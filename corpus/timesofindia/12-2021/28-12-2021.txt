---||Lucknow||UP: Allahabad HC acquits man awarded death penalty for rape, murder of minor||PRAYARAJ: The Allahabad high court has acquitted a man who was awarded death penalty in the rape and murder of a minor, saying that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. While rejecting the reference for affirmation of death sentence and allowing the appeal of Nazil against the order of his conviction and sentence, a division bench comprising Justice Manoj Misra and Justice Sameer Jain set aside the judgment and order of the trial court. Besides, the high court acquitted the appellant Nazil of all the charges for which he was tried and convicted. The high court directed to release the appellant from jail forthwith unless wanted in any other case. Delivering this judgment dated December 12, the court observed, “In the present case, we find that the prosecution evidence has failed to prove the incriminating circumstances of the deceased being last seen alive with the appellant and the recovery beyond the pale of doubt, and there is no medical / forensic evidence to demonstrate that there was presence of semen or blood stain of the appellant on the clothes of the deceased or on her body.” The court held that all orifices and organs of the body of the victim were missing and there was nothing to incriminate the accused for rape except the confessional statement made by him before police which is not admissible. Unfortunately, the trial court failed to test the reliability and credibility of the prosecution evidence and has accepted the prosecution evidence as gospel truth, which is not the requirement of law, the court added. The court was hearing an appeal filed by Nazil, convicted by a trial court on December 13, 2019, and awarded capital punishment for allegedly raping a minor and murdering her. He was convicted by the court of the additional sessions judge, fast track court (crime against women)/ special judge, POCSO Act, Rampur for offences punishable under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 376AB (punishment for rape of woman under 12 years of age) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 of the POCSO Act. As per prosecution’s case, the deceased, aged six years at the time, had gone out to fetch curd on May 7, 2019, but did not return and despite a hectic search, could not be found. More than a month later, her partially-decomposed body was found from a semi-built house on June 22, 2019. The appellant was later arrested for the crime after an encounter. The counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial court had not tested the prosecution evidence and without putting the same to scrutiny, accepted the prosecution evidence as the gospel truth. According to him, such a decision is no decision in the eyes of the law, and evidence of the deceased being last seen alive with the appellant is unacceptable and completely unreliable.

---||India||MHA blocks foreign funds to Missionaries of Charity||NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: The Union home ministry has blocked foreign funding of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity, but denied freezing any of its bank accounts. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and several Kolkata-based minority and inter-faith groups called the move “an attack on India’s poorest of poor” and said they were appalled by “the timing (on Christmas) and lack of empathy”. The ministry on Monday said it had refused the organisation’s application for renewal of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act registration on Saturday. The Centre said it didn’t approve Missionaries of Charity’s (MoC) Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) renewal application “for not meeting eligibility conditions” and over certain “adverse inputs” received when it was considering the application. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee was one of the first to protest after the news reached Kolkata. “Shocked to hear that on Christmas, Union ministry FROZE ALL BANK ACCOUNTS of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity in India! Their 22,000 patients & employees have been left without food & medicines. While the law is paramount, humanitarian efforts must not be compromised,” she tweeted. Shocked to hear that on Christmas, Union Ministry FROZE ALL BANK ACCOUNTS of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charit… https://t.co/VJAY1eYVIP— Mamata Banerjee (@MamataOfficial) 1640597529000Missionaries of Charity superior-general Sister M Prema issued a statement on Monday evening confirming that its FCRA renewal application had been refused. But there “is no freeze order by the ministry on any of our bank accounts”, she clarified. “We have asked our centres not to operate any of the foreign contribution accounts till the matter is resolved as a measure to ensure there is no lapse,” she said. The MHA said MoC had itself asked the State Bank of India to freeze its bank accounts after the ministry rejected its application for renewal of registration under FCRA. “While considering the MoC’s renewal application, some adverse inputs were noticed. In consideration of these inputs on record, the renewal application of MoC was not approved. The FCRA registration of MoC was valid up to December 31, 2021. MHA didn’t freeze any accounts of MoC. State Bank of India has informed that MoC itself sent a request to SBI to freeze its accounts,” the ministry said on Monday. Elaborating on “adverse inputs”, a source told TOI that they essentially relate to “audit irregularities”. This means that the financial dealings or accounts of the NGO associated with the late Mother Teresa, a Nobel laureate, were not found as per the requirements under FCRA by the ministry. “The renewal application under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act for the renewal of FCRA registration of Missionaries of Charity (MoC) was refused on December 25, 2021 for not meeting the eligibility conditions under FCRA 2010 and Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules (FCRR) 2011. No request/revision application has been received from Missionaries of Charity (MoC) for review of this refusal of renewal,” said the MHA. In the absence of renewal of its FCRA licence, Missionaries of Charity will not be able to receive any foreign funding. However, its domestic funding will not be impacted. The foreign receipts of Missionaries of Charity totalled around Rs 75 crore in 2020-21, Rs 104 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 68 crore in 2018-19. The protests started immediately after the news reached Kolkata. The Catholic Association of Bengal’s response came immediately after Banerjee’s reaction. “Today, more than ever before, the poorest are the ones struggling to come to terms with the unprecedented situation the pandemic has brought upon them. Mother Teresa did all she could for the poorest of the poor. Today a lifeline for those in need has been snapped as funds for all this work for the marginalised comes from generous individuals across the world. We see this curtailment of the FCRA funds as a harsh blow to their efforts to reach out to the poorest, the orphans, the handicapped, the leapers, the addicted, the aged and the uncared for, the sick, the abandoned and the dying,” CAB president Angelina Jasnani said, adding that the home ministry needed to find a way to ensure that the poor did not suffer and all required norms of the FCRA were met at the same time. Missionaries of Charity spokesperson Sunita Kumar, who was associated with Mother Teresa for decades, reacted in disbelief. “This is very distressing. I cannot believe this to be true. Look at the work they have done in India and all over the world, caring for those who do not have anyone. The nuns lead a spartan life. Their quarters are bare. Mother herself lived all her life without even a fan though her room in Mother House was just above the kitchen and would be stifling in summer,” she recounted. Times ViewThe law must take its course. Nonetheless, it is important to recognise that thousands of needy and deprived are dependent on this organisation for food, medicine and survival. We hope that they will not be left in the lurch.United Interfaith Foundation (India) general secretary Satnam Singh Ahluwalia called the move “an attack on humanity to stop social outreach by the Missionaries of Charity sisters and brothers”. “We condemn the government action and are appalled by the timing and lack of empathy to consider the humanitarian disaster this decision will cause,” he added. TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien called the Centre’s “clarification” (that no bank account had been frozen) an example of “MHA... SPINDOCTORING & COVER-UP”. “India has an opposition that will fight the good fight. And I have a leader who will always stand up for the oppressed, Mamata Banerjee,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mha-blocks-foreign-funds-to-missionaries-of-charity/articleshow/88531107.cms||Bharti Jain

---||World||Fauci: US should consider vaccine mandate for domestic air travel||WASHINGTON: Dr Anthony Fauci, the top United States infectious disease expert, said Monday the US should consider a vaccination mandate for domestic air travel, signalling a potential embrace of an idea the Biden administration has previously eschewed, as Covid-19 cases spike.  Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief science adviser on the pandemic response, said such a mandate might drive up the nation's lagging vaccination rate as well as confer stronger protection on flights, for which federal regulations require all those aged 2 and older to wear a mask.  "When you make vaccination a requirement, that's another incentive to get more people vaccinated," Fauci told MSNBC. "If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that's something that seriously should be considered."  The Biden administration has thus far balked at imposing a vaccination requirement for domestic air travel. Two officials said Biden's science advisers have yet to make a formal recommendation for such a requirement to the president.  The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said a vaccine mandate on planes could trigger a host of logistical and legal concerns.  The US currently mandates that most foreign nationals traveling to the country be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, though citizens and permanent residents only need to show proof of a negative test taken within a day of boarding.  Federal rules don't require people travelling by air within the US to show a negative test. Hawaii requires travellers to test or show proof of vaccination to avoid a mandatory quarantine.  Earlier this year, the White House explored a domestic vaccination requirement for flights, or one requiring either vaccination or proof of negative test. But officials have not been eager to mandate vaccination for domestic air travel because they expected it to face immediate legal challenges, mitigating its potential effectiveness as a tool to drive up vaccinations.  Pressed last week on why Biden had not mandated vaccinations for domestic air travel, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that "we know that masking can be, is, very effective on airplanes."  "We also know that putting in place that additional restriction might delay flights, might have additional implications," she added. "We would do it, though, if the health impact was overwhelming. So we rely always on the advice of our health and medical experts. That isn't a step at this point that they had determined we need to take."  Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show more than 241 million Americans, about 77% of the eligible population aged 5 and over, have received at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine. Officials believe, though, that there is some over-count in the figures due to record-keeping errors in the administration of booster shots.  Since the summer, the Biden administration has embraced various vaccination requirements as a way to get unvaccinated Americans to roll up their sleeves. It has instituted requirements that federal workers, federal contractors, and those who work in health care get their shots, and that employers with 100 or more employees institute vaccination-or-testing requirements for their workers.  Those vaccination requirements have been mired in legal wrangling, with the Supreme Court set to hear arguments Jan. 7 in cases seeking to overturn them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/fauci-us-should-consider-vaccine-mandate-for-domestic-air-travel/articleshow/88531859.cms||---

Among healthcare and frontline workers and those aged 60 and above with comorbidities, prioritisation and sequencing would be based on completion of nine months or 39 weeks from the date of the second dose as of January 10, the government said in its guidelines issued on Monday. To register on the CoWin site, children can use their school IDs, National Health Authority chief executive RS Sharma said. They can register themselves online through an existing account or create a new one. The 60-andabove recipients will have to mention their comorbidity on the portal while registering and need to produce a certificate from a registered doctor at the vaccination site. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has called for a review meeting with states and Union territories to discuss smooth implementation of the guidelines and review the evolving Omicron situation across states. “All those aged 15 or more will be able to register on CoWin. In other words, all those whose birth year is 2007 or before, shall be eligible. Beneficiaries can self-register, online through an existing account on CoWIN or by creating a new account through a unique mobile number, this facility is available for all eligible citizens presently,” the guidelines said. Healthcare and frontline workers and citizens aged 60-and-above with comorbidities will be able to access vaccination for the precaution dose through their existing CoWin account. The CoWin system will send an SMS to eligible persons for availing the precaution dose when it becomes due, the guidelines said. Details of administration of the precaution dose will also reflect in vaccination certificates. Nearly three crore healthcare and frontline workers are expected to be eligible in January to get the booster dose of the Covid vaccine, which will be administered with a gap of nine months after the second dose. Besides, 6-7 crore children in the 15-18 age bracket will be eligible to receive Covaxin. The health ministry said the precaution dose or third dose of Covid vaccines is being provided to health and frontline workers as a “matter of abundant precaution”. While an estimated three crore people above 60 years of age are expected to have comorbidities, very few may actually be eligible for receiving the third dose in January, given the nine-month gap required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-vaccination-children-between-15-18-years-can-register-on-cowin-from-jan-1-on-site-from-jan-3/articleshow/88531760.cms||---
---||India||Election Commission unlikely to put off polls; govt says step up tests, jabs||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission, which was informed by the Union health secretary on Monday that the five poll-bound states do not have many Omicron cases, may not consider rescheduling of elections. After being briefed in detail on the extent of Omicron cases as well as status of vaccination in poll-bound UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur, the commission has suggested that the health ministry ensure 100% or highest possible coverage of first dose of Covid vaccination in UP, Punjab and Manipur and also focus on promptly administering the 2nd dose to those already eligible. It asked the health secretary to come back in a week’s time with a fresh report on the updated status of vaccination. Based on that report as well as inputs to be collected by EC during its three-day UP visit starting Tuesday, the poll panel will take a call on fine-tuning its guidelines for Covid-safe polling and campaigning in the five states, said a source. The Centre has meanwhile asked the five poll-bound states to exponentially increase testing and ensure strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour, apart form ramping up vaccination coverage. The commission on Monday also met representatives of ITBP and Sashastra Seema Bal, which guard the International border in Uttarakhand and UP, and asked them to step up surveillance in the run-up to polls and monitor movements across the border to rule out any attempts by external forces to vitiate the upcoming polls. A discussion with BSF, which is deployed along Indo-Pakistan border in Punjab, will also be held later regarding securing the border during polls. EC also held a discussion with DG, Narcotics Control Bureau, as many political parties in Punjab and Goa had aired concerns about drugs being used for voter inducement. The panel has asked NCB to monitor the movement of narcotics in the run-up to polls and step up seizures, particularly in Punjab and Goa. As per information shared with EC by the health secretary, there is 100% coverage of first dose of Covid vaccine in Uttarakhand and Goa, though it’s around 85% in UP, 78-79-% in Punjab and around 70% in Manipur. EC has requested that the coverage be taken to 100% or as high as possible in the remaining three states. On the second dose too, coverage in Uttarakhand and Goa is almost 80% and 93% respectively, even as UP, Punjab and Manipur are much behind. EC has told the health secretary to ensure that all those who have completed three months after their first dose, are identified and administered the second dose without delay. As for threat of Omicron variant, the health secretary informed EC that the cases were very limited in the five poll-bound states. Also, Omicron, through highly transmittable, did not have very serious or long-term health effects and many people infected with it were recovering well, he apprised the poll panel. This, said a source, means that the variant is not yet a concern serious enough to review plans to hold the polls as per schedule, though a senior functionary added that it’s Covid norms for upcoming polls will factor in all concerns and shall be subject to revision as the situation progresses. It be recalled that an Allahabad High Court judge had, in a bail order, requested EC and PMO to postpone polls in UP in view of the Omicron threat. EC will be visiting UP from Tuesday for three days to make its assessment of poll preparedness in the state, during which it will also review the threat of Omicron in consultation with the state administration. It will be meeting district magistrates and SSPs, political party representatives, chief electoral officer to discuss all aspects of poll preparedness. EC will hold a final, detailed discussion with the UP chief secretary and DGP, before heading back to New Delhi. The Commission is likely to announce polls in the five states anytime after January 5, by when the updated rolls with respect to January 1, 2022 as the reference date are expected to be published.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-unlikely-to-put-off-polls-govt-says-step-up-tests-jabs/articleshow/88532274.cms||Bharti Jain

The largest among the projects is the Rs 7,000-crore Renuak dam project, which will also incorporate a storage-based 40 megawatt (MW) hydel unit, on Giri river — one of Yamuna’s tributaries — in Sirmour district. The project failed to take off for nearly 30 years after it was conceptualised due to differences over sharing of water and costs among Himachal, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Delhi. Once completed, the project will boost Delhi’s annual water supply by 500 million cubic metres. As per an agreement signed in January 2019, the Delhi government has agreed to bear 90% cost of the power component of the project and balance 10% is to be borne by Himachal. The project has been given the status of a national project, which envisages the Centre will bear the 90% cost of the dam (water) component, while the balance is to be shared by all basin states in the ratio of allocation of water as per MoU of 1994. The next big project to be launched was the Rs 1,800-crore Luhri Stage-I on Satluj river with a generating capacity of 210 MW estimated to pump out 758 million units of electricity per year. The project will help stabilise the northern grid and also add to Delhi’s supply. The PM also dedicated to the nation the Rs 2,080-crore Sawra-Kuddu hydel project with a 111 MW capacity, which is estimated to produce 380 million units of electricity per year and help the state earn annual revenue of Rs 120 crore. Another project to be launched was the Dhaulasidh project, the first hydel project in Hamirpur district. The 66 MW project will be built at a cost of over Rs 680 crore and lead to generation of over 300 million units of electricity per year. These projects are part of the Centre’s plan to develop 26,000 MW of hydropower projects by 2030 with an aim of taking the tally of green power’s share in the overall supply to 50% by then. More than 9,000 MW of large hydropower projects are under construction at present. As of March last year, India's installed utility-scale hydroelectric capacity was 46,000 MW, or 12.3% of the country’s total utility power generation capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-launches-hydel-projects-worth-rs-11000-crore-in-hp/articleshow/88532117.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Much of Bahia, home to about 15 million people, has suffered from intermittent flooding for weeks, after a long drought gave way to record rains. Flooding in some areas intensified late on Christmas Eve and early on Christmas Day after a pair of dams gave way, sending residents scrambling for higher ground.  Rescue workers patrolled in small dinghies around the city of Itabuna, in southern Bahia, plucking residents from their homes, including some who escaped through second-floor windows.  Bahia governor Rui Costa said on Twitter that 72 municipalities were in a state of emergency.  "Unfortunately, we're living through the worst disaster that has ever occurred in the history of Bahia," he wrote. Manfredo Santana, a lieutenant-colonel in Bahia's firefighting corps, told Reuters that emergency workers had rescued 200 people in just three nearby towns. The heavy currents of the swollen Cachoeira river complicated rescue efforts.  "It's difficult to manoeuvre even with jet skis," he said. "Rescue teams had to retreat in certain moments."  Bahia's civil defence agency said on Monday afternoon that 20 people had died in 11 separate municipalities.  Newspaper O Globo, citing a state firefighting official, said that authorities are monitoring an additional 10 dams for any signs they may collapse.  The scrutiny of public infrastructure and urban planning comes just a couple years after the collapse of a mining dam in neighbouring Minas Gerais state killed some 270 people.  In televised remarks, Costa, the Bahia governor, attributed the chaotic scenes in part to "errors that have been committed over the course of years."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/death-toll-from-brazil-flooding-rises-to-20-in-bahias-worst-disaster-ever/articleshow/88532326.cms||---
---||World||Snow blasts California and freezes Pacific Northwest||SAN FRANCISCO: Blowing snow in mountains of northern California and Nevada closed key highways, while an arctic blast brought frigid temperatures to the Pacific Northwest and unusually warm weather settled over parts of Texas and the Southeast.  At Donner Pass in the Sierra, officials with the University of California, Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Laboratory on Monday said recent snowfall has smashed the snowiest December record of 179 inches (4.6 m), set in 1970. The record is now 193.7 inches (4.9 m) as more snow is expected.  The Northstar California Resort in Truckee closed its mountain operations on Monday amid blizzard conditions. The ski resort has received more than 6 feet (1.8 m) of snow over the last 48 hours, according to the resort's Facebook post.  Search and rescue crews are looking for a missing skier who was last seen Saturday morning on a lift at the ski resort, KCRA reported.  The snowpack in the Sierra was at dangerously low levels after recent weeks of dry weather but the state Department of Water Resources reported on Monday that the snowpack was between 145% and 161% of normal across the range with more snow expected.  In the Pacific Northwest, emergency warming shelters were opened throughout western Washington and Oregon as temperatures plunged into the teens and forecasters said an arctic blast would last for several days. Sunday's snow showers blew into the Pacific Northwest from the Gulf of Alaska, dumping up to 6 inches (15 cm) across the Seattle area.  More than a foot (0.3 m) was reported near Port Angeles across the Puget Sound on the Olympic Peninsula. Portland, Oregon, also received snowfall. Frigid temperatures in the region could tie or break records in the coming days.  The National Weather Service said Seattle's low Sunday was 20 degrees F (-6.7 C), breaking a mark set in 1948. Bellingham was 9 degrees F (-12. 8C), three degrees colder than the previous record set in 1971.  State officials in Oregon have declared an emergency. In Multnomah County - home to Portland - six severe weather shelters are open with plans to open additional sites, including at the Oregon Convention Center. Seattle city leaders also opened at least six severe weather shelters starting Saturday through at least Wednesday.  In Nevada, freezing air and blinding snow blasted across the northern part of the state on Monday, affecting travel and business, closing Sierra Nevada highway passes, delaying airport flights and shutting state offices.  Interstate 80 remained closed due to poor visibility and heavy snow from the Nevada state line to Placer County, California. An avalanche blocked a state route that connects Tahoe City to some ski resorts in Olympic Valley and authorities urged motorists to avoid non-essential travel.  Several flights were cancelled or delayed at Reno-Tahoe International Airport and at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, where skies were clear but nearby mountains were capped by snow.  Nevada governor Steve Sisolak ordered non-essential state workers other than public safety and corrections personnel to remain home due to the storm.  Weather and travel advisories stretched to Northeast Nevada and Elko due to the possibility of blowing and drifting snow.  The storms that have been pummeling California and Nevada in recent days also brought rain and snow to Arizona. A record inch of rain in one day was reported at the airport in Phoenix Friday when 11 inches (28 centimeters) of snow fell at the Arizona Snowbowl ski resort just outside Flagstaff. Another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of snow were recorded in the 24 hours ending Monday morning.  More storms are expected to hit the desert state starting Monday afternoon and continuing throughout the week.  Temperatures were unseasonably warm in parts of the Southern Plains, including in Arkansas, where several cities broke records on Christmas Day for daily high temperatures.  But forecasters warned that severe storms were possible midweek when a storm system moves through the Deep South, with Alabama and Mississippi at greatest risk for bad weather, according to the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.  Heavy snow will start winding down by Monday evening in California's Sierra Nevada and the area is expected to get a break from the cold snap by Thursday, said Emily Heller, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.  Temperatures in western Washington and Oregon aren't forecast to rise above freezing until at least Thursday, and possibly not until the weekend, forecasters said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/snow-blasts-california-and-freezes-pacific-northwest/articleshow/88532411.cms||---

In Goa, an eight-year-old boy who arrived in the coastal state along with his father from the UK about 11 days ago was found to be infected with Omicron. In Manipur, a 48-year-old man who returned to Imphal West district from Tanzania recently tested positive for the virus. Delhi recorded 63 fresh cases, the highest to be recorded in a day by any state in the country so far, taking its total tally to 142, second only to Maharashtra which has 167 cases, including 26 detected on Monday. Delhi and Maharashtra alone account for 46% of the total 671 infections. Gujarat is the third worst-affected state with 73 cases followed by Kerala, which has 57 cases. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Delhi’s LNJP hospital, which is the capital’s largest facility for treatment for Covid-19 patients, said that 85-90% of the patients are asymptomatic while others have very mild symptoms. In Maharashtra, 11 of the 26 fresh cases are from Mumbai. Other states which confirmed new Omicron cases on Monday were Gujarat (24 infections), Telangana (12), Uttarakhand (3), Rajasthan (3) and Haryana (2).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-at-135-biggest-one-day-rise-in-omicron-cases/articleshow/88532419.cms||---

In a letter sent to the chief secretaries of all states and administrators of Union territories, home secretary Ajay Bhalla said that while the country has witnessed overall decline in active cases, Omicron variant is reported to be at least 3 times more transmissible than the Delta variant and is posing a new challenge for the fight against Covid. Emphasising that the growth trajectory of cases has been very steep in the countries with Omicron-driven surge, the home secretary drew the attention of states and UT administrations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s directions after a review of status of Covid on December 23, asking people to be ‘satark’ and ‘savdhaan’ (alert and cautious). “As per his directions, it is important to maintain a high level of vigil and alertness at all levels. State governments should ensure that the health systems in the states are strengthened to meet any challenge posed by the new variant. Further, the state governments/UT administrations should ensure that oxygen supply equipment are installed and are fully functional and the buffer stock of essential drugs should also be maintained,” stated Bhalla. Recalling the normative framework put out by the ministry of health and family welfare on December 21, the home ministry on Monday issued an order under Disaster Management Act directing states and UTs to consider implementing the framework until January 31, 2022. The home secretary’s letter to states and UTs also asked them to take prompt and appropriate containment measures as per MoHFW’s normative framework, based on their respective assessment of the situation. He further said the state and UT governments may consider imposing need based, local curbs/restrictions, to control the crowd during the festive season. The MHA order extending Covid containment measures until Jan 31, 2022, asks the states/UTs to ensure that National Guidelines on Covid-19 Management — which ban spitting in public, shops to ensure social distancing among customers and work-from-home to be followed as far as possible along with staggered hours at workplaces — are strictly followed. It further says the district magistrates shall be responsible for enforcing the Covid containment measures and may impose curbs under Section 144 of CrPC as far as possible. Prompt action under DM Act and IPC was also called for, to deal with violations of Covid norms. Meanwhile, the home secretary, in his communication to the states, noted that with with distinct presence of the Delta variant and detection of 578 Omicron cases across 19 states thus far, there was need for greater foresight, data analysis, dynamic decision making, and strict and prompt containment actions at the local and district levels. Stressing the need for adherence to the five-fold strategy, i.e., test-track-treat-vaccination and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour to avoid a possible Covid surge, he asked the states and UTs to strictly enforce wearing of face masks and social distancing in public areas. Bhalla also sought proactive and regular media briefings by the states and UTs to discourage any misinformation in respect of Omicron variant. Omicron cases have already been reported in 116 countries. Further, surge in cases is also being reported across various countries, especially in the USA, the UK, Europe (France, Italy, Spain), Russia, South Africa, Vietnam, Australia, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/consider-curbs-on-festive-crowds-mha-amid-covid-surge/articleshow/88532484.cms||Bharti Jain

Judge Bruce Jones scheduled a hearing for January 13 to reconsider Rogel Aguilera-Mederos' sentence following widespread outrage over the severity of his punishment and an unusual request by prosecutors to revisit the matter.  During a virtual hearing to discuss the request, one of Aguilera-Mederos' lawyers, James Colgan, said the defence needed some time to do research to see if there were any similar cases that could help guide its approach.  Jones said he wanted to learn more about whether the law that allowed him to reconsider the sentence gave him discretion to set whatever sentence he wanted.  He said victims would be able to speak at the in-person hearing about whether Aguilera-Mederos should be resentenced. But he noted he did not want them to go through that stress unless they wished to.  "I am a captive audience if they want to speak to me," he said.  Around 5 million people have signed an online petition seeking clemency for Aguilera-Mederos. In addition to the prosecution's request to lower the sentence, Aguilera-Mederos has requested clemency from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis.  Last week, District Attorney Alexis King said in a statement she would seek a term of 20 to 30 years in the 2019 wreck on Interstate 70 west of Denver. She said that sentencing range reflects an "appropriate outcome" for Aguilera-Mederos' conduct, noting that the crash was not an accident.  After Monday's hearing, King said her office made the reconsideration request to give the court the ability to impose a sentence not bound by the state's mandatory sentencing laws. She said the judge, knowing the case well, was in the best position to decide a new sentence and urged people to be patient as the court process plays out.  Jones imposed the 110-year sentence against Aguilera-Mederos on December 13 after finding it was the mandatory minimum term set forth under state law.  "I will state that if I had the discretion, it would not be my sentence," the judge said during the hearing. Leonard Martinez, another lawyer for Aguilera-Mederos, has said the district attorney's new requested sentencing range is not consistent with similar cases in Colorado and the United States.  Colorado law allows for sentences for crimes deemed violent to be modified in cases with "unusual and extenuating circumstances," but those sentences cannot take effect until 119 days after a person enters prison. King and defense lawyers believe Jones can impose a new, reduced sentence before that and have it take effect later.  Aguilera-Mederos testified that he was hauling lumber when the brakes on his semitrailer failed as he was descending a steep grade of Interstate 70 in the Rocky Mountain foothills on April 25, 2019. His truck plowed into vehicles that had slowed because of another wreck, setting off a chain-reaction wreck and a fireball that consumed vehicles and melted parts of the highway.  He wept as he apologised to the victims' families at his December 13 sentencing.  "When I look at my charges, we are talking about a murderer, which is not me," he said. "I have never thought about hurting anybody in my entire life."  Prosecutors argued he should have used a runaway ramp designed for such situations. Aguilera-Mederos, for his part, said he was struggling to avoid traffic and trying to shift to slow down.  The crash killed 24-year-old Miguel Angel Lamas Arellano, 67-year-old William Bailey, 61-year-old Doyle Harrison and 69-year-old Stanley Politano. Relatives of victims supported at least some prison time at his sentencing hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judge-sets-hearing-to-reconsider-truckers-110-year-sentence/articleshow/88532510.cms||---

Relaxation during curfew will be given only to those with valid reasons, Pant said. Roads like MG Road, a hub for revellers, will be cordoned off on New Year’s Eve. “Those having valid reasons and falling under guidelines issued by the government will be given relaxation from curfew. Night patrol by cops will be intensified. Passengers heading to the airport, railway stations or bus terminals must display their tickets. Similarly, those having medical emergencies should have the related documents. People working night shifts must have valid work ID cards,” Pant said. Asked about New Year celebrations in public places, he said ‘nakabandi’ will be imposed on streets and roads known to be frequented by revellers. “Be it MG Road, Indiranagar 100 Ft Road or Koramangala, gathering of people is strictly prohibited. We will cordon off these areas and install CCTV cameras. Those violating curfew will be booked under the National Disaster Management Act and IPC,” he said. “No passes are being issued. Your reason to come out must be valid.” Impact on Metro In the wake of night curfew in the city from 10pm on Tuesday, Metro train frequency will be reduced after that time of day. However, service operational timings (5am to 11pm) remain the same. Health is our priority: CM“While we understand the concerns of businesses and industry over night curfew, our priority is health. We also want them to run and earn more revenue for the state, but the health of every citizen is more important under the present circumstances,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said while referring to the opposition to night curfew. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mg-road-to-be-cordoned-off-on-ny-eve/articleshow/88532689.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Google moves court seeking more time to respond to CCI||BENGALURU: Google has filed a writ petition in the Karnataka High Court seeking more time to respond to CCI’s queries related to a probe regarding Play Store and Google Pay billing rules. The CCI had launched a probe into mandatory use of Google Play Store’s payment system for in-app purchases. When TOI contacted Google on the matter, its spokesperson acknowledged the filing and said, “We respect the CCI’s investigative process and will continue to engage cooperatively and constructively in the interest of a fair investigation.” Sources told TOI that Google has sought the appointment of a judicial member on the panel probing the matter. Recently, Google deferred the deadline for developers in India to integrate with Google Play’s billing system. It will now become effective October next year, not April. The company said it is doing this to provide developers in India the required product support for recurring payments through convenient user payment systems, including UPI and wallets, and also provide them more time in light of the changes to India’s recurring digital payments guidelines. The new rule requires developers who distribute their app through the Google Play Store to ensure that in-app purchases are done through Google’s billing system. Google had initially set a commission of 30% on these payments, but, following pressure, this was reduced to 15%. Last year, a case had been filed with the CCI alleging that “Google, through its control over the Play Store and Android OS, is favouring Google Pay over other competing apps, to the disadvantage of both, i.e., apps facilitating payment through UPI, as well as users.” The complaint also alleged that Google skews the search results on the Play Store in favour of Google Pay. The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF), a grouping of entrepreneurs and startups, filed a plea for interim relief in the CCI in October. It has called the latest development and action by Google as another delaying tactic. “The only commitments that have been consistent on the part of Google throughout this entire antitrust process have been their commitment to a) delay the process in every way possible and b) protect their super-profits from the app economy abusing its dominance,” Sijo Kuruvilla George, executive director of ADIF, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/google-moves-court-seeking-more-time-to-respond-to-cci/articleshow/88532693.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

The accused are Sheik Iliyas alias Illu, 34, and Erakala Kavadi Nagendra alias Naga, 35, both residents of Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. Iliyas was wanted by police since 2008 and Nagendra since 2007 for house burglaries. Facing at least a dozen cases each in Andhra Pradesh and other parts of Karnataka, both were arrested by Andhra police as well as cops from Madhugiri in Tumakuru district and Gauribidanur in Chikkaballapur district. However, this is the first time they landed in the custody of Bengaluru police.Six cases solvedWith their arrest, at least six cases of house burglaries reported earlier this year in different parts of the city have been solved, CCB police said. “Preliminary investigation revealed the accused burgled houses in Hennur, JP Nagar, Hebbal, DJ Halli, KR Puram, and Adugodi,” an investigating officer said.Another officer said the two were into gambling as well. “Travelling in trains and buses, the duo would stay in hotels and roam around in residential areas. They would target houses where the front yard was littered or heaps of newspapers were dumped before the main door, indicating the inmates were not around. To double-check, they’d pelt stones at the house to see if anyone came out,” he said. The duo would then break into the house at night and decamp with booty. They concentrated on gold and silver ornaments, which they would later dispose of in Andhra Pradesh, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-interstate-burglars-land-in-police-net/articleshow/88532694.cms||---

Considered the future of the automobile industry, almost all states are now looking for ways to attract investment in the sector. But having had a poor track record with at least two major EV automobile companies — one Indian and the other international — Karnataka is struggling to revive its investor-friendly image. Industry department sources said the government has been making amends by way of reformulating and redrawing laws which will help industries come to Karnataka. Minister Murugesh Nirani admitted some land laws and taxation policies require an overhaul. “Our land policies and taxation structure for industries have been a serious lacunae. We’re now trying to overhaul the structure, bring in amendments and inculcate a fresh approach,” he said. The changes included scrapping the 99-year lease for sale in two years of being given land and allowing a free hand in purchase of land directly from farmers for industrial purposes with amendments to Karnataka Land Reforms Act. Under the tax structure, the government is exploring possibilities of delinking commercial and industrial taxes by further reducing them. “Wherever we had lagged behind other states, we’ve been taking remedial actions and bringing in amendments,” said Nirani. According to officials, four EV companies are in talks with the industry department, but none has committed to investing yet. “We are in advanced stage of talks with one firm which is likely to invest Rs 700 crore to manufacture commercial vehicles,” said an industry department official, adding there is a possibility that the company will have two units. Nirani told TOI 3-4 companies are in talks with the government and two of them are closer to having a tie-up. The government is looking to set up an EV hub in four revenue divisions — one each in Dharwad, Kalaburagi, Mysuru, and Tumakuru districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/states-ev-hub-dream-yet-to-become-reality/articleshow/88532697.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

What was once popular among engineering colleges and tier-1 cities has now percolated to all institutions, irrespective of stream or place. According to Teamlease Edtech, a platform that provides learning solutions like soft skills and leadership training to higher educational institutions, 500 to 700 colleges (both tech and non-tech) have started this trend in the past few months. In the next 12-18 months, a minimum of 5,000 colleges are expected to start the initiative. Through this initiative, colleges are giving training for hard technical and domain skills as well as soft skills. While engineering colleges have preferred training their students on industry-relevant coding projects in the past, non-engineering colleges are focusing on soft skills and certain domain skills. “Colleges are investing an average of Rs 4,000-20,000 per student. The cost is being absorbed by colleges predominantly. Currently, in each college, 250-500 students are enrolled for these training sessions and the average tenure of the training is between two weeks and three months,” said Neeti Sharma, president and co-founder, Teamlease Edtech. “While there have always been discussions on unemployability of students, never have they felt its impact as much as now. Moreover, NEP has given the push and has mandated the inclusion of skills in core curriculum,” she added. “We have seen students in our college, who are mainly from rural areas, being equally good at academics as their peers in urban areas. However, when it comes to industry exposure and placements, our students lose out to their peers in cities like Bengaluru. We do not want that to happen. We wish to train them during their college days so they can be on a par in soft skills and other domain expertise with their counterparts from cities,” said Venkatesh Babu, principal, BGS Institute of Management Studies, Chikkaballapur. Several edu-tech companies are offering skill courses to students who join their programmes. “The courses offered in colleges are not enough for preparing students for any kind of employment. They do not help them as they provide a very academic approach. Unless there is a blend of hard and soft skills, students will find it difficult to get a job and retain it. It is better that colleges get an external agency to provide these skills until they understand how to offer them within the set syllabus,” said Rumi Sikdar of Ants Consulting and Services, which is into skill development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-nep-colleges-looking-to-invest-in-skill-training-courses-for-students/articleshow/88532699.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP unlikely to meet night shelter deadline||BENGALURU: In July, the Karnataka high court gave BBMP an ultimatum to set up 84 night shelters in six months for the city’s homeless. However, the civic body established only 14 shelters so far. Activists and officials from the National Urban Livelihood Mission say that of these 14, 10 are operational. As northerly winds bring down temperatures in Karnataka, the homeless in the city are once again left with nothing but hollow promises from BBMP and state government agencies. Hundreds of them look for sleeping spots — under flyovers, on closed drains, outside shops, etc. “We have approvals for 46 shelters and 14 are operational. Last week, we completed a few more shelters and some repair work is pending on a few others,” said KA Dayanand, special commissioner, BBMP. Data he shared with TOI shows the civic body recently made three more shelters operational, while three others are ready. He added the remaining approved shelters will start functioning after BBMP signs MoUs with NGOs selected to run them and other pending works are complete. Stating that the civic body targets to have 46 shelters up and running in the next 10 days or so, Dayanand said approvals for 38 more shelters (so the city gets 84 as mandated by the HC) are still unsettled. “We will complete them by March 2022,” Dayanand said, admitting that they will miss the HC deadline. The high court, while hearing a PIL on July 22 this year, had underlined that almost 11 years after the Supreme Court directed state governments to build shelters in the ratio of one for one lakh population, Karnataka had only 46 functional shelters out of the required 166 statewide. Activists working with the homeless said repeated representations and meetings with government authorities have yielded no results. They also claimed that the state of affairs at the functional shelters is baffling. “BBMP has given old dilapidated buildings for this purpose. The existing shelters need a lot of refurbishments,” said a social activist, who didn’t wish to be named. The campaigners of night shelters and their inmates say many homeless people are from other states and are migrant labourers. They allege government agencies are against migration and lacked the will to execute a decade-old order because of their intolerance towards interstate migration. “Indians can move within their own country, but officials tell us there are thousands of people coming to Karnataka daily and they cannot keep accommodating them. But can the government prevent people from moving?” an activist asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-unlikely-to-meet-night-shelter-deadline/articleshow/88532700.cms||Sanika Athavale

The state which reported the first Omicron case in the country, added the latest figure (seven new patients) on Saturday alone. Early on Monday, the Union health ministry said: “India reported 6,531 new cases in the last 24 hours, with the daily positivity rate of 0.87%, which is less than 2% seen for the last 84 days. Weekly positivity rate (0.63%) is less than 1% for the last 43 days.” In the same report, the ministry said that India had 578 Omicron cases spread across 19 states as of 7am on Monday, and 151 among these have already recovered. However, state-wise data puts Karnataka’s total Omicron cases at 31, while it should be 38. One state health official said: “Sometimes, there’s a delay in updating. But we have 38 cases in Karnataka.” The data shows just eight of the 19 states with Omicron — Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — account for 538 or 93% of all cases of the new variant. Delhi, with 142 cases leads the table, followed by Maharashtra (141) and Kerala (57). No other state has more than 50 cases. In terms of discharges, Maharashtra has the most at 42, followed by Rajasthan (30), Delhi (23) and Karnataka (15).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/15-omicron-patients-in-karnataka-discharged/articleshow/88532702.cms||---

But this wasn’t his original plan. Jayesh was hoping to start a Master of International Tourism Management from a leading university in New Zealand from February 2022. But thin prospects of the country reopening its borders pushed him to go for the alternative option. In fact, education experts have been advocating what they call the ‘backup path’, considering the uncertainty around international travels and surge in Omicron cases in several countries. “I was hoping New Zealand would open its borders at least by mid-2022. But it looks unlikely now. I did not want to waste another year, so decided to enrol for this programme, which will add to my CV,” the Banaswadi resident said, adding he will wait until February 2023 to start his studies in NZ. Jayesh’s concerns are echoed by several other students and parents in the city, who say the uncertainty around Omicron reminds them of March 2020, when the first wave of Covid-19 hit the country. Madhumathi D, a retired school teacher, said her son had initially planned to fly to Australia to start his PG course in June 2020. With Australia’s borders shut, he enrolled for a six-month certificate course and joined an NGO. “Though Australia has reopened its borders, he plans to stick to his job until he gets his visa. The Omicron surge may push countries to shut borders anytime,” she feared. However, educationists and counsellors say a complete shutting down of borders may not happen again. But if it does, the last two years have prepared them. A counsellor with a foreign education consultancy said that she encourages students to update their skills. “In the last two years, I have seen the disappointment and eagerness among students up close, so I try my best to save their time. For students applying to Canadian universities, I always suggest they take up French courses, even if it’s from the Duolingo app. I look at their profiles and ask them to take up relevant courses,” she added. The counsellor further said to beat the uncertainty, students should start certification and diploma courses that are in demand. This way they can keep the momentum going and not lose out in case border restrictions kick in. “These courses are short and don’t cost much. Volunteering activities also help boost their resumes,” she added. A Workplace Learning Report by Udemy, an open online course provider, too found that skills in data science, Python scripting, cloud computing, and languages like Arabic and French are in high demand. Benazir I Shaikh, proprietor and director at Transcend Institute of Foreign Studies, Belagavi told TOI that having witnessed two major global recessions she realised that after a series of disappointments there will be a flood of jobs and opportunities for candidates. This uncertain period can be used to build profiles and skills. “The best way to utilise time is by engaging in research activities, paper presentations in international journals, small projects and volunteering to teach the underprivileged. Students can pursue certification courses online, from universities within India and abroad,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/have-backup-in-case-new-variant-surge-leads-to-travel-bans-experts/articleshow/88532705.cms||Farheen Hussain

Speaking at the launch of the new BMTC BS-VI and electric buses on Monday, transport minister B Sriramulu said, “These mini-buses will reduce traffic congestion.” BMTC officials said the mini-buses will have no conductors. “We are working out the modalities. We are yet to finalise whether to charge a flat fare or have pass or smart card-based travel in these buses,” an official said. He said each bus will cost Rs 15-20 lakh. “We will need Rs 150-200 crore for 1,000 mini-buses. We will also be able to operate these buses to apartment complexes and other narrow interior roads like Chickpet.” Separately, BMTC is inducting 90 non-AC e-buses (9m long with 33+1 seats) that will operate as Metro feeder services to provide first- and last-mile connectivity under Bengaluru Smart City funds. Advanced ticketing system Sriramulu said BMTC will introduce an advanced ticketing system involving electronic ticketing machines and UPI/wallet/credit card/debit card payments. “The project under the automatic fare collection system will be implemented in six months,” he said. The minister said the labour department and BMTC will issue ‘Vanitha Sangathi’ passes to 1 lakh women garment workers in the city from January 1. “The cost will be borne by garment factory owners (40%), labour department (40%), and BMTC (20%).” “Considering the encouraging response to fare reduction for Vajra services, BMTC will augment the Vajra fleet from the present 183 buses to 300 from next month. Monthly passes at a reduced rate of Rs 1,500 will be issued from January,” he said. Under the Centre’s Nirbhaya scheme, he said, BMTC is installing vehicle-tracking units, CCTV cameras, passenger information system, and panic buttons in 5,000 buses. “We will launch a mobile app by March 2022. These measures will ensure women’s safety. They are funded by the central and state governments on a 60:40 ratio,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1000-mini-buses-to-be-launched-in-2022/articleshow/88532707.cms||---

The two men, hailing from Tamil Nadu, were smuggling gold from Sharjah. Sources said the first person, a 28-year-old, landed in Bengaluru on Air Arabia flight G9 496 on Christmas day. Following passenger profiling, a customs team intercepted the man, who was behaving suspiciously, and frisked him. They found he had hidden gold — around 1.1kg, estimated to be worth Rs 52.5 lakh — in his underwear. He was arrested for smuggling and customs duty evasion. The following day, a 25-year-old man arrived on the same flight from Sharjah. He had concealed gold in paste form inside three capsules in his rectum. Following interrogation, he handed over 421 grams of gold, estimated to be worth Rs 19.9 lakh. Probe is on to ascertain if there is any connection between the two cases and if the two men are part of an international smuggling racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gold-worth-72l-seized-at-airport/articleshow/88532708.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: In a first, BMTC inducts 190 environment-friendly buses||BENGALURU: BMTC broke new ground on Monday as it rolled out 190 electric and BS-VI buses. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai flagged off the buses at Vidhana Soudha. “We have already formed two committees for the revival of state transport undertakings (STUs) and power utilities. Retired IAS officer MR Srinivas Murthy will soon submit a report on the revival of STUs. The committee will give recommendations on plugging pilferage and improving services to turn STUs profitable,” he said. Stating that STUs should not rely only on government subsidies, he said, “It’s difficult to run them with government subsidies. There are different ways to raise BMTC revenue. Earlier, many PSUs in the city used to hire BMTC buses to ferry employees. We will speak to PSUs such as HAL and IT firms to convince them to do so again.” The CM also suggested that BMTC buses change their look to make them more appealing to commuters. However, there has been a delay in the induction of electric and BS-VI buses. BMTC was the first state-run transport utility in the country to conduct trial runs for e-buses in 2014. While the plan was to deploy these 90 e-buses from June 2021, it was delayed because of various reasons. Similarly, 565 BS-VI buses were announced in the 2017-18 state budget, but things were delayed by a case in the National Green Tribunal. 40 of 90 e-buses hit the roadBMTC officials said 40 of the 90 non-AC e-buses under Bengaluru Smart City scheme are being operated in the first phase. “These will operate on three routes from Kengeri depot: Kengeri-Banashankari, Kengeri-Electronics City, and Kengeri-Chikkabanawara,” said BMTC MD V Anbukumar. These 90 e-buses will run as Metro feeder services to provide first- and last-mile connectivity. Bengaluru Smart City Ltd has provided financial aid of Rs 50 crore for the operation. “So far, 40 zero-emission and environment-friendly e-buses have been delivered; the remaining will be deployed by January,” Anbukumar said. Of the 90 e-buses, 30 each will operate from three depots: Yeshwantpur, KR Puram, and Kengeri. The buses are 9m long with 33+1 seats and come equipped with vehicle-tracking units, CCTV, LED route display boards, and emergency panic button. NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd will ru these buses for 10 years on gross cost contract model at a rate of Rs 51.67 per km with daily electricity for 180km per bus. 150 BS-VI diesel buses too BMTC officials said they are inducting 565 BS-VI diesel buses with financial assistance of Rs 191 crore from the state. BS-VI buses are environment friendly with low emission. “They have 41+1 seats with add-on features such as emergency panic button, rear air suspension and LED route display board. They will replace some old buses and have more frequency. So far, 150 buses have been delivered; the remaining will be deployed by February 2022,” said Anbukumar. He added that BMTC is scrapping all old buses that have covered a distance of more than 9 lakh km or crossed 11 years. “We have identified 1,232 such buses, including BS-III ones. Of these, 500 have already been scrapped,” said Anbukumar. The last time BMTC inducted buses to its fleet was in November 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/in-a-first-bmtc-inducts-190-environment-friendly-buses/articleshow/88532710.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt to seek SC nod, parties prepare for twin battle of ZP-TP & BBMP polls||BENGALURU: The much-awaited elections for the newly formed 243 wards of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are likely to be held in the early part of 2022. The government is reportedly preparing to submit an affidavit at the Supreme Court seeking directions to conduct the polls at the earliest. The civic polls are likely to coincide with the zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections as the authorities are anticipating the dates in March-April for which the high court is scheduled to hear the case on January 18. The twin battle has put all political parties on high alert as the ZP-TP polls are likely to gauge the mood of the voters ahead of the 2023 elections. The electorate for the ZP-TP polls is placed at 3.1 crore of the total 4.2 crore of the state. If the BBMP polls are held simultaneously, then it involves another 95 lakhs voters and they are expected to serve as precursor for all the parties ahead of the March-April 2023 assembly elections in Karnataka. “We regard it as the semifinals before the assembly elections and we’re going to deliberate on these polls tomorrow (Tuesday) at the BJP core committee meeting and executive to be held in Hubballi,” said BJP general secretary and MLC N Ravikumar. The BBMP polls were supposed to be held in September 2020, but were postponed due to Covid-19. In fact, the high court on December 4, 2020 directed the State Election Commission to schedule the polls for 198 wards within six weeks. However, the government brought the new BBMP Act, which increased the number of wards to 243 from 198, and delayed the elections further. It then moved the Supreme Court against the HC’s order, while initiating the delimitation process for the newly constituted 243 wards. The SC posted the case for disposal and the verdict is expected soon after the court reopens on January 3. Officials said the government will submit an affidavit seeking the court’s directions to conduct civic polls at the earliest as the delimitation exercise is almost done. “The government will let us know about its stand shortly and accordingly, we’ll place our submission before the court,” said advocate general Prabhuling K Navadagi. If the SC gives its nod, the process will be completed before the end of February. At the other end, the delimitation committee headed by retired IAS officer M Lakshminarayan has started the process of redrawing boundaries of ZP-TP constituencies. He said it will take another two months to complete it. “We’ll submit our recommendations to the government, following which it will start the process of finalising reservation,” he said. The developments indicate the likelihood of BBMP polls overlapping with ZP-TP elections. “We’re prepared for it. The two elections can be held in a gap of a week or so,” said S Honnamba, secretary, Karnataka State Election Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-seek-sc-nod-parties-prepare-for-twin-battle-of-zp-tp-bbmp-polls/articleshow/88532711.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

---||Bengaluru||HC: Officer can’t be revenue court only by virtue of rank||Bengaluru: A revenue officer holding an office that is not inferior in rank to that of a tahsildar cannot constitute himself as a revenue court only by virtue of his rank. He will have to conduct proceedings to act like one, the high court has observed. The court pointed out that under Section 25(1) Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964, it is mandatory that these revenue officers exercise power under the Act or any other law in force so as to constitute a revenue court.Dismissing writ appeals filed by the taluk panchayat of Chamarajnagar and the revenue department, a division bench of justices PS Dinesh Kumar and P Krishna Bhat said under Section 25(2) of the Act, such power should be exercised for inquiring into or to decide any question arising in any proceedings, and under Section 25(3), for determination of any question between the government and any person or between parties to proceedings. In the case on hand, the division bench noted there was no proceedings pending before him for inquiry and therefore, the deputy commissioner, Chamarajnagar, could not be a ‘revenue court’. The dispute related to about seven acres of land in Kasaba hobli of Chamarajnagar taluk. On February 26, 2009, a single bench had directed the authorities to enter the names of CP Rukmini and others in the record of rights by way of inheritance khata, in terms of a November 27, 2006 order passed by the Chamarajnagar DC.Rukmini and others had, in fact, challenged the DC’s June 20, 2007 order, annulling the November 27, 2006 directive passed by his predecessor, when their revision application was allowed.In the November 27, 2006 order, the Chamarajnagar DC, sitting as a revenue court, while exercising power under section 136(3) of the Act, had found that removal of the late CV Srinivasan’s name from revenue records was illegal, unauthorised and in violation of law, and therefore, ordered restoration of the petitioners’ names in the records in respect of two items of lands as per an order dated March12, 1964.A further direction was issued to his subordinates to put up the file for initiating acquisition proceedings on account of the fact that various government offices had come up in the lands in violation of the petitioners’ rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-officer-cant-be-revenue-court-only-by-virtue-of-rank/articleshow/88532713.cms||---

The cases pertained to threatening the complainants over giving evidence against People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leader Abdul Nasir Madani and T Nasir in the 2008 Bengaluru serial blasts case. KK Shahina from Kochi, a journalist, Suber Padupu from Kasaragod and Ummar Moulvi from Yalavidahalli, Madikeri taluk, had filed the petitions, claiming the sanction granted for their prosecution was defective. On February 28, 2018, the Principal District and Sessions judge, Madikeri, rejected their applications seeking for discharge from the cases. The cases against them were registered following two complaints by KB Rafiq and Yoganand, both from Somwarpet taluk, who alleged that Shahina and her accomplices who came in a Innova car on November 16, 2010, threatened them with dire consequences if they give evidence against Madani and Nasir in the serial blasts case. Appearing for the state government, additional advocate general R Subramanya told the court that the sanctioning authority has applied its mind and perused the documents and the other circumstances relied upon by the prosecution before granting the order. Considering the submissions, justice NK Sudhindrarao dismissed the petitions and observed that the petitioners cannot go into the mind of the authority to say that they have not reviewed it or the authority has not followed the procedure as mentioned under sub-section 2 of section 45 of UAPA at the time of according the sanction to conclude that it is defective. The judge pointed out that in one case, seven prosecution witnesses are stated to have been examined and five in the second case and added the other aspects urged by the petitioners are with reference to facts and in respect of which, opportunity is always available to them to raise them during the trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-relief-for-kerala-journalist-and-2-others-in-madani-case/articleshow/88532714.cms||---

Complaints lodged with the assistant engineer of the board had not been acted upon in the last decade.  A visit to the place found that five blocks around the collapsed structure have also developed deep cracks. Window shades are broken, water seepage marks prominent and bigger cracks found inside the houses too. All these existing damages haven’t been repaired ever since the building was inaugurated three decades ago. Urban Habitation Board MD M Govinda Rao said the shelf life of the building was thirty years and it had come to 28 years. “An amount of 1 crore was being sanctioned to repair the building but it did not withstand the test of time,” he said. Out of the 1.3 lakh units under the board in the city and its neighborhood, about 17% are not in livable conditions. Minister for rural industries and TNUHDB T M Anbarasan said that about 23,000 units of the board in Chennai constructed more than 45 years ago were enumerated as dilapidated.  These units would be demolished within five years to make way for construction of new tenements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/collapse-couldve-been-prevented-if-warnings-were-heeded-residents/articleshow/88532716.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

Justice N Anand Venkatesh has also requested the media, particularly Tamil media, to adopt the style sheet till the state government comes up with a glossary to be followed by media. “This court wants to make an earnest request to the media to take into consideration the words and expressions mentioned in the glossary, to be used while addressing persons belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community,” the judge said. If these words and expressions are used regularly, it will become a common practice and that will pave the way for a dignified identity for persons belonging to this community, the court added. “This court reposes confidence in the media that they will seriously consider the request made by this court and start implementing the same henceforth,” the judge said. The issue pertains to a plea moved by a same-sex couple who faced harassment at the hands of police and their parents. Initially, when the plea came up for hearing, Justice Anand Venkatesh chose to undergo a counselling session, as he felt that lacked understanding of the issues faced by the community. The judge then passed a series of orders touching upon the need to sensitise people, particularly judiciary and police, on the issue. The court also highlighted the need to revamp the medical education curriculum to sensitise medical practitioners. On December 23, when the plea came up for hearing, advocate S Manuraj, who initially represented the petitioners and now assisting the court, circulated a short note focusing on the standardised guide/prescriptive glossary containing the words and expressions to be used by the press and media while addressing persons belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community. Taking the note on record, the court passed the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/madras-hc-proposes-media-glossary-for-lgbtq-community/articleshow/88532717.cms||Suresh Kumar

They have nothing but the clothes they are wearing. Everything else is under tonnes of debris. "I was getting ready to go to work, when I heard my neighbours calling me to come out,” he said. He didn’t even stop to take the money he had saved up for his brother's education. Prem Kumar said the cracks in the walls started to worsen two days back. "When we woke up in the morning, we couldn't unlock the door. We called each other to find out if everyone faced the same problem. We are used to seeing cracks and plaster falling, but that day the cracks were everywhere,” he said. This is when they decided to take up the matter with the DMK area secretary T M Thaniyarasu, a former councillor, who promised to videograph the building and press the government to repair it. "Thaniyarasu came in the morning and asked us to vacate the building so that he could videograph it. Though we muttered that our morning routine was upset, we wouldn't have been alive if we hadn't walked out," says Prem Kumar. Another resident Saroja said, “We have lost everything we worked all our lives for." Thaniyarasu told TOI that he saw the cracks on the walls were widening. "I did not want to panic people that the building was about to collapse as they would begin to run. Some would take time to collect their belongings," he said. The affected residents were housed in a community hall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/i-had-walked-just-200-metres-from-building-when-it-crashed/articleshow/88532718.cms||Sindhu Kannan

The Great Western Industries Limited was incorporated in 1997 and is a listed public company. Every public-listed company should appoint at least one woman director within one year. This company should have appointed at least one woman director by April 1, 2015. The deputy registrar of companies, Tamil Nadu, issued a show cause notice on July 7, 2015, but no reply was received.

Re-employment is not a matter of right and once the teacher attains the age of superannuation, the relationship between master and servant ceases, said a division bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice R Vijayakumar. “A coordinate bench of this court on March 16 has categorically held that the state has passed another GO dated December 20, 2018 to the effect that teachers who attained superannuation during the middle of the academic year, will not be entitled to reemployment, when there are surplus teachers,” said the judges, allowing a state government appeal against a single judge order in favour of two teachers. The government school teachers attained superannuation during the middle of academic year 2019-20. Citing a GO dated October 27, 1988, they claimed re-employment for the rest of the academic year. As the request was rejected, they moved the high court. Opposing the plea, the government contended that there are surplus teachers on the same subject. Refusing to concur, a single judge of the court relied on the 1988 GO and held that the teachers can be re-employed in the same school for the welfare of the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-govt-school-teachers-have-no-right-to-seek-re-employment/articleshow/88532721.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Reverse flow of sewage floods GST road||CHENNAI: The reverse flow of sewage from manholes on the Grand Southern Trunk (GST) road near Chromepet is going on unabated for the last three days. The sewage is gushing out of the manholes and has flooded the corners of the road making it hard for pedestrians to even walk. The sewage also flows into the stormwater drains built by the Highways Department and ends up at the Pallavaram Periya Eri, a major water source for the huge neighborhoods around the lake. Residents and activists from the neighborhood said the officials of Tambaram Corporation (Pallavaram Municipality previously) are unmindful of this incident even though this is happening right on the busy national highway. “We have given multiple complaints to the Engineers but the issue has not been resolved. This is causing difficulty in people crossing the road and entering the neighborhoods from the road,” said activist David Manohar. With the unrelenting speed of the sewage flow, the traffic police have managed to keep a barricade on the spot to warn the commuters. The NGT, in the past, had directed the erstwhile Pallavaram Municipality to immediately plug the outflow from underground networks. However, such outflows continue to happen. Civil Engineer and GIS expert Dayanand Krishnan said the sewage flows out of manholes generally due to a block in the lower gradient of the drains. “Because of the block, the flow is disturbed, and the sewage tries to escape from the manhole out of gravitational pressure. The block needs to be removed at the earliest to restore the flow,” he said. Betsy Gnana Latha, a senior engineer with the Tambaram Corporation, said they had instructed the officials to identify such reverse flow and stop it. “We have stopped in various localities so far. The silt had accumulated due to recent rains. They will be removed,” she told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/reverse-flow-of-sewage-floods-gst-road/articleshow/88532722.cms||Omjasvin M D

"When such criticisms are raised, those who participated in the '#MeToo' movement are being treated as an accused, and the ones against whom charges are raised as prosecutors."Flagging victimisation of a person, who had already been victimised, he said, "the society does not realise that the victim is being subjected to secondary victimisation by posing several questions on the victim under the guise of fair treatment for the accused to find out the reasons."Justice V Ramasubramanian narrated two cases of survivors approaching the court over sexual harassment and said: "The criminals are more imaginative than the law enforcement agencies."Justice K Chandru, former judge, Madras high court, said attempts were being made to delay the proceedings in sexual harassment cases, in which the accused was holding higher positions and responsibilities. "When an allegation is made against a person holding high positions, there are attempts by the accused to delay the proceedings in the case by raising issues such as a particular official should not investigate it," he said. There is disappointment if one goes by the number of convictions despite mandating Vishaka committee and making an exclusive legislation against sexual harassment, he added. "Law alone is not enough, there should also be spirit to execute it," Justice Chandru said.On the debate on whether the '#MeToo' movement was a success, Justice Chandru said the issue must be observed from the perspective over and above how many people were accused and punished. The movement shook honchos in the country, he said.Advocate K Santhakumari narrated the obstacles that came her way before she managed to publish her book on #MeToo movement and its effects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/metoo-champions-suffer-secondary-victimisation/articleshow/88532723.cms||---

Students, teachers, parents are still in the dark about the upcoming board exams or revision tests as the school education department is yet to release the schedule. CBSE, meanwhile, has split the board exams in two, and have conducted the term 1 exams during November and December. With the government doctors’ association seeking closure of schools and colleges, teachers say that this uncertainty has sparked anxiety among parents and students. There are no reference marks for this year’s batches of Class X and XII in case the board exams were to get cancelled due to the pandemic, they further added. The school education department had planned to conduct two revision tests in January and March to prepare the students for the board exams, but the schedulaes are not yet released.  “School education department does not have an alternate plan in case the schools are closed in January next year. The Class X students did not write Class IX, VIII exams, and Class XII students did not write their previous two exams due to the pandemic," said P Patric Raymond, general secretary of the TN Graduate Teachers Federation. The academic year started on September 1. "This year, the school education department announced that up to 40% of the syllabus was made optional for board exam students, but it has not released any details about the prioritised syllabus which the schools were told to follow," he added. Teachers say that if the department had conducted a monthly common test, they could have used the average of these to calculate the marks for board exams in case of a cancellation, they say. Meanwhile, private schools are contemplating conducting two revision tests and a pre-board exam to prepare the students. "Students will start preparing for board exams only if the schedule is released. Private schools are planning to conduct a pre-board exam in April," said N Vijayan, senior principal of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/class-x-xii-students-parents-in-dark-about-board-exams/articleshow/88532724.cms||A Ragu Raman

---||Chennai||Maps of disquiet: Taking imagery beyond the wall||Chennai: In recent years, Chennai Photo Biennale (CPB), the two-month-long celebration of photography and art has emerged as a distinct lens clarifying the role of imagery in important junctures against landmark physical spaces, around important conversations, and complimenting powerful films and video art. As Shuchi Kapoor, one of the founding members of CPB says, “It is important that we relook at photography; go beyond the frame on the wall or on Instagram to a language that reflects the dystopias around us – environmental degradation, migration; things we learn about every day on the internet and newsprint. Through this edition, we are enabling newer ways to think and converse about them.” Which is why, after a year of being withheld, CPB’s third edition explores the hybrid format to its most creative potential with photo-based work, and the literature and conversations around them presented in five compelling formats physical shows, digital shows, online journals, newsprint and as films. The edition is titled ‘Maps of Disquiet’, and curated to reflect the exigencies of our times - resisting majoritarian impositions, ecological collapse, and technological dystopias. It has been curated by Arko Datto, a visual artist from Kolkata, Boaz Levin, artist and curator from Berlin, Bhooma Padmanabhan, curator from Chennai, and Kerstin Meincke, curator and researcher from Essen, Germany. The physical shows are open at seven handpicked venues – Forum Art Gallery, Ashvita's Gallery, Roja Muthiah Research Library, Madras Literary Society, Goethe Institut/MMB Chennai, with Dakshinachitra and the Government Museum showcasing the Foundation's projects. The digital showcase opened earlier this week featuring 37 exhibiting artists, along with their second journal and podcasts. “We looked at it as a way for diverse audiences to really take in the work, pause and reflect on them, at a time when we are hurrying past the deluge on Instagram,” says Shuchi. Kolkata's documentary photographer Soumya Sankar Bose for instance, has created a body of work on the Marichjhapi massacre, which can be viewed along with a film on the event also made by him. Andreas Langfeld and Sarabhi Ravichandran's photo work explores the Keeladi excavation, viewing it as a process of shaping and negotiating cultural identity and historical narratives. In the coming weeks, virtual guided tours, photo book launches, interaction with jurors and student engagement programmes will be presented on the hybrid model, leading all the way up to February 6, 2022.

Private forecasters have said the monsoon-like spells may spill over to January 2022 due to the return of the easterlies. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast shallow fog and mist over suburban areas. In its five-day forecast, IMD said there are chances of light-to-moderate rainfall at isolated places over coastal Tamil Nadu on December 28 and December 29 while the rest of the state is likely to experience dry weather. On December 30 and December 31, there could be light-to-moderate rain at a few places across the state. Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet, said a feeble trough or an elongated region of relatively low atmospheric pressure extending from coastal Andhra Pradesh to coastal Tamil Nadu may influence the year-end spells.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/imd-predicts-showers-in-next-4-days-across-tn/articleshow/88532729.cms||---

Students are partnering with NGOs as part of initiatives such as sanitary pad distribution in Bengaluru, apart from an online session on gender inequality and menstrual hygiene management awareness sessions for school-going girls in Chennai. “Our students hope to create a long-lasting impact by helping women to pursue a confident life,” said Ratna Kumar Annabattula, faculty advisor for Shaastra 2022, IIT Madras. "Each year, about 23 million girls drop out of schools in India as soon as they start menstruating. About 62 per cent of women in the age group of 15-24 years still rely on cloth during periods,” a release from the institute said. Speakers will explain the need for menstrual hygiene and how the lack of it can lead to health conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/menstrual-hygiene-campaign-at-iit-m/articleshow/88532730.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Railways repairs 165-yer-old bridge in 3 days||CHENNAI: It took more than 800 workers, four heavy cranes, an earth mover, 14 tonnes of rolled steel, one tonne of reinforcement bars and much concrete grouting to repair a 165-year-old bridge across a river and restore traffic in three days on the Arakkonam-Katpadi section, one of the busiest in the country. It was a rare feat for Southern Railway to complete the work in record time along a route that has 150 trains daily. The authorities built a mini coffer dam to divert water to the adjacent piers of the bridge to create a safe working space under the pillars to repair the two cracks that had weakened the bridge at its centre portion. Built when the first railway line was laid in the south, the bridge (no.299) across Ponnai river between Mukundarayapuram and Tiruvalam railway stations is one of the oldest in the country. A routine inspection team detected two cracks on the bridge on December 23. Railways suspended traffic after the cracks started widening. Railways had to suspend around 20 trains a day while several suffered delays on routes including Vellore, Coimbatore, Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram. “The biggest challenge was to divert the water flow to adjacent piers. The last time we saw such a flow of water was in 1934. We had to convince the workers to bring down the machinery into the water to create a mini dam to create a safe working space. Once this was done, cranes of 220-tonne and 140-tonne capacities were used to hoist steel reinforcements and other materials to create a support for the span. We applied concrete grouting in high pressure so that it could seal fissures as small as 0.1mm.” A parallel bridge turned out to be a blessing as a limited number of trains were routed over it. It was also used to install lights to illuminate the old bridge to carry out the repair. At 8pm on December 26, the track was declared fit, and a trial run was made using a locomotive and a goods train. “We have installed a strain gauge to check if there are any signs of sinking or settlement at the spot where the repairs were done,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rlys-repairs-165-yr-old-bridge-in-3-days/articleshow/88532732.cms||V Ayyappan
---||India||Punjab polls: BJP, Captain’s party and Dhindsa’s SAD will have common manifesto||NEW DELHI: BJP is likely to play the role of senior partner in its alliance with Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s SAD (Sanyukt) in Punjab, and the coalition is unlikely to project any chief ministerial face in the run-up to the election, sources said on Monday. Former Punjab CM Singh and former Union minister Dhindsa on Monday met the BJP top leadership, including Union home minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda in New Delhi. After the meeting at Shah’s residence, BJP’s Punjab in-charge Gajendra Shekhawat formally announced that all three parties will contest elections and will come up with a common manifesto. Shekhawat said a joint committee will be formed comprising two leaders from each party to finalise a seat-sharing agreement and a vision document. Asked about the chief ministerial face of the coalition, Shekhawat said that the election will be contested “under the collective leadership of the alliance”. “BJP usually contests election in the name of PM Modi,” he said, adding that the party does not project any face for the post of chief minister. He also underlined that the seatsharing agreement will not be based on the party’s previous alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab. “BJP is a national party which has won two Lok Sabha elections back to back and its base has expanded across the country so the alliance in Punjab will not be based on the seat distribution formula of its previous alliance with the Akali Dal in Punjab,” Shekhawat said. The minister also said the vision document will focus on all pending issues of Punjab. Sources in the party said BJP will play the role of senior partner in the border state and may contest more than half the 117 seats. BJP leaders expressed confidence that elections in Punjab becoming a five-cornered fight, with various farmer outfits having entered the fray in addition to Congress, SAD and AAP, will work in its favour. Singh formed his own party, the Punjab Lok Congress, days after he resigned as the chief minister and quit Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-polls-bjp-captains-party-and-dhindsas-sad-will-have-common-manifesto/articleshow/88532752.cms||---

Participating in the Young Rider category, Kavya won both the individual gold and team gold in the recently-concluded event at the Amateur Riders Clubs at Mahalakshmi in Mumbai. The event was conducted under the aegis of EFI. Kavya reaped the rewards of hard work and training from the age of 12 at the Chennai Equitation Cen tre. Riding different horses while training, she understood the temperament of each horse and it helped her build a winning partnership. While she would practise with her own horse Supreme Quest in her growing-up years, it was with Sechs Richtige that she achieved the feat in the national event. She has been training with Sech Richtige for the last six months. In fact, Kavya’s individual medal came on the back of a record breaking score of 73.3475 in the category. Last year, she won her maiden medal – team silver – in the Young Rider dressage category. Kavya thanked her trainer Isabelle for helping her win. “I am grateful that I had such an amazing partnership with Sechs Richtige for the past six months. Our partnership clicked in no time under the guidance and training of Isabelle,” the young rider said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-girl-kavya-riding-her-way-to-glory/articleshow/88532797.cms||---

Ramkumar is taking a lot of confidence from the win as he kicks off the new season by featuring in the Australian Open qualifiers which starts from January 10. “I will leave for Australia on Tuesday. The aim is to deliver my best and keep improving,” the 27-year-old mentioned during a felicitation programme organized by the Ampa Group here on Monday evening.Ramkumar --- who took 12 years since turning pro to achieve tournament success at the Challenger level --- aims to break into the top-100 ranking in 2022. “I just want to be healthy and play a lot of matches like I’ve been doing the last few years. If I can get into the top-100, nothing like that. I believe if I keep playing well and keep growing as a player --- I can crack that barrier,” said Ramkumar, currently ranked 184 in the world.Having been on the circuit for well over a decade, Ramkumar rates the Challenger tournaments as the toughest. “I’ve played the Challenger tournaments as well as ATP events and the difference (in competition levels) is not much. Challengers are tougher, if you ask me. The fire (to win) in each player is a lot more in Challengers. Sometimes, being a seeded player in an ATP tournament --- you can get away in a match here or there as they (your opponent) may not try harder. The grind and challenges in a Challenger event are immense,” pointed out Ramkumar. India will be hosting Denmark in the Davis Cup tie at New Delhi in March 2022. Ramkumar believes India will have an upper-hand in the clash. “Denmark is a strong team with players such as Holger Rune and Mikael Torpegaard. However, we are going to be playing on grass which was a collective decision by the coaches and player. I feel it will work in our favour,” Ramkumar mentioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/in-form-ramkumar-hopes-to-breach-top-100-barrier-in-2022/articleshow/88532798.cms||Prasad RS

Floating a new theory of planetary health to the climate change issue, the researchers observed that new areas should be explored to protect public health in the backdrop of steep rise in temperatures. A team of researchers headed by Dr Aalok Khandekar, assistant professor, department of climate change, IIT-Hyderabad, has started work on the new theory of planetary health. Dr Khandekar said planetary health is an emerging research sphere that seeks to connect the idea of human health and environmental health. “Global health, public health and individual human health is best ensured when we protect the health of ecosystems around us and beyond,” contended Dr Aalok Khandekar. Study team member and research scholar, NSV Sarath Chandra said several new health disorders are ready to pose a challenge due to climate change and rising temperatures.  He observed that the Covid-19 pandemic could have been avoided had the world focused on adopting a planetary health concept much earlier, and added the world could protect planetary health by not disturbing natural ecosystems. “If we have to avoid future pandemics or health impacts of climate change and rising temperatures, implementing planetary health is key,” said Sarath Chandra. Sarath Chandra said promotion of planetary health lies in restoring ecological infrastructure. He explained that the Intergovernmental science Policy platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) defined ecological infrastructure as the natural or semi natural structural elements of ecosystems and landscapes that are important in delivering ecological services. For example, there has been evidence of increasing incidence of air pollution or heatwave deaths in south Asia and this trend could be reversed over the coming years only by restoring and regenerating forest ecosystems, said Dr Khandekar and Sarath Chandra. Along with focusing on human health challenges of climate change and rising temperatures, governments and civic society must simultaneously focus on restoring ecological infrastructures such as air, water, soils and biodiversity, the researchers felt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/planetary-health-key-to-avoiding-future-pandemics-experts/articleshow/88529601.cms||Samdani MN

He once again exhibited his fondness towards Telugu language by writing the letter in Telugu. Here are some excerpts from his letter: “I have been thinking of going to Pennavaram since long to meet all near and dear. As the Supreme Court is going for winter vacation, I got a chance to implement my thoughts into action. With a lot of excitement I left for Ponnavaram on December 24 along with my family members. From the moment we stepped into Andhra Pradesh at Garikapadu, scores of people welcomed us. We cannot forget the love and affection shown by people by showring praises and flowers all along the way to Ponnavaram. The entire village came out to welcome me and my family members. Memories of my childhood chased me in the streets of Ponnavaram. The elders in the village calling me ‘Abbaay Ramana’ with affection is the best thing I have experienced. None of the respectable addresses would replace the love filled address by the elders treating me as their own. Upon knowing about by tour, many people sent me invitations, but I could not accommodate them all. The state government and the governor gave a grand reception to me on my first visit to the capital region. The felicitations made by Bezawada Bar Association from where I have started my career, the High Court lawyers’ association, Bar Council, High Court Employees Association, Rotary Club are unforgettable. The Supreme Court judges and judges of high courts who accompanied me in the tour were moved by the love and affection shown by the Telugu people. I thank everyone who came out to show their love on me without expecting anything in return. I am giving my word that I will live up to your expectations in discharging my duties.

The minister has agreed to meet the film distributors on Tuesday. The distributors are keen to resolve the issue with big-budget movies lined up for the festival season. Sources said that a delegation of movie theatre managements have also sought a separate appointment with the minister. About 120 theatres were closed in the last few days since the state government launched a crackdown against violations by the managements. The theatre managements said they could not run the show at the prices fixed by the government. Notwithstanding reservations expressed by theatre managements, the minister wants to take feedback from distributors on how the price issue would affect revenue. The film industry is keen on deciding the price of movie tickets in rural and municipal towns where the prices are considered to be too low. Over 90 per cent of theatres in the state are leased out to big distributors-cum-producers. However, the theatre managements are struggling to handle the issue as many distributors have suspended long-term lease agreements. They are insisting that theatre owners come forward to lease on cost-sharing basis.

Speaking at the 26th conference of the party’s AP unit which began on Monday, Yechury said this rightward shift was also bringing forward a communal, capital and imperial approach of governments, which deprives people of their fundamental rights. Yechury referred to the Special Category Status promise given to AP at the time of bifurcation and wondered what the ruling party was doing to get the promise fulfilled. He wanted the AP government to mount pressure on the Centre to get all the promises delivered and all its rights restored. The first day of the conference passed a resolution to fight for the rights of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/call-to-fight-for-states-rights/articleshow/88529617.cms||Gopi Dara

While around 10 ward secretaries were injured in the lathicharge, around 12 police personnel also sustained injuries in the stone pelting. The stones thrown by the irate ward secretaries damaged some private vehicles. With stones all around, the BJP office on Beerchand Patel Marg looked like a war zone. The ward secretaries’ demands included regularization of their work in the wards they functioned and payment of regular honoraria to them. They also said various developmental activities related to Har Ghar Nal Jal Yojana, and construction of RCC lanes in villages were conducted under their watch for the last four years. However, they were not paid for the work. “At the time of our selection, the agreement did not say that our services would be tenurial, nor was there any mention about the likely payment of any sum of money to us for the services,” said an agitating ward secretary. The state panchayati raj department had recently issued a notification that the services of the existing ward secretaries would be terminated and new ones would be selected. This letter forced them to resort to agitation. They had been sitting on dharna at Gardanibagh here for the last 13 days. “When no one turned up to listen to our grievances, we gheraoed the state BJP headquarters,” they said. Kin of slain mukhiya, ward member receive ex gratia: State panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary on Monday paid Rs 5 lakh ex gratia each to the next of the kin of the newly-elected mukhiya of Rampur Faridpur Neeraj Kumar and ward member Sanjay Kumar, who were gunned down by criminals. The ex gratia amount of Rs 5 lakh was paid to the next kin of the two deceased at a function held here to condole the deaths of the duo. The minister said the department had written to the state DGP, asking the police to apply the Crime Control Act (CCA) on those assaulting the elected panchayat representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ward-secys-fight-pitched-battle-with-cops-in-patna/articleshow/88529977.cms||Abhay Singh

While Monday’s feast was viewed as a form of damage control by Manjhi, it too ended dramatically when a group of youngsters posing as Brahmins and claiming to be members of Sri Ram Sena alleged that they were manhandled, abused, and pushed out of Manjhi’s residence. “We were not permitted to meet Manjhi and were pushed out even after an invitation. What Manjhi is doing is dividing the Hindu community, not uniting it,” one of the members could be heard saying. This was the same group that had recently organised a Satyanarayan Puja outside Manjhi’s bungalow. However, Danish Rizwan, the national spokesperson of the HAM(S), denied that anyone was mistreated during the feast. “Both Brahmins and Dalits attended the feast, and Manjhi ji served everyone. They were seated with dignity, served food, and given Rs 1,001 each,” he said. Rizwan added, “The man who made the allegation of mistreatment was Saurav Singh. He is not a Brahmin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-organises-brahmin-dalit-feast/articleshow/88530008.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The urban development and housing department (UDHD) intends to construct smart roads on the drains. According to sources, a consultant firm has been hired by the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited to develop a comprehensive traffic and drainage master plan for the city, including the redevelopment of all major drains. It has proposed covering numerous drains and constructing roads on top of them. Serpentine Nala carries the discharge of wards 9 and 21 and Anandpuri Nala of wards 7, 21 (some parts) and 22. The 5.6-kilometre-long road over Serpentine Nala will provide direct connectivity between gate I of Eco Park and Harding Road. On the other hand, the road over Anandpuri Nala will provide seamless traffic flow from Baba Chowk to Boring Canal Road, a distance of 2.5 kilometres. A UDHD official told this reporter that a proposal to construct a drain box and road over Serpentine Nala and Anandpuri Nala was made during the most recent smart city meeting, but had not yet been approved. “Once we receive approval from the state cabinet, only then will work on redeveloping the two drains begin. If everything goes according to plan, both drains will be developed along the lines of Mandiri Nala, incorporating key features of a smart urban street,” the official said, adding that vendor zones, footpaths, parking lots, open and green spaces, zebra crossings, rumble strips, stop signs, advanced direction signs, and directional arrows were all likely to be included in the redevelopment project. Sources claim that the open drains create an unsanitary environment for those who live near them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/plans-afoot-to-redevelop-two-more-drains-build-roads-on-top-of-them/articleshow/88530075.cms||Faryal Rumi

Also known as ‘King Mahendra’ among his supporters, Prasad was a seven-term Rajya Sabha member from Bihar. His current term in the Upper House was scheduled to end in April 2024. Before making his maiden entry in the Rajya Sabha in 1985, he was also elected to the Lok Sabha from Jehanabad parliamentary constituency in 1980 on a Congress ticket. As he lost the 1984 parliamentary polls from Jehanabad, the Congress sent him to the Rajya Sabha. Later, he went to the Rajya Sabha as RJD’s nominee. He was then elected to the Rajya Sabha as JD(U) nominee for three consecutive terms in 2006, 2012 and 2018. He was the founder of Aristo Pharmaceuticals. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and many other JD(U) functionaries have condoled the demise of Prasad. In his condolence message, Nitish said Prasad was an established name in the pharmaceutical industry and also an experienced politician. “Prasad was sociable and a person of good nature. His demise has caused an irreparable loss to politics, society and industry,” Nitish said in a statement. The CM spoke to Prasad’s brother Umesh Sharma alias Bhola Babu and his son Rajeev Sharma over the telephone and consoled them. “The JD(U) mourns Prasad’s demise and remembers his devotion towards the party and people of Bihar,” JD(U) national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan said. The Bihar unit of JD(U) held a condolence meeting at the party headquarters here to mourn the demise of Prasad.

In a bulletin issued on Monday afternoon, the Patna Meteorological Centre stated that a warning has been issued for moderate thunderstorms with lightning in one or two locations in south-western and south-central Bihar on Tuesday and Wednesday. Cold day conditions are also expected at one or two places, primarily in south-west and south central Bihar, on Wednesday and Thursday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an all-India weather bulletin on Monday evening, claiming that a wet spell is expected over north-west, central, and eastern India until Thursday. Additionally, it stated that isolated thunderstorms, lightning, and hailstorms are possible over Bihar on Tuesday, with cold day conditions expected on Wednesday and Thursday. The anticipated inclement weather has been attributed to a western disturbance along with a cyclonic circulation. According to Aarti Gupta, a Met official, the cyclonic circulation was located over south-western Bihar on Monday. “On Tuesday and Wednesday, cloudy conditions are likely to prevail, and light to moderate rainfall, as well as thunder and lightning, are expected in a few locations across the state,” she said. Aarti added, “Wednesday’s daytime temperature may experience a significant drop. The state’s average maximum temperature is likely to be between 16 and 18 degrees Celsius. On Thursday, similar weather conditions are likely to prevail in south Bihar. As a result, the state is expected to experience cold daytime temperatures.” A cold day occurs when the minimum temperature falls below 10 degrees C or when the maximum temperature deviates by 4.5-6.4 degrees C for two consecutive days. Meanwhile, the state’s average minimum temperature was between 11 and 13 degrees C on Monday, while the maximum temperature was between 23 and 25 degrees C.

The party had sought permission from the city police commissionerate to hold a protest over the paper leak for the exam for head clerk posts conducted by the Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board for December 23. The party members were demanding removal of the chairman of the board. However, the police rejected the request and shifted party members who had already gathered at the venue on the evening of December 22 to the party office. The agitating party members have been demanding compensation for unemployed youths who have been made to suffer due to the leak of the question paper. They submitted that the demands raised by the political party are with regard to policy matters and therefore are not enforceable in court. Therefore, peaceful protest is the only constitutional way of getting their demands enforced. The police did not allow the party members to gather and protest. After aggressive protest by the party members at the ruling BJP’s headquarters, skirmishes and arrests in Gandhinagar, a party member, Bipin Patel, filed the petition for quashing of the city police’s rejection of a permit to the party to protest. When petitioner’s advocate, Punit Juneja, mentioned it before the court on Monday, the court asked the petitioner to wait till the winter vacation ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/denied-police-permission-for-protest-aap-moves-court/articleshow/88531573.cms||---

The HC on Monday stayed RMC from any coercive recovery and sought an explanation as to how it computed Rs 30 lakh arrears since 1999, when the property tax was revised according to the civic body’s claims. BPCL’s advocate Ajay Metha submitted that the oil company runs a pump named Bombay Garage on Gondal Road in Rajkot city. When RMC raised the property tax bill in 2016-17, it mentioned that there were nil arrear for previous years. The next year’s bill reflected backlog of one year. The pump did not get any bill after 2018, but in 2021, the RMC issued a demand notice for Rs 30.47 lakh towards property tax including arrears. BPCL dashed off a legal notice to the civic body, which replied that arrears was computed considering the tax revision since 1999. The company filed a petition and submitted that the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act does not have a provision for retrospective taxation. The RMC levied the revised tax without giving BPCL any opportunity to argue against the revision and demand of arrears and it sought to recover the dues under the threat of sealing the petrol pump. The company termed the RMC’s actions arbitrary. After a preliminary hearing, Justice Nikhil Kariel said in the preceding year, the bills reflected that there were no outstanding dues from BPCL and RMC was seeking to calculate outstanding taxes from as far back as 1999. It clearly appeared that the company was not given the opportunity of a hearing. The HC sought a reply from the civic body and posted a further hearing for January 17, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bpcl-moves-hc-after-rmc-seeks-rs-30l-in-property-tax/articleshow/88531707.cms||---

This was announced by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy at the review meeting with the officials at his Tadepalli camp office on Monday. The Andhra Pradesh health department has estimated that there are about 24.4 lakh children in the 15-18 age group to whom the Covid-19 vaccination would be rolled out on January 3, 2022. Starting from the healthcare workers and frontline staff on January 16, 2021, the mass inoculation drive has so far covered only people older than 18 years. About 29.42 lakh people fall into the category of 60-plus and having comorbidities, becoming eligible for the ‘precaution doses’. There are 20.5 lakh healthcare workers and frontline staff in the state. The precaution doses for the healthcare workers, frontline staff and senior citizens with co-morbidities will be given from January 10, 2022. Amid the Omicron surge across the world, booster shots have gained prominence. But in India, this has been called ‘precaution dose’, not the booster dose. The chief minister geared up the officials to be prepared to face the third wave and the Omicron variant. The officials told the chief minister that six Omicron cases were reported in the state. However, none of them was hospitalised and added that the situation was not alarming. However, the chief minister told the officials to gear up the government and private hospitals to face any eventuality. The chief minister also told officials to expedite vaccination process and conduct door-to-door vaccination drive. He asked them to identify people who were not vaccinated while conducting fever survey and administer vaccines to them. He directed the officials to take necessary measures by monitoring the situation regularly as people are travelling from other places. The chief minister said frontline workers, people with chronic diseases and the elderly should be the focus in the administration of booster dose. The chief minister has given green signal for general transfers in health department.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Seniors most at risk, need immediate 3rd shot, say doctors||KOLKATA: The 60-plus population remains the most vulnerable to Covid — especially when a new variant like Omicron is on the prowl — and needs a third ‘precaution’ dose immediately, felt doctors and experts in Kolkata. Apart from almost 95% of them having some co-morbidity, their immune systems are weaker and make them susceptible to infection, particularly those which are extremely transmissible, like Omicron, they pointed out. Thousands of senior citizens in Kolkata had contracted Covid during the first and second waves when a large number of them were either unvaccinated or had received just one shot. “Those with kidney, lung and cardiac diseases were the most widely affected and many died, several even after double vaccination. So we need to protect them with an additional dose without delay,” said internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas. He cited cases of multiple patients who got the virus and had a severe disease despite staying at home. “Those with co-morbidities had a high fatality rate during the first wave,” said Biswas. It will be wrong to go by the lower virulence of Omicron and take it to be innocuous, said AMRI Hospitals internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh. “It could turn virulent with transmission, which is now happening at a fast rate, and affect senior citizens more than the rest. Their immune systems turn weaker and can’t generate enough antibodies to fight the virus. Their organs are more likely to be affected in the event of an infection like Omicron and, consequently, they will be the first casualties. So they need a booster dose quickly,” said Ghosh. The ‘risk-based approach’ to vaccination was the right one, according to Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. Those above 60 were the most vulnerable, along with health workers, since they were the first to receive the jab and, hence, have suffered an antibody depletion, Sarkar said. “According to this approach, frontline workers and senior citizens are inoculated first. Statistics show the 60-plus group has been the most vulnerable to Covid and have had the highest number of deaths. We saw more senior citizens die in the first wave, when they were yet to receive the vaccine. During the second wave, the 40-50 age group surpassed them in terms of the number of deaths since they were unvaccinated,” said Sarkar. While there is yet no government guideline, a booster dose could be most effective if taken after six months of the second shot. “Most healthworkers and a majority of the 60-plus group have crossed that period. We are coming in close contact with patients so the fear is logical. A substantial number of doctors are above 60 as well. This will allow them, many of whom have co-morbidities and are vulnerable to infection, to return to work,” said RTIICS intensivist Sauren Panja. “Studies show that antibodies deplete in six-eight months. So we can assume that those who received the second dose between April and June will now qualify,” Sarkar said. “At least 50 members of Banchbo — an organisation working with healthcare of senior citizens — have registered with us so we can help them with the procedure for getting the booster dose. More queries are coming in. Most of our members had completed vaccination by April,” said physician Dhires Kumar Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/seniors-most-at-risk-need-immediate-3rd-shot-docs/articleshow/88530807.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The high court asked the petitioners to file a note with surviving prayers and directed the state government to file a reply on the same before January 28. The high court had earlier adjourned the matters as the Repeal Act did not get assent from the governor. However, as the state government filed an additional affidavit stating that the governor gave assent to the Repeal Act and it was notified, the petitioners argued that the hearing should be continued in respect of some specific prayers. Arguing on behalf of the capital farmers, senior counsel Shyam Divan said that though the twin legislations have been repealed, the developmental works in Amaravati are not taking place according to the notified masterplan. As the developmental works in the capital are to be done in a time bound manner, the petitioners seeking directions from the high court to complete the works in accordance with the masterplan and hence the hearing should be continued, he said. Shyam Divan said that the state government has promised to develop returnable plots under Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) but nothing has been done so far other than notional allotment of plots. Though the state government stated that LPS developmental works will be taken up on priority basis, those proposals remain on papers and the works are yet to be grounded, he said. Even in the case of the high court, the high court stated before the Supreme Court in an affidavit that they will complete the work of court building, judges accommodation and other developmental works in time bound manner but it has failed to do so, he said. All these aspects are to be heard and decided, he said. Senior counsel Jandhyala Ravi Shankar said that the state government committed fraud on the Constitution by violating various provisions of law. The state government in the objects and reasons mentioned in the Repeal Act that the legislation is being brought to enable the state government to introduce a better bill for trifurcation of the capital. As the fundamental dispute lies in the legislative competence of state government to make such a legislation and it was challenged in the petitions, they cannot be deemed as infructuous, he said. P B Suresh, Prabhunath Vasireddy, Unnam Muralidhar Rao and M S Prasad also argued that the state government is still going ahead with the shifting of offices even after the repeal of the twin legislations. Shifting of Waqf Tribunal is one such example to show that the state government is doing indirectly what cannot be done directly. Some of the ministers are stating that wherever the chief minister sits, that place is considered as the capital. As the state government cannot make legislations to shift the capital after it was notified, the hearing on the petitions should be continued for passing appropriate orders, they argued. Considering the arguments of the petitioners, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy and Justice D V S S Somayajulu asked the petitioners to prepare a note mentioning the prayers that still survive after notifying the Repeal Act and submit the same within ten days. The high court directed the state government to file a reply to the note and posted the matter for further hearing on January 28.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Radius rule rejig to make pre-high schools, high schools a distant affair||VIJAYAWADA: The state government on Monday passed orders revising the radius of pre-high schools and high schools (Class 3rd to 8th) from existing one kilometer to three kilometers. The move helps to rationalise the existing primary and upper primary schools. The government issued a gazette notification amending the Andhra Pradesh Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules- 2010 (RTE Act). The government has classified the education system in four parts--foundation schools, foundation-plus schools, pre-high school and high school. While the government has continued the existing rule of compulsory school in one kilometer from the neighborhood for foundation schools which teach (PP1, PP2, Class 1 and 2) and foundation-plus which teach PP1 to Class 5, students from Class 3 to Class 8 studying in pre-high schools should travel for three kilometers. CPI(M) state secretary P Madhu condemned the amendment. “This move will increase the distance of schools from habitation and the poor will suffer in going to school. The move is a part of a deal with the World Bank,” Madhu alleged. Primary Teachers Association secretary Ganapati Rao said the number of teachers will significantly reduce with rationalisation and many schools will be closed with the amendment made to RTE Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/radius-rule-rejig-to-make-pre-high-schools-high-schools-a-distant-affair/articleshow/88529552.cms||Venu Lanka

It came four years after the world’s first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was launched. Eight years later, the central bank’s opposition to crypto has only become stronger. Earlier this month, the RBI told its board that a ‘complete ban’ on crypto was needed as partial restrictions won’t work. In 2018, the RBI had effectively banned crypto trade in India as it ordered banks not to facilitate it. A Supreme Court ruling in 2020, however, set aside the central bank’s order. The RBI has consistently resisted crypto as it has concerns related to financial stability. The central bank’s monetary policy would be less effective if crypto is allowed to move freely. Virtual currencies would also undermine banks and other regulated entities. Other concerns about crypto include extreme price volatility and difficulty in tracing transactions. Besides, in a country like India, managing the foreign exchange risk will be a greater challenge given that money would flow in via digital currency and not necessarily in the form of dollars, RBI sources have argued. Even IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath highlighted this challenge while pointing out that emerging and developing countries face a greater threat. The view from Mumbai’s Mint Road is that crypto should neither be treated as a currency nor an asset, especially given the concerns over illegally channelling funds. The government is yet to firm up its view given that all wings are not in sync on the issue — something that led to the introduction of the proposed legislation being postponed until at least the next Parliament session. According to a fintech player, a section in the government may be against a full ban due to fears of being cut off globally and being clubbed with China, which banned crypto this year. Legal experts say that, while recognising crypto as legal tender is out of the question, it is too late to ban crypto. According to them, the government’s approach will have to be balanced so as not to hurt investors but at the same time not let it grow uncontrollably as that could threaten the country’s foreign exchange reserves and lead to disruptions in the economy. “The government is viewing cryptocurrencies as investment instruments and plans to regulate them. Under income tax rules, cryptocurrencies are likely to be treated as assets and attract capital gains. GST and TDS are other areas where the position of law is not clear,” said L Badri Narayanan, executive partner, Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys. Legal experts said that comprehensive regulation is needed and that it would not be fair to compare the policy stance that India takes on crypto with that of developed countries like the UK, which is taking a ‘piecemeal regulation’ approach, due to differences in foreign exchange regulations. “You cannot take money out of India without permission. We are a foreign exchange-regulated market and that means we cannot take certain decisions like developed countries that have a free market,” said Narayan. He added that it would be tough for regulators to stop crypto payments by Indians abroad. The crypto industry too has sought clarity on foreign exchange and tax laws. “Under FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act), the cross-border movement of ‘goods’ and ‘services’ is classified as import/export. However, the regulations do not clarify whether crypto tokens amount to ‘goods’,” said Sumit Gupta, CEO & co-founder of CoinDCX, a crypto exchange, and co-chair of industry body BACC. A section in government has suggested that crypto may be regulated as an asset class by market watchdog Sebi. To this end, a bill on cryptocurrencies, along with some amendments to RBI and Sebi Acts, were to be tabled in Parliament. However, the much-awaited crypto bill and other amendments were not introduced during the just-concluded winter session of Parliament. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said emerging tech like crypto should be used to “empower democracies, not undermine”, while FM Nirmala Sitharaman said that cryptocurrencies will not be allowed for payments in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-wants-full-ban-on-crypto-legal-experts-say-it-is-too-late/articleshow/88531142.cms||Aseem Gujar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh high court stays single judge order on fee reimbursement scheme||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday stayed the single judge order on Jagananna Vidya Deevena scheme directing the state government to pay fee reimbursement amount directly to colleges instead of paying to mothers of students. The government moved an appeal petition after the HC turned down the review petition on the issue. The private college managements moved the HC arguing that the students are not paying the fee despite the government reimbursing the same. The government made changes to the fee reimbursement scheme and paying the fee amount into the accounts of mothers of the students. The managements argued the mothers are not paying the fee and the government directed not to insist the students to pay the fee. The HC then directed the government to pay the fee amount to colleges. Advocate general S Sriram said the government brought changes to the scheme to ensure transparency and accountability. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure students do not default on paying the fee. He said the government had issued another GO stating if any student failed to pay one instalment in time, the next instalment will be paid directly to the college. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed that the college managements cannot demand implementing a government scheme in a particular manner. The bench said the colleges did not have any say in this matter and granted interim stay on the single judge order and directed the colleges to file counters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/high-court-stays-single-judge-order-on-fee-reimbursement-scheme/articleshow/88529580.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The accident occurred on the NH-139 near Rani Talab under the same police station area. The deceased were identified as Nitish Kumar (32) and Kanhaiya Prasad (34), both of Kukri, and Durgesh Kumar (38) of Alampur. The injured, Vikash Kumar and Deepu Kumar, were referred to the Patna Medical College and Hospital. The SHO of Rani Talab police station, Vimlesh Kumar, said the postmortem of the deceased was done at a Paliganj hospital. “The collision was so severe that the car was completely destroyed. When the locals heard the loud thud, they alerted police,” he told this newspaper. Meanwhile, three bike-borne miscreants allegedly robbed a grocer, Binod Choudhary, of Rs 15 lakh and fled the scene in Supaul district on Monday. The incident occurred around 10am near Ganpatganj High School in Raghopur as Choudhary was about to deposit cash in the Central Bank of India. After pursuing the man on his motorcycle, the criminals snatched his bag at gunpoint. Later, SDPO (Nirmali) Pankaj Kumar and inspector K B Singh arrived at the spot to investigate the incident. Saurabh Kumar, Choudhary’s son, filed a complaint against unidentified criminals. Raghopur SHO Bhupendra Singh stated that police were investigating the incident and examining the CCTV footage from the location of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-killed-two-injured-as-suv-hits-road-divider-in-paliganj/articleshow/88530247.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||RBL stock dives 18%, RBI allays fears about lender||MUMBAI: Shares of RBL Bank closed 18% down on Monday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appointed an additional director on the board of the bank. The RBI’s move followed RBL Bank’s CEO Vishwavir Ahuja going on medical leave six months before his term ended. RBL opened weak at Rs 155 on Monday after the weekend developments and hit the 20% lower curcuit of Rs 132, before recovering marginally and ending at Rs 141 — 18% lower than Friday’s close of Rs 173. This prompted the RBI to issue a statement seeking to quell speculation concerning the bank. “The bank is well capitalised and the financial position of the bank remains satisfactory. According to half-yearly audited results as of September 30, 2021, the bank has maintained a comfortable capital adequacy ratio of 16.3% and provision coverage ratio of 76.6%. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of the bank is 153% as of December 24, 2021, as against the regulatory requirement of 100%,” the RBI said in its statement. In a late evening release, RBL Bank said that it has extended for five years its partnership with Bajaj Finance for co-branded credit cards. This is likely to be seen as a measure of confidence as it comes after the RBI coming on board with a director. Addressing the media on Sunday, the bank’s interim CEO Rajeev Ahuja, who was until recently an executive director, said that the RBI nominee on the board would help the bank in improving its processes concerning risk management and compliance. He also said that Vishwavir Ahuja’s one-year term meant that a successor would have to be eventually identified and his going on leave had precipitated the need for it. According to sources, the RBI nominee on the board, Yogesh Dayal, will assist the bank in the process of identifying a successor. The bank has already started the work on improving risk processes. Last year, the bank brought in Deepak Kumar, who was earlier a chief general manager with SBI and had served on RBI’s committee for resolution of the PMC Bank crisis. “It is clarified that appointment of additional director in private banks is undertaken under section 36AB of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as and when it is felt that the board needs closer support in regulatory/supervisory matters. As such, there is no need for depositors and other stakeholders to react to speculative reports. The bank’s financial health remains stable,” the RBI added. The quoted section allows the RBI to appoint a director in the interest of banking policy or in the public interest or in the interests of the banking company or its depositors. The RBI had earlier appointed additional directors on the board of Yes Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank and Dhanlaxmi Bank. Motilal Oswal in a report, “Current developments have raised concerns about the bank’s ability to sustain a turnaround in its operating performance, while at the same time raising worries of similar actions by the regulator on other mid-sized banks, where the operating performance has been sub-optimal. We thus put our rating under review and remain watchful of further developments and await further clarity in the 3QFY22 result.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbl-stock-dives-18-rbi-allays-fears-about-lender/articleshow/88531068.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Traders’ bodies ask members to prepare booster-dose eligible list||KOLKATA: Several traders’ organisations have directed their member associations to prepare a list of those who will be eligible for the Covid vaccine booster dose once the government rolls it out on January 10 and prepares a guideline on how and when it will be administered. They have also requested members to ensure those who have not taken their first or second jabs immediately get vaccinated. “The pandemic is not over and Omicron cases are on the rise. This is forcing us to think about the booster shot as it is directly connected with our business. We have requested all member associations to be prepared for the booster dose. They must make a list of all those who will be eligible as and when government rolls it out,” said Sushil Poddar, president of the Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations. Last week, the government announced it will soon roll-out booster doses for frontline healthcare workers, those above the age of 60 who have co-morbidities, and those between the ages of 15 and 18. “During the first two waves, traders suffered the most as most markets were either completely shut or working hours were curtailed. We want to take all precautionary measures to avoid that,” said the secretary of a retail market in Burrabazar. Many associations have also decided to hold vaccination camps from first week of January when those between the ages of 15 and 18 will be vaccinated. “We have decided to hold vaccination camps for children and grandchildren of our members,” said Poddar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traders-bodies-ask-members-to-prepare-booster-dose-eligible-list/articleshow/88530811.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Private hospitals rush to get Covaxin, contact schools for vax drive||KOLKATA: Several private hospitals that had run out of Covaxin and didn’t acquire it since it had a low demand are now scurrying to restock it. Since Covaxin is likely to be recommended for the 15-18 age group, even those with depleted stock are planning to place orders. Several are also getting in touch with schools to vaccinate their students in the eligible group. Housing complexes, too, are being roped into the vaccination drive. Government hospitals, on the other hand, are waiting for more clarity on the vaccination for the 15-18 group. “It should come through after Tuesday’s meeting between the Union health ministry and the states. We will require 50 lakh doses for the youngest group and each vaccination team across the centres should now have a paediatrician,” said a state health official. Belle Vue Clinic has decided to procure 30,000 doses of Covaxin. It has asked three schools — which were used as vaccination venues earlier this year — to send a list of students who qualify for the shot. “These include South Point School, La Martiniere and JIS Group of schools. It’s still not clear if only Covaxin can be administered to the 15-18 group, but we will keep enough stock for the other groups as well. We expect the 12-15 age group to be brought under the fold soon, so more vaccines will be needed,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. AMRI Hospitals, too, has contacted at least 25 schools and asked them to share a list of students who fall in the 15-18 age bracket. “They can register with us directly from the school and walk into any our three units for a shot. We have contacted several CNI schools, as well as some private ones, and will soon start roping in housing complexes for the drive, too,” said an AMRI spokesperson. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) now has just 5,000 Covaxin doses. “We will start with 5,000 doses and monitor the demand for a week before placing the next order for another 5,000-7,000 doses,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. At Peerless Hospital, the Covaxin stock is down to 390 doses. “It could shoot up though we don’t have any official confirmation whether only Covaxin is to be administered to the youngest group. But we will procure more this week,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-rush-to-get-covaxin-contact-schools-for-vax-drive/articleshow/88530796.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The cause of the incident remains unknown, and a high-level investigation has been ordered. According to sources, the coach, which sustained significant damage, was meant to isolate passengers who tested positive for Covid during screening at the railway station. However, the other five coaches escaped damage because the fire was extinguished before it reached them. A press release issued by Rajesh Kumar, the chief public relations officer (CPRO) of the East Central Railway, stated that the fire started at approximately 9.15am on Monday. “The coach, which was to be used for isolating Covid positive passengers, was completely deserted. No damage to other railway property or human life has been reported as a result of the incident. Soon after receiving information, RPF and GRP officials arrived on the scene and immediately called the fire department, which brought the situation under control by 10.30am,” the CPRO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-isolation-coach-catches-fire-at-gaya-junction/articleshow/88530047.cms||---

The industrial house has been taking steps towards these themes through organic and inorganic deals. “Our new pilots and businesses, from 5G to TataNeu (super app) and Tata Electronics, are poised to benefit from these four themes going forward.” The chairman added that the conglomerate “did well” financially this year. He, however, didn’t reveal any financial metrics. Chandrasekaran has been implementing a process of simplifying, synergising and scaling (3S) to create an agile and powerful platform. “Thanks to our 3S strategy, we are becoming simpler and financially stronger than we have been in a long time,” he wrote in the letter. The new year letter to employees is an annual tradition for a Tata Group chairman in which the conglomerate’s milestones and macroeconomic factors are highlighted. Chandrasekaran called the winning bid for Air India the “most important” milestone for the conglomerate. Air India was originally promoted by the Tata Group before it was taken over by the government. Chandrasekaran has asked employees to press on with the transformation to propel the conglomerate and the country. “As a business, we can play our part in the evolution of India, with its ambitions to become a $3-trillion economy by 2024,” he said. However, the chairman cautioned that all the conglomerate’s ambitions are contingent on a more immediate concern: learning to live with the coronavirus. “Businesses and society must adapt to it by preparing as best we can for new outbreaks and variants.” He warned employees against letting their guard down and suggested taking booster shots of the Covid vaccine as and when made available. “Recent success has given our group a great platform to build on. I am excited by the heights I know we can reach, not just financially, but also in terms of the difference we can make to communities,” Chandrasekaran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chandra-lists-4-themes-for-tata-group-for-next-year/articleshow/88531054.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Business||Turmeric not agri produce, but 5% taxable spice: GST-AAR||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra bench of the GST-Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) has held that turmeric is a ‘spice’ that would be taxable at 5%. Recently, the bench was approached to determine whether turmeric would be exempt as an ‘agriculture produce’. However, the GST-AAR bench gave its ruling as the whole turmeric had been cleaned by boiling and later dried and polished by farmers prior to its sale. This is contrary to a ruling given by the Gujarat bench. Further, on the flip side, the Karnataka bench had recently held eggs (in their raw form) to be an agriculture produce and, hence, exempt from GST. In the latest case, the applicant Nitin Bapusaheb Patil was a commission agent, recognised under the state’s Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) rules. His role was to conduct an auction under the supervision of an APMC officer and in the presence of farmers and traders. If the price obtained at the auction was accepted by the farmer, he continued to act as the intermediary and facilitated delivery of the dried and polished whole turmeric. For such services, he got a fixed commission of 3% from the traders, according to the APMC rules. Further, in his application to the AAR, he sought to know whether his ancillary services would also be exempt from GST. According to a notification No. 12/2017 dated June 28, 2017, agricultural produce means any produce out of cultivation of plants and rearing of all life forms (except horses) for food, fibre, fuel, raw material or other similar products. The notification also requires that no further processing should be done on such items, or processing which is done by the cultivator or producer should be such that it does not alter the essential characteristics of the produce but makes it more marketable for the primary market. The applicant relied on various judicial and quasi-judicial precedents. He quoted the Supreme Court which, in two cases, had held that in case of certain agricultural products, some cutting or processing is required to make it marketable. If it is minimal and does not result in transformation of the product, it would remain an agriculture produce. However, the GST-AAR bench held that the applicant had failed to prove that the specialised process of boiling, drying and polishing that required use of machines was carried out by the farmers on their own land. It was not ‘fresh’ turmeric and would be taxed at 5%. Consequently, the services provided by the commission agent would also be taxable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/turmeric-not-agri-produce-but-5-taxable-spice-gst-aar/articleshow/88531110.cms||Lubna Kably

Of these, 3,436 were done by the prohibition, excise and registration department and 11,488 by the home department. Addressing mediapersons here on Monday, Dhanji stated that a total of 2,390 people were arrested in prohibition cases this year. “The department set a target of Rs 3,420 crore for the 2021-2022 fiscal year, from April 1 to December 31, against which Rs 3,432 crore revenue was already collected by December 24,” the commissioner said. Dhanji claimed that a search operation against illegal liquor in trains was underway, as was a 24x7 vehicle inspection drive at checkpoints. “Continuous raids are being conducted on home delivery vendors and various businesses. During these raids, altogether 85,425 litres of liquor, both imported and domestically produced, have been seized,” he said, adding that 59 individuals engaged in home delivery were also arrested and 316 vehicles seized. The Patna high court (HC) has announced the appointment of judicial officers as presiding officers in the state’s 74 special courts. The HC makes these appointments on the recommendation of the prohibition, excise and registration department in accordance with the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016. “Special courts have been established solely to hear cases involving prohibition. Four appointments have been made in Patna, three in Gaya, one each in Saharsa, Sheohar, and Sheikhpura, and two in each of the remaining districts except Arwal,” Dhanji stated during the press conference. He also mentioned that the department would use drones to monitor illegal liquor manufacturing in Bihar. A trial run in this regard was conducted in Digha area on Saturday in which three companies participated. “A demonstration of 10-15km flight range was conducted at Digha Ghat, and a night vision trial was conducted at Kangan Ghat. Soon, an organisation will be chosen based on its performance,” the commissioner said. Meanwhile, the prohibition, excise and registration department has initiated a bidding process for the digitization of documents dating from 1950 to 1995. “After digitization, the department will have a great deal of convenience in making the documents’ records available to the general public as soon as possible,” Dhanji said, directing all registration officers to deliver pending registered documents to regional offices and the parties concerned by January 15, 2022 or destroy them in accordance with the rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2k-held-in-prohibition-cases-in-bihar-this-year/articleshow/88530195.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||Liquor case: Bihar cop axed for taking Rs 3 lakh from accused||SASARAM: Hours before the arrival of CM Nitish Kumar at Sasaram as part of his ‘Samaj Sudhar Abhiyan’, Rohtas SP Ashish Bharati on Monday suspended SHO-cum-inspector of Sasaram town police station, Kamakhya Narayan Singh, for allegedly letting off a health department official who was arrested in a drunken state in lieu of bribe payment of Rs 3 lakh. The SP said further action against the SHO would also be taken. According to sources, a senior health department official, who had come to Sasaram to inspect the sadar hospital, was arrested in an inebriated condition from a hotel on December 23. He was brought to the town police station, but released by the police within half-an-hour. It was alleged that the police took a bribe of Rs 3 lakh to let off the accused.

This is part of the bank’s ‘Axis One’ strategy where it approaches the customers offering its entire gamut of products instead of a standalone service. “We are making aggressive strides in merchant-acquiring. We are not looking at merchants as just someone who acquires a point-of-sale (PoS) terminal but as an opportunity to open a new current account for their business, personal savings account and an opportunity to provide loans and insurance protection. We are growing this business by offering new products to the payment products merchant,” said Axis Bank executive VP & head (cards & payments) Sanjeev Moghe. The bank’s market share in the number of devices has gone up from 15% in January this year to 16% up to October. Its share in spending is even larger as the bank is constantly tracking the number of inactive terminals. “We have speeded up the onboarding process by making it completely paperless. While the onboarding is still done in the presence of the merchant for Know-Your-Customer requirements, we are working on ways to do it remotely,” said Moghe. The sharp jump in the onboarding of merchants — including small shops, organised retail and e-commerce merchants — took place after the bank decided to stop looking at these card-swipe machines as a profit stream. “The business model is a loss-making one if you look at it purely as the difference between what you earn from the merchant for the transaction versus what you pay as interchange. This is why many banks have chosen not to do this and instead outsource to partners or joint ventures. We have decided to keep this business within the bank,” said Moghe.Currently, HDFC Bank dominates the merchant-acquiring space followed by Axis Bank, which has overtaken SBI and ICICI Bank, both of which have hived off merchant-acquiring to an associate company. Axis Bank’s strategy to increase the number of merchants is to offer the latest in technology to them and address pain points. For instance, the bank installs Android PoS machines and has also come out with a printer-less compact machine. “The charge slip is no longer required for reconciliation and many customers now do not ask for the slip as it is no longer required,” said Moghe. On the agenda are bring-your-own-device (BYOD) solutions that will enable the use of regular smartphones with an attachment for accepting cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/axis-bank-is-2nd-largest-in-pos-machines/articleshow/88531087.cms||Mayur Shetty

The cantonment medical officers said that they have so far not noticed any increase in positive cases. However, they have still instructed their doctors to carry out testing of patients showing Covid-like symptoms in their out-patient departments (OPD) and fever clinics. Collectively, all three boards are carrying out testing of at least 100 people on a daily basis. Dr Uday Bhujbal, who works under the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), said, “We are carrying out at least 40-50 RT-PCR tests every day. At present, four patients were found Covid-positive, and they are asymptomatic. The Covid situation in the PCB area is under control till date. Still, we have appealed to the citizens to come forward for testing if they develop any symptoms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-rt-pcr-testing-in-3-cantonments/articleshow/88531575.cms||Sandip Dighe

The total number of active cases has gone past the 1,000-mark. At such a time, the state has begun preparations to immunise 26.5 lakh teenagers in the 15-18 years age group who are eligible to get the vaccination from January 3. Jai Prakash Shivahare, state health commissioner, told TOI that schools would be the primary focus in the inoculation programme for teenagers. “We will be collaborating with the educational institutes for vaccination of students between 15-18 years of age. Those not attending any schools would also be covered. If need be, special camps would be organised in clusters for maximum coverage,” he said, adding that currently the scheme allows both online and offline registration for the teens. “Out of total, about 22% population is in eight municipal corporations with Ahmedabad and Surat cities having two lakh and 1.8 lakh teenagers, respectively. The overall guidelines for the vaccination were issued by the central government on Monday, whereas a video conference with all top health department officials from states on Tuesday would provide us more clarity on the process,” said a top health department official, adding that they would rope in schools to help in vaccination process – either by creating awareness or providing space to organize vaccination camp – if the rules allow. According to the state health department figures, the 15 to 18 years population has recorded about 5% of the Covid positive cases since July this year after the second wave, and account for less than 1% of mortality. Experts however said that the move is welcome as it would reduce spread and safeguard the teens for whom the schools and coaching classes are gradually going offline. The registration for vaccination would start from January 1 on CoWIN portal, said officials. Aadhar card or class X marksheet would be among valid documents for age verification for both online and offline registration. Covaxin would be administered to the teens according to the central government directive. “As of Monday morning, Gujarat has over 55 lakh doses of vaccination out of which 50% is Covaxin. The vaccination supply has been regular, so there would be no issue of running the inoculation programs for both regular and teenage populations,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-records-204-cases-in-24-hours-prepares-to-jab-26-5l-teens/articleshow/88530654.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Patna||NITI Aayog report: Bihar second worst on health parameters||PATNA: Bihar has emerged as the second-worst performer, just above Uttar Pradesh, in terms of overall health performance among the larger states in the fourth Health Index released by the NITI Aayog on Monday. Kerala has emerged top among the 19 larger states. Bihar’s index score was 31, a tad better than UP’s 30.57. The maximum index score that a state/UT can achieve is 100 and Kerala scored 82.20. However, in terms of incremental performance, Bihar was placed in the category of larger states which had shown positive results. Still, this was not significant in case of Bihar. The fourth round of the Health Index has taken into account 2019-20 as the reference year and 2018-19 as the base year. While maximum incremental performance was shown by UP with 5.52 points more than the base year, Bihar’s performance has increased by 0.76 points in reference year from the base year. As per the report, the states showing 0.01 to 2.0-point improvement have been placed in the category of least improved, those less than 0 as not improved, those from 2.1 to 4 as moderately improved and those more than 4 as most improved. As per this categorisation, Bihar and four other states fall in the category of least improved. The report said among the 19 larger states, only four improved their rank in reference year from the base year, while 10 states, including Bihar, retained their rank and five states showed a decline in their ranking when compared to the base year. State health minister Mangal Pandey said he would first study the report released by the NITI Aayog and then comment on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/niti-aayog-report-bihar-second-worst-on-health-parameters/articleshow/88530011.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The team had reached Patna on Sunday. On Monday, the team held a meeting with senior officials of the health department for nearly three hours. They also sat at a routine meeting of the health department with all the civil surgeons and directly asked questions from them. One of the officials said the team visited some localities in the city for first-hand experience. The central team is also likely to visit some districts in the state to review Covid situation. “We have apprised the team about the measures being taken to test and vaccinate people. The team was also informed about enforcement of Covid protocols in the state. The central officials were more than satisfied with the steps taken in the state to fight the virus. The state’s oxygen generation capacity has also increased,” health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh said. Central teams have been sent to 10 states, including Bihar, which have either been witnessing increase in the Omicron cases or were performing poorly on vaccination front. As Bihar has so far not registered any Omicron case, the central team is mainly focusing on the vaccination front. Sanjay said they have been given a clear picture of vaccination as well as the eligible beneficiaries who will be inoculated to the central team. Officials said though Bihar has 7.34 crore people above 18 years of age as per the voter list, a door-to-door survey conducted by the health department found that nearly 5.95 crore were living in the state. Another health official said the Centre may have calculated vaccination being done out of total 7.34 crore population, instead of 5.95 being targeted by the state health department.  “By Monday evening, 5.74 crore people had been given the first dose. This shows that over 96% have got the first dose. But when calculation is done taking 7.34 crore calculation into account, only 78% have got the first dose,” the official said, adding the state has reached almost saturation level when it comes to the first dose. He added the Centre has also called for a virtual meeting with all the states on Tuesday to discuss the rolling out of vaccination for teenagers and booster doses for healthcare workers, frontline workers and elderly with comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-19-central-team-holds-meeting-with-bihar-health-officials/articleshow/88530081.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The required land for Corridor II of the project was transferred to Patna Metro Rail Corporation Limited (PMRC) and a no-objection certificate was also acquired from the departments concerned. According to sources, the transfer of 1,340sqm land on Fraser Road is under the process. A PMRC official said there was also a proposal for transfer of 1,277sqm land at Rajendra Nagar railway station. “The land belongs to railways. Danapur cantonment has agreed to give 934sqm land and the proposal is sent to the ministry of defence. Another 76-acre land for the construction of ISBT Patna Metro Rail Depot and ISBT station is being acquired by the district administration. The state government has sanctioned Rs 1,000 crore for land acquisition,” the official added. He said the PMRC was hopeful of getting funds from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) by next month to further expedite the construction work on metro rail project. The construction work on Corridor II between Danapur and Khemnichak will also begin from next year. The Corridor I will be 17.9km long from Danapur to Khemnichack via Mithapur, of which 7.3km will be elevated and 10.5km underground. The Corridor II will be 14.5km from Patna Junction to ISBT (7.9km stretch will be underground and 6.6km elevated). Altogether 25 metro stations will be constructed.

It is around 6.6km long,” the official added. Meanwhile, Asian Development Bank and European Bank have also shown keen interest in providing funds for the construction of Patna metro rail project. The JICA officials, on the other hand, conducted several rounds of meeting with the officials of PMRC recently. The estimated cost of Patna metro project is Rs 13,365 crore, excluding land acquisition cost which will be borne by the state government. According to the agreement, 20% of the project cost will be borne by the state government, 20% by the Centre and the remaining 60% will be borrowed as loan from JICA. So far, the central government has released Rs 424 crore for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-metro-rail-land-made-available-for-corridor-ii/articleshow/88529975.cms||Faryal Rumi

The BJP and HAM(S) functionaries have been at the loggerheads over Manjhi’s recent controversial remark on Brahmins. “If the four HAM(S) MLAs withdraw support from the NDA government in the state, it will automatically fall,” party spokesman Danish Rizwan told mediapersons here while reacting to BJP leader and environment and forest minister Niraj Kumar Singh Babloo’s remark that “the effect of old age was showing on Manjhi.” Babloo had advised Manjhi to live and spend his “remaining years honourably, chanting Ram Ram for the better future of his son Santosh Kumar Suman, who is a minister in the NDA government in the state”. “Manjhi’s remark against the pandits was not right. He is in the NDA and also a senior leader. He was given an opportunity and made CM of the state by Nitish Kumar. He should respect his own age,” Babloo said. Babloo’s remark left Rizwan bristling with anger. “Babloo is also in the NDA. Does he have the courage to question PM Modi who keeps saying ‘ulta-pulta’ things at his public meetings? If the NDA government falls in the state after the withdrawal of support by four HAM(S) MLAs, Babloo will be on the road. He should respect the age and experience of the people like Manjhi,” Rizwan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/if-hams-withdraws-support-govt-will-fall/articleshow/88529991.cms||Abhay Singh

To curb practices of illegal transfer of properties of registered charitable organisations, charity commissioner Y M Shukla has insisted that all sub-registrars across the state will first have to confirm that prior permission has been accorded by the charity commissioner’s offices under the provisions of law. He warned registration officers that if they register any document by trusts without prior permission from the charity commissioner’s office, it would inform the higher-ups about defaulters for action against them. Shukla mentioned in the circular that it has come to his notice that trusts nowadays enter memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with purchasers for transfer of trust properties and a token amount is also accepted. He termed the practice illegal, and stated that such practices are likely to result in litigation. He requested trustees of registered charitable organisations not to indulge in the practice to transferring, leasing or selling properties of trusts through MoUs. The commissioner has stated that the provision of mandatory prior permission is to ensure that a trust’s property is not wasted, and therefore the sub-registrar should first confirm about such prior permission before making any entry relating to properties belonging to registered charitable organisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/charity-commissioners-nod-needed-to-file-trust-papers/articleshow/88531706.cms||---

A bio-bubble is a safe and secure environment isolated from the outside world to minimise the risk of Covid-19 infection and permits entry to authorised persons after testing negative. IIT Kanpur will be hosting convocation this year after organising the ceremony virtually last year. It will be the first time when a convocation will be held in the country in a bio-bubble. The institute got RT-PCR tests done of all the attendees on Monday and will conduct Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) on Tuesday before opening the gate of the convocation venue. IIT-K deputy director, Prof S Ganesh said, “As we are going to organise the 54th Convocation in hybrid mode in the presence of respected dignitaries, it is our duty to ensure everyone’s safety.

Over 60 vaccination centres, mainly in public hospitals and a handful of private facilities, offer Covaxin in the district. The officials are planning to increase the centres by roping in more state and municipal corporation-run hospitals, where Covaxin doses would be made available so that more eligible children could be vaccinated. “According to our latest calculation, about 5.33 lakh children in the 15-18 age group in Pune district are eligible to register on CoWIN and get the shot for free at public hospitals from January 3. For this, we have about 1.89 lakh doses of Covaxin in stock. We only need to expand the centres to avoid overcrowding,” said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region. Besides the eligible children, the officials have to take care of adult vaccination as well. “We shall get more doses of Covaxin from January 1. We shall ensure that those due for the second dose of Covaxin get it on time,” Deshmukh said. A total of 54,133 people in the Pune district received their Covid shots on Monday.

Addressing mediapersons, Pacheco alleged that both the parties have been funded by industrialist Adani, who, he said, has close ties with BJP so as to ensure that that all big infrastructural projects in which he has interests, have a smooth run. “So, indirectly, it is BJP which has brought both these parties to Goa,” Pacheco said. “They haven’t come on their own will. The sole aim is to reduce Congress votes to the extent possible. Today, all major businesses are in the hands of Adani. The BJP government is spending huge amounts of taxpayers’ money on projects which will favour only Adani. Because, if Congress comes to office, all these projects opposed by people will be scrapped. So Adani is helping BJP in curtailing Congress votes by funding these parties.” He further alleged that both AAP and TMC were offering crores of rupees to politicians to join TMC. He claimed that he declined TMC’s offer to join the party. Pacheco further criticised the government for allowing Sunburn festival in the state despite declaring that no permission will be given for it this year. “The festival has begun, and it is attracting huge crowds. Even if 2-3 persons from the crowd are infected, the spread will be difficult to contain. The festival needs to be stopped immediately,” he said. He also came down on the government for processing applications received under amended 16-B of the Town and Country Planning Act as, he said, the matter was now in the court. “The government appears to have given its ministers a free hand to loot, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-tmc-want-to-finish-cong-for-bjps-gain-mickky/articleshow/88554202.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Doctors allege cops thrashed them during protest march, but police deny||NEW DELHI: The Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) of India, which is spearheading a protest over the delay in NEET-PG counselling, on Monday alleged that several doctors who were participating in a march from the Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) campus to the Supreme Court were manhandled and thrashed by police. Police, however, denied the charge. According to the protesting doctors, they were marching from the MAMC campus to the Supreme Court when police stopped them near ITO. “The cops thrashed some of our colleagues and bundled a few others in buses parked at ITO. Is this how they treat the doctors, whom the government hailed as corona warriors just a few months ago,” one of the doctors said. Dr Anuj Aggarwal, general secretary of the Safdarjung RDA, said the police crackdown on a peaceful protest was uncalled for and it would lead to more protests. Police, on the other hand, claimed that they detained 12 people who were protesting at the ITO junction. “They were taken to Rajendra Nagar police station and were later released,” police said. According to police, from 9.30 am, these people were protesting at the ITO junction. “We told them to move from there and tried to pacify them but they did not listen,” an officer said. They continued their protest for five to six hours. Later, they started protesting in both carriageways, which led to traffic snarls. And when policemen started detaining them, they became violent and attacked buses. “About seven policemen were injured during the whole incident,” the officer said. When asked whether they manhandled protesters, police denied the allegation and said they only detained them as per law and no manhandling took place. “They were taken to the police station and were released,” the officer said. Delhi Police later during the day registered an FIR under sections of rioting, causing obstruction in duty of police personnel, damaging public property and disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant at IP Estate police station. The complainant in the case is one of the cops. The doctors also took out a march from Safdarjung Hospital to the union health minister’s residence in the evening. When the cops stopped them again and detained a few, they laid a siege of the Sarojini Nagar police station to demand the release of the doctors who were detained. If a decision is not made on expediting NEET-PG counselling soon, protests may intensify further, sources said. The doctors claim healthcare institutions across the country are running short of an adequate workforce of resident doctors, with no admission in the current academic year yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctors-allege-cops-thrashed-them-during-protest-march-but-police-deny/articleshow/88531618.cms||---

---||Pune||Children aged 15-18 years can log on CoWIN for vaccine from Jan 1||Pune: Children in the 15-18 age group can start registering on CoWIN for their Covid vaccine doses from January 1. CoWIN platform chief R S Sharma told TOI on Monday, “Children born in 2007 and prior can start registering from that date for the vaccine approved for them. For healthcare and frontline workers and 60+ people with comorbidities, appointments on CoWIN will be available a couple of days before January 10, when precaution doses are to start for these groups.” All persons aged 60 years and above with comorbidities, who have received two doses of Covid-19 vaccine, will on doctor’s advice be provided with a precaution dose from January 10, 2022. All modalities on CoWIN for these groups would work similarly as in the past, he said. New users, in this case children aged 15-18 years, will have to first register themselves on CoWIN to avail of the vaccine dose. At the time of registration, they will need to provide their ID proof. A senior official from the ministry of health and family welfare said, “Children in the age group approved for vaccination can use School/college ID while registering in case they do not have Aadhar card.” He added: “Healthcare and frontline workers and people aged 60 years and above with comorbidities will be eligible for the precaution dose upon completing 39 weeks after their second vaccine dose. CoWIN will also have a feature for notifying people about the precaution doses due after the nine month period, via an SMS. Those due for precaution doses will also be able to see the same on their CoWIN accounts once they have completed the nine-month gap.” The official added that CoWIN would start reflecting the 15-18 years age category once registrations for children began. Children will have the options of registering online on CoWIN or offline (at the vaccination centres). On the changes in the vaccination certificate of those taking precaution doses, a senior official with CoWIN told TOI said, “ It has been decided to effect changes in one certificate itself (final certificate issued after the second dose) instead of generating an additional certificate for those availing of the precaution doses. Thus, after the precaution dose is given to a beneficiary, a revised CoWIN certificate will be generated for showing the details of all the doses taken, first, second and third, including the vaccine name, batch numbers, dates when the three doses were taken.” The official said, “CoWIN is capable of seamlessly integrating all the new aspects that come into the vaccination programme including any new Covid vaccine approved in future or additional doses to be monitored.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/children-aged-15-18-years-can-log-on-cowin-for-vaccine-from-jan-1/articleshow/88531619.cms||Neha Madaan

Kalicharan Maharaj had made comments against Gandhi at an event in Chhatisgarh and also praised his assassin Nathuram Godse. Minority affairs minister Nawab Malik demanded that he should be arrested for treason in a discussion in the state assembly on Monday. “This fake guru has insulted the Father of the Nation. Strong action should be taken against him,” said Malik. The BJP also demanded action against him but said that the state government should have acted instead of raising this issue in the state assembly. “Why has the state government not taken action against him till now?” said a minister.

So vote to protect the country,” said the 37-year-old, while addressing a voter awareness campaign in the city. Rani, who is the first woman from Uttar Pradesh to climb the Mount Everest, is the Lucknow ambassador for SVEEP (systematic voter education and electoral participation) and aims to increase voter awareness and participation in the upcoming assembly polls in UP. “While serving in IAF, there was no option for postal ballot. However, things have changed and election commission along with armed forces have ensured that service personnel cast their vote through postal ballot,” said Rani, who was instructor for the first batch of IAF’s women fighter pilots. The campaign was organized by the district administration at 1090 crossing, where district magistrate Abhishek Prakash launched a video for SVEEP awareness and dedicated a ‘selfie point’ depicting the tree of democracy. “In last elections the voting percentage of Lucknow was 57%. This year we will ensure to drastically increase voting,” said Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vote-to-protect-the-nation-mountaineer/articleshow/88532165.cms||---

State minister Aaditya Thackeray, who spoke to the media on the sidelines of the Mumbai University convocation on Monday, said: “People need to stay masked up. The decision regarding school and college will be taken after looking at the situation 15 days from now. This is anyway the holiday season. It is not a great idea to close down campuses. Some students have not seen their school.” During the convocation, chancellor BS Koshiyari credited the Indian diet and people’s habit for playing sports in ensuring that the country did not see a strong second wave. Vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar said a decision had been taken to throw open MU’s historic convocation hall to all colleges to conduct their ceremony. This year’s convocation broke the gender trend of more girl gradu-ates.

---||Goa||Amonkar probe: Bihar woman approaches cops||VASCO: The victim of the alleged sex scandal involving a minister, approached Mormugao police station on Tuesday offering assistance in the investigation against vice-president of Goa Pradesh Congress Committee Sankhalp Amonkar. The victim, who arrived with her advocate at the police station on Tuesday, alleged that Amonkar fraudulently took her mobile handset and other material, and used her for political gimmick. Mormugao police inspector Paresh Naik said that, “We are taking the victim to certain spots to find out whether what she is saying is true or false. She has claimed certain things in her complaint which we are investigating,” Meanwhile, her advocate said that the investigation is based on the complaint filed by the victim in Bihar against Amonkar and others “for exploiting her for political gains”. It was transferred to Mormugao after registering it as ‘zero FIR’ in Bihar. The victim, while speaking to reporters, said that, “Amonkar had threatened to kill my son or kidnap me, and had warned against revealing to anyone that he is exploiting me for political benefits, and rather told me to blame former urban development minister Milind Naik instead. Amonkar has certain belongings of mine, including the cell phone which he fraudulently has taken. I want these things back.” She also claimed that she never had any relationship with Naik, and that he never exploited her. It may be recalled that on November 19, Congress in a press conference had claimed a BJP minister was involved in a sex scandal. Few days later, Congress disclosed the name to the governor and later revealed Naik’s name along with his social media chats and pictures as evidence of exploiting a widow from Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/amonkar-probe-bihar-woman-approaches-cops/articleshow/88554221.cms||---

---||Delhi||Explained: Why Delhi hasn't seen dense fog this December so far||NEW DELHI: For only the third time in 21 years, not a single ‘dense fog’ day, i.e., visibility dropping below 200 metres, has been recorded in the capital so far in December. Before this, Delhi did not see dense fog in December in 2000 and 2009. Track the pollution level in your cityNot just dense fog, IMD data for the Palam monitoring station shows that only one day of moderate fog, i.e., visibility between 200 and 500 metres, has been reported this month — for three hours between 1.30am and 4.30 am on December 17. Shallow fog (visibility between 500 and 1,000 metres) was recorded on 17 days. In contrast, seven dense fog days and 11 moderate fog days were recorded in December last year. Even the average dense fog days in December is 7-10 days with duration lasting to 40 to 50 hours. Moreover, the city has seen 95 hours of fog this month till now, the lowest for December since 1985, when the India Meteorological Department (IMD) started maintaining the record. Before this, the lowest fog duration was in 1985, at 137 hours. Met officials said fog formation has been affected this year by less moisture in the air and large-scale wind patterns. Though the capital has so far recorded 18 fog days in December, it is much lower than normal. According to IMD, usually, the number of fog days for December is 26 with a duration of 280 hours. Read AlsoWhy cloud seeding is no longer being seen as an option to clear Delhi’s airOnce pursued as a viable technical solution that could address Delhi’s pollution woes, the option of cloud seeding seems to have finally been discarded due to certain weather-related restrictions.Explaining the reasons behind low fog formation this December, R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, “Lack of required moisture availability and large-scale wind patterns were not favourable for fog formation. Over 94% moisture is needed for dense fog formation. Besides, western disturbance triggering fog was missing this time.” IMD usually forecasts fog 12-24 hours before its occurrence. As a few days are still left in the month, Met officials said there is less chance of dense fog formation in the next 12 hours. “In view of fresh clouding likely in the forenoon, leading to drizzle on December 28 evening, the morning may have shallow to moderate fog and low clouds with less chance of dense fog,” said Jenamani. According to another senior official who analyses the fog pattern in Delhi, “Many micro meteorology conditions play an important role. If the moisture availability is not sufficient, if the temperature is low and the wind speed is high, it can impact fog formation. Fog is formed when micrometeorological balance is achieved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-weather-vagary-no-dense-fog-this-dec/articleshow/88530774.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||Goa: Shantaram Kolvenkar quits as Ponda civic chief||PONDA: Chairperson of the Ponda Municipal Council (PMC) Shantaram Kolvenkar, who proved BJP’s efforts to dethrone him futile three months ago, resigned from his office on Monday citing personal reasons. He said he has resigned to enable a new person to get elevated to the chairperson’s post. He was in office for the past seven months. Sources said MGP-backed councillor Pradeep Naik is likely to be elected to the post once again. He served as the first chairperson from May 21, 2018 to August 29, 2019. Kolvenkar, who was Ponda BJP block president, had wrested the chairperson’s post on May 18 this year by defeating Ritesh, son of then Ponda MLA Ravi Naik. Irked with this, on September 27, seven BJP-backed members of the council, including deputy chairperson Virendra Dhavalikar and councillors Ritesh, Vishwanath Dalvi, Archana Dangui, Yatish Sawkar, William Aguiar and Anand Naik, had moved a no-trust motion against Kolvenkar after four months in office. However, with no councillor turning up for the October 4 special meeting, the no-trust motion moved against Kolvenkar fizzled out. PMC is a 15-member body. On May 18, Kolvenkar had wrested the post by joining hands with five MGP-backed and two GFP-backed councillors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kolvenkar-quits-as-ponda-civic-chief/articleshow/88554222.cms||---

While four of them are from Kharghar, one is from the old Panvel area. As a preventive measure, the civic body has sealed four residential buildings — three in Kharghar and one in old Panvel — where these five Omicron patients reside. Panvel deputy municipal commissioner Sachin Pawar said, “In Kharghar sector 35, a 46-year-old man who had returned from the US about 10 days ago had tested negative for RTPCR at Mumbai airport. After he went home from the airport, he was isolated at the Kalamboli jumbo covid care centre. As mandated for those returning from Covid at-risk and high-risk countries, we conducted RTPCR test of his wife and 14-year-old daughter too. As the mother-daughter duo tested Covid positive, we sent the nasal swab samples of all three for genome sequencing to detect the Omicron variant. We have been sending such samples to Alibaug laboratory and they are then forwarded to the Pune lab. It is a time-consuming process.” “On Sunday, we obtained the genome sequencing analysis report of the US returnee’s wife and daughter. They tested positive for the Omicron variant. The mother-daughter duo has also been sent to Kalamboli jumbo covid care centre for treatment. But her husband’s genome sequencing report is awaited from the Pune laboratory,” said Pawar said. “The three men, two from sector 5 and 8 in Kharghar and one from old Panvel, also tested negative in the RTPCR tests conducted at the Mumbai airport after they arrived from Dubai and Nigeria 10 days ago. They had travelled to other countries as well. The two men from Kharghar were immediately isolated at the Kalamboli jumbo covid care centre, while the man from old Panvel had isolated himself at Suasth hospital in Kalamboli. Their genome sequencing report came positive for the Omicron variant on Sunday, Pawar added. As four residential buildings have been sealed, the respective society office management have been told to ensure that the patients receive essential commodities during their quarantine period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-spurt-5-omicron-cases-in-kharghar-panvel/articleshow/88532224.cms||George Mendonca
---||Mumbai||50 years on, veteran revisits 1971 Indo-Pak war that cost him an eye||Thankfully, retired brigadier Atmaram Shandil has not seen the 1973 Hindi film ‘Hindustan Ki Kasam’. The various flights — and fights — of imagination in this Raj-Kumar-starrer, which opens with the actor taking a vengeful oath by a crew member’s dead body following an air raid, would likely make the 76-year-old army veteran’s good eye bleed. His right eye had bled itself to darkness in a blast during Operation Cactus Lilly, the opening chapter of the 1971 Indo-Pak war, which had inspired the film. The blast had taken place along the Rajasthan border and had split the military vehicle carrying him into two. On December 14, 2021, exactly 50 years since that day when he had shouted desperate instructions into a radio handset before being heli-lifted to a hospital, the septuagenarian posted his entire experience on the online group of the Nerul complex where he moved after his retirement in 2001. Until then, only around 40 ex-servicemen living in this 500-odd-flat-strong Army Welfare Housing Organisation complex were privy to his biopic-worthy story. J&K-born Shandil was a 26-year-old bachelor still aching from the loss of his mother, when ‘2 Grenadiers’ — the Bangalore unit in which he was an intelligence officer — joined the 1971 war. His mother, too, had contributed to the war efforts by cooking meals for jawans at the Amritsar border. His retired-teacher father and two elder brothers, he says, were not apprehensive about his joining the war. “In fact, they saw my posting as a chance to perform my duty to the nation,” says Shandil, who was a 17-year-old former boy-scout-turned-NCC cadet in Punjab during the Indo-China War of 1962 when he had decided to quit studies and “serve the motherland” . Among the nearly 35 mementos and trophies that he had amassed over a four-decade-long career, is a ‘steel tumbler’ that he was awarded for being the best all-round recruit during his military training in 1963. The tumbler raises a toast to the time he was given out-of-turn promotion as a naik. “Soon, I got my first posting at the headquarters of the Southern Command in Pune, and was even shortlisted for a foreign assignment in Vietnam. But due to my very young age, it was ruled out,” says the veteran, who, in 1969, joined ‘2 Grenadiers’ which boasted war-hardened commanders. On December 4, 1971, the unit joined a ‘special task force’ that had to ensure the restoration of the road-rail link between Munabao and Khokhropa — a link vital for the movement of guns, ammunition and water trains. The task, says Shandil, was accomplished despite frequent attacks. By December 13, though, the unit had run out of rations. Amid heavy shelling, he got the rations replenished. He returned the next morning to find the unit itching for the capture of Pakistan-controlled positions, Naya Chor and South of Parbat Ali. When old maps proved unhelpful, it was Shandil’s keen senses that alerted seniors to a few jungle boot imprints on the side of the sandy track leading to the post. On December 14, he found himself sitting between the battery commander and the commanding officer (CO) in an open Jonga, a military vehicle, following the footprints 50 to 60 km inside Pakistan. When Shandil spotted tall bushes swaying near their destination, the CO applied the brakes. A huge explosion followed. The Jonga was flung four feet high. “It was an anti-tank mine blast; this track was heavily mined by Pakistan,” recalls Shandil, whose right shoulder and eye had bled profusely as he took over the radio handset of a colleague to ask to be heli-lifted to Munabao. Optical illusions haunted him long after his eye was surgically removed. Soon, though, he would resume duty at the same location in Pakistan where he had been injured. Today, it’s the administration’s blind eye that hurts. “The removal of exemption from income tax of the war injury pension had hurt disabled war veterans,” says Shandil. “Thankfully, the decision has been stayed by the Supreme Court so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-50-years-on-veteran-revisits-1971-indo-pak-war-that-cost-him-an-eye/articleshow/88532548.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

Further, all digital copies be kept in safe custody under CCTV cameras with double lock system under proper charge of a responsible officer,” the GCZMA decided at its meeting held on December 10. The formulation of the CZMP for Goa saw widespread protests from villagers across the state. Most villagers objecting to the draft CZMP had said that the inputs sent by their respective panchayats had not been incorporated in the draft plan. The first public hearing held to receive objections and suggestions from the public was also faced with protests. The hearing process itself was then challenged before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). This led to a fresh hearing being ordered by the tribunal and held on July 7 this year, where objections and suggestions were taken from the public through the physical and the virtual mode as also in writing. These inputs will now be digitised and stored under CCTV surveillance. The NGT has set December 31, 2021, as the deadline for Goa to complete its CZMP. The GCZMA had allotted the work to different state departments of carrying out ground truthing and verification of the various objections and suggestions received from the public. The inputs have already been sent to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai, which is incorporating the inputs into Goa’s CZMP. “One of the comments of the fisheries department is that there are no reports/scientific studies in respect of fish breeding areas hence the authority recommends the NCSCM that such areas depicted as fish breeding areas in the draft CZMP may be depicted as fishing zones. This may be incorporated in the final draft CZMP,” the GCZMA has decided. Data on demarcation of mangroves, khazan lands and sand dunes has also been submitted to the NCSCM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/public-suggestions-on-draft-coastal-plan-to-be-digitised-kept-under-surveillance/articleshow/88553705.cms||---

The district health department has taken up all measures to break the chain. Our officials and staff have been monitoring the village and collecting samples from all the contacts. None of them has an interstate and international travel history, but the visit of a relative may be the reason for the infection,” he said.District surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh said: “We have been conducting RT-PCR tests on all their primary and secondary contacts in the area.

Union Ministry for Jal Shakti secretary, Pankaj Kumar, will conduct a review via video-conference with chief secretaries of AP and Telangana on Tuesday. In a communication sent to the chief secretary, Dr Sameer Sharma, Pankaj Kumar said the progress of the implementation of the provisions in gazette notification was not satisfactory. He said no state has deposited seed money of Rs 200 crore each to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) even after lapse of five months. The Centre had issued gazette notification by taking over the control of all the key installations on irrigation projects and power stations on Krishna and Godavari rivers in AP and Telangana on July, 14, 2021. The Centre made it clear that the notification would come into force from October 14. It directed both states to comply with the provisions of the gazette notifications within six days of the issuance of the notification and handover all the projects 30 days prior to the enforcement of the gazette. The state government had argued that inclusion of projects which do not share common interest between AP and Telangana would complicate the implementation of the gazette notification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/centre-to-review-mgmt-of-river-boards/articleshow/88529994.cms||Samdani MN
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Man awarded death penalty for rape, murder acquitted||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has acquitted a man who was awarded death penalty in the rape and murder of a minor, saying that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.  While rejecting the reference for affirmation of death sentence and allowing the appeal of Nazil against the order of his conviction and sentence, a division bench comprising Justice Manoj Misra and Justice Sameer Jain set aside the judgment and order of the trial court. Besides, the high court acquitted the appellant Nazil of all the charges for which he was tried and convicted. The high court directed to release the appellant from jail forthwith unless wanted in any other case.  Delivering this judgment dated December 12, the court observed, “In the present case, we find that the prosecution evidence has failed to prove the incriminating circumstances of the deceased being last seen alive with the appellant and the recovery beyond the pale of doubt, and there is no medical / forensic evidence to demonstrate that there was presence of semen or blood stain of the appellant on the clothes of the deceased or on her body.” The court held that all orifices and organs of the body of the victim were missing and there was nothing to incriminate the accused for rape except the confessional statement made by him before police which is not admissible.  Unfortunately, the trial court failed to test the reliability and credibility of the prosecution evidence and has accepted the prosecution evidence as gospel truth, which is not the requirement of law, the court added.  The court was hearing an appeal filed by Nazil, convicted by a trial court on December 13, 2019, and awarded capital punishment for allegedly raping a minor and murdering her. He was convicted by the court of the additional sessions judge, fast track court (crime against women)/ special judge, POCSO Act, Rampur for offences punishable under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 376AB (punishment for rape of woman under 12 years of age) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 of the POCSO Act.  As per prosecution’s case, the deceased, aged six years at the time, had gone out to fetch curd on May 7, 2019, but did not return and despite a hectic search, could not be found. More than a month later, her partially-decomposed body was found from a semi-built house on June 22, 2019.  The appellant was later arrested for the crime after an encounter.  The counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial court had not tested the prosecution evidence and without putting the same to scrutiny, accepted the prosecution evidence as the gospel truth. According to him, such a decision is no decision in the eyes of the law, and evidence of the deceased being last seen alive with the appellant is unacceptable and completely unreliable.

With the state government imposing night curfew from 10pm to 5am from December 28, the district has intensified interstate border surveillance. Strict surveillance will be in place at all interstate border entry points in Dakshina Kannada to prevent partygoers from crossing borders during the year-end. Meanwhile, all Yakshagana performances, Kambala and religious ceremonies have been asked to wind up before 10pm. Deputy commissioner KV Rajendra said the district administration will implement night curfew effectively from December 28. “All events held during nights including Kambala, Yakshagana and religious programmes must be stopped before 10pm. There will be no relaxation in this restriction. Organisers of all programmes and events have been directed to follow the guidelines related to night curfew strictly. The government has ordered night curfew in the wake of an increase in Omicron cases,” the DC said. District nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Ashok H and district surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh, who have been given the responsibility of border surveillance, said all measures are in place to check interstate commuters. “Samples are collected randomly at the border entry points in Sullia, Puttur, Bantwal and Talapady. Though the number of daily cases in the district has fallen considerably, we have been continuing border surveillance,” he added. Udupi deputy commissioner M Kurma Rao said DJs, orchestras, dance programmes and other entertainment are not allowed during night curfew at clubs, bars, pubs, restaurants and public places. Those who celebrate New Year should not use public places like roads, parks and playgrounds. Only those who have taken two doses of the vaccine should be allowed in pubs, bars, restaurants and other public places. 19 new cases in DK, Udupi Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts reported 19 new Covid-19 cases on Monday. Dakshina Kannada had 12 cases with a test positivity rate of 0.2%. As many as 18 persons were discharged and the district has 145 active cases. Seven new cases were reported in Udupi and the district has 50 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/more-curbs-on-borders-ahead-of-ny-celebrations/articleshow/88530005.cms||---

The purpose of the bank is to make sure every baby receives human milk as early as possible. Dr Durgaprasad MR, medical superintendent of the hospital, told TOI the bank is being built with the support of Rotary Club Mangaluru through a global grant project at the cost of Rs 45 lakh. “The objective is to provide low birth-weight premature babies, infants whose mothers are unable to provide sufficient milk and babies separated from mothers due to many reasons with breast milk from the bank that will be accepted only after testing for any kind of infection. This will help in reducing the risk of infections and boost their immunity.” Archie Menezes from Rotary club along with paediatrician Dr Shantaram Baliga took special interest in the project that is currently in its implementing stage and is likely to begin operations by February. The human milk bank will come up next to the NICU and RMO Dr Balakrishna Rao has been appointed as the nodal officer along with a panel of obstetricians, staff nurses and counsellors. The club is in talks with Dr Sreenath to impart training to the staff once the equipment is installed. The hospital has also submitted a request to the district administration and the state government to appoint full-fledged staff, Dr Durgaprasad said. “Once the human milk bank is established, the next big challenge is to encourage donors. Mothers should voluntarily come forward to donate milk. Hence, an awareness drive is being planned with women NGOs, self-help groups, department of woman and child development, anganwadi and Asha workers to spread awareness and in turn help reduce neonatal deaths at this tertiary referral centre that records an average of about 750 deliveries per month,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/human-milk-bank-at-lady-goschen-hosp-to-begin-ops-from-feb/articleshow/88530010.cms||---

The companies that have reduced MRP of edible oils include Adani Wilmar, Ruchi Soya, Emami, Gemini and Gokul Agro, the trade body said in a statement on Monday. To provide some succour to consumers, Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey had called a meeting of industry leaders a few days ago and requested them to respond positively to the reduction in import duties that the government had announced. “We are happy to share that our leading members have responded proactively and reduced the MRP on edible oils marketed by them, across the board, by 10% to 15%, to provide relief to consumers during the festival season,” the association added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/edible-oil-producers-cut-prices-by-10-to-15-sea/articleshow/88530816.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Kayaking in mangroves introduced at Saligrama||Udupi: In an attempt to introduce the scenic backwaters of Udupi district to tourists, as they paddle down the backwaters of Seethanadi river at Saligrama, kayaking in the mangroves was introduced recently. Mithun Kumar Mendon and Lokesh Mendon from Kodi, who are friends and business partners through Sails and More Adventures, launched this initiative.The backwaters of Kerala have been open for tourist activities for several years, but it is yet to pick up in Karnataka. Kayaking amidst the mangroves is definitely a new experience for the tourists of Udupi. The starting point is near the Saligrama Parampalli bridge, and one can paddle for nearly two hours for Rs 300, while it is free for children who are below 10.Mithun said, “Enthusiasts have already explored several kayaking spots in the state, but this stretch with mangroves on either side is unique. It is amazing when the Sun’s rays penetrate through the mangroves, and birds chirp, making the expedition memorable. One does not need to be an expert to do kayaking. One needs to follow the instructions that are given for the first 15 minutes, and we have observed that by the time people return, many would have mastered the technique. All safety measures are in place, and wearing life jackets is mandatory,” he said.The team has eight kayaks, and the instructors also travel along with the tourists. Kayaking is open between 7am to 7pm . “The other advantage is the depth. It is one of the safest routes. Even during the high tide, the depth does not cross 5 ft. The demand is already picking up for kayaking, and tourists who visit the temple town are reaching out to us. Most of the tourists who visit us are from Bengaluru, Kerala and Tamil Nadu,” Mithun said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kayaking-in-mangroves-introduced-at-saligrama/articleshow/88530017.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Delhi||AQI improves to ‘poor’ from ‘severe’ in a day due to light rain||New Delhi: After staying in the ‘severe’ category for the past six days, Delhi’s air quality improved to the ‘poor’ category on Monday due to light rain and other meteorological factors. On Sunday evening, the city saw an average of 3 mm rainfall, while Ayanagar recorded maximum rainfall at 6mm. The air quality, however, is likely to drop slightly due to poor ventilation conditions over the next two days. According to Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) on Monday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 285 as against 459 a day earlier and 431 on Saturday. The national capital had been suffering ‘severe’ air quality since December 21 as an active western disturbance led to drop in the wind speed, rise in humidity. These factors were responsible for poor ventilation and accumulation of pollutants. According to India Meteorological Department, the national capital is likely to see ‘light’ to ‘very-light’ rainfall on December 28 evening. On Monday, the city recorded maximum and minimum temperatures of 22.6 degrees Celsius and 10 degrees Celsius, respectively. According to IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 22 and 10 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Tuesday along with rain or thundershower towards the second half of the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-improves-to-poor-from-severe-in-a-day-due-to-light-rain/articleshow/88530830.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Farmers in Vijaywada busy sowing paddy despite advice||VIJAYAWADA: Despite the directions of the district administration not to cultivate paddy during Rabi season, many farmers in Krishna delta region have started sowing paddy. While authorities are eyeing to start a campaign on promoting alternative crops, farmers are busy sowing paddy for the second crop. The Krishna has received copious amounts of water during monsoon. Around 120 tmc water was released into Bay of Bengal from Prakasam Barrage in 2021. Despite the huge flood, officials estimated that they will face difficulty in providing continuous water for the Delta during the second crop season. The irrigation department took a decision to repair the broken gate at Pulichintala Project and also for the construction of a new bridge on the Krishna and a dozen of bridges on three major irrigation canals in the Delta. Considering various factors which lead to water shortage, the district collector, J Nivas, in the first week of December announced that farmers should go for alternate crops in place of paddy. The collector directed the agriculture authorities to conduct a series of awareness campaigns at 760 Raithu Bharosa centers in the district. The agriculture department suggested the farmers to grow black gram, green gram, groundnuts as summer crop for this season but did not organise any campaign in villages. While authorities are busy procuring the seeds of alternative crops, many farmers in the Delta region started ploughing and preparatory works for sowing paddy. Many farmers at Nidamanuru, Poranki, Mudinepalli, Gudivada, Avanigadda regions had already started paddy sowing works. Farmers associations are unhappy with the situation as farmers who have sowed paddy would end up in losses due to scarcity of water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmers-busy-sowing-paddy-despite-advice/articleshow/88530019.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Delhi||Delhi air cleaner this year than pre-lockdown 2019||NEW DELHI: This year has fared better than 2019 as far as the capital’s air quality is concerned. AQI was between 201 and 500 (poor category or worse) on 164 days in 2021, compared to 183 days in 2019. Till December 27, there were 197 days when AQI was in good, satisfactory and moderate categories, i.e., between 0 and 200. Track the pollution level in your cityThe year 2020 had seen 139 days with AQI in the 201-500 range, but it was cleaner mainly on account of the lockdown. So far this year, Delhi has seen 24 ‘severe’ — six in January, 11 in November and seven in December. It has recorded 62 ‘very poor’ and 78 ‘poor’ days. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows the number of days with AQI between 201 and 500 have reduced over the years and those with AQI of 0-200 have gone up. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “It is already evident from CPCB data that the long-term PM2.5 curve has bent in Delhi. Also, the days in ‘satisfactory’ and ‘poor’ categories are increasing annually. Despite this improvement, the annual average concentration of PM2.5 still requires substantial reduction — close to 60% — to meet the clean air standards. Only round-the-year sustained action on sources can reduce the overall base pollution in Delhi-NCR and prevent ‘severe’ episodes during winter.” VK Soni, head, environment and research centre, India Meteorological Department, said, a season-wise analysis should be done of the past five years to draw a pattern. “The air quality deteriorated in November and December as fewer number of rain days were observed.” Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said, “Our air quality is mostly dependent on meteorological factors like wind speed and humidity. They are the driving force behind dilution and disposal of pollutants. This year, extended rain has reduced the number of bad days.” He added, “Disturbances in the south-east and west made the air quality poor in December this year. It is necessary to cut down emissions from all sectors to improve air quality.” According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality of the capital is likely to remain in the ‘poor’ category for the remaining days of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-cleaner-this-yr-than-pre-lockdown-2019/articleshow/88530821.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Chandigarh||Gagandeep, woman friend spent time in Khanna hotel||Ludhiana: Gagandeep Singh, key suspect in Ludhiana blast case who died in the explosion at district courts on Thursday, had spent time with a woman in a Khanna hotel two days before his death. However, police are not sure if it was connected to preparation for the blast. Requesting anonymity, a police officer said Gagandeep and his female friend had booked a room at the hotel near Samrala Chowk in Khanna for a day but stayed only for a few hours on Tuesday. Gagandeep had given his Aadhar card to the hotel staff as identity proof. The CCTV footage from the hotel showed the pair enter the said hotel at around 10am and leaving around 1pm. Khanna police have handed over the footage to the agencies probing the case. The same officer said the investigations showed that it was not unusual for Gagandeep to go to different hotels to spend time with his woman friend. However, there seemed to be no role of the friend (a policewoman) beyond the fact that she was in relation with him. “It is unlikely that she knew about the Gagandeep’s plan to carry out blast,” the officer added. Another officer, also seeking anonymity, said another CCTV footage from the bus stand area suggested that Gagandeep was alone and was carrying a black bag on the Thursday morning. He added that they were tracing the cameras between Khanna and Ludhiana to ascertain how did he reach Ludhiana. Police also said that Gagandeep had given Rs 1 lakh to his wife a day before the blast. Investigators are seeking bank account details to learn about other transactions and follow the money trail. They are also trying to find out if some anti-national elements sent him some money for carrying out blast. Investigators are also looking into cellphones data of the two cellmates of Gagandeep from Ludhiana central jail to look for more clues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gagandeep-woman-friend-spent-time-in-khanna-hotel/articleshow/88532253.cms||Shariq Majeed

Assistant director veterinary department (in-charge) Dr Nithin Prabhu has ensured that his farm is a zero-fodder wastage farm. Dr Nithin told TOI, “This is a model farm in terms of adoption of technology. Our family has always been into dairy farming, but we took it to the next level towards the end of 2018. The pandemic turned out to be a blessing, as my brother Naren Prabhu, a software engineer, is working from home and is managing the farm during his free time. We currently have 22 cows of five breeds that produce an average of 50-60 litres of milk per day,” he said. Out of the interest of keeping different breeds of cows at the farm, they have Holstein Friesian, Jersey, Gir, Malnad Gidda and Deoni cross breed. “To ensure that there is zero fodder wastage, we grow a variety of hybrid napier grass on a two-acre land. With the help of a chaff cutter, the stem and leaf are chopped and given to the cattle, so that everything is consumed by the cow and the fibre availability in the diet is completely met. I have developed a formula for concentrate feeding. Meanwhile, machines are used for milking,” he said. Due to the hectic schedule, Dr Prabhu has not been able to spend much time at the farm. The farm is looked after by his family members including Naren, his wife Parul and Dr Nithin’s wife Nirmala. On a few occasions, training programmes were also held at the farm for self-help group members and NGOs. Although milk from the farm is purchased locally in the neighbourhood, a majority is procured by a milk producers cooperative society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/veterinary-officer-develops-model-dairy-farm-in-sullia/articleshow/88530024.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The ‘precaution doses’ (boosters) for health and frontline workers, as well as those above 60 with co-morbidities, will begin on January 10. Vaccination for children aged 15-18 will begin on January 3. The roll-out is not going to be difficult, said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary. An estimated 20% of the state’s adult population falls in the bracket of 60+ years.  State immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai said that 91% of frontline and 90% of healthcare workers have taken both doses, but not many are likely to qualify immediately for the booster shot, which will be given 39 weeks after the second dose. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC is geared up to vaccinate an estimated 9lakh teens, 11 lakh senior citizens and 3lakh frontline and healthcare workers. The city has 451 vaccination centres to support the upcoming drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-maharashtra-states-to-discuss-booster-shots-in-online-meet/articleshow/88532270.cms||---

The formal inauguration of the unit located at the Koraga Colony in Padebettu village in Kaup was held recently. Udupi zilla panchayat CEO Naveen Bhat Y has assured to help the women SHG by asking government departments to buy chikki. “Serve chikki instead of biscuits at zilla panchayat meetings. Till the group formally ties up with anganwadis, for all zilla panchayat meetings, chikki prepared by these women will be purchased, thus helping them in base level marketing. He also requested the gram panchayats and taluk panchayats to procure chikki from the Koraga women and serve during meetings. MLA Lalaji Mendon said that this is an attempt to help Koraga women. Prabhakar Achar, district programme manager, NRLM, said that six women were trained last year, and the unit has been set up at a cost of Rs 6.9 lakh, through the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) and the local panchayat. There is a good demand for chikki. Now that the government departments will procure the same, based on the demand, and we plan to upgrade with installation of machinery, he said. The women who produce the chikki are between 30-40 years. They had come together to form Sri Subrahmanya Sanjeevini Self Help Group, that was later merged with Sanjeevini-Karnataka State Rural Livelihood Promotion Society, a government agency implementing the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) programme in the state. Currently, they are producing around 10 kg of chikki every day. Meanwhile, Koraga women in Byndoor will soon start producing areca plates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/chikki-to-replace-biscuits-at-official-meetings-to-support-koraga-women/articleshow/88530040.cms||---

The traffic movement towards Konkan and Goa has been severely hampered due to the bad condition of roads in the important ghat sections. The pothole-riddled road in Amboli ghat used to reach Sawantwadi and Goa, Amba ghat for Ganpatipule and Ratnagiri, Karul Ghat for Vaibhavwadi and Devgad, Phonda Ghat for Kankavli- Malvan, Anuskura ghat for Rajapur are causing a traffic delay of almost an hour. The current condition of the roads in the ghat section is such that they resemble dirt tracks with no tar road at all. Pravin Bane, who was travelling in Karul ghat, said that they had travelled to Malwan using the Phonda ghat but the road was in such bad shape that they decided to seek an alternative for their return journey. “We decided to try Karul ghat route via Gagan Bawda while returning but this turned out to be a nightmare. Karul ghat has no road at all. It’s almost like an off-road driving experience. The road has potholes of two to three feet and the car has already got hit four times due to deep potholes in the ghat section,” he said. Similar situation is faced by travellers in Amboli ghat. Prashant Sonawane, who was travelling from Pune to Goa, said, “After wasting half hour for the negative Covd test check post at Kognoli toll plaza, the road from Ajara town of Kolhapur district towards Amboli and Sawantwadi was pathetic. There are huge potholes on the road leading to the ghat. It is a frustrating experience to drive on such roads. If the government is collecting road taxes and hefty toll amounts, then why can’t they provide good roads?” In last week, a truck overturned over a tempo traveller in the Karul ghat section while trying to avoid a huge pothole. Five women from Pune were injured. The pathetic condition of ghat roads is also affecting daily life of the citizens. Most of the vegetables from Kolhapur APMC goes to parts of Sindhudurg district and with poor condition of roads in Karul ghat and Phonda ghat, the vegetable carrying vehicles get late by around two hours; thus affecting the freshness of the vegetables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/ghats-to-konkan-goa-in-bad-shape-post-rain/articleshow/88529292.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Why cloud seeding is no longer being seen as an option to clear Delhi’s air||NEW DELHI: Once pursued as a viable technical solution that could address Delhi’s pollution woes, the option of cloud seeding seems to have finally been discarded due to certain weather-related restrictions. Track the pollution level in your cityCloud seeding — a weather-modification technology to help create rain to achieved different goals, including improving the air quality — was being pursued a few years back by government agencies with the help of different institutes, including IIT-Kanpur. The technology, used by China to control its pollution situation, is however now off the shelf, even as scientists continue to back it for different applications, including defence and addressing draught. According to a document from the Central Pollution Control Board, obtained through an RTI application filed by Noida-based activist Amit Gupta, weather conditions, such as low moisture levels in the capital during the winter, are unsupportive of cloud seeding and, thus, “the project was not further taken up”. “In India, the cloud-seeding experiments are limited to convective clouds during the monsoon season. During winter, the clouds are mostly exacted with western disturbances. The widespread fog occurs after the passage of western disturbances. Generally, the moisture in the air is too less during winter in northern India, which limits the scope of cloud seeding. The potential pre-existing clouds are needed to carry out the seeding process. This limits the scope of cloud seeding during winter to bring rain and disperse the smoke,” the CPCB reply stated,, asserting that the decision was based on the views obtained from the India Meteorological Department. Western disturbances is a flow of high moisture winds and clouds from the Mediterranean Sea to the Himalayas. During winters, Delhi often receives northwesterly winds, which are cold and dry. However, there are also instances of western disturbances when the wind speed changes to easterly or southeasterly, leading to a rise in moisture. According to Sachchida Nand Tripathi from IIT-Kanpur who, in 2018, led the project at experimental levels with help of HAL and other organisations, cloud seeding must be pursued. “We made efforts in 2018 and conducted a few experiments. We had also obtained a small aircraft from Isro to experiment in Delhi, But then, there were some unfulfilling pre-requisites for seeding in Delhi, so it was dropped. Then, experiments were proposed using a bigger aircraft from HAL in 2019 in Uttar Pradesh, but it was dropped due to certain reasons. Later, the Covid wave hit the nation,” said Tripathi, head of the civil engineering department at IIT-K. Requesting anonymity, another official said that the experiment was dropped in 2019 due to lack of “financial support”. According to Tripathi, however, cloud seeding must not be turned down just because of the weather of Delhi and should be explored as a technological advancement on the lines of China. “Cloud seeding needs to be pursued as it has other applications. India has several draught-hit areas like in Bundelkhand in UP and elsewhere in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The technology also has strategic applications like for defence purposes. Over the past decade, many countries, especially China, havemastered it,” Tripathi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-cloud-seeding-is-no-longer-being-seen-as-an-option-to-clear-delhis-air/articleshow/88530860.cms||Kushagra Dixit

When will SP, BJP and BSP react?” he asked. The entire country is watching the silent politics of parties. The Dharam Sansad was held with total support of BJP in Uttarakhand, he said. Owaisi said the silence of political parties is exposing their true colours. They are not talking about Haridwar Dharma Sansad as they fear losing the majority votebank, he said and added: “But here the matter is more serious than just vote-bank politics, as a call has been given for genocide of Muslims. They should react.” Unless leaders who gave the call for genocide are arrested and a ban is imposed on all organisations which participated in it under UAPA and other Acts, such incidents cannot be stopped, the Hyderabad MP said. Though Owaisi blamed Congress too for maintaining silence on the issue, both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi had condemned and demanded stringent action against those who gave hate speeches in Dharma Sansad. On BJP, SP and BSP trying to woo the Brahmin community and other sections in Uttar Pradesh, Owaisi said the common factor among all these parties is that they are working hard to get the support of all except the Muslim community which comprises 19% of total population in UP. “This is exactly what the AIMIM is trying to tell Muslims that they have been left as orphans by these political parties. There is no value of Muslim votes. These political parties will realise the value of Muslim votes only when the minority community develops their own political leadership. Muslims should realise that political parties such as BJP, SP and BSP would never want Muslim leadership to develop and the AIMIM is working hard to expose them,” the Hyderabad MP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/owaisi-break-silence-on-dharma-sansad/articleshow/88530864.cms||Roushan Ali

Speaking to TOI, the bhojanmata, who has studied uptill class 8, said that “nobody has approached me with a job proposal yet but if such an offer comes my way, I will only consider moving out of Uttarakhand if it is a permanent government position as I won’t be able to survive in Delhi or take care of my children with the meagre income of a bhojanmata.” Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, Gautam had said, “Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami should have taken immediate cognisance of the matter and ensured justice to the woman. He should now issue an apology.” He had thereafter invited Devi to “come to Delhi where our government will provide her a job as a cook.” When asked if she has filed a police complaint against the school authorities for sacking her, Devi said, “I have not yet approached police with a complaint but I might do so if justice is not delivered.” She added that it was not the first time when she faced caste discrimination. “In our village, people from upper castes don’t come to our houses and don’t allow us in their houses as well. There is sharp division along caste lines.” Notably, Devi had joined the school, which has a student strength of 230, as bhojanmata on December 13 but the very next day, several upper caste students refused to eat the meal cooked by her. Later, the chief education officer of the district, RC Purohit, after reviewing the matter, termed her appointment as illegal, and dismissed her. However, on Saturday, 23 Dalit students of the school came out in support of Devi. To protest her removal, they boycotted the mid-day meal cooked by her replacement, a woman from upper caste, and instead got their own lunch from home. The same day, Prem Singh, principal of the school, wrote a letter to the block education officer, apprising him of the entire episode. Later in the day, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami constituted an inquiry in the matter. The district magistrate of Champawat thereafter formed a panel headed by the chief education officer of the district to enquire into the matter. The panel’s members are expected to submit a report on the termination of Devi’s employment shortly.“A lot of people are reaching out to me now. They tell me I will get justice. As of now, I am just waiting for the inquiry to end,” added Devi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/delhi-minister-offers-job-to-dalit-cook-who-was-removed-from-school-after-upper-caste-students-refused-food-made-by-her/articleshow/88530058.cms||Gaurav Talwar

They alleged that state BJP leaders were resorting to political drama in the name of ‘nirudyoga deeksha’. Addressing a press conference, minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav and MLAs Mutha Gopal and Kaleru Venkatesh said the BJP in its manifesto announced that it would provide employment to two crore youth a year, but it turned out to be a big joke. Leaders described the unemployment protest as a publicity stunt. Minister dared state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay to tell which BJP-ruled state had been implementing the schemes such as 24x7 free power to farmers and other welfare schemes on the lines of Telangana. He also condemned allegations against CM and his family. “Family members were democratically elected by the people and nominated by the government,” Srinivas said. He said that the state government had not only filled up vacancies but also providing employment opportunities in private sector too.

---||Mumbai||Dual RT-PCR plan: First with regular kit, then S-gene drop in Mumbai||Pune/Nagpur: The Union health ministry has advised states to adopt a dual RT-PCR testing strategy prior to genome sequencing of Covid samples for Omicron detection. Under the new plan, suspected patients’ throat/nasal swab samples will be tested using a standard RT-PCR kit and, if detected positive, the same sample will undergo a second test with an imported RT-PCR kit with an S-gene drop. “Only those samples showing positive for S-gene drop-out or S-gene target failure (SGTF) will be genomically sequenced for Omicron. Besides cost-cutting, it will also help in picking up the highly probable Omicron cases and save resources,” a senior Union health ministry official told TOI on Monday. The Maharashtra government is among the first to have already started implementing the dual test strategy. Quite a few districts with high floating populations have already received the imported kits. “The cost of genome sequencing goes up to Rs5,000 per sample in India, including the transport, human resource, and other heads,” the official said, adding that whereas the cost of a standard RT-PCR kit and imported RT-PCR kit with SGTF is Rs19 and Rs240, respectively. The dual RT-PCR costs Rs260. Besides testing individuals with international travel history and their close contacts, these kits can also be used at government-run laboratories for routine Covid tests to rule out community spread from daily caseload having high viral load or below 25 cycle threshold (CT) value. Twenty-three of 60 Covid-positive samples have so far tested positive for S-gene drop-out in Nagpur. Instead of sequencing all 60 samples, these 23 samples are being prioritised. The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at Nagpur’s Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital — one of the key sentinel centres in Maharashtra — is carrying out the second RT-PCR test for SGTF prior to sending the samples for sequencing. Nagpur’s second confirmed Omicron patient, a 21-year-old who returned from Dubai, was the first whose throat/nasal swab sample when tested twice with RT-PCR kit showed the SGTF. The sample was later genomically sequenced to confirm the presence of the Omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dual-rt-pcr-plan-first-with-regular-kit-then-s-gene-drop-in-mumbai/articleshow/88532282.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt’s changed stand on quota upsets Muslim leaders||MUMBAI: The state government’s volte-face on reservation for Muslims has left the community leaders fuming. Responding to the renewed demand for a 5% Muslim quota in education, state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said in the assembly on Thursday that the state government cannot proceed with Muslim reservation unless the quota limit is extended beyond 50%. Putting the ball in the Centre’s court, Malik said: “We have asked the Centre for the right to extend the quota limit beyond 50%. This will clear the path for reservation for Marathas and Muslims,” said Malik. The community leaders feel that the change in the stand of the government on Muslim reservation flies in the face of the Congress-NCP combine’s avowed stand as they had arranged for 5% reservation to Muslims in jobs and education through an ordinance in 2014. “The masses are being misguided that the reservation demand is on religious grounds. The Congress-NCP government had given a 5% quota to 50 socially and educationally identified classes among Muslims. The reservation was on socio-economic backwardness and not on a religious basis. This is part of our election manifesto too,” said Congress MLA Amin Patel. Community leaders said that instead of trying to find excuses that the Muslim reservation cannot be given as the Supreme Court’s order prohibits the government from extending the quota beyond 50%, the government should at least give 5% quota to Muslims in education which was allowed by the Bombay High Court. “Who stops the state government from giving Muslims 5% reservation in education?,” asked Pune-based educationist P A Inamdar. He said that the state government is dragging its feet on the issue of Muslim reservation because it doesn’t want to annoy the Marathas the quota for whom was not approved by the Supreme Court. M A Khalid of All India Milli Council said that the justification for Muslim reservation is in several reports that found Muslims educationally and economically backward. “Both Sachar and Mahmoodur Rahman Committees had recommended quota for Muslims as a way to improve their lot,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-govts-changed-stand-on-quota-upsets-muslim-leaders/articleshow/88532590.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The tanker which was transporting over 17 tonnes of LPG from HPCL-Visakha refinery to IOC plant overturned near the IOC-LPG bottling plant at Parawada around 5.30 am. The incident took place when the driver tried to park the vehicle near the plant as there were some other tankers inside the plant at the time. Police said the leakage started when the authorities tried to lift the tanker with the help of a crane. While they were lifting the tanker around afternoon, the vehicle developed a small hole and the LPG started to leak. People living in nearby areas were asked to leave as a precautionary measure. Speaking to TOI, inspector of Parawada, P Eswar Rao, said fire and rescue service personnel and a technical team from the IOC rushed to the spot and managed to prevent fire by continuously spraying water. “After ardours efforts, the tanker was separated from the engine part of the vehicle and shifted to the plant around 2 pm.

---||Kolhapur||Growth of ‘Ranmodi’ needs to be controlled: Botanist||Kolhapur: City-based botanist Dr Madhukar Bachulkar has said that haphazard growth of Siam weed — scientific name Chromolaena odorata, which is called Ranmodi in Marathi — is one of the reasons behind wild animals leaving the forest area in search of food. This invasive species, considered one of the most harmful weeds on earth, can be easily found spread across the forests of Kolhapur district and is known to prevent the growth of other plant specie, resulting in scarcity of fodder for wild animals like Indian gaurs (bisons). Bachulkar and environmentalists Uday Gaikwad and Anil Chougale have raised their objections against the growth of this species with the forest department and state government, seeking its removal before the weed destroys the forest. Bachulkar, while talking about this invasive weed species, said, “Ranmodi is encroaching the forest lands due to which few specific species of Karvi, grass, shrubs and trees that are food for bison and other herbivores are getting scarce day by day. Even though food for these animals is available today, the rate in which the invasive species is preventing other plants from growing is a serious threat and will create trouble in future. There is a need to remove this species scientifically as when it’s dry it can also act as fuel for wild fire. This plant species as it is exotic has no enemies here due to which it grows very fast.” He added, “In the last two decades, wild animals are coming to urban areas as they are facing scarcity of food, water in their habitat and due to which man-animal conflict has increased. The plant species can be extensively found in Radhanagari-Dajipur wildlife sanctuary grown as weed and also as a climber. Taking help from students and the locals, this invasive species needs to be destroyed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/growth-of-ranmodi-needs-to-be-controlled-botanist/articleshow/88529321.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Dehradun||3 more cases of Omicron in U’khand, tally now 4||Dehradun: Uttarakhand has recorded three new cases of Omicron variant of Coronavirus - two in Dehradun and one in Haridwar. An elderly couple - male (74) and female (65) - who had recently attended a family function where they met their Omicron variant positive son, daughter-in-law and grandson in Delhi have been infected. While a Yemeni national who was suspected to be carrying Omicron in Roorkee, Haridwar, is also positive. Earlier, a woman who had returned from Scotland to Kanwali had tested positive. Among the four Omicron cases in the state, one returned from abroad, second was a foreign national and two had come in contact with foreign travellers, the director general of health department, Dr Tripti Bahuguna, said. The sample results of over half a dozen people are awaited. It includes the help deployed at elderly couple’s flat and the parents of the state’s first Omicron case. The woman had returned to Dehradun from Delhi in a car with her parents. Local residents along with health authorities are a worried lot as there is still no requirement of the mandatory RT-PCR report while travelling to the hill state, and there are no restrictions on the crowd for political rallies, wedding parties or public gatherings. “The only solution is to check each and every traveller’s RT-PCR report and get them registered in the respective district’s portal. Random sampling will not help our state, especially when we have snow season and people are in the mood to celebrate outdoors in the mountains,” said a senior doctor from the health department. Secretary of health department, Dr Pankaj Pandey, has alerted all the district magistrates to form district-level teams comprising administration, police and health department officials to ensure that all the isolation, quarantine and containment centres-related works are executed well within the proper time frame. The Uttarakhand government placed a night curfew from Monday onwards following restrictions by several other states. So far, 19 states have recorded 578 cases of Omicron, out of which 151 have recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-more-cases-of-omicron-in-ukhand-tally-now-4/articleshow/88530077.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Hyderabad||HC reserves verdictin MP Raju’s appealagainst Jagan bail||Hyderabad: Making it clear that both cancellation of bail and issuing a notice to the accused are serious matters, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan of the Telangana high court on Monday reserved his judgment in an appeal filed by YSRCP disgruntled MP K Raghu Rama Krishna Raju seeking cancellation of bail given to AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in the quid pro quo case. The judge said he would first decide the issue of maintainability of the petition and till then the question of issuing notice to Jagan does not arise. Wondering whether Raju was trying to settle personal scores after he fell out with Jagan, the judge said: “The bail was given in 2013. You are seeking its cancellation after eight years. It is the CBI that should move such a plea. Let us not covert this court into a platform for a political slugfest. The trial court dismissed the plea of Raju because he failed to show a single instance of intimidation to the court.” To query on grounds urged by Raju, his counsel S Sri Venkatesh said Jagan through his actions was intimidating the witnesses in the case. When asked to elaborate on the issue, he said that several bureaucrats were named as witnesses in the case by the CBI in quid pro quo case and all of them were working directly under the administrative control of Jagan. Justice Bhuyan said: “We cannot say that the trial court will be blind to all such things. In any case, the IAS officers are controlled by the department of personnel and training belonging to the central government.” Raju was arrested in a case and he could come out only after the intervention of the Supreme Court, Venkatesh said. There were several attempts to influence the witnesses, he said.  Responding to a pointed query on any instances of Jagan intimidating or threatening the witnesses, CBI counsel K Surender said that they did not come across any such instances. Venkatesh found fault with the CBI for taking different stands. When Jagan sought exemption from court hearings, CBI said he was protracting the trial with such petitions. “But in our petition it refused to take a stand,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-reserves-verdictin-mp-rajus-appealagainst-jagan-bail/articleshow/88530884.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Cong workers held as cops foil meet in KCR’s bastion||Hyderabad: Top leaders of the Congress including state president A Revanth Reddy were either placed under house arrest or taken into preventive custody on Monday ahead of their programme ‘Rachabanda’ to be held at Erravelli in Gajwel Assembly constituency represented by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Revanth and party leaders strongly condemned the police for stopping the Rachabanda programme where the Congress leaders were scheduled to meet farmers in Gajwel over paddy procurement and other problems being faced by them. “CM KCR deployed police force and stopped Congress leaders from reaching Erravalli. Is Erravalli a restricted area? Is it located in Pakistan that we need to take a visa to visit Erravalli? BJP state president Bandi Sanjay organised Nirudyoga Deeksha to counter Congress’ Rachabanda programme. KT Rama Rao’s letter to Bandi Sanjay was part of a tacit understanding between TRS and BJP to divert the attention of the people from Congress programmes for the cause of farmers. The TRS and BJP are behaving like attention- diversion gangs,” Revanth said. “Rachabanda programme was planned to instil confidence among paddy farmers in the state. Many farmers committed suicide or died due to heart attacks and other reasons as they were upset over non-procurement of paddy, in the last three months,” Revanth said. “Neither the BJP government at the Centre nor the TRS government in Telangana took any concrete measures to restore confidence among paddy farmers. Instead, the TRS and BJP indulged in a blame game. The police would not have resorted to mass arrests of Congress leaders without the approval of CM KCR,” Revanth said. He sought to remind that it was CM KCR who had earlier given a call for cultivation of paddy in one crore acres as the TRS government was giving water for irrigation. But failure of KCR government to provide gunny bags, transportation to procure paddy of Vanakalam season left lakhs of paddy farmers in a lurch with some of them resorting to the extreme step like suicide, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-workers-held-as-cops-foil-meet-in-kcrs-bastion/articleshow/88530886.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Exempt property tax for educational institutions: AIMES||Hyderabad: All India Muslim Educational Society (AIMES)-Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on Monday urged the state government to exempt educational institutions from property tax, impact fee and compounding fee for residential buildings used for educational purpose across the state. A representation submitted by MS Farooq, advocate, general secretary, AIMES-Telangana and AP, to the government stated that the proposed act of the municipal department may cause several educational institutions in the state to shut down. “We want the state government to withdraw the GO as it is affecting the low-budget private schools that are mostly housed in residential areas. The schools have been asked to submit the applications online by December 31, 2021 along with 50% penalty fee. As per the GO, the state would collect impact fee, compounding fee and property tax with penalty from owners or occupiers of buildings that have been converted into commercial or school buildings from residential buildings,” Farooq said. He said that due to the pandemic several schools remained shut which resulted in many private unaided schools shutting down permanently as the managements were unable to bear the taxes and rents or collect fee. “Various state governments have exempted property tax for residential buildings in use for educational purposes as they are sharing the responsibility of the state sector in providing access to education on non-profit basis,” stated the representation “The present GO, if implemented, could be the final nail in the coffin for many unaided schools as the managements may not cooperate in paying penalties proposed to be collected,” Farooq added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/exempt-property-tax-for-educational-institutions-aimes/articleshow/88530893.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao likely to focus on filling vacancies in several departments||HYDERABAD: With allocation and transfer of state government employees in districts and multi zones likely to be completed soon, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is expected to focus on filling up vacancies in various government departments. As many as 68,000 vacancies have already been identified by the heads of the departments on the directions of the CM. Official sources though the exercise was completed in July itself, notifications have not been released as the government wants to first complete distribution of government employees to all the 33 districts to have complete clarity on vacancies. Sources said the state cabinet will be meeting in the first or second week of January mainly to clear filling up the vacancies which will be sent to Telangana State Public Service Commission and other agencies in a phased manner. Of the 68,000 vacancies identified, a majority of them are in police, education and medical and health departments. The government’s priority will be for police department and paramedical staff in hospitals. The rest are from other departments such as revenue, panchayat raj, municipal administration, irrigation, social welfare, tribal welfare and other departments. “Many districts do not have staff in district collectorates and revenue departments and have been functioning with meagre staff. After allocation, there will be clarity on the requirement of staff,” a senior official of the general administration department said. Filling up vacancies has been a major issue now with opposition parties taking up protests demanding the state government to fill up the vacancies. The recruitment issue was a poll issue during MLC polls for Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar graduates constituencies early this year. Industry minister KT Rama Rao released a list of government departments and institutions in which 1.32 lakh vacancies were filled up by the TRS government in the past seven years. In his open letter to BJP state president Bandi Sanjay a couple of days ago, he questioned why the Centre did not fill up vacancies in the central government departments while the TRS was making sincere efforts on this issue. Apart from BJP, YSRTP chief YS Sharmila has been taking up ‘nirudyoga nirahara deeksha’ in various parts of the state. “In every five posts in the central government, one post is vacant. The NDA government on the floor of Parliament declared that there are eight lakh vacant posts. Why is the Centre not filling up them,” health minister Harish Rao tweeted on Monday. కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వ ఉద్యోగాల్లో ప్రతి ఐదింటిలో ఒకటి ఖాళీగా ఉంది @bandisanjay_bjp గారు.కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వ సంస్థల్లో 8,72,24… https://t.co/jZ6CgRTtJP— Harish Rao Thanneeru (@trsharish) 1640600115000||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-likely-to-focus-on-fillingvacancies-in-several-depts/articleshow/88530880.cms||Koride Mahesh

The curfew will be in force from 10pm to 5am and no New Year celebrations will be allowed after 10pm on December 31. The decision was taken at a review meeting convened by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday. For the New Year celebrations, only 50% of the seating capacity will be allowed in bars, hotels, restaurants and clubs. Police and additional sectoral magistrates will be deployed to ensure restrictions on gathering of people in malls, public places, beaches and other entertainment areas. It has been reported that the Omicron variant spreads fast in closed indoor areas and authorities of malls and other such institutions have been asked to ensure proper ventilation facilities. The state has reported 57 Omicron cases but there is no local spread so far. The chief minister has asked officials to prevent formation of Covid clusters in the state. If any clusters are found, he has asked them to declare the areas as containment zones and impose strict restrictions to prevent any spread outside the clusters. He has asked the health department to take adequate steps to face any spike in cases in view of reports that the Omicron variant is more contagious. The department has already taken steps to set up Covid wards in each hospital and adequate medicines are stocked. The availability of oxygen and ICU beds is also being ensured. The chief minister has asked the district collectors of Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam to go for more genome sequencing of samples as more Omicron cases are reported in these districts. All district collectors have been asked to ensure adequate oxygen supply in their regions. The meeting also reviewed the preparations for vaccination of children aged 15-18 from January 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/new-year-celebrations-only-till-10pm-over-omicron-fears/articleshow/88530910.cms||---

The Thaltej resident is now planning to get her son, a student of Class 12, vaccinated at the earliest. “We had two Covid cases in the family during the second wave, and we know the importance of vaccination to protect ourself from the effects of the infection. But more importantly, it would be an opportunity for him to pursue activities apart from school that he attends offline,” she said, adding that her son’s social interaction has been limited due to his unvaccinated status. “With all the activities slowly resuming offline, his vaccination would bring us some peace.” As per the rules laid down by the Centre on Monday, registration for vaccination will start from January 1 and the vaccination drive will begin from January 3. The teenagers will have to get their Aadhaar card or Class 10 mark sheet as the proof of their age. The state health department officials said that schools would be primary focus for the vaccination drives. City-based doctors said that it’s a step in the right direction. While many students attend coaching classes for Boards or entrance tests, some also participate in co-curricular activities at the school or elsewhere. “Vaccination will help them move without fear of getting infection even as the share of patients from this age group is relatively lower than the average Covid patients’ age,” said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parents-eager-to-get-their-teenagers-vaccinated/articleshow/88530908.cms||---

Addressing a public meeting at Sasaram as part of his social reforms campaign, Nitish said some people recently suggested that the people coming from outside the state should be allowed to drink liquor. “It is not possible in Bihar. We will not allow anyone to drink liquor in Bihar. Should I tell the people coming to Bihar to drink liquor here? Please do not come to Bihar if you are thinking of drinking liquor,” Nitish said. The CM had reached Sasaram, around 160km south-west from here, in the third leg of his three-week long campaign which he had launched at Motihari on December 22. At Sasaram, the CM referred to Mahatma Gandhi who had once said “consuming liquor does not just cause money loss, but also makes people mentally corrupt”. Making a sarcastic remark against a section of intellectuals who argue against the state government’s decision of total prohibition, Nitish said, “Some people who drink liquor consider themselves as more efficient, but they are not efficient. They might be highly educated, but if they consume liquor, I will not consider them as an efficient intellectual. All such people are against the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi.” The CM asked the officials of Rohtas, Kaimur, Buxar and Bhojpur districts who were there to attend the review meeting, to take effective steps to check smuggling of illicit liquor from the neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dont-come-to-bihar-if-you-wish-to-drink-liquor/articleshow/88530276.cms||Madan Kumar

Now as the garden has opened again, bicycles have been kept ready for children so that they can get to know about traffic rules, signal lights and signs while riding through the cycle track. Superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade said, “If kids understand traffic rules at an early age then it will play a valuable role for them in their future. These kids can also make their parents aware about various traffic rules. The fines for breaking traffic rules have increased two to four times and in order to avoid paying hefty fines, people should voluntarily make it a point to obey the traffic rules.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/traffic-garden-to-reopen-from-jan-1/articleshow/88529334.cms||---

A meeting of these producers in the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce on Monday discussed the matter and they have now decided to formally approach the authorities. “The film ticket rate should also be reduced to facilitate people to watch a small-budget film,” said Natti Kumar, former joint secretary of Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce. Recently, the Telangana government had increased the film ticket rates both in single screens and multiplexes. Natti said a representation would be made to the Telangana government on reducing ticket rates for small-budget films, and a separate plea would be made to both the AP and Telangana governments for allowing a fifth show. The fifth show for small films should be at 2.30 pm and ticket rates restricted to Rs 100, Rs 75 and Rs 50 for different classes, he said, adding that any film made under Rs 3 crore is small-budget. Natti Kumar said that as per the provisions of the Cinematograph Act, 1956, of the total capacity of theatres, including multiplexes, 10% seating should be made available for a cheaper ticket rate. “Should the poor look at multiplexes from outside and not enter it to watch a movie?” Natti Kumar said, describing the ticket rates ranging from Rs 150 to Rs 300 as exorbitant. At the meeting on Monday, producers said that the lowest ticket rate was Rs 50 in several states, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat and UP. Small-budget producers want the same rate for multiplexes in Telangana and AP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/reduce-ticket-rates-allow-5th-show-say-small-film-producers/articleshow/88530904.cms||---

In a letter to AICC president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, Jagga Reddy took serious objection to Revanth’s call for a ‘Rachabanda’ programme at Erravelli without consulting him. “I am the lone MLA from the Congress in old Medak district and Revanth does not even inform me about it,” he said.“He is using party programmes for promotion of his own image. I sense something fishy in Revanth’s style of functioning. Kindly look into the matter and conduct an enquiry,” Jagga Reddy said in his letter to the AICC president. The TPCC president does not have a grip at the grassroot levels and does not possess any experience to go into the village, mandal level and work for the Congress, Jagga Reddy alleged. Former MP V Hanumanth Rao also said the party leadership should have informed Jagga Reddy regarding the Rachabanda programme in his district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/remove-revanth-from-tpcc-prez-post-jagga-to-sonia/articleshow/88530899.cms||---

Telangana BC Commission chairman Krishna Mohan Rao Vakulabharanam met NCBC chairman Bhagwanlal Shaini in New Delhi and said OBCs had high hopes on the national commission that it will prevail upon the Narendra Modi-government to do a caste-wise census of OBCs. He also urged the NCBC chairman to make public the statistics collected as part of Socio Economic and Caste Census held earlier. Taking up the cause of 40 BC castes from Telangana which are deprived of reservations as they are not included on Centre’s OBC quota list, Rao submitted a detailed technical information on the 40 Castes to NCBC chairman Shaini. He informed Shaini that these 40 BC castes have suffered immense loss of opportunities in central educational institutions and jobs as they are not in the centre’s OBC reservation list although they are in the list of Backward Classes quota in Telangana for a long time now. Rao also thanked NCBC chairman for conducting a hearing to include BC castes in OBC list from December 22 to December 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bc-panel-seeks-caste-count-with-general-census/articleshow/88530911.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Those who beat Omicron say ‘be careful, not afraid’||AHMEDABAD: A 46-year-old Anand resident, the first Omicron variant case from the district, was discharged from Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad on Monday amid showers of petals from the staff. Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent of the hospital, said that he was the first patient to be admitted for the variant of Covid-19 and the first to be discharged. Speaking to mediapersons, the recovered patient said he had been to the UK and returned to India via Dubai airport. He was found to have Covid after an RT-PCR test at the airport, after which he was hospitalized. “I just had paracetamol and multivitamins during my isolation. I had no symptoms at all. I want to tell everyone not to be afraid of the variant, but be careful,” said the man, adding that his fully vaccinated status prevented the infection from turning severe. He appealed to people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. In Surat, both confirmed Omicron patients had the common symptom of sore throats. A 42-year-old diamond businessman and a 39-year-old woman fashion designer tested positive at the start of December. The woman had a mild bodyache and a headache as well. “I had a sore throat one day after I returned from Africa on December 1. Before going to a wedding, I went for a test on December 7 and tested positive. I isolated myself while the health department team came and collected samples for genome sequencing,” said the businessman. The fashion designer said she recovered at home and advised citizens to be careful, while asserting that there is no need to panic. Vadodara’s first Omicron patient, a 75-year-old NRI from Zambia, said that at first, he did not even realise that he could be infected with the new variant of Covid-19. “We reached Vadodara on December 7. I had a simple headache, body pain and a sore throat. We consulted our family physician and continued medicines for three days. We then tested positive for Covid-19 and were later found to have the new variant,” said the man. He and his wife were both diagnosed as having the Omicron variant. Both were fully vaccinated. They said that all the symptoms were like a flu. They got discharged after nine days of hospitalization, whereas four other contacts got discharged on Saturday. Dr R S Trivedi, medical superintendent of PDU hospital in Rajkot, said multivitamins, paracetamol and rest are enough for Omicron patients. “We measured all parameters on time but there was not much change,” he said, adding that the patients did not require oxygen. His Tanzanian patient shared his experience, saying that he had a severe headache initially and his heart rate also increased. But eventually his symptoms disappeared. The student was unvaccinated but had two RT-PCR tests return negative before coming to India.

---||Meerut||After 2 jumbos die, probe on cause for infighting||Bijnor: The forest department authorities on Sunday found the carcass of a 10-year-old elephant in Jafatabad area of Kaudiya range in Bijnor’s Najibabad elephant reserve, nearly a month after a 40-year-old jumbo was found dead in a six-foot-deep ditch, 10 km from the forest guest house in Amangarh tiger reserve. Foresters claimed that their injury marks indicated that both had died fighting with other jumbos, probably for territory or mate. “Both were adults. It is rare for elephants of this age to fight,” said Manoj Shukla, Najibabad's divisional forest officer. Now, the foresters are monitoring the activities and movement of an elephant herd spotted in Kaudiya range to ascertain the reason for infighting among the tuskers. Giving details, Shukla said, “Going by the condition of the 10-year-old elephant’s carcass, it seems that the jumbo died in a fight between two elephant herds. This was apparent from the number of trees that lay on the ground ripped off their roots. The staff had heard loud trumpets at night.” He said the battle between herds is a matter of concern as there are at least 100 elephants in the Najibabad division. “Our staff has been put on alert and they are monitoring jumbos’ activities." Anil Kumar Patel, Bijnor divisional forest officer, said there are times when an adult elephant turns rogue and becomes a nuisance for its own herd. The herd turns against its own member, and tries to drive it out. The result can be a bloody and fatal battle. This is what he believes to be the cause for the jumbo’s death in Amangarh. “The dead elephant sustained many deep gashes and contusions. After losing the battle, it may have tried to flee. This may explain why it fell into a deep ditch and bled to death there.” The forest department is studying the matter thoroughly, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-2-jumbos-die-probe-on-cause-for-infighting/articleshow/88530110.cms||Harveer Dabas

This innovative idea has been coined by Usharaje High School’s science teacher Varsha Maske wherein around 55 different plant species on the school premises have been attached with its name and QR code plates so that the students can get all the information about the plant by using their mobile phones. “If any person scans the QR code then they will get all the information about the plant like scientific name, common name, origin, family, sub-family, genus and its uses. They only need a smartphone to get all the information. The entire process took around 4 months to get completed and now, students, parents, teachers and people passing through the school premises are seen scanning the QR code,” Maske said. Suhani Lokhande, a Std IX student, said, “With installation of these QR codes, gaining information and knowledge about the trees and plants has become easier as it helps in reducing efforts required to search about the information on the internet or in books. The names of these plants are a bit difficult to memorize, so scanning a QR code is the easiest way to know more in less time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/school-installs-qr-code-on-trees-to-aid-learning/articleshow/88529350.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

In 2021, as many as 1,21,149 people were arrested till December 15 under various IPC sections. In the corresponding period last year, 1,00,447 people were nabbed. There was a rise in arrests for street crimes like snatching, robbery and burglary. Last year, 61 dacoits were arrested against 127 this year. “If we compare the data of the past three years, the highest number of dacoits were arrested in 2021,” said an officer. There was also a 16% increase in the arrests of robbers this year. While 1,977 snatchers were arrested till December 15, 2021, about 1,613 were arrested in the same period last year. About 5,717 auto lifters were arrested this year, whereas last year 4,888 were held. Sources said this year over 800 people were arrested for murder, around 1,200 for murder attempts, more than 3,000 for molestation and over 1,100 in Pocso Act cases. The report also showed that compared with 2019, there was an increase of more than 35% in arrests. In 2018, 79,550 people were arrested. An officer said they found that when active criminals were arrested and sent to prison, crime decreased. But when they were released, they again started committing crimes due to which the figures rose. “Several such criminals out on bail committing crimes have been arrested,” added the officer. Seeing the situation, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana asked his force to conduct a crackdown on criminals, ruffians, bad characters and those fit for externment. “DCPs are also being asked to identify gangsters and their associates and book them under MCOCA,” the officer said. To detect vehicles used in a crime, officers have been told to take the help of CCTV cameras meant for detection of speed violations. Another direction was issued in which the police chief directed officers to ensure that unsolved robbery and snatching cases were solved at the earliest to improve the case closed percentage. “District DCPs should coordinate with DCPs of railways and Metro and formulate effective strategies to prevent snatching incidents outside stations,” the order stated. It added that combing operations should be conducted at regular intervals in JJ clusters and other areas where a large number of criminals resided. “Delhi Police insists on registering each incident of crime. With the increase in the registration, more cases are likely to be detected, resulting in more arrests of criminals,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-cops-made-20-more-arrests-this-yr/articleshow/88531014.cms||Abhay Singh

The rift between Sena and Congress-NCP is widening with every passing day as Sena leaders were not included in the panel of candidates for KDCC election. The leaders are miffed as all three parties are part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi formed at the state level to keep Bharatiya Janata Party out of power. Taking a dig at Mushrif, Kolhapur MP Sanjay Mandlik said, “Mushrif claimed Sena has benefitted due to the alliance with Congress and NCP. However, in reality it is other way round. We have contributed in every election since Maha Vikas Aghadi was formed. Mushrif and others have used Sena in Gokul dairy, MLC and other elections. Now we will not let that happen. For the political future of Sena, we decided to set up panel and contest election. The voters will ensure a win for us.” Mushrif is leading the campaign for Congress-NCP led panel. He is leaving no stone unturned to win for the KDCC election for second time. Sena has aligned with Peasants and Workers Party, Republican Party of India and smaller fronts. Already six from Mushrif’s panel have won the election unopposed and he needs just five more winners. Prakash Abitkar, Sena MLA from Radhanagari constituency, said, “In these recent days, Mushrif is unable to take mature decision confidently. We learnt he is using Sena to fulfil his political ambitions, but we won’t let that to happen this time.” Panel for Shahu Factory wins unopposed Panel contesting for Kagal’s Shahu Sugar Factory won all seats. Samarjitsinha Ghatage, district president of BJP led panel won all seats unopposed. No candidate was in fray to oppose Ghatage’s panel.  He said that the new faces have been given chance to run one of the state’s top cooperative sugar factories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sena-leaders-hit-out-at-mushrif-over-kdcc-poll/articleshow/88529365.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Night curfew ahead of NY may hurt tourism||Nainital/Mussoorie: Hoteliers in Uttarakhand were upset with the state government's decision on Monday to impose night curfew with "immediate effect" amid a rise in the number of Covid cases and a looming Omicron threat. The move will have a direct impact on the state's tourism industry, they said. Ahead of New Year weekend, hoteliers in Nainital have been receiving a decent booking and tourist inflow. While hoteliers in Mussoorie believe the night curfew would have a significant impact on tourism in the Queen of Hills in the run up to New Year parties and celebrations which mainly takes place at night. Hoteliers from Mussoorie reported around 60% to 70% occupancy for December 31 and January 1, so far. Night curfew may now cause a dip in hotel bookings. Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand Hotel Association, said, “Imposition of night curfew is bound to impact tourism. A large number of tourists make last minute bookings and with night curfew in place they will think twice now.” Sanjay Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Hotel Association, said, “People want to celebrate till late hours on New Year’s eve. While we would abide by the government's decision, it is also a fact that night curfew would affect tourism here.” Naresh Gupta, GM Mannu Maharani, said, "The night curfew is a sad development for the tourism industry. We are still confused as we had little time to react.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/night-curfew-ahead-of-ny-may-hurt-tourism/articleshow/88530121.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Ahmedabad||Before Covid, shortfall of nurses in Gujarat was 53%: State health index report||AHMEDABAD: The State Health Index Report for 2019-20 was released by NITI Aayog on Monday. The silver lining for Gujarat was climbing one rank from 7th in the last report to 6th. The report also mentioned that Gujarat improved health spending marginally, from 6.51% of its annual budget to 7.24%. However, on several other indicators, the state did not have a great showing. The report, analyzing data from just before the Covid pandemic began, found that about 53% of the sanctioned posts for nurses at PHCs, UHCs and CHCs were vacant in Gujarat. Likewise, district hospitals had a 37% shortfall in specialist doctors. On long-term indices, the state was adjudged the worst performer among the major states on a few parameters. According to the report, sex ratio at birth reduced by 4.5% from 2014 to 2018 (from 907 to 866), the sharpest fall among major states. Institutional deliveries fell by 5.7%, from 90.8% to 86.1% from 2014-15 to 2019-20. “The pandemic showed the importance of the public health system and the need for trained human resources. While the data is a bit old, it is certain an indication as to where efforts need to be concentrated and how to strengthen health delivery outside urban areas,” said a city-based public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/before-covid-shortfall-of-nurses-in-state-was-53/articleshow/88530932.cms||---
---||India||Go for dual RT-PCR testing to detect Omicron at low cost: Centre to states||PUNE/NAGPUR: The Union health ministry has advised states to adopt a dual RT-PCR testing strategy ahead of genome sequencing of Covid positive samples for Omicron detection. Under the new plan, suspected patients’ throat/nasal swab samples will be tested using a standard RT-PCR kit and if detected positive, the same sample will undergo a second test with an imported RT-PCR kit having an S-gene drop. “Only those samples showing positive for S-gene dropout or S-gene target failure (SGTF) will be genomically sequenced for Omicron. Besides cost-cutting, it will also help in picking up the highly probable Omicron cases and save resources,” a senior Union health ministry official told TOI on Monday. The Maharashtra government is among the first to have already started implementing the dual test strategy. Quite a few districts with high floating populations have already received the imported kits. “The cost of genome sequencing goes up to Rs 5,000 per Covid positive sample in India, including the transport, human resource, and other heads,” the official said, adding that whereas the cost per kit of a standard RTPCR kit and imported RTPCR kit with SGTF is Rs 19 and Rs 240, respectively. The dual RT-PCR costs Rs 260. Besides testing individuals with international travel history and their close contacts, these kits can also be used at government-run laboratories for routine Covid tests to rule out the community spread from daily caseload having high viral load or below 25 cycle threshold (CT) value. A total of 23 of 60 Covid positive samples have so far tested positive for S-gene dropout in Nagpur. Instead of sequencing all the 60 positive samples, these 23 samples are being prioritised for sequencing in Nagpur. The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at the Nagpur’s Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital — one of the key sentinel centres in Maharashtra — is carrying out the second RT-PCR test for SGTF prior to sending the samples for sequencing. The hospital’s head of microbiology department and principal investigator Dr SS Raut said, “We are testing the positive samples again using the specialised RT-PCR kits for SGTF.” Nagpur’s second confirmed Omicron patient, a 21-year-old youth who returned from Dubai, was the first whose throat/nasal swab sample when tested twice with RTPCR kit showed the SGTF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/go-for-dual-rt-pcr-testing-to-detect-omicron-at-low-cost-centre-to-states/articleshow/88532906.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Thiruvananthapuram||After SC rap, govt releases Rs 124.5cr for ex-gratia payment||Thiruvananthapuram: After facing severe criticism from the Supreme Court for the low number of disbursements of Covid-death related ex-gratia payment, the state government has granted Rs 124.57 crore to the districts for disbursal to the beneficiaries. An order issued by the disaster management department in this regard on Saturday said that some of the districts are facing a shortfall in the balance amount of the state disaster response fund for giving ex-gratia payment as compensation for Covid-related deaths. The funds have been disbursed to Thiruvananthapuram (Rs 20.78 cr), Kollam (Rs 13.44 cr), Pathanamthitta (Rs 5.12 cr), Alappuzha (Rs 9.68 cr), Kottayam (Rs 7.74 cr), Idukki (Rs 2.63 cr), Ernakulam (Rs 16.10 cr), Thrissur (Rs 15.32 cr), Palakkad (Rs 10.63 cr), Malappuram (Rs 9.13 cr), Kozhikode (Rs 11.36 cr) and Kasaragod (Rs 2.62 cr). Though more than 45,000 deaths have been reported in the state, only a few applications that were submitted seeking ex-gratia payments were processed and cleared by the government, which had come under severe criticism from the SC last month. The court had observed that only a few applicants were paid the ex-gratia of Rs 50,000 by the state government, and it further instructed the state to release all the payments to the eligible claimants within a week. The revenue department had in the first week of November come up with an online portal in order to process and disburse financial relief for the relatives of those who lost their lives due to Covid-19. When the applications for financial relief are submitted in www.relief.kerala.gov.in, there are a series of documents as well which are to be submitted along with the application, including the death certificate (death certificate issued by the ICMR and the death declaration document), copy of the ration card, Aadhaar card and bank pass book of the applicant and the heirship certificate if available. The applications that are to be submitted by the close relative of the person who has died due to Covid-19 will be examined then by the respective village officer along with the documents submitted along with it, which would then be passed on to the district disaster management authority (DDMA), which will then examine and give final clearance to the application. Those applications that are received in physical format in the village offices will be verified and handed over through the portal to the DDMA by the village officer. In those cases, where there is a need for re-examination, the DDMA will hand over the applications to the respective tahsildar through the portal for further inquiry. As per the rules, once the applications are received, those should be processed and the money should be transferred to the beneficiary’s bank account within 30 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/after-sc-rap-govt-releases-rs-124-5cr-for-ex-gratia-payment/articleshow/88530977.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: Septuagenarian from Karad holds on to book with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s note to her father||KOLHAPUR: A yellow dog-eared book with a special message from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is the prized possession of a septuagenarian in Karad. Sharada Vilasrao Patil has preserved the book, which she got from her father — freedom fighter Vishnu Tatya Janugade. As India celebrates Azadi Ka Amrit Mohatsav, Patil wants the future generations to preserve and cherish the book the way she has for the past 30 years. Janugade was just 16 years old in 1931 when Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had addressed a large gathering at Karad, a town near the confluence of the Krishna and Koyna rivers. Janugade and his friends had walked a long distance to hear the leader speak. “My father stayed back to meet Netaji, who was staying in the house of a local Congress leader. There were a lot of people to meet Netaji. Despite all odds, my father was able to reach Netaji who told him to join the army and help the freedom fighters. Then, Netaji wrote a message that my father has carried with him for his entire life,” said Patil, Janugade’s only daughter. Netaji wrote in his signature style: “Self-sacrifice and self-effacement constitute the price we have to pay for freedom.” The message written on December 25, 1931, inspired Janugade to join Netaji’s Azad Hind Fauj. Janugade was jailed in 1945 for his association with the Fauj. Janugade hid the book from the British, and gave it to his wife to be kept safely till he was released from a Singapore jail. He was released after India got freedom and the notebook remained with him all the time. Vishwas Patil, former bureaucrat and writer of the ‘Mahanayak’ novel based on Bose’s life, said, “In 1931, Netaji was the general secretary of Congress and Jawaharlal Nehru president. They made extensive tours of India. They held meetings in small towns and cities and thousands used to gather to listen to them. There were over 400 to 500 captains in Netaji’s force. Janugade was one of them.” Patil said that Jagunade played an important role in getting army officers and jawans to join Netaji’s Indian National Army. “Jagannath Bhosale, who rose to the rank of a General in the INA, was initially reluctant to join the INA. But Janugade persuaded him saying that they are from the land of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. They should be on the battle lines fighting the British,” said Patil. A few years ago, Shrinivas Patil, then governor of Sikkim, and current Satara MP had got the photostat of the page on which Netaji had written the message. He has kept in the library of Sikkim governor’s office, said Suresh Patil, Janugade’s grandson..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/septuagenarian-from-karad-holds-on-to-book-with-netajis-note-to-her-father/articleshow/88529320.cms||Abhijeet Patil

The Gujarat Government Doctors Forum (GGDF), which has doctors from six government-run and eight GMERS colleges as members, had earlier threatened to go an indefinite strike from December 13. They later decided to postponed their stir after a promise from the state government that their demands would be looked into. The protesting doctors had given the government till December 26, but now have decided to revisit the deadline and wait till January 16 for their demands to be met. “The government has looked into many of our demands, however, discussions are on about a few of our demands and we are hopeful that the government will consider them before the Vibrant Gujarat summit next month,” said a member of GGDF. GGDF has been protesting the reduction in salaries and pressing other pending demands. Over the past few months, professors have been facing salary cuts in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 96,000 per month. The government gave a dearness allowance for about five months but decided to withdraw it, and recovered the money paid from the salaries of professors. The demands included higher non-practising allowance in line with the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations. Another demand is related to the abolition of contract appointments. As medical college teachers are barred from private practice, an allowance is paid to them as compensation. Gujarat Medical Teachers’ Association (GMTA) had earlier this year demanded that medical college teachers be allowed to start private practice after 10 years of regular service. Citing a government resolution of 2017, GMTA sought an increase in the cap on the monthly salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-service-doctors-defer-strike-till-jan-16/articleshow/88530975.cms||---

The move on containment zones is being mulled after the civic authorities were informed about high number of Omicron suspects being reported from Hanuman Nagar zone. The issues were discussed during a Covid review meeting held at the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Monday. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that 11 scattered cases of S-gene drop have been reported from Hanuman Nagar zone. “Out of the 20 suspects with S-gene drop, 11 are from this zone. If need arises, we may create micro or major containment zones. I have asked officials to chalk out a plan for such a situation. Priority will be cases where S gene is missing as it is an indicator for Omicron variant,” he said. The civic chief also said that mass testing would be done in localities in case group of cases surface. “We did mass testing of Regional Police Training School (RPTS) recruits and Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology students after cases were reported there,” he said. Regarding vaccination drive, Radhakrishnan added that NMC has over 160 centres, but not all of them are functioning at full potential. “Staff from there would be deployed for special drives at schools. Our education officer has been asked to hold the camps. Coaching centres too would be roped in for these drive. We are awaiting state government guidelines on which vaccine has to be given among other things,” he said. The civic chief reiterated that new Covid patients, even if asymptomatic, would continue to go in institutional quarantine. “We shall review the decision only if cases go beyond a certain number. Right now, all can be accommodated in Covid Care Centres and designated hospitals,” he said. On arrangements to tackle projected third wave surge, he said, “Everything is available — from manpower to oxygen plants and hospital beds. The district administration also held a review meeting to assess availability of manpower, doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and infrastructure. The civic administration has also asked for quarantine arrangement at private hotels for international flyers. District round-up: Daily cases slip to 12 The daily Covid cases slid to 12 as the number of tests too was down at 2,451 in Nagpur district on Monday. For the last two days, the district has reported a spike of 24 and 32 cases from over 3,300 tests on Saturday and Sunday, , respectively. Seven patients recovered in the day.

The chambers and secret exits were allegedly meant to frisk away bar dancers in case of a police raid at the dance bars. The BMC inspected eight bars in its K-East ward and found hidden rooms and exits in two of them. “We carried out the inspection along with the police. Our staff found a hidden chamber behind a mirror in one of the bars and in another one there was a secret exit from behind a cupboard. The door was hidden behind the clothes and may have been used to hide bar dancers. We have demolished the illegal structures at Pink Plaza bar and Urvashi bar,” said Prashant Sakpale, assistant municipal commissioner of the K-East ward. “We will be taking action against the bar owners under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act and we have informed the police too so they will also take necessary action. This was part of the drive to check illegal construction and alterations inside bars and restaurants. All walls were checked for cavities, secret chambers and doors,” said Sakpale. While Pink Plaza is located near the subway at Andheri railway station, Urvashi is located on AK Road near the Western Express Highway. These were the second and third bars in Andheri where a secret cavity or chamber was detected. Earlier this month, a bar was raided in Andheri by the social service unit of the crime branch, leading to the arrest of 11 people and rescue of 17, an official said. The raid had taken place at night and the wall of the establishment had to be broken to find cavities in which women were kept hidden, Sakpale said. “A tip-off was received that women were made to dance at the bar. An advanced electronic system was installed near the bar to alert those inside of any raid. We found a basement with beds and air-conditioning. A case was registered at Andheri police station,” he said. Sakpale said the BMC was going to suspend the health licence of the bar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-game-of-hide-and-seek-ends-at-2-andheri-bars/articleshow/88532331.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

For those from Kolkata as well, an air ticket on January 2 will cost over Rs 13,000 as against the usual Rs 4,500. Flight tickets on the Goa-Delhi and Goa-Hyderabad sectors have also more than doubled from around Rs 4,000 to nearly Rs 10,000 on January 2. Surprisingly, the airfare to fly into Goa for New Year’s Eve has not risen as much on most routes. For instance, an air ticket from Delhi to Goa on December 31 will cost a little over Rs 6,000. It is a similar situation with bus fares. A luxury bus ticket from Pune to Goa on December 31, for example, is available for around Rs 1,000. But a return ticket to Pune on January 2 will cost between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500. For the Goa-Mumbai route, this luxury bus ticket will cost up to Rs 3,000, which is double of what it will cost to arrive by bus to Goa on December 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-happy-new-year-for-airlines-flights-out-of-goa-cost-up-to-4x-the-usual-price/articleshow/88553834.cms||---

His throat had been slit and a part of his hand was chopped off. Broken bottles of liquor were also recovered from the site. Police on Monday arrested Shakeel Lambu, one of Shahbaz's aides, and booked him under charges of murder. He was arrested and remanded to judicial custody. Cops claimed that the duo were involved with a gang that made "fake" visas by luring people with jobs abroad. The two would charge as much as Rs 2.5 lakh to promise quality jobs abroad but would either take all the money themselves and flee, make travelling visas instead of work ones, or provide low-paying jobs such as cattle grazing or working as a janitor. Police said that the accused confessed to killing Shahbaz with a pair of scissors because "he used to take the majority of the profit from the trade." Cops have recovered the pair of scissors following the alleged confession. The accused, who hails from Sherkot city in Bijnor, allegedly conspired to kill Shahbaz by inviting him to the district, said Bijnor's superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh. "Shahbaz is from Bijnor's Afzalgarh city but he had settled down in Delhi some years ago. He had his network in Bijnor as well. The accused Shakeel, his associate, is a criminal. A case was earlier registered against him at the Nehru Nagar police station of Dehradun under sections 420, 406, 467, 468, 471, and 120b of IPC. He was declared a fugitive," the SP said. The SP told TOI that Shakeel was arrested in Bijnor, close to the roadways bus station. He was interrogated after arrest, where he allegedly revealed that he was involved in an ego tussle with Shahbaz. The accused told police that Shahbaz would often "act like his boss" and "try to overpower him". He alleged that he was forced to extort money from those wanting to go abroad for jobs, and when he refused to do the same, he was threatened with "dire consequences". Shakeel then hatched a plan to eliminate him, the SP said. The accused allegedly told the police that he met Shahbaz in Delhi and brought him to Bijnor in a hired car on December 25 on the pretext of giving him money. He said he took Shahbaz to the Bhaguwala village in Najibabad first, where they promised another man a visa for a Gulf country. Later, he said he took Shahbaz to a hotel, where they stayed along with their car driver. The driver stayed in a separate room while the duo were in another. Both Shakeel and Shahbaz had wine, after which Shahbaz fell unconscious from excessive drinking. "This is when Shakeel attacked him with a pair of scissors. He slit his throat and chopped off some portion of his hand. Shahbaz died of excess bleeding. Shakeel fled from the spot, locking the body inside the room. The incident came to the fore when the room remained shut throughout Sunday morning. The staff broke the door open," said the SP. Sources say thousands of people from Bijnor work abroad. There are several touts active who make their visas. Many gullible people are duped by gangs. A dozen such cases are reported from the Bijnor district every year, according to police records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-from-delhi-found-dead-in-bijnor-hotel-with-throat-slit-hand-chopped-aide-arrested/articleshow/88530192.cms||Harveer Dabas

Pointing out at the thin territorial waters between the two countries, he added that it is forcing fishermen to cross the boundary in search of their livelihood.Mourya also condemned the human rights violations of Sri Lanka by directly spraying disinfectants on the detained fishermen under the pretext of Covid-19 preventive measures. “It is shocking that the Union and state governments are unmindful of such violations,” he said. The MNM also sought a permanent solution for the issues faced by fishermen from the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mnm-urges-govt-to-bring-back-68-fishers-detained-in-lanka/articleshow/88530989.cms||---

For the fourth consecutive round, Kerala emerged as the best overall performer. Among smaller states, Mizoram emerged as the best performer in overall performance as well as incremental outcome. Among Union territories (UTs), Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir ranked at the bottom in terms of overall performance but emerged as leading performer in terms of incremental performance. Poll-bound UP has shown a marked improvement in its performance in majority of the indicators. Among the larger states, UP has taken the top spot in terms of incremental performance by registering the highest incremental change of 5.5 points from the base year (2018-19) to reference year (2019-20). A vast majority of the states and UTs have recorded a shift in their overall performance rankings from base year to reference year. Among the 19 larger states, four improved their rankings while five deteriorated and 10 retained their base year ranks. Three out of the eight smaller states improved their rankings, four deteriorated while one retained its base year rank. Four UTs improved their ranks while three deteriorated. Assam made the maximum improvement, moving from 15 to 12 while Andaman & Nicobar went down the maximum, from 4 to 7. “The Covid pandemic has reinforced the importance of the health sector and the need for doubling up health systems strengthening efforts. Though this round of the health index (Round IV) 2019-20 does not capture the impact of Covid-19 on health outcomes or any of the other indicators, as the index performance relates to the base year (2018-19) and reference year (2019-20), largely the pre-Covid period, it will provide good guidance on areas of improvement to states and UTs,” Niti Aayog member Vinod Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-retains-top-spot-in-niti-health-index/articleshow/88531001.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BSF nabs 21-year-old Pak man crossing Rajasthan border on way to meet Mumbai girl||MUMBAI: In what could possibly be one of the most riveting stories of love in the time of Corona in the recent past, a Pakistan man who fell for a college girl in Mumbai through social media sneaked through the border fence at Anupgarh sector in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar district on December 4, and planned to walk over 1,300 km to reach Mumbai to meet the girl. Not only did the man put the police and several government agencies in a fix, but was lucky to not get shot by the Border Security Force (BSF). A resident of Bahawalpur district in Punjab-Pakistan — which is 40km away from the border — Mohammad Amir (21) was caught by the BSF and is currently in judicial custody. Two police constables from Sri Ganganagar district reached their police station in Rajasthan on Monday and submitted a report after verifying Amir’s claim with the statement of the 20-year-old girl, a resident of Kandivli, who confirmed that they were in love and planned to marry. Officials at Anupgarh police station in Rajasthan said over time, the two became good friends, exchanged numbers, and decided to get married. Amir told the joint interrogation committee (JIC) officials that he did apply for an Indian visa to travel to Mumbai but the request was denied by the Indian authorities. “On being denied a visa, he planned to cross the borderfence to meet the girl. He was unsure how to reach Mumbai and planned to walk all the way to meet the woman. To verify his claim, a team was sent to Mumbai to locate the girl and it confirmed his claims,” Sri Ganganagar superintendent of police (SP) Anand Sharma told TOI. A source from Mumbai police said that the two Rajasthan cops, along with their counterpart at Sakinaka and technical and human intelligence, took almost 24 hours to locate the girl’s new address that falls under the jurisdiction of Kandivli police. The two constables from Rajasthan reached Mumbai on Saturday and took the help of Sakinaka police to track the girl. “They, however, failed to locate the girl at the address that Amir provided to us. They became friends during the lockdown after they met on Facebook, and after 10 months of regular chatting on social media, he expressed his desire to meet her and she agreed to his decision. He had planned to walk all the way to Mumbai to meet the girl as he was carrying only a small amount of Pakistani currency. The JIC, consisting of Intelligence Bureau (IB), BSF, local police and other government agencies, did not find any weapon or explosives in his possession,” said Sharma. Amir, a school dropout, hails from a very poor family and left his home without his parent’s knowledge at night on December 3. “Early next morning, Amir trespassed the India-Pakistan international border at Anupgarh sector when the BSF caught him. He was clueless about how to reach Mumbai and the mode of transport. Since he did not have enough money, he had planned to walk over 1,300km to reach Mumbai to meet the girl. The BSF handed him over to the custody of the Anupgarh police and we have referred him to the JIC, which questioned and booked him for trespass and other offences. After completing the probe, the BSF will initiate proceedings for pushback after taking up the issue with Pakistani rangers,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pak-man-dodges-bsf-to-meet-love-across-border-in-mumbai/articleshow/88532335.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Bareilly||UP: Imposing night curfew, calling lakhs to rallies beyond comprehension, says Varun Gandhi||BAREILLY: Bharatiya Janata Party MP Varun Gandhi on Monday raised questions over the Uttar Pradesh government's decision to impose a night curfew across the state while simultaneously organising election rallies despite the looming Omicron threat. “Imposing a night curfew and calling lakhs of people to attend rallies is something beyond the comprehension of the common man. Considering the limited healthcare infrastructure of UP, we must decide whether our priority should be controlling the spread of Omicron or displaying muscle power for elections," Varun tweeted. Varun told TOI, "Policymakers should lead from the front, inspiring the public to stay at home. Maximum transmission typically happens during the day, as there are fewer people on the road during the night." He added that the government must push to reduce social gatherings as they could emerge as possible Covid-19 clusters. He highlighted the need for a "holistic" strategy, similar to that in the Centre's note to the Maharashtra government in March 2021. "Measures such as night curfews and weekend lockdowns have a very limited impact on containing or suppressing the transmission of the virus. The administration should focus on a strict and effective containment strategy," he said. Varun, as part of an outreach drive, has lent support to Anganwadi, ASHA workers, contractual health staff, and Shiksha Mitras. He said these workers are entitled to honorarium on a par with other government employees. “I will stand by them till the time they are regularised and held in high regard,“ he tweeted. He had recently slammed the privatisation of banks and other assets, saying such a move would result in job losses for lakhs of people. He said currently, banks generate employment, support self-help groups, and also provide loans to rural masses. Earlier, Varun had raised the issue of minimum support price (MSP) in Parliament by introducing the first-ever private bill in favour of farmers, titled "The Farmers Right to Guaranteed MSP Realization of Agri-Produce Bill, 2021”. The components of the bill are yet to be discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/imposing-night-curfew-and-calling-lakhs-to-rallies-beyond-comprehension-varun-gandhi/articleshow/88530188.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Goa||Karnataka institute to prepare forest working plans||Panaji: The state cabinet recently granted approval to the Bengaluru-based Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST) to prepare a working plan for North and South Goa forest divisions. The plan will help evaluate the status of forests and biodiversity resources within a forest division, assess the impact of past management practices and help decide about suitable management intervention for future. Periodical updating and revision of a working plan is essential to keep pace with the trends emerging out of forest-people interface and to address national and international obligations. Therefore, the Union environment ministry has adopted a uniform code — the National Working Plan Code in 2014 for the purpose. The working plan for South Goa forest division expired in March 2021 and an extension for two years — from 2021-2022 to 2022-2023 — was granted by the .Union environment ministry. Further, the working plan of North Goa forest division is valid up to March 2022, following extension. Hence, the revision of working plans of both the divisions is to be taken up immediately, the cabinet note said. Although the preliminary working plan report (PWPR) of the South Goa division has been approved by the standing consultative committee (SCC), the revision in the plan slowed down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Another factor that affected the work is that the staff of the working plan division and both the territorial divisions are fully engaged in review of the private forest as per NGT directive and extensive field verification is being undertaken in a time-bound manner. “In view of intensive involvement of both the territorial divisions and working plan divisions in review of private forests in Goa, it was considered to seek technical assistance for the revision of working plan of South Goa division and North Goa division from reputed external agencies with expertise and technical experience in forest management,” the cabinet note said. A senior officer said that IWST was requested to send the technical and financial proposals to take up the preparation of the working plans of the forest divisions of Goa. On August 12, the IWST consented to provide technical assistance and submitted detailed technical and financial proposals as per the National Working Plan Code 2014, for both the territorial divisions with a total financial outlay of Rs 35 lakh. As per the proposal, the IWST will take up all the field works like survey, field data collection, data analysis, geospatial analysis and mapping and writing a draft working plan. The institute will also support development of a preliminary working plan report (PWPR) in parallel to the sampling exercise for all the divisions in consultation with the working plan officer and facilitate submission of the PWPR to the regional office, environment ministry, Bengaluru, for approval. The timeline for the entire work proposed by the agency is 10 months from the stage of inception of the workshop to incorporation of feedback and comments and finalisation of the working plan. The working plan for South Goa forest division expired in March 2021 and an extension for two years — from 2021-2022 to 2022-2023 — was granted by the . Union environment ministry. Further, the working plan of North Goa forest division is valid up to March 2022, following extension||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/karnataka-institute-to-prepare-forest-working-plans/articleshow/88553842.cms||TNN

With the curfew imposed at 11pm, restaurateurs say they will be forced to shut early and this will hurt their business, especially at a time people tend to venture out late in the night. Narendra Somani, president, HRA, Gujarat, said, “New Year and Christmas is the time of the year when people like venturing out late at night to enjoy the weather and spend time with friends and family. However, with the new restrictions, people will be forced to shut shop by 10pm because their staff will have to leave. This will bring down the number of customers and hurt business.” “Rumour mongering has already caused a decline in footfalls at restaurants,” he added. Lack of clarity on delivery timings has also hurt food businesses over the past few days. “There is no clarity on whether food delivery is allowed till midnight. This will reduce footfalls in the evenings, which account for the maximum business. At a time when people venture out in the evenings, we will truly lose our season’s business,” said Dilip Thakkar, an Ahmedabad-based restaurateur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/night-curfew-to-cut-hotel-restaurant-business-by-20/articleshow/88531023.cms||---

In a letter to ICAI vice-president Vijender Sharma, he said Hindi medium students are allowed to attempt section A in online mode. For section B, C and D, answer sheet will be provided by the institute to attempt questions at the examination centre which must be submitted to the invigilator before leaving. For them, the physical answer sheet will be considered for final evaluation.”“Only Hindi medium applicants are eligible for this. They are required to mention their registration number and other mandatory details on physical answer sheet only at the space provided,” the instruction in the notification added. Venkatesan said that it is clear from above instructions that Hindi medium students have been given the opportunity of their physical answer sheet being considered for evaluation. Candidates of English medium have to type the descriptive answers in Sections C and D, which may consume more time. More over, the mark pattern has also been changed from 60/100 earlier for multiple choice questions to 40/100, which has also caused concern for English medium candidates who have to type answers for theoretical parts. The discrimination will put non-Hindi medium students in a disadvantageous position, he said. Thousands of candidates are yet to write examination and this discrimination has to be set right before that, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-alleges-bias-against-non-hindi-candidates-writing-cma-exam/articleshow/88531005.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: 17 years on, Ernakulam police identify Ripper Jayanandan as killer||KOCHI: Seventeen years after the gruesome murder of a woman and her relative at Ponekkara near here, the Ernakulam unit of state crime branch (CB) has identified serial killer Ripper Jayanandan as the person behind the murders. CB has recorded the arrest of the accused, KP Jayanandan alias Ripper Jayanandan. The case pertains to the murders of a 74-year-old woman –– who was bludgeoned to death and sexually assaulted ––and that of her elder sister’s son, a 60-year-old. The man too was clubbed to death. As much as 44 sovereigns of gold and silver coins weighing 15 grams were stolen from the house at Chendankulangara in Ponekkara where the murders took place on May 30, 2004. Although the CB which took over the investigation had questioned Jayanandan who had committed similar crimes in Mala, Paravoor and Kodungalloor regions, they were unable to connect him to the murder back then. Police said that after 16 years, the accused admitted his involvement to his cellmate at the Thiruvananthapuram high security prison, where the duo and another inmate had been living for the past one year. “In the light of him sharing some details with some convicts with whom we had been maintaining a liaison, based on their extra-judicial confession and 164 statement, we were able to confirm his role. He was awarded capital punishment for a murder committed at Puthenvelikkara and it was reduced as life imprisonment. Feeling happy on hearing this news, he shared the details in this case to his cellmate. With this, the crime branch has been able to solve this crucial case,” said crime branch ADGP S Sreejith. Police said that the neighbour of the victim who saw the accused near the house where the crime happened at around 1:30am has positively identified Jayanandan during a test identification parade conducted by Aluva Judicial First-Class magistrate-II. CB officials said that they were exploring the possibility of conducting DNA profiling in the case as well. Police said that the infamous accused has murdered eight persons in six incidents between 2003 and 2006. Apart from the Punthenvelikkara case, he has also been granted life imprisonment for murdering a woman in Vadakkekara. He has around 15 other robbery-theft cases against him as well and was convicted in eight cases. He was convicted for escaping from Viyyur Central Jail in 2007, Kannur Central Jail in 2010 and Poojappura Central Jail in 2013. Police said that most of Jayanandan’s victims were the elderly. He used to steal the ornaments of the victims. In one case, he had severed the palm of the victim to steal her bangles. He used to sexually assault his female victims as well. In most cases, he used to club the victims on their head using rods or iron tools found in the area as weapons. He used to try not to leave behind obvious evidence, police said. The man used to wear socks on his hands while committing the crime. He had poured kerosene, sprinkled chili powder, and left the cooking gas stove on to try and avoid getting sniffer dogs in some cases, police said. In the Ponekkara case as well, chilli powder was sprinkled at the scene of crime, police said. The investigation in this case is ongoing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/17-years-on-police-identify-ripper-jayanandan-as-killer/articleshow/88531039.cms||---

However, they said that quarantine measures for international passengers need to be made stricter to prevent spread of the Omicron variant. “We had already submitted a request to the state government seeking a booster dose, so definitely the announcement is welcome. Unless authorized bodies recommend otherwise, the booster dose should be of the same vaccine as the other two doses. There can ideally be a minimum of six months’ gap after the second dose or time of natural infection,” said Dr K Senthil, state president, TNGDA. The IMA Madurai has also welcomed the announcement on booster dose and vaccination for children between 15-18 years. Dr V N Alagavenkatesan, president-elect, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Madurai, further said that though research is still awaited, changing the type of Covid-19 vaccine by mixing and matching for the booster dose may be suggested for better protection. On the other hand, both TNGDA and IMA are also urging the government for stricter quarantine measures for international passengers to ensure prevention of spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu. “International passengers must not be chased around after they test Covid-19 positive. Two swabs must be taken from all passengers, as and when they arrive at airports. They must be put strictly under institutional quarantine at a Covid-19 care centre or hotel for 15 days. Only when both swab tests return, they must be allowed to go out. If we can prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, we would not need any unnecessary lockdowns,” said Dr Alagavenkatesan. Dr Senthil also said that institutional quarantine is necessary because in case of Omicron variant, often the symptoms are mild. “Home quarantine is not advisable as the symptoms are mild and the public may be tempted to not follow it strictly, especially as the Omicron variant spreads quickly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/doctors-welcome-booster-dose-but-ask-for-stricter-quarantine/articleshow/88531011.cms||---

The woman, identified as R Kavitha, wife of Ravi Kumar, a prisoner lodged in the Dindigul district jail, started the protest in the morning stating that bribery was prevalent in the jail and that prisoners were not even being given proper food. “Jailer Rajendran has always been demanding Rs 1,000-2,000 to allow family members to talk to prisoners. Today, when I talked to my husband, he told me that around 150 prisoners, including him, were not being given proper food and were starving. Prisoners are being mistreated. I demand for an investigation,” she told reporters. The Dindigul Town West Police who arrived on the spot held talks with the woman and assured her to look into the allegations. Kavitha also presented an audio clip, which she claimed was that of Jailer Rajendran asking her to send the bribe money to his bank account by giving his account number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/prisoners-wife-protests-bribery-by-jail-staff/articleshow/88531033.cms||---

Newly reported daily cases, which breached the 100 barrier for the first time in almost three months, included TMC vice-president and Rajya Sabha MP Luizinho Faleiro and actor Ranvir Shorey's 10-year-old son. A health official said contact tracing was being "vigorously" carried out to identify and isolate all those who were with those testing positive after attending the two weddings. Health centres that recorded a rise in infections included Margao, Cansaulim, Chinchinim and Cortalim. The caseload in Panaji was 68, the highest among all such units. Ahead of the devastating second wave of the pandemic from March to June, three high-profile Goa weddings had played a role in cases soaring in Goa, sources said. MP Faleiro said he had isolated himself on doctor’s advice. He instructed all those who had been in contact with him to get tested at the earliest. With assembly polls months away, there has been a rise in political meets and gatherings in Goa. Faleiro's MP colleague and TMC national spokesperson Derek O’Brien, who visited Goa recently, tested positive in Kolkata and is isolating at home, he tweeted on Tuesday. Actor Ranvir Shorey announced on Twitter that his son tested positive during a routine RT-PCR screening for a return flight from Goa. "We are both completely asymptomatic and have immediately quarantined until further investigations. The wave is real," he wrote. Since September 30, when Goa recorded 113 cases, the state witnessed a clear drop in infections. For October, the daily average was between 50 to 80 on most days. Throughout November, the daily tally remained less than 50. Goa has seen a jump in cases since Friday even as tests done were less than 2,000 each day. On Tuesday, the daily case positivity rate was 4% for 2,776. Goa, along with poll bound states, has been instructed to ramp up Covid testing. With a single mortality, the fatality count increased to 3,521,and recovery rate was 97.75%. As many as 41 recoveries were recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/s-goa-weddings-blamed-as-cases-double-in-24-hrs/articleshow/88553851.cms||---

The order was passed on a complaint by Sanjay and Shailaja Gaikwad who sought not only direction to Omkar Realtors and Developers to hand over possession of the flat and to pay interest for delayed possession, but also Rs 2 crore compensation for the “mental torture and agony” caused to them. The Gaikwads had booked a flat on the 46th floor of tower C of Omkar 1973 Worli on June 27, 2017, and were to get possession on June 30, 2019. They paid Rs 21 crore of the total consideration of Rs 24.5 crore and Rs 1.22 crore towards stamp duty and registration charges. However, Omkar failed to hand over the flat. The couple urged interest from June 30, 2019, till the actual date of possession. Their complaint said that the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act, 1963 allows only six months of extension for reasons beyond the promoter’s control. Hence such extension, because of force majeure conditions, can be extended only up to December 31, 2019, and not beyond. Omkar “unilaterally and unlawfully” extended the timeline of completion till June 30, 2021. Omkar replied that June 30, 2021, due date for possession was declared on the RERA website due to various factors, including pace of construction. The Gaikwads were informed that due to reasons beyond their control, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the flat would be handed over as per the revised date. Omkar said Gaikwads’ claim for compensation is premature and must be dismissed with exemplary costs. It pointed out that under Section 71 of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, compensation claim has to be dealt with by MahaRERA’s adjudicating officer. But Gaikwad’s advocate Godfrey Pimenta referred to MahaRERA appellate tribunal’s decision in the Pankaj Agarwal case to contend that besides dealing with a complaint seeking multiple reliefs, MahaRERA has to also decide the claim for compensation. Agreeing with Pimenta, MahaRERA member Vijay Satbir Singh, in his November 17 order, said the couple’s main prayer for interest on delayed possession falls within MahaRERA’s jurisdiction and the claim of the compensation is secondary relief to the main relief as held in Agarwal’s case. “In view of these facts...MahaRERA has jurisdiction to try and entertain this complaint on merits,” Singh concluded, and directed the matter to be listed for regular hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharera-can-decide-payout-for-mental-agony-to-flat-buyers/articleshow/88532646.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Kanpur||Kanpur's perfume businessman Piyush Jain spent the night lying on jail floor||KANPUR: Perfume businessman Piyush Jain, who had allegedly stashed unaccounted cash at his various premises, was sent to jail in 14-days judicial custody by the remand magistrate of Kanpur court where he was produced by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) team on Monday. Piyush has been arrested under Section 132 of the CGST Act. Photos: Rs 284 crore seized from Kanpur perfume trader’s residencesRemand magistrate, Yogita Kumar, in her order observed that application of judicial custody remand moved by senior intelligence officer DGGI Zonal unit Ahmedabad was allowed and the objection on remand was rejected. Earlier, senior intelligence officer DGGI Zonal unit, Ahmedabad had moved an application before the remand court and had pleaded that the alleged accused should not be granted bail till computation of the investigation was not over and might be remanded to judicial custody. The counsel for Piyush Jain objected strongly and pleaded that the conditions of Section 41 of CrPC were not followed and there were loopholes in the arrest procedure. The presiding judge in her order observed that the matter involves the recovery of huge amounts of money and for proper investigation, it appears just reasonable that accused Piyush Jain be remanded in judicial custody. The defence counsel during the court proceedings also presented the bail application of Piyush Jain filed by his son-in-law Neeraj Jain of Ranchi, Jharkhand. It was stated that Piyush Jain was detained by GST officials illegally on December 22 and sought his signatures on several papers after putting pressure and thereafter displayed his arrest on December 26 and produced him in jail while as per law, the accused must be produced before the court within 24 hours of his/her arrest. Further, Piyush Jain was arrested under Section 132 (1)A of CGST Act-2017. As per the Act, the maximum punishment for violation of this section’s provision is seven years. On the other hand, Section 41 (1) CrPC states that if the sentence is of seven years, then there is no need to arrest the accused. The DGGI team had depicted an estimated penalty of Rs 52 crore and Piyush Jain had given his consent to deputy registrar DGGI, Ahmedabad to pay the penalty and for making the payment he had already asked the State Bank of India to pay Rs 52 crore from the deposited amount to clear his liability and penalty. Under these circumstances, there was no need to make his arrest, and his judicial custody remand be rejected, it was pleaded. The counsel further pleaded that Piyush Jain was suffering from various diseases such as blood pressure, blood sugar. His unlawful detention had enhanced his blood pressure and his life was in danger in the absence of proper medical assistance. Citing a ruling of Madras High Court, the counsel pleaded that the High Court had clearly stated that arrest could be reasonable only after proper computation of liability, therefore, Piyush Jain should be released and remand application of the prosecution be rejected. Piyush Jain was officially arrested by the DGGI team on Sunday night when huge cash and gold along with sandal oil stock was recovered from his possession from his houses and business establishments in Kanpur and Kannauj. According to sources, the DGGI team had taken him to CGST office in Sarvodaya Nagar and later in the night shifted him to Kakadeo police station. As per police station sources, accused Piyush Jain was kept in the Women Helpline room on the premises of Kakadeo police station. “Piyush remained awake for the whole night. In the morning, he however, had his breakfast,” said sources further. The DGGI team in the morning took him to Lala Lajpat Rai hospital for medical examination and later after a short visit to Ursala Hospital, he was brought back to Sarvodya Nagar office of CGST. Later under heavy security, he was produced before the court. The media persons tried to interview Piyush Jain, but he did not speak to anyone. To recall, a joint team of the Income Tax and the Directorate General of GST Intelligence conducted a raid at Piyush Jain’s Kanpur’s Anandpuri house last week. The raid lasted for over 120 hours. He was in Delhi at the time for his father’s treatment. He was asked to reach the raid site and arrested after 50 hours of interrogation. A huge recovery of cash amounting to nearly Rs 284 crore and gold and silver were seized during the raid. Documents with regard to 16 expensive properties were also found during the raid. Four of these properties are in Kanpur, seven in Kannauj, two in Mumbai and one in Delhi. Two properties have been traced in Dubai. The Central agencies found 18 lockers in a cellar at Piyush Jain’s ancestral house in Chhipaiti area of Kannauj. They also found a bunch of around 500 keys which they used to open the lockers. Piyush Jain used to run his business at Kanpur’s ‘Attar Wali’ Gali, known for its perfume trade. He has offices in Kannauj, Kanpur and Mumbai. During the Kanpur raid, the Income Tax department also found around 40 shell companies through which Jain used to do his business. Earlier, acting on specific inputs, the Ahmedabad unit of the GST Intelligence initiated a search operation on the factory premises of Kanpur’s Trimurti Fragrance Private Limited and the office and godowns of Ganpati Road Carriers on Thursday. While Trimurti Fragrance Private Limited are manufacturers of tobacco products for Shikhar brand, Ganpati Road Carriers is involved in the transportation of goods. The officials said that the transporter would generate multiple fake invoices in the name of non-existent firms to avoid the generation of e-way bills. After searches, more than 200 fake invoices used for transportation of goods without payment of GST were also recovered from the premises of Ganpati Road Carriers. An amount of Rs 1.01 crore in cash has allegedly been seized from the possession of the transporter. The residential premises of businessman Piyush Jain in Kanpur’s Anandpuri locality was also searched. Jain, who is a partner in Odochem Industries in Uttar Pradesh’s Kannauj, supplied perfumery compounds with transactions mostly in cash. During the searches at the residential premises of Piyush Jain, huge amounts of cash, wrapped in paper, were found. The money was linked to the dispatch of goods via fake invoices and without e-way bills by the goods transporter, officials had stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/piyush-jain-sent-to-jail-in-14-day-judicial-custody/articleshow/88531049.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Goa||Experts: Curbs needed now to avoid another severe wave||Panaji: Goa will have to act fast and start testing all travellers irrespective of their vaccination status, experts said. Eyebrows have also been raised as to why when Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala have imposed restrictions, Goa government has been lax even to implement existing Covid protocols, reports Bindiya Chari. They said the government has been dilly-dallying even as there has been an influx of tourists for the end of the year as welll as increased elections activities. Health experts feel that some rise in cases is inevitable in Goa considering the infectivity of Omicron. However, as of Tuesday, Goa had a single case of the variant. The state has reported a rise in cases since Friday and over the last 48 hours, cases have doubled. With 112 fresh infections on Tuesday, its active caseloads touched 535. Consultant pathologist Dr Eugene D’Souza said, “The Omicron variant infecting Goa or for that matter India is inevitable. It will happen. With quarantining people, we are trying to flatten the wave. With elections happening, we can even expect a sharper peak. Even if just 1% of the total cases require hospitalisation, and if the volume of infections is big, we will be in trouble.” Though most cases are likely to be with mild symptoms, D’Souza said that symptomatic patients and those having severe comorbidities will still need medical attention. “If cases are spread out then the management becomes easier. My colleagues in South Africa are also of the similar opinion,” he said. A senior government doctor said the rise in cases has been a warning bell, and if the government chooses to be aloof till all hell breaks loose then be prepared to be hit by another severity of the pandemic. “My colleagues in the UK have told me that they are facing a problem because too many cases were reported at one point of time. The healthcare system has been overwhelmed,” said D’Souza. Dr Anil Mehndiratta, a chest physician said, “As of now there has been nothing to worry about, but yes, we might have a difficult period later.” Looking at the developments in UK and Europe, where it is not just Omicron, but the Delta variant too which is at play, people need to be cautious. “Mortalities have not increased but hospital admissions have because of both Omicron and Delta variants. We are not doing genomic sequencing for locals and so we will not know the actual scenario with regards to Omicron. Initially, we were told that Delta was less virulent but later everybody was proved wrong,” he said. “I hope, the predictions of experts that we might get a milder third wave are right,” said Mehndiratta, urging people to take further precautions. D’Souza highlighted the need to be careful since Omicron has been noted to have an immune escape and can infect fully-vaccinated individuals. He said, “The fully-vaccinated and untested travellers may have a mild disease but capable of transmitting infection to others during packed parties held in closed spaces.” “The only way to protect Goa from a sharp spike is to have 100% testing enforced at borders, railways and airport or submit a negative RT-PCR report done 72 hours prior to arrival,” he added. The coastal belts of the state has been packed with tourists, and crowding will continue till the weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/experts-curbs-needed-now-to-avoid-another-severe-wave/articleshow/88553865.cms||TNN

Almost 40 houses have developed cracks and some homes have been severely damaged. Some houses and farmlands in the region have already started caving in. “They are using machines for slope cutting and are flattening our terrace farms for making tunnels and the rail line for this project. This work has led to cracks in the houses of almost 40 families. We are living under constant fear of losing our lives to mishaps,” said Virender Singh, 48, who is the pradhan of the village. The district magistrate of Rudraprayag, Manuj Goyal, said Railways is in the process of rehabilitating villagers after their consent. “Around 19-20 families have been rehabilitated by the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) while the remaining are under process. They have agreed to give compensation with the consensus of villagers." The 125-km-long Rishikesh-Karnprayag rail line is an ambitious project by the Centre, estimated to cost around Rs 16, 000 crore. It will connect Rishikesh in the foothills to Karnprayag on the Garhwal hills. It will also feature an over 15-km-long tunnel, reported to be the country's longest, between Devprayag and Lachmoli. Villagers yet to get rehabilitated said that they would move only after their demands are met. “Most of the village's land has been acquired and now we are left with a few houses and cowsheds. Now, RVNL is asking us to move out to another location, saying they will pay our rent. However, it is inconvenient to move with our lifelong belongings, livestock, etc. to a rented room or house. It is not a feasible option,” said Devi Prasad Thapliyal, van sarpanch, Marora village, and member of the Rail Prabhavit Sangharsh Samiti, Rudraprayag. Villagers are demanding complete rehabilitation along with a job. They said RVNL had promised all of the above before acquiring their land. “We want the project company to give us houses on a separate land, along with employment to a family member from each house, as they had promised. Currently, barely four villagers have been given work. Almost two dozen adults await employment,” added Singh. Meanwhile, environmentalists have expressed worry. “A recent study of the Maletha village in Tehri from where a rail line is passing established that it will impact the life of farmers adversely. Maletha is famous for its fertile land. This project is based upon acquiring farmers’ land, therefore, it will cause overall disturbance to the ecosystem of the hills,” said S P Sati, an environmentalist-cum-geologist. Sati added, “The tunnelling of the mountains and flattening of the farms for the railway line would certainly hurt the mountain life and its rich water drainage system, apart from causing natural disasters such as landslides.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/work-on-rs-16k-cr-railway-project-leads-to-cracks-in-villagers-houses/articleshow/88530252.cms||Shivani Azad

State additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas on Monday told TOI, “The current number of Covid patients admitted in hospitals is 3,628 of the total 9,813 — only around 40% of the active cases in the state. The usage of oxygen supply for these patients per day is below 30 MT (metric tonnes).” State health minister Rajesh Tope had said last week the possibility of a fresh lockdown in the state would emerge only if the per day oxygen demand exceeded 800 MT. The state’s oxygen manufacturing capacity per day is 1,350 MT, but now 1,050 MT is being produced daily because of less demand. Of it, 750 MT is supplied for industrial use and 300 MT is reserved for medical use, including 30 MT for the treatment of Covid patients.  Senior officials of the state government stated that the industrial use could be reduced depending on the medical use. “As of now, the situation is very much under control. We as a state have a capacity of producing up to 1,350 MT daily. The demand is around 1,050 MT now and it is being divided between industrial and medical purposes,” said one of the officials. The peak requirement of oxygen in the state during the second wave of Covid was 1,700 MT per day. The state had then scaled up the production up to 2,000 MT daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/daily-o2-demand-for-ncov-patients-below-30-mt-govt/articleshow/88532353.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Goa||Goa CM Pramod Sawant cites tourism, refuses curbs to stop Omicron spread||PANAJI: Ignoring recommendations of the expert committee to impose a night curfew with immediate effect in view of rising Covid-19 cases, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday ruled out such a move, effectively putting tourism before public health. “We don’t want to disturb the tourism business, and if the positivity rate continues to increase, strict steps would be taken,” he said. “The decision to impose strict curbs to control the spread of Covid would be taken on January 3 at the task force meeting.” On testing, he said that on Tuesday, around 3,000 people did the Covid-19 test, and that the positivity rate has reached 4%. Thousands of tourists have thronged Goa’s beaches and nightclubs to usher in New Year festivities. While most of them have been seen flouting Covid-19 norms, authorities too have turned a blind eye towards them. Amidst all these festivities, Goa has witnessed its first case of Omicron variant of Covid-19. When asked if it would be too late to impose night curfew as most neighbouring states have already imposed the same, Sawant said, “Police, tourism department and collectors will ask people to follow strict Covid norms. Being a tourist state, we cannot take an immediate decision to impose a night curfew, and we have to give some time to them”. “Considering the increase in the number of Covid cases, we will have to take strict decisions,” Sawant said. “We are continuously taking reviews from the state administration, including collectors, health department and home department. Being the festive season, the maximum number of tourists will visit Goa till December 31, (when) the tourism business will reach its peak.” The CM said that as per the expert committee, 94% of the state’s eligible population is fully-vaccinated, and the remaining are hesitant to get the vaccine administered. “The task force committee will also deliberate on the population that is yet to take the vaccine, and a decision would be taken. If required, we would make it compulsory to take the vaccine,” he said. Sawant also said that from January 3, the Union government will make available Covaxin to the state to administer to the age group 15-18 years.“From January 1, online registrations will begin,” he said. The chief minister said that from January 10, booster doses would be made available to frontline and health workers. Also, he said that to test for Omicron, a genome sequencing machine will be made available at Goa Medical College and at the directorate of health services. Referring to the increase in Covid cases on Tuesday, Sawant blamed it on two weddings in which guests had arrived from London and Germany. Sawant also directed authorities to increase testing. “Those with symptoms like flu, headache and body pain should visit their primary health centre for the Covid test,” Sawant said, appealing to people to wear masks. Sawant also held a meeting with health officials and others to review the Covid situation in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-cites-tourism-refuses-curbs-to-stop-omicron-spread/articleshow/88553867.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Goa||Goa: Pratapsingh Rane hints at retirement from active politics||MARGAO: Veteran Congressman and Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane on Tuesday hinted at retiring from active politics in order to pave the way for the younger generation to take on the mantle. “I have completed nearly 50 years in politics. The time has come for me to take rest. I deeply feel that I should now take rest and give a chance to the youth,” the former chief minister said on Tuesday. “Goa is a progressive state, let’s take the state forward. Let’s encourage youth and take them forward too,” he said, speaking at the Congress’ foundation day celebration in Panaji. What’s significant is that Congress has already declared Rane as its candidate from Poriem. Congress’ announcement about Rane’s nomination on December 23, had come a day after his son, health minister Vishwajit, said he would contest against his father and defeat him. In a further twist to the move, a day later, Rane denied that the party had finalised his nomination, thereby indicating that he was in two minds about contesting the election for yet another term. Rane has never lost an election from Poriem — where he has won since 1989, the first election after Goa attained statehood. He is a five-time CM and has been elected for 10 successive terms. While the 83-year-old appeared to have been not too keen in contesting the 2022 polls even earlier, he had changed his mind after his supporters insisted that he contest. “I have to listen to my supporters,” he had said while announcing his decision to fight the polls, a day before Congress cleared his nomination. With Rane now publicly asserting his desire to “take rest,” political observers feel that Congress will now have to accelerate its exercise of finding a replacement for Rane. “Fifty years ago when I first contested the election in 1972, Congress was not that strong a political force in Goa,” Rane said. “Now, Congress has grown much stronger and has penetrated deep in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-sr-hints-at-retirement-from-active-politics/articleshow/88553874.cms||---

This raises serious concern for not only for health issues but for the women’s mental health issues too, a leading cause of maternal mortality rates. The national average is 53.8% while that of UP is 50.1% which shows that the region is comparatively in a better position though a matter of concern as almost half of the women in this age group are anemic. However, the figures in all the districts of the region barring Banda district have improved from the previous survey of 2015-16. As per the survey reports, Jhansi has 41.3% anemic women in this age group while earlier the figure was 51.3%, Chitrakoot 46.6% anaemic while previously it was 61.4%. Lalitpur has 38.1% while previously it was 49.8%, Jalaun 44.2% while previously it was 67.9%, Hamirpur 46.1% while previously it was 54%, Banda 52.2% while previously it was 51.1% and Mahoba 49.4% of anemic women while previously it was 64.8%. The data shows that Chitrakoot and Mahoba districts have performed extremely well and so have the others except Banda where the figures have increased. According psychotherapist Dr Shikafa Zafrin, anemia leads to change in behaviour of adolescents. It is also the root cause of anxiety, depression, anger and frequent headaches in them. “The anemic girls have a low self-esteem and cannot concentrate on their studies. It is important that it should be detected at an early stage by checking hemoglobin which can be improved by medicines and proper diet. It is not that only girls from poor families are anemito control it. Free iron supplement medicines and blood check-up facilities are available in all district hospitals, PHCs and CHCs. In addition, regular awareness camps are also beng conducted in the schools. “Red and blue iron tablets are available in hospitals and also with Anganwadis, ASHA and ANM workers. Tablets are also being made available in schools. Red tablet is for pregnant women which are to be taken for 180 days during pregnancy period while blue tablet is for girls aged between 10-19 years to be taken once a week on Mondays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/45-41-bkhand-women-anaemic/articleshow/88531060.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Goa||First Omicron case detected in Goa||PANAJI: An eight-year-old boy, who came to Goa with his father from the United Kingdom about eleven days ago, has been found infected with the Omicron variant of Covid, director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said. The boy is now the first case of Omicron in the state. The boy and his father have been in isolation at a state-run facility in South Goa, Almeida told TOI. Though the father tested negative for the Omicron variant, his sample will be retested, the doctor said. The condition of the boy is stable, she added. Meanwhile, the report of a 13-year-old boy whose sample was tested for Omicron came negative, but reports of more people are awaited. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the government will take steps as per the protocol of the government of India. “Necessary stringent measures will be taken by the government of Goa in public interest based on the advice given by the expert committee,” he said. All travellers coming from high-risk countries are tested on arrival at Goa international airport, and samples of those who test positive for Covid are sent for genome sequencing to a laboratory outside the state. Travellers who test negative for the Omicron variant are allowed to leave the isolation facility, but need to be in quarantine at home for the stipulated period. All travellers coming from high-risk countries are required to be in quarantine for 14 days even if they test negative for Covid-19 on arrival. On the eighth day, a traveller is made to under go the Covid test, and if negative, he or she has to self-monitor. While throughout the month Goa’s daily count of Covid-19 infections were below the 50-mark, a marginal rise was noted on Friday and Saturday. Almeida said they will intensify contact tracing to contain the possible spread of the virus in view of the Omicron scare. “Since we found positive cases among travellers, contact tracing has become very important,” she said adding that health services has also been trying to increase testing. “Normally, of the total tests done for the day, 50% samples are drawn from the local population, and the balance are of the travellers coming to Goa,” she said. The health services, she said, has noticed a drop in testing of travellers. “We don’t know why it has happened, but we will write to district collectors to see that testing at border checkposts happens properly. We will also sharpen contact tracing at our end,” the director said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/first-omicron-case-detected-in-state/articleshow/88531819.cms||---
---||Goa||BJP snubbing those who want to advance Manohar Parrikar’s legacy: Michael Lobo||PANAJI: Two days after launching his wife Delilah’s poll campaign in Siolim, science and technology minister Michael Lobo hit out at BJP, stating that the party has no respect for its karyakartas, and accused the party leadership of sidelining functionaries who want to take forward the legacy of former CM Manohar Parrikar. Lobo said that he has learnt that BJP will deny him the candidature for the upcoming assembly election, and that he would soon decide his future course of action if he’s not wanted by the party. Lobo also alleged that BJP is using one yardstick for deputy CM Chandrakant Kavlekar (whose wife wants to contest from Sanguem) and the Monserrate couple, and another yardstick for him and Delilah. In a scathing attack, Lobo said that “two people in the party” are finishing off BJP in Goa, and that if the central leadership should act against them else remove Lobo from the party. The minister said that karyakartas have no place in the party, and that BJP gives entry to those who can win elections. He also said he “is not in the race for a ticket”. On Tuesday, Lobo continued to campaign in Siolim for Delilah, who is BJP’s mahila morcha vice-president. “If people don’t want the Lobos, then we will be sitting at home. If people want (us), we will be there on the field and serve the people. We will go across the state to bring revolution, and this revolution will form the next government in Goa,” he said. “I have been in BJP for the last 15 years,” he said, adding that it’s a big party and he has grown in it. “We always used to say that BJP is a party with difference, and we have lately realised that it is no more a party with a difference. At one point, the party belonged entirely to karyakartas, but today, karyakartas are not at all important for the party. We have seen this in Saligao and Porvorim constituencies.” Recently, amid protests from its karyakartas, BJP welcomed former Saligao GFP MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar and Porvorim independent MLA Rohan Khaunte. Lobo said that BJP has told karyakartas that if they don’t agree with the party’s decision, they can leave the party and go. “These are the words of the party to karyakartas, who came to me and told me,” he said. “This party has forgotten values. The party is importing leaders to win elections. The party should meet karyakartas and repair the damage to the party.” The minister said the party should think whether its base would be strengthened by importing leaders. “People will go to vote with open eyes to press the EVM button. There will be a revolution in Goa, and we will be part of the revolution,” he said. He also said that when Parrikar was around, such words were never used for karyakartas, but the former CM had solved such issues amicably. “Today the situation has changed, and the party has become commercialised. When things become commercialised, it results in downfall,” Lobo said. “I have heard that I will not be given a BJP ticket to contest the assembly election,” he said. “The chief minister has not told me. BJP’s state president has not told me. Some people are telling me that I will be denied a ticket. The people who are telling me these things are also prominent politicians and newspaper editors. They tell us when we interact with them. These rumours should be cleared by BJP.” Lobo added, “I don’t have a problem (if I am denied a BJP ticket). For me it is enough that people give me a ticket. The people of Calangute and Siolim constituencies are with us and our agenda is to carry out development, whether it is self-development, constituency development, beautification or help those who are in the tourism sector. We will provide help to all of them”. Asked what he would do if denied a ticket, he said, “If BJP denies us the ticket, we will go where the people say”. He added that representatives of TMC, AAP, Congress and MGP have met him, but that does not mean that he will quit BJP and join them. “I will take a decision at the right time,” he said. Lobo said that he has not gone against the party, but told the party that there has not been basic development in Siolim constituency. Lobo said that the people don’t want the inauguration of big buildings, they want basic things including water, electricity, and roads. Taking a dig at the government for providing free water, Lobo said that the common man doesn't want free water; they are ready to pay bills if only the water is supplied regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-snubbing-those-who-want-to-advance-parrikars-legacy-lobo/articleshow/88553885.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Don’t take Punjabis for granted: CM to Kejriwal||Ludhiana: Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi inaugurated a sports park and a panchayat ghar in Rohno Kalan village, near Khanna, on Monday. He also addressed a public rally, where he lashed out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its national convener Arvind Kejriwal.Channi said his government had set the wheels of justice in motion by booking Bikram Singh Majithia and raids were under way to arrest him. He reiterated that his government was acting tough against the sand mafia and had already started the scheme of giving Rs 25,000 reward to anyone who gives a proof of any violation. Assailing Kejriwal, Channi said, “He should not take Punjabis for granted by building castles in the air. He should understand that Punjabis are capable of leading their own state and do not need an outsider like him. Our government is implementing the common man’s agenda, while Kejriwal is promising the moon. He should rather be working for the betterment of the aam aadmis of Delhi. He is good at rolling out lies. Before the 2017 Punjab Vidhan Sabha elections, he had assured to throw Majithia behind bars. But when AAP failed to form the government in Punjab, Kejriwal offered an unconditional apology to Majithia under the party’s letterhead. Families who have lost their sons to drugs will never forgive Kejriwal.” Channi said, “Chacha-bhateeja relationship of Capt Amarinder Singh and Majithia is now an open secret. The former CM has been issuing statements in favour of the Akali leader. Ever since I became the Punjab CM, more than 100 people-centric decisions have been taken. Punjab is providing the cheapest petrol and diesel in the entire northern region. Rates of power, too, are the cheapest in the country. Power bill arrears of Rs 1,500 crore have been waived, power rates for domestic consumers have been reduced by Rs 3 per unit, bills of Rs 1,200 crore have been waived in rural areas, water charges brought down to Rs 50 and rates for sand have also been reduced.” Cabinet minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli, in whose constituency the public meeting was held, said, “Due to the pro-people policies of CM Channi, a large number of industries are being set up in the state. We are making efforts to bring industrial units to Khanna and nearby areas. It would not only bring prosperity to the area, but also generate employment.”Fatehgarh Sahib MP Dr Amar Singh, Payal MLA Lakhbir Singh Lakha, zila parishad chairman Yadwinder Singh Jandiali, former ministers Tej Parkash Singh Kotli and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dont-take-punjabis-for-granted-cm-to-kejriwal/articleshow/88530274.cms||---

Governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union minister for housing and urban affairs and minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri will also be present during the inauguration ceremony. According to the media cell of UPMRC, PM Modi would first visit the IIT-Kanpur Metro station, where he would board the Metro train and become the first passenger of the service. He will travel upto Geeta Nagar Metro station and this will mark the end of his Metro journey. From here, the PM would proceed to the Railway Ground in Nirala Nagar where he would address a political rally. Also, from this same venue he would inaugurate the Kanpur Metro service.Ahead of the launch of the Metro services, Kanpur Metro trains have been beautifully decked up. All nine Metro stations have been tastefully decorated. The minimum Metro fare has been kept as low as Rs 10. After the inauguration, children of a primary school would be allowed to board the train and travel. On November 15, 2019 that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had inaugurated the civil construction work of Kanpur Metro. Followed by this, on November 10 this year, the trial run of Kanpur Metro commenced on the Priority Corridor in the presence of the CM, secretary, housing and urban affair, Durga Shankar Mishra, principal secretary, housing and urban planning, Deepak Kumar, managing director, UPMRC, Kumar Keshav and other dignitaries. All the nine stations of the Priority Corridor have been certified with platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). The entire stretch has been developed in accordance with the green building codes, which makes it safe for the environment. Due to its stringent compliance with the green building codes and parameters, it has been certified with the ISO-14001 certification for environment management and ISO-45001 certification for safety management. Earlier this month, the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), during his three-day visit from December 20 to December 22 of Kanpur Metro inspected the via-duct, track, PA systems, signage, safety, security arrangements, drinking water facility, stations and technical rooms. On the third day of the visit, the CMRS tested the speed of the Metro train which was found to be satisfactory. The CMRS visit was successful and Kanpur Metro was given NOC for the commercial run on the Priority Corridor. “The Kanpur Metro will run on the Priority Section from ‘IIT-Kanpur to Motijheel’ with three coaches. After the inauguration of operations by the Prime Minister, the commercial services for the public will be opened from December 29. The daily Metro services will be available from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Initially, ticketing with QR code will be available and later on, smart cards will also be introduced for the people. With the advancement in technology, the ticketing model introduced by us will enhance the daily commuting experience in Kanpur city to a world class level” said Kumar Keshav. He further said, “Metro is the safest mode of transit which will not only provide a comfortable, safer and secure travel experience but also change the way people commute every day. It will surely facilitate the women, children, senior citizens, public and ‘divyangjan’ with comfortable commuting experience. Kanpur Metro is affordable than other modes of urban transportation. It will save time and money by helping the passengers reach their destination without getting stuck in the daily traffic jams.” “UPMRC in the coming days will also introduce GoSmart Cards which will offer a 10% discount on single journeys. It will offer a contactless travel experience to the commuters. The onset of Kanpur Metro services will transform the lives of the people and improve the transport infrastructure in the city,” he added. Kanpur Metro will be the safest, most comfortable and a reliable mode of public transport in the city. Keshav also said, “The commuters will surely get a world class travel experience in Kanpur Metro. The credit for delivering the Priority Corridor within the stipulated time frame entirely goes to the hard working and dedicated team of UPMRC, contractors, labourers, workers and consultants. I also thank the people of Kanpur for showing sheer patience, support and cooperation in delivering the priority section of Kanpur Metro. The local civic agencies, traffic and police departments have also played a pivotal role in achieving this milestone.’’ The Kanpur Metro Rail Project comprises two corridors and has a total length of 32.5 km. The first corridor from IIT-Kanpur to Naubasta is 23.8-km-long while the second corridor from Chandrashekar Azad Agriculture University to Barra-8 is 8.6-km-long. The Priority Section from IIT- Kanpur to Motijheel of the first corridor having nine elevated metro stations is ready for revenue operations now. In spite of two Covid-19 waves, Kanpur Metro Rail Project maintained a fast pace of construction work and overcame all obstacles and challenges. The UPMRC team, contractors, labourers, workers, and consultants have been able to complete the civil construction work of the priority corridor in less than two years. As a result of this, UPMRC has been able to conduct the trial run of Kanpur Metro in less than two years. Simultaneously, the UPMRC team has been able to achieve the remarkable feat of commencing the revenue services of the Kanpur Metro in two years and two months. The trains of Kanpur Metro will be equipped with ‘regenerative braking’ technology which will save upto 35% energy in train operations. The regenerative braking is the main brake power of the train and regains the maximum possible energy and pumps it back to the system and thus fully utilizes the advantage of 3-phase technology. In addition, lifts installed at stations and depots will also be able to save energy with regenerative braking technology. These will have energy efficiency of up to 34%. All the Metro premises will have 100% LED lighting for energy saving. Apart from this, a plan has also been prepared to install solar panels at Metro depots and stations. The Kanpur Metro has been aesthetically designed and it will get powered by a third rail instead of OHE (Over Head Electrification). It will have a green depot designed for routine upkeep and maintenance of metro trains. The Metro structure has been developed on the ‘Green Building’ concept which along with saving energy will also have a water recharging facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/modis-new-year-gift-to-kanpur-to-open-metro-stretch-today/articleshow/88531094.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Mumbai||12-year-old rape survivor can end 23-wk pregnancy: Bombay high court||MUMBAI: A vacation bench of Bombay high court on Monday permitted a 12-year- old girl to undergo termination of an almost 23-week pregnancy caused allegedly by her rape. The vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Abhay Ahuja factored in the mental anguish continuation of such pregnancy would ca-use the child after observing that a medical expert team of JJ Hospital, appointed by the court to examine her, had also recommend medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). The HC directed the MTP to take place on December 28 at state-run JJ Hospital and directed the hospital to preserve the DNA of the foetus for purposes of the criminal trial. The offence was allegedly committed by her 22-year-old cousin. The 12-year-old’s father had petitioned the HC saying that she was a victim of rape and offences punishable under Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. He said her pregnancy was about 22.5 weeks old. On December 23, the HC bench of Justices Prasanna B Varale and S M Modak, who first heard the father’s plea seeking orders for the MTP to save the 12-year-old’s life, had directed the medical board to examine her and to submit a report in a sealed cover to the vacation bench on December 27. The HC had then also directed the hospital to arrange for her admission. The medical board, comprising Dr Ashok R Anand, professor and head of obstetrics and gynecology; Dr Vanshree Patil, professor and head of psychiatry department; Dr Bela Verma, professor and head of pediatrics department; and Dr Shilpa Domkundwar, professor from radiology department, submitted their report before the HC on Monday. The report said, “After careful clinical examination and psychiatric evaluation and ultrasonography examination, the committee has come to the opinion that at present only a minor anomaly is detected in the foetus...However, the minor (12 years old) is anguished with the pregnancy. Continuation of pregnancy in the minor may lead to pregnancy-related complications like anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension as well as increased operative interference during labour. It is also going to have a psychological impact on the pregnant minor with an uncertain future.” The report said that the minor and her parents have expressed their desire to terminate the pregnancy and are made aware of the dangers of continuation of pregnancy as well as abortion. Though at 22 weeks of gestation, termination of pregnancy carries risk to the pregnant minor, continuation of pregnancy would have both physical and mental stress to her. “Hence, it’s advisable to terminate the pregnancy in whichever institute the minor and her parents desire,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/12-yr-old-rape-survivor-can-end-23-wk-pregnancy-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/88532651.cms||---

He has asked his office to send all the university-related files to the chief minister’s office. “I do not wish to have any confrontation. So if there is something then I am saying take over the responsibility. I stand by my decision,” the governor said. “I am not dealing with university matters anymore. I have already given instructions to my office, send everything to the government. I have done enough against my conscience and I cannot continue with this anymore,” he said. There were reports that conciliatory talks between the governor’s office and the state government are going on to end the stalemate over the governor’s reluctance in continuing with the chancellor’s post. However, the governor has brushed aside all such speculations and made it clear that he was not ready to mend fences with the government. The governor and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan were engaged in open criticisms against each other over the appointment of the vice-chancellor of Kannur University.

The case has become a mystery and showed negligence on the part of a nationalized bank, which allowed the money transfer with a cheque from 2006. According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines of 2012, the validity of a cheque is three months from the date of issuance. Mayur Vayeda, a resident of Thakorbhai Tower in Law Garden, said he had gone to his bank in Nehrunagar as he wanted to withdraw around Rs 40,000 from his bank account. When the banker checked his account, he told Vayeda that he did not have sufficient money in the account. Vayeda inquired further and got a bank statement, which showed the irregularity. According to the bank statement, Rs 50,000 were transferred to one Pankil N Deval on December 21. Vayeda said that he had never met a person named Pankil N Deval and not even heard the name. As he further inquired into the matter, he learned that the money was transferred to the other account with a cheque issued in 2006. “The bank officers should check the details before transferring the money. They cannot allow someone to transfer money from one account to using a 15-year-old cheque. This is contrary to the guidelines of the RBI,” Vayeda, who runs an elevator business, told TOI. Vayeda also said that the bankers confessed to there being a mistake and said they would deposit the money back in his account. Ellisbridge police began an inquiry to know who withdrew the money using the 15-year-old cheque and whether there was connivance by a bank officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/money-transferred-using-15-year-old-cheque/articleshow/88531096.cms||---

Now his own party colleagues have started cornering him. Congress leader and Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu has come out in support of the policemen who opened a front against Sidhu on social media. Without naming Sidhu, Bittu said, “I have come across several videos of policemen expressing agony over the comments made against them. I am deeply hurt by these comments and want to apologise to all the Punjab police personnel with folded hands. It is my request to everyone, including political persons, to refrain from demoralising our police personnel who are heroes. They have always bravely stood up to save Punjabis.” Bittu said, “Whether it was the black days of terrorism or the pandemic, Punjab police personnel, from an SPO to senior officers, worked tirelessly for the safety and protection of the people. Instead of making such comments, we should salute their sacrifices. How will they serve and protect the people, including politicians, when we use such derogatory comments against them? I also urge them to ignore this incident and keep doing great work.”Bittu also uploaded a video on his Facebook page, reflecting similar views and was being hailed over the stand taken by him. Sidhu had kicked up a controversy when a video of him went viral on social media in which, during a recent rally at Sultanpur Lodhi, he could be heard saying to the public that Congress MLA Navtej Singh Cheema could make a police officer wet his pants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mp-bittu-tenders-apology-to-police-over-sidhus-comments/articleshow/88530282.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Jaipur||I believe in daily success with a big vision, says Archana Surana||When the Siliguri girl moved to Delhi along with her family, it opened two battlefields – gender bias and cultural conflict. Fortunately, she found a woman role model who gave her the nerve to face her the world hostile to women. “When I was in Class 9, I received an award from Kiran Bedi. It was a fleeting moment with her but she filled me with the confidence of a lifetime. Then, I went on to become the prime minister (head girl) of the school cabinet. With the experience, I developed a vision which groomed a leader within me at an early stage,” recollects Archana Surana, founder-director of ARCH College of Design & Business that offers over a dozen undergraduate and post-graduate courses on jewellery, fashion and interior design. Explaining her source of creativity, Archana says during her childhood days, she nurtured a fondness for rich textiles. While pursuing a degree in Delhi University, she found her calling and took admission in Fashion Design at South Delhi Polytechnic. But her entrepreneurship journey had to wait for a few years. She got married to Rajeev, a lawyer and shifted to Jaipur, a city rich with cultural heritage and indigenous crafts. “In a family where everybody was a professional, to start an entrepreneurship journey was not easy. I started off as faculty in a fashion design institute, then joined another one where I started a jewellery design course, a first in Rajasthan, and taught till I started my own in 2000. By then I had a deep understanding of building a culture of design-led skill courses. I had also done a course in contour design from De Montfort University in the UK to gain a world view,” says Archana. At that time, Jaipur was known more for colourstone than jewellery. Design was limited to traditional craftsmanship. Archana says her journey as an entrepreneur tracks the growth of Jaipur as a jewellery hub. “It was a humble beginning. From two rooms of my residence, I moved outside to Bani Park, Bapu Nagar and other places as the number of students in fashion, jewellery and interior design increased. By 2003-04, I used to get a lot of students from several states. Today, students from 30 states study here,” says Archana. Artistic sensitivity and intuition for exploring new trends not only rewarded her but also inspired her to dream big. She wanted a bigger campus, having all the infrastructure, labs in one place. That’s how the 65,000 sq ft Malviya Nagar campus came up in 2006. “I had never taken a loan in life. I grew the centres by putting in everything I earned. But the big facility needed huge investments. With a loan I completed the building in nine months,” says Archana. But soon she sailed into rough weather after the deemed university status was taken away by the UGC putting in jeopardy her graduation certification programme. That’s when she tied up with Pearson, the largest awarding body in the UK for academic and vocational qualifications. But Archana feels that her visit to the US for the International Women Leaders Mentoring Partnership Programme by the US State Department changed the way she looked at entrepreneurship. “There I met Geraldine Laybourne, an American entrepreneur and media icon who mentored, inspired and empowered me to develop strategic thinking. Under her guidance I focused on business priorities and set my goals,” recalls Archana. She says she gets inspired by daily accomplishments. “I believe in daily success and a big vision. A day with a plan-led activity seems successful to me,” she says. But her journey is not without disappointments. “A major professional setback for me was the closing down of the Gurgaon campus. It was one of my dream projects and had involved a lot of planning. Demonetization, GST and mushrooming of design departments in private universities convinced me to close it down,” says Archana. But in hindsight, she feels that it was a right decision to shut it given how the Covid pandemic has played havoc. Today Archana says her goal is to make India a world voice in design. “India is a beautiful place for design innovations. We have a huge treasure-trove of crafts, art forms and indigenous knowledge systems and living traditions which can be rediscovered through modern sense of form, function and aesthetics,” says Archana. Her dream is to build a design culture initiative. “This would encompass all walks of life, right from schools to higher education, management to governance, nurturing a design leadership,” she says. She is also coming up with design culture in the name of Pink City Design Confluence to bring thinkers, practitioners, educators, media and industry to form, reform, and transform the design canvas by 2050.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/i-believe-in-daily-success-with-a-big-vision-says-archana-surana/articleshow/88531104.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Jaipur||Doing things in the real world always excited me: Lata Rawat||A family with three daughters, no sons could have gone for constraining rules. “Far from it,” says Lata, explaining, “Rather, freedom filled our home atmosphere and we were disciplined.” Today, Lata owns and runs two schools and a college having 7,500 students, cumulatively. Being the eldest daughter of the family, it fell on her shoulders to set examples. “I would often tell my parents that I can do more than what the boys are capable of,” says Lata. Her father Pratap Singh was an engineer from the reputed VJTI, Mumbai, when IIT didn’t come into existence. He quit a high-paying job half way to start chemical import and gas businesses. “Doing things in the real world always excited me. After passing out of school, I wanted to help my father in his business, which was doing well. He agreed but said it should not affect my college education,” recalls Lata. The next seven-eight years were life changing. Lata had absorbed her affable father’s endearing qualities. She was fluid, dedicated and intelligent when engaged with the outside world. “I owe a lot to my father for the personality I have grown into,” reminisces Lata. She recalls how her father presented her to Ram, her husband, a merchant navy captain. “My father told my husband, ‘I am giving you my right hand’,” recalls Lata. With Ram, Lata sailed across the world. Job or business was the last thing on her mind. “Since Ram’s mother wanted to stay close to her daughters, we too moved to Jaipur from Mumbai. Couple of years later, one of Ram’s family members suggested that I start a school. That’s how Cambridge Court High School came into being in 1999,” she explains. Her approach of ‘explore, experiment, and implement’ has been the hallmark of her pedagogy which helped Cambridge Court High School build a reputation. “That’s how we went from 200 students in 1999 to 3,000 students now,” says Lata. In the meantime, Lata had developed a penchant for research and case studies in school education. She found resonance in many of them but wanted to implement them in a new school. Then came the Cambridge Court World School (CCWS) in 2016. The rise of nuclear families with both parents working had an impact on children. “There are many issues that need to be addressed. The most prominent one was the guilt in the working couples ‘Are we giving the best to our kids?’’, she explains. Answering several other issues of the working couples, Lata came up with the idea of a futuristic school. She calls CCWS as a day-grooming school where students are guided to win the challenges of life. With the school timing 9:30am-4:30pm, the child leaves home with the parents and reaches home at the time when they return. “When I introduced this timing in my school, people said I was taking a big risk but it turned out to be the best initiative that was welcomed by all,” says Lata. Similarly, Lata says when things don’t go in the right way, one often falls back upon hobbies. For her, it’s reading but she says watching TV is certainly not a hobby. “That’s how we focused on developing hobbies in school like playing cricket, squash, theatre, reading, archery, swimming, etc.” Again referring to research, Lata felt it was high time that students are introduced with the concept of emotional intelligence at the school level itself. EI also found a place in her school’s teaching style. “I ensure that every child who enters my school exits with not only academic excellence but also with the most essential virtues of life like having a strong character, amiable disposition, mindfulness and a habit of showing gratitude towards nature and everyone around,” says Lata. Learning never stops. One fine day, hearing NR Narayana Murthy’s ‘Communication and presentation skills are missing in youngsters’, Lata felt an urgent need to do something. And the idea to associate her school with the TED-Ed organisation came up. CCWS became the first in Rajasthan and 4th in India to conduct TED-Ed sessions for its students. On her next venture, Lata says she wants to do something for students who cannot afford a good education. “It will be a charity venture for the underprivileged children,” she explains. Both her schools and college are saturated now. Without giving details, she says, growth is a never-ending process. “However, I am now creating a model for students in post-Covid times who have fallen prey to distractions, gadgets, become disoriented and have lost focus. While her husband assists her in managing non-academic responsibilities, her highly educated son Aayush, daughter-in-law Priyanshi and daughter Aarna have joined the school, managing strategic operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/doing-things-in-the-real-world-always-excited-me-lata-rawat/articleshow/88531115.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The vaccination will be done on school premises with the consent of parents. The department is likely to know on Tuesday the name of the vaccine that will be made available by the centre to vaccinate children, said the director, Dr Ira Almeida. Other modalities are set to be worked out in the next two to three days as the health department starts vaccinations. The state is yet to receive vaccine doses to be administered to fresh target population while adequate stock is available to carry out regular Covid vaccinations, district immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said. The health department is also gearing up to administer booster doses to the eligible population from January 10 onwards. “We are looking to administer booster doses to about 40,000 healthcare and frontline workers,” Borkar said. To date, he said, about 93% of the population has been fully vaccinated and everyday, on an average, about 3,000 people get vaccinated with the second dose and about 500 to 600 with the first dose. Those getting vaccinated now are either freshly recruited staff of the hotel industry or those who have became eligible upon completion of 18 years, he said. It also includes those who had refrained from getting vaccinated earlier due to varied reasons, he said. Till Monday, the number of partially vaccinated people stood at 1.8 lakh. Borkar said they have no plans to conduct special drives to vaccinate either children or to administer booster doses to the eligible population. “We will have vaccination of booster doses at health centres as done on a regular basis,” Borkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/health-dept-set-to-vaccinate-nearly-1l-children-aged-15-18-years-from-jan-3/articleshow/88531845.cms||Bindiya Chari

Members of the Vata Foundation suspect that the trees were chopped off for road widening work as the stretch leads to the Kokapet Neopolis. “The trees may have been planted only a few years ago. If that was the case, the authorities would have known that they would face the axe in road widening. It’s always better to translocate these trees instead of chopping them off,” said Krishna.

Sanjay said this at the party office during the deeskha for job notification that if the state government does not take sufficient steps to issue job notifications, BJP MLAs Raja Singh, Eatala Rajender and Raghunandan will not halt the assembly proceedings the next time.  “People of the state fought for separate statehood in the hope of getting more jobs, but nothing was implemented. BJP will come to power next time and justice will be meted out. This will be the last job agitation in the state,” he said. The BJP chief slammed the TRS government for failing to issue job notifications claiming that “the government removed 12,000 vidya volunteers, 7,000 filed assistants, and 22,000 scavengers from jobs.” Objecting to the TRS government’s claim that the state has the lowest unemployment rate in the country, he stated that “chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced in the premises of the assembly that there are 1.92 lakh vacancies in the state.” He went on to say that during his padayatra, he received many appeals from unemployed youth who are struggling because they do not have a stable source of income. He appealed to the youth not to commit suicide, saying, “We will fight for one last time, and problems will be solved after the BJP comes to power.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/issue-job-notifications-within-a-month-bandi/articleshow/88531781.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court summons LIC chairman, top officers in contempt plea||HYDERABAD: Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of the Telangana high court on Monday directed LIC chairperson MR Kumar, Hyderabad zonal manager and senior divisional manager to appear before the court on February 7, 2022, to answer three contempt petitions that charged them with violating the court orders. The judge, while hearing three contempt petitions filed by A Srinivasa Rao, Ch Ramesh, A Ravi Teja and others, issued ‘form-1’ notices to the three LIC officers.According to Aka Venkata Ramana, the counsel for the petitioners, the case pertains to a1996 recruitment notification. LIC on July 17, 1996, issued a notification inviting applications from eligible candidates for filling up of 400 posts of sub-staff (peon) under Hyderabad and Secunderabad divisions but recruitment could not take place on account of court cases that went up to Supreme Court. Finally, LIC itself came out with an affidavit before the Supreme Court to the effect that they would complete the process of recruitment within six months. Accordingly, it issued orders of appointment to 393 candidates in 2012 and 2013. However, only 350 candidates joined. The HC in July 2019 directed the petitioners to make a fresh representation to the LIC management and also directed the management to consider their cases for posts that were lying vacant on account of the selected candidates’ refusal to join them. The management rejected their pleas in September 2019. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel M Surender Rao said that what the management did was a clear case of contempt. Advocate general BS Prasad appeared for LIC and conveyed that the management has some practical difficulties and sought some more time. The judge refused to grant more time and ordered the presence of the top brass. LIC mgmt facing cases in apex court too:The LIC management is facing separate contempt cases at Supreme Court too after it failed to take back or compensate the temporary employees despite orders from the labour tribunal, high court, and Supreme Court also. The management has filed six review petitions against the SC order which were all dismissed. It filed six curative petitions and they were also dismissed by the Supreme Court in February 2017 itself. All India National Life Insurance Employees Federation vice-president BNP Srivastava along with several other unions filed contempt petitions against LIC management. These contempt cases are also slated to be heard by the Supreme Court in February 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-summons-lic-chairman-top-officers-in-contempt-plea/articleshow/88531759.cms||---

---||Goa||Giant quilt exhibit of life in times of Covid drapes walls of Panaji church||PANAJI: The stark, white walls of the Church of the Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception of Mary in Panaji are now adorned in multicoloured hues as part of ‘Let Love Bloom’, a six-part quilt that comes together to form a flower garden along the walls of the iconic structure. The community engagement initiative inspired by the quilting tradition that exists across the world was launched by the Sunaparanta Goa Centre for the Arts in collaboration with the Corona Quilt Project, with permissions from the Church and the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP). It involves inviting people to submit their unique entries physically or virtually in the form of a 15 inch by 15 inch square using repurposed materials, which are then sewn together to build a quilt. “These quilts have evolved into large-scale community art projects across Indian cities. This quilt brings together over 3,000 narratives of hope, love, trust, friendship and, most importantly, coming together as community to rebuild, to reconstruct and to remain resilient in the face of the global pandemic,” Sunaparanta said. The project first began during the Covid-induced nationwide lockdown, with the aim of giving people across India a chance to express and share their pandemic experiences. A cloth square was the template; each person had to create a design to imbue this square with the intensity of her or his own experiences. Parish priest of the Immaculate Conception Church, Fr Walter de Sa, said it is a joint project of the Church and Sunaparanta. “We received many congratulatory messages. It is a community project and a positive initiative, and we have safeguarded all that is necessary. The church structure hasn’t been touched,” he said. “The project portrays the expressions of children, orphans, school students, and those from homes for the aged about the Covid-19 pandemic, and how this led us to show concern and solidarity. It also appreciates the sacrifice by doctors, nurses, volunteers and so many people irrespective of class, caste, creed and religion. Everyone came forward focusing on humanity,” De Sa said. Conceived as a way to connect people, the project captures the collective memory of this unprecedented time. By turning the quilt into the primary motif for creative expression, it provides a platform for people to come together and weave a story.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/giant-quilt-exhibit-of-life-in-times-of-covid-drapes-walls-of-panaji-church/articleshow/88531863.cms||---

The kids are eager to climb the treehouse and the only condition the school authorities put forward is that they have to spend time in it for reading. The school has provided various newspapers, magazines and books from the library on the treehouse, and also has tables and chairs in it. The treehouse, launched a week ago, is now a favorite spot for kids to spend their leisure time. Dijesh P V, headmaster, said that the initiative was taken because the kids were very eager to climb a treehouse when they saw one during a study tour in Wayanad before the pandemic. So the teachers thought of making one within the school campus, which has several trees. Besides Dijesh, all other teachers Dipin K, Regila V, Rejin C and Yajusha AK contributed Rs 20,000 to make the treehouse. Besides money, they spent time helping make the house. “The frame was made using galvanized iron (GI) pipe and the roof was covered with metal sheets. To give it a natural touch, the roof was covered with dry bamboo leaves and hay. Also, we made handrails out of bamboo. The tree is built at a height of 13ft and it has a room and a verandah. Around 15 students can use it at a time and there is a ladder to climb. We remove the ladder to prevent unauthorized entry after school hours. We also made a few tables and seats in the house. It took around three weeks to make the house,” Dijesh said. There are 79 boys and 56 girls studying in classes 1 to 5 and most of them use the treehouse. Teachers are always present when the kids use the house. “The kids are eager to climb the house and they are ready to read,” Dijesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/treehouse-library-in-this-school-kindles-students-reading-habits/articleshow/88531154.cms||TNN

Their accomplice is on the run.Police said, “The main conspirator of the murder had broken up with a woman, who later became friends with victim Tushar Kumar. This angered the former and he planned to eliminate Tushar.”Tushar, who worked at the AC market, had gone missing on December 23. On December 26, his body was found buried near Satluj river. The police have arrested his friends Robin Singh, 22, a labourer, and Kulwinder Singh, 23, who is unemployed and resident of Kaneja village, Meharban. Paramjeet Kumar, a kabaddi player and resident of Yashpal Colony, Nakeja Road, is at large.Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Varinder Brar said, “Robin had hatched the murder conspiracy with his friends Kulwinder and Paramjeet. The trio used to spend their free time near Satluj river and so they decided to take Tushar there and bury him. After they dug up a pit there, Robin called up Tushar and said he wanted to meet him as he needed money. Thereafter, Robin reached near Tushar’s house. They went to Satluj banks on Tushar’s bike. There, Robin had a spat with Tushar after which they strangled him to death.”While Robin and Paramjeet held Tushar, Kulwinder strangled him with a handkerchief.The police had initially lodged a case against unidentified accused for keeping Tushar in illegal custody.

Addressing the media, the citizens said that over the last five years, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (IPSCDL) has failed to provide any tangible benefit to the state capital. They have called for a probe into the functioning of the special purpose vehicle and have demanded to know how funds allocated for the mission were spent. Former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes, who is part of Citizens for Democracy, said that Urban Mass Transit Company Ltd (UMTC) was paid Rs 28 lakh for preparing the Inception Report for the Comprehensive Mobility Plan and Parking Master Plan for Panaji, but till date nothing has been implemented. Gomes, who gave a detailed presentation, said that Rs 669 crore has been siphoned off through IPSCDCL without any audit and accountability and under the guise of making Panaji “smart” while keeping the citizens in the dark. “The national Smart City mission website shows that projects worth Rs 669 crore were approved by the central government for Panaji under the mission. But there is no information about the projects under the mission on the smart city portal of the Corporation of the City of Panaji website,” Gomes said. Gomes said that IPSCDCL has started depositing funds with other government departments such as PWD and WRD for various works without any coordination with relevant bodies like CCP. “The tender process followed was flawed being tailor made to suit some contractors without fair competition,” Gomes said. Former scientist Joe D’Souza said that with no tangible results and Rs 669 crore of funds misused, a thorough probe is needed. Shailendra Velingkar, the son of former RSS Goa chief Subhash Velingkar, alleged that clandestine plans are being made to hand over the Old Secretariat to an off-shore casino operator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/smart-city-funds-wasted-needs-probe-citizens-group/articleshow/88531877.cms||---

The fiasco happened when most of the city residents chose Lulu Mall as their destination to spend the Christmas holiday. It made way for one of the biggest traffic snarls that the city has witnessed in recent times, choking even the six-lane NH 66 bypass road. On Sunday, the condition of the bypass road in front of the mall was in stark contrast to that on Saturday, courtesy of the police intervention.  The police acted early in the morning itself, installing traffic cones and no parking signs along the stretch to regulate the traffic. Sign boards were also placed to direct the outgoing vehicles from the mall to go through the underpass nearby to cross the bypass road without affecting the traffic along the main stretch. Sufficient number of police officials was also deployed in the area to manage the vehicular movement and unruly parking. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law & Order and Traffic) Vaibhav Saxena said that they are even toying with the idea of expanding the pay-and-park system to Akkulam region. The system already exists on other major roads in the city, including the MG Road, with traffic wardens trained by the police managing the designated parking spaces. However, any decision in this regard has to be taken by the city corporation. He said that the reason for the traffic jam on Saturday was due to the parking spaces of the mall running out of capacity. ‘’The mall had a capacity of parking 2,000 vehicles only whereas at least 5,000 – 6,000 vehicles were parked on the roads outside,’’ the DCP said, adding that vehicles were parked as far as two kilometers from the mall. Many people even parked their vehicles on the flyover nearby. As many as 66 police officials were deployed here to manage the traffic. This includes 46 officers attached to the city traffic police division and 20 wardens. The Assistant Commissioners of City Traffic North and South as well as Shangumugham sub division too reached on the spot to lead the action. Several vehicles were given parking chalans while those parked on the flyover were towed away. ‘’We will continue to issue chalans for those who violate the traffic rules’’, the DCP said. Currently all the towing vehicles barring one under the city police are deputed for Sabarimala duty. Once they are brought back, towing away of vehicles will also be intensified.  If that happens, the motorists can get their vehicles back only through the court, warned the DCP. The city police authorities have also requested the mayor to expedite the procedures to install the proposed traffic signal light at the junction in front of the mall as it would also help to keep the vehicular movement under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cops-bring-in-more-regulations-as-mall-visitors-clog-nh-bypass/articleshow/88510631.cms||---

Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing to ascertain whether they are infected with Omicron or some other strain.As per the local health department data, of the eight who tested Covid positive December 20 onwards, four came from United States of America, two from Dubai in United Arab Emirates (UAE), one from London and one from Canada.Health department epidemiologist Dr Sahil said, “Of around 5,400 international travellers who returned after November 26—around when Omicron emerged—nine have tested positive for Covid. Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing. They have been isolated and their contact tracing has been done.”The first case belonged to Haibowal and tested positive in the first week of December after landing at Kochi airport. He is the ninth case.The department officials said all the eight cases, which came in less than 10 days, were negative when they landed in India, but tested positive on retest after seven days.“None of the cases has severe symptoms. All are isolated at their respective places. A number of teams have been constituted to monitor international travellers. However, in a cause for concern, Omicron cases are being reported in neighbouring areas, including Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh,” the officials added.The experts said there is a need to exercise caution.“All the international travellers need to be monitored in the wake of the Omicron threat. The strategy remains the same: testing, isolation and tracing of maximum contacts of positive patients. The contacts also need to be isolated till their reports come negative,” said president-elect of Ludhiana IMA Dr Bimal Kanish.Reports in 4-7 daysThe officials said more than 50 samples were sent for genome sequencing and none has tested positive for Omicron. “Genome reports of the international travellers, who tested positive recently, are expected in four to seven days,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/8-intl-travellers-test-covid-ve-in-6-days/articleshow/88530332.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Goa||State’s +vity rate up at 4%, 465 active cases||Panaji: Goa reported 67 new cases of Covid-19 while the daily case positivity rate increased to around 4% as against 2.41 % recorded on Sunday. During the last two days, less than 2,000 tests were conducted on each day. The drop in numbers has been attributed to the festive season. However, the cause of concern has been that since Friday, Goa has recorded a rise in infections even as less tests were conducted. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said that they have seen a rise in infections during festivals. However, he said, the increase in cases recorded on Friday, Saturday and Monday, was insufficient to say anything conclusively. Betodkar said that during the last few days they have noted entire families testing positive after one had contracted the virus. The state will have to watch the Covid graph this week to see that the numbers are indeed rising, said another doctor. Meanwhile, Goa’s active caseload was 465, and with 51 recoveries, the recovery rate was 97.8%. Two patients were hospitalised during the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-vity-rate-up-at-4-465-active-cases/articleshow/88531874.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 80% jump in Omicron cases, symptoms mostly mild||NEW DELHI: The capital on Monday added 63 new cases of Omicron to its Covid tally on Monday, taking the total number of infections linked to the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 to 142. Till Sunday, the city had logged 79 cases of Omicron. So far, 671 cases of Omicron have been reported in the country. Delhi is behind only Maharashtra, which has reported 167 such cases so far. While every fifth case is being reported from the national capital, health experts said that patients in Delhi are showing mild or no symptoms. At the same time, they stressed the need for vaccination and following Covid norms. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of LNJP hospital, which is the city’s largest facility for treatment of Covid-19 patients, said most of those admitted to the hospital had very mild symptoms and were discharged without requiring steroids or oxygen therapy. “There is no need to panic regarding this. As of now, 85-90% patients don’t have any symptoms and others have very mild symptoms,” he said, adding that out of the total 51 Omicron cases admitted to the hospital till date, 40 have been discharged in perfectly healthy condition. Most patients are recuperating without oxygen support, Remdesivir or the need to be admitted in ICU, Dr Kumar said. “However, I would urge people to get fully vaccinated because those who were inoculated had very mild or no symptoms at all. Only those who are not vaccinated face more problems,” he added. Delhi reported its first case of Omicron variant three weeks ago, on December 6, when a 33-year-old man who had recently returned from Tanzania tested positive. The patient was admitted to LNJP, which was earmarked for treatment of such cases on November 30 and set up isolation units. To augment the capacity of institutional isolation facility in the private sector for Covid-positive international passengers who have travelled from or transited through the ‘countries at risk’, Delhi government later gave directions to establish similar isolation units on payment basis at Batra Hospital and Research Centre, Tughlakabad Institutional Area, Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj, and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital. “The cases that we have seen in Delhi mostly have mild or no symptoms at all. However, it is still early to deduce if there could be cases with symptoms too. That is why people should strictly follow Covid safety norms at all times and get fully vaccinated as soon as they are due for their second dose,” a health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/80-jump-in-omicron-cases-symptoms-mostly-mild/articleshow/88531156.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Ahmedabad||PM’s En Bloc Govt Change Sets Tone For Election Year||The year gone by was an eventful one in which the BJP leadership resorted to an unprecedented political experiment, replacing the entire cabinet from chief minister Vijay Rupani to DyCM Nitin Patel to the lowest ranked minister. What perhaps necessitated this unparalleled political shake-up was the fact that 2022 is extremely significant for the ruling party. Towards the end of 2022, the BJP will have to seek the mandate of the people to continue their rule after an unbroken 24-year stint. Going by indications from the central leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s "en bloc no-repeat" formula is expected to be replicated elsewhere as well. As the year on the calendar changes, the big question that will be on the minds of those who follow politics and governance will be ‘Can the BJP’s seemingly impregnable fortress be breached?’ Does the Congress have enough firepower to dethrone the BJP, which has enjoyed an uninterrupted stay in power for 24 years in Gujarat? If political developments in the year gone by are any indication, it may be a very uphill task. The BJP launched its preparations for the December 2022 election more than a year in advance. The biggest challenge of anti-incumbency was shrugged off in spectacular fashion when the BJP changed the CM and the entire cabinet. Electorally, it has pulled off some spectacular performances, setting up the ideal launchpad for the 2022 campaign.  On the other hand, the Congress has little to cheer about its performance. Its numbers in the assembly have dwindled, it lost control of the majority of district and taluka panchayats and the BJP decimated the Congress in municipal corporation and municipality elections in the beginning of the year. To make matters worse, the party was without a full-time state president and leader of opposition from March to December.  Barring a couple of occasions since its inception, Gujarat has by and large witnessed two-party contests in the assembly elections. Although both the BJP and Congress maintain it will be a direct contest between them, the election calculations have become a bit more complex with new entrants Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM). While AAP has made some electoral gains in Surat, AIMIM opened its account in the local bodies of Godhra and Ahmedabad.  As far as electoral caste and community equations are concerned, the battle lines have been drawn already. Congress has leaned back on its trusted KHAM — Kshatriya Harijan (Dalit) Adivasi (tribal) and Muslim — social engineering formula. The appointment of Jagdish Thakor, an OBC leader, further buttressed this theory. By appointing Bhupendra Patel as CM, the BJP is saying that the Patidar community is back in its fold. Put simply, 2022 promises to be an exciting year in politics. AAP tastes electoral success  In a surprising development, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) emerged as the opposition in the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) in February 2021. AAP won 27 seats against 93 of the BJP, leaving the Congress high and dry in the SMC. Much of AAP’s success in the state has been because leaders of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) that had spearheaded the Patidar quota movement, have joined the Arvind Kejriwal-led party. AAP state president Gopal Italia is also a former PAAS leader. AIMIM debuts in Godhra, A’bad The Asaduddin Owaisi-led All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) opened its account in the local polls held earlier this year. It tasted success in the Godhra municipality polls and even became part of the ruling coalition for a short while before the BJP turned the tables on the ruling coalition. Meanwhile, AIMIM also won a few seats in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and has been taking up people’s issues forcefully as it makes a bid to open its account in the legislative assembly. The majority of its electoral gains have been at the cost of the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pms-en-bloc-govt-change-sets-tone-for-election-year/articleshow/88531868.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Gandhinagar teacher accuses husband, in-laws of dowry torture||AHMEDABAD: A teacher of a reputed CBSE school in Gandhinagar has accused her husband and in-laws of harassing her for dowry. Filing a complaint with Sola police on Sunday, the 30-year-old said that she got married to the Gota resident in 2018. “At the time of marriage, my father gave gold and silver ornaments as well as Rs 25,000 in cash. From the second day of marriage, my husband began to abuse me. When I informed his parents about this, they sided with him. My parents also told me to bear with the situation,” she said. She added, “My in-laws went to Uttarakhand and I stayed with them for 10 days. They along with my sister-in-law used to abuse me. After returning from Uttarakhand, I began living on rent in Gota. My husband continued to abuse and assault me. When I complained about this to my in-laws, they said that my father had not given sufficient dowry so I must bear the torture.” The complainant alleged that her sister-in-law then started living with the couple in their house. “They forced me to leave my house. Last February, I became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter. My in-laws abused me for that as well. In November, they threw me out of the house. I have been staying with my parents in Motera since then,” she said. The teacher alleged that when she asked her in-laws to take her back, she was told to get a four-wheeler and cash as dowry if she wanted to enter the house. Finally, she filed a complaint under the dowry act and under IPC Section 498 (A) against her husband and in-laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cbse-teacher-accused-husband-in-laws-of-dowry-torture/articleshow/88531161.cms||---

Altogether, 185 students from the 2020 and the 2021 batches of the institute were conferred with their degrees together at the ceremony. “Despite being one of the youngest IITs, established in 2016, IIT Goa has done very well in attracting research funding. The institute has filed three patents, one of them has already been granted. It is testimony to its scientific abilities and potential,” Pradhan said. Being located in Goa and having signed an MoU with a French body for research in marine science, IIT Goa is well-positioned to become a hub for activities in the field of marine science and technology, said Pradhan. “I have been informed that several elements of National Education Policy 2020 like fractional credit, early exit options, emphasis on humanities are already being implemented at IIT Goa in various forms,” said the Union minister, appreciating the IIT’s efforts. IIT Goa director, B K Mishra, said that there were several challenges faced during the early years of the institute as it is operating from a temporary campus at Farmagudi. “Soon we realised that managing students from a makeshift campus and providing adequate facilities to faculty would pose several challenges to our growth. Hence, two new academic blocks, four faculty blocks and one workshop were built at the transit campus. One by one all issues were resolved and we marched ahead,” Mishra said. During the pandemic, IIT Goa adapted to the dire circumstances and adjusted its academic patterns to help students to deal with the difficult situation, the director said, adding, “Though we are still struggling to restore normalcy, we are working to emerge as a prominent national institute.” Within two years of the IIT’s inception, research programmes in engineering, sciences and humanities leading to the award of PhD degrees were introduced at IIT Goa in 2018, he said. “Despite various challenges like the pandemic and the space constraints, we have endeavoured to lay a strong foundation for the institute on all fronts – academic, research, outreach,” Mishra added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-can-become-hub-for-marine-sci-tech-activities-union-minister/articleshow/88531882.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Pothencode attack: Gang held||Thiruvananthapuram: The Pothencode police on Sunday arrested the three men wanted in connection with the attack on a man and his 17-year-old daughter at Pothencode in a road rage incident. Police identified the accused as Faisal, 23, of Koithoorkonam, Noufal, 27, of Velloor and Ashiq, 22, of Andoorkonam. Pothencode station house officer inspector K Syam said that the accused were taken into custody from a lodge at Karunagappally in Kollam district, where they were hiding. They were caught during the early hours of Sunday in a joint operation by officials of Pothencode police station and Karunagappally police station. The inspector added that among the accused, Faisal and Noufal had criminal history. Faisal was involved in a highway robbery reported near Mangalapuram in April this year. He was part of a gang that robbed gold ornaments from a merchant who was travelling in his car. Noufal was involved in a causing hurt case reported at Mangalapuram police station. It was on Wednesday night, the trio attacked Sheikh Mohammed of Venjaramoodu and his daughter blaming them for not stopping their vehicle for the gang to take a u-turn on the road. The incident had made way for heavy criticism of police as it was only a week before that a man was hacked to death in broad daylight at Pothencode. While the recent spike in criminal activities prompted the police to launch a special drive, two more violent crimes of similar fashion were reported in the district on the night of Christmas. The first incident took place at Kachani School Junction under Aruvikkara police station limits on Saturday around 9 pm in which a gang waylaid two men who were travelling on a motorcycle. The gang attacked them using crude explosives and sharp weapons. Rahul and Sajith of Kachani were injured in the incident. Rahul sustained serious injuries after being hacked on both shoulders. The suspects have been identified as Gokul, Sachin and Ashiq. In the second case, the Nagaroor police arrested 12 persons involved in a gang fight that broke out at Viswambharan Nagar near Velloor. Shyam, 26, Lallu, 28, Arun, 26, Vishnu, 30, Sajeesh, 28, Suraj, 41, and Lalu, 41 were arrested on charges of trespassing into a house and unleashing violence while Afsal, 19, Suraj, 22, Najeeb, 22, amd Abhiram, 19, were arrested for attacking the other gang in retaliation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pothencode-attack-gang-held/articleshow/88510645.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Five years later, Young Turks divided between BJP, Congress||In the run up to the 2017 assembly election, three young firebrand leaders shot into the limelight in Gujarat’s political arena: Alpesh Thakor, Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani. Interestingly, all three shot to fame through agitations in their respective communities, namely the OBC Thakors, the Patidars and the Dalits. Alpesh rallied the Thakor community around him by forming the Gujarat Kshatriya Thakor Sena and took on the government over the sensitive issue of liquor prohibition. Hardik Patel became convener of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti, which spearheaded the community’s agitation for reservation. Jignesh Mevani championed the cause of Dalits by holding numerous protests in the aftermath of the Una Dalit flogging incident of 2016. In the process, the three earned for themselves the title "The Three Young Turks". And yes, they did inflict electoral damage to the BJP in the 2017 election. Now, five years down the line, as the state faces another assembly election in December 2022, Hardik Patel is working president of the state unit of the Congress party and Jignesh Mevani — who won the 2017 election as an independent — is expected to formally join the Congress just ahead of the assembly election. Of the three, only Alpesh Thakor appears to have been pushed to the periphery of the political arena. And not without reason. He won his maiden assembly election from Radhanpur constituency in north Gujarat on a Congress ticket. Ahead of the 2019 LS election, Thakor quit the Congress and subsequently joined the BJP. When he contested the Radhanpur assembly seat byelection on a BJP ticket, he was rejected by the electorate and faced defeat. Since then, Thakor has slipped further away from the political spotlight. Having an OBC Thakor leader as GPCC president, the Congress will look to strengthen its base among Patidars and Dalits by putting to use the charisma of Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani. Only time will tell how much magic the duo can still work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/five-years-later-young-turks-divided-between-bjp-congress/articleshow/88531879.cms||---

On Tuesday, the department will place camera traps and seek help of the fire brigade to find the tiger’s exact location and bring it out of the mangrove thicket where it’s hiding now. “We have used drones and trap cages, but have not been able to capture it. We have asked the fire brigade if they can spray water using the hose. This can bring the tiger out of the spot where it is hiding now and help us tranquillize it,” said a senior forester. A senior official said though they have managed to trace the tiger’s location, it’s not coming out of the thicket making it difficult for them to tranquillize it. “We have secured the spot with three layers of nylon net fencing to separate the villages nearby from the site,” said a forester. On Monday, forest staff, according to chief wildlife warden Debal Roy, even burst crackers to force the tiger come out of mangroves so that it can be tranquillized. But, the efforts failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cameras-fire-brigade-to-help-locate-tiger/articleshow/88531188.cms||TNN

In the wake of rising cases, the state government issued fresh guidelines to district collectors directing them to focus more on contact tracing, samplings for Covid tests, vaccination and to ensure people follow appropriate Covid behaviour. In the guidelines, issued by principal secretary Akhil Arora, collectors were made aware about experts’ warning on Omicron,which is three times more infectious than Delta variant, while mentioning that in Rajasthan too, the cases have increased in the past few days. For effective management of Covid, the health department has alerted the district collectors.“Apart from vaccination, contact tracing and Covid appropriate behaviour, we have directed them to focus on sampling for Covid tests. Every district has been asked to ensure minimum of 500 samples collected daily per million population.

The girl who was then eight-years-old resided in the first floor of the building and the ground floor was rented out to a family. The accused, who is a relative of the family living on the ground floor, frequently visited the house. On the day of the incident, the girl went to the ground floor to collect the electricity bill. The tenant was away and the accused who is a deaf and dumb person grabbed the girl and flashed his private parts. The girl escaped and ran to her mother and police were alerted. The investigation revealed that the accused had pounced on the minor girl with the indentation of sexual misconduct. The court while pronouncing the verdict observed that the accused was well acquainted with the pros and cons of his misdeeds. His attitude shows his scant respect and honour for the legal system and morality and he is not entitled to get the benevolent provisions of the Probation of Offenders act, 1958, the verdict said. He was found guilty of offences under section 354-B IPC, section 7r/w8 and 11r/w 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The prosecution was conducted by special public prosecutor Vijay Mohan RS. The investigating official was V Saiju Nath. The police had registered the case and immediately arrested the accused. Besides, the investigating officer also seized the dress worn by the accused at the time of incident and was sent for scientific examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-gets-9-yrs-ri-in-pocso-case/articleshow/88510648.cms||---

Goemkars will decide in forthcoming assembly election about the ‘governance index’ of BJP government,” he said. “Whilst Goemkars were celebrating Christmas, BJP’s home minister was praising the work of the Goa government. Why do they boast of this ranking, is it because they failed to resolve the issues of Goa?” he said. Stating that Goans were wise enough to know the difference between good, worst governance Sardesai said, “BJP is boasting of good governance when it failed to resume mining and performed badly in financial management.” He also questioned whether selling Mhadei was good governance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-good-governance-ranking-a-poll-gimmick-gfp/articleshow/88531902.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: CPM campaign flays K-Rail detractors||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: To counter the campaign against the SilverLine project, CPM has decided to launch a door-to-door campaign to clear the concerns against the project. A leaflet detailing the project has been prepared which will be distributed among households. The leaflet says that there has been an unholy nexus between UDF, BJP and Jamaat-e-Islami to sabotage the development projects in the state. It calls for the people to be guarded against this nexus and rally behind the LDF government for creating a vibrant Kerala. The CPM pamphlet said that the previous LDF government had succeeded in implementing several welfare-oriented initiatives to benefit the people and the present government is focusing on improving revenue generation. For this, we need to develop both the agricultural and industrial sectors. Only through more investments can we increase the production capacities to generate more revenue for the state. However, it is a fact that the state lacks enough infrastructural facilities, a hurdle for inviting more investments to the state. It is in this backdrop that the previous LDF government strengthened the role of KIIFB in improving infrastructural facilities. In the last five years, several projects worth Rs 60,000 crore were initiated by KIIFB. SilverLine project is one such initiative for improving infrastructure facilities. The K-Rail project was initiated in September 2016 when the state entered into an MoU with the Union railway ministry. The project’s feasibility study report was submitted to the Union railway ministry and on December 17, 2019, the state received the nod to find out the investment possibilities for carrying out the project. The state government approved the DPR on June 17, 2020, and it was submitted to the Union railway ministry. This project was included among the central projects later. In 2021 Union Budget, it was declared that the project would be completed by 2030. However, now the Centre is not willing to provide financial assistance to this project and the entire liability of the project has been put on the state government. Hence the state government decided to source funds from various international banks. But the Centre has limited the state’s borrowing capacity to scuttle the project. UDF and BJP are actively campaigning against this project by misguiding the people. The fact is that this project needs only a line having a width between 15m and 25m. This is less than half the land required for a six-lane road. The 115km stretch goes through agricultural land, of which 88km is elevated highway. For protecting the rivers, riverbeds, paddy and wetlands, several elevated highways, overbridges, etc, have been planned. Of the total 530km of SilverLine, 137km line goes through elevated poles and through tunnels. There will be no hazard for the environment as propagated by the opposition parties. SilverLine does not go through any ecologically-sensitive areas. All the paddy and wetlands will be protected and no damage will be done to them. Only 9,314 buildings will have to be evacuated for the project and they will be given due compensation. Only 1,383 hectare land will be required for acquisition and rehabilitation of the people. For the land acquisition, Rs 13,362.32 crore will be required. The project itself has ensured the compensation and rehabilitation packages. The actual project cost is estimated at Rs 63,941 crore. However, the opposition campaign is that the cost is above Rs 1lakh crore, which is baseless. It is a fact that a state cannot progress without infrastructure projects for which the state will have to take loans. However, those opposing the project are ignoring the fact that this project will increase our revenue through tourism, technology and business sectors. The financial situation of the state will improve through this project, says the CPM leaflet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-campaign-flays-k-rail-detractors/articleshow/88531221.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Year of constant & change in babudom||Following the appointment of retired IAS officer M S Patel as vice-president of the Gujarat BJP, he has become a sought-after leader, not just among politicians but bureaucrats as well. M S Patel played a key role in organizing several Patidar community events in the past two decades and enjoys goodwill among Patidars and other communities. The BJP may look to project him as the new face of the Patidar community leadership, as several Patidar leaders have had to face public wrath in the wake of the Patidar agitation of 2015. More importantly, Patel and state BJP president C R Paatil enjoy a close relationship and Patel has been giving key inputs to his state party chief on matters of administration. As a result, many bureaucrats are looking to get into the good books of their former colleague. Interestingly, Patel’s name was almost finalized for a BJP ticket in the 2017 assembly election, but the move fell through. Rise of Rajiv Kumar Gupta through the pandemic Whether it be implementing the major part of the Statue of Unity complex project, tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in Ahmedabad city, which was the worst hit in the state, or heading the industries and mines department now as its ACS, Rajiv Gupta emerged as the officer the political leadership can fully rely on. At the pivotal department for the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS), Gupta has been overseeing preparations for the mega business summit which is to be held in January, even as he has initiated a number of steps to keep local industry in good humour. Gupta recently launched the open-house project, where department officials visit industrial units and try to address their grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/year-of-constant-change-in-babudom/articleshow/88531889.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Ex-cop learning to drive hits professor on bike, crushes him to death||KOLKATA: A 51-year-old professor riding a motorcycle was crushed to death near his house on Monday morning, when a former cop, who was learning to drive, dashed his car into him. The victim, Sunil Kumar Garai, a professor at a research institute, was returning from the New Garia market when the accident took place around 8.50am on New Garia Cooperative Road under Panchasayar police station. Passersby called up police and took Garai to Peerless Hospital, where he was declared brought dead around 9.05am. Locals claimed the accused, a former mid-level police officer, had panicked when he saw Garai’s two-wheeler in front of his car. Police added that the former cop, in his confusion, appeared to have pressed the accelerator instead of the brake. They are probing whether he had a learner’s licence or whether a trainer was seated next to him at the time of the incident. Garai, police said, was not wearing a helmet. The driver has been arrested. Acquaintances said Garai worked in Visakhapatnam and had returned to Kolkata barely three days ago. “His family arrived here on Sunday and he had gone to buy fish and vegetables from the market. He was returning home on a bike when the car hit him from behind. In the impact, Garai fell to the ground and the driver, in his attempt to speed away, ran him over. He was crushed against a tree. Garai’s head got stuck between the engine grille and mudguard. He was bleeding heavily when I managed to pull him out and called the police. Cops told us not to wait. By the time I could arrange a rickshaw and take him to hospital, my clothes were soaking in blood. I knew there was little chance to save him,” said Sk Rehman, who owns a tea shop. The accident spot is away from the thoroughfare. “We have registered a case for death due to rash and negligent driving. We might slap Section 3 (i)/181 of Motor Vehicles Act,” said an investigator. “The MV Act section is slapped when the accused does not carry a driving licence with him, not even a learner’s licence. This can attract punishment for the owner, too,” said a legal expert. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said the FSTP would check whether other sections needed to be added. This was the fourth accident in the pandemic caused by negligent driving by a novices. Last year, a person learning to drive fatally hit a woman on Panditiya Road. This year in June, a 74-year-old died in a similar way near Jodhpur Park. “It is a problem when people drive before being trained. The only way to track them is to check everyone’s licence, but that is next to impossible,” said a Lalbazar traffic officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ex-cop-learning-to-drive-hits-professor-on-bike-crushes-him-to-death/articleshow/88531224.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Allahabad||UP: No entry in Magh Mela without mask, vaccine certificate||PRAYAGRAJ: With seers, saints and volunteers of religious, social and spiritual organisations starting to move to Magh Mela campus to set up their camps ahead of the annual religious fair, Magh Mela administration have issued an advisory to seers, saints, teerth and purohits arriving at the campus to come with complete vaccination certificate. Mela administration has also made wearing of mask mandatory during their stay on mela campus. Moreover, mela administration have also planned to deploy medical teams at all 15 entry points of the campus for strict adherence of covid-19 protocols. District magistrate (Magh Mela), Shesh Mani Pandey, told TOI that mela administration has held a meeting with prominent seers, saints, teerth and purohit associated with religious and spiritual organisations, appealing that people arriving to attend the month long mela at their respective camps should be fully vaccinated. He added that visitors must come with negative 72 hours RT-PCR report and fully vaccination certificate for their stay at camps. DM also claimed that medical teams would be deployed at all 15 entry points and there would be vaccinating and covid testing centres at all first aid posts spread around mela campus. Besides, there would be regular testing and checking at camps of seers and saints during the month-long event. The Magh Mela health authorities have drafted the blueprint for ramping up vaccination and curbing spread of covid-19 during the 47-day religious congregation from January 14 to March 1, 2022. Strict measures are being planned after seeing the surge in the covid cases across the nation and people from all across the country are expected to arrive for the mela. While the health authorities have already setup a covid-19 control room that would function round-the-clock, half a dozen static booths are being set up on the area for collection of samples for antigen and RT-PCR tests. DM, meanwhile, said mela authorities have urged all visitors not to let down their guard in the wake of changing covid-19 scenario and to bring a verifiable RT-PCR report of not more than 72 hours, along with vaccination certificate. Mela health authorities have also roped in a total of 20 Mobile Medical Unit teams for sample collection. These teams would be visiting camps of different religious, social and spiritual camps on frequent intervals to collect samples. Random sampling will also be done on entry gates as well. The test reports will be compiled and maintained by mela authorities. Plans are also afoot to rope in a total of 12 Rapid Response Teams to take care of covid patients and to ensure their proper treatment at hospital after consultation with the district surveillance officer, said a senior official adding as many as 15 screening teams would been engaged to screen devotees at gates. A total of 60 surveillance teams would be deployed on the mela campus. Moreover, a plan has been chalked out to carry out proper sanitation in all six sectors. Frequent sanitization work would also be conducted at hotspots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/no-entry-in-magh-mela-without-mask-vax-certificate/articleshow/88531220.cms||---

In villages located on the Indo-Pak border, the campaign is being carried out on camels and tractors. Irrespective of the tough geographical and severe cold conditions, the health personnel are vaccinating the public. There are border areas in Barmer and villages that come in the Desert National Park region with no roads. Here the health officials use camels. Auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) Mukesh, deployed in Sundara said that camels are used for Covid vaccination, immunisation of children and even while administering pulse polio drops. The last village on the border is in the prohibited area of Desert National Park which lacks basic facilities. Mukesh said that she was deployed at the sub-centre for the last 20 months and there is no facility to reside here. People are less educated in this area, as such she sometimes finds it difficult to inform the locals about vaccination and other schemes. The people here do not understand the importance of vaccine against Covid. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya shared a photo of a health worker on a camel to administer vaccine on his Twitter handle. Jaisalmer faces the same problem. Looking at this, district collector Ashish Modi directed the health officials to vaccinate people deprived of first and the second doses. The chief district education officer also directed panchayat elementary education officers of all senior secondary schools to make people aware about the necessity to vaccinate against Covid. CMHO Dr Kunal Sahu said that special campaigns will be held for vaccination. He said that till now 85% of the population in Jaisalmer has been administered the first dose whereas 62% of the population has been administered the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/desert-dists-go-all-out-to-vaccinate-people/articleshow/88531207.cms||Vimal Bhatia

---||Delhi||Night curfew in Delhi: E-passes not needed for those exempted||NEW DELHI: With the number of new Covid-19 cases on a constant rise, night curfew imposed by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) between 11pm and 5am came into force from Monday. The order mentioned that Covid-19 cases and positivity rate had increased rapidly over the last few days, besides concomitant increase in the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. “Therefore, it is felt that night curfew needs to be imposed in Delhi with immediate effect as an emergency measure for the well-being and safety of people,” it added. Unlike DDMA’s order imposing night curfew in April, the current one has done away with the requirement of e-passes for exempt people. In April, apart from government officials and healthcare professionals, all others in the exempt category had to apply online for an e-pass, which was approved by the district magistrate. A few lakh applications were received for e-passes in April, out of which a large number were rejected as most applicants were not a part of the exempted category. Many had also filled the online applications incorrectly. Instead of e-pass, this time those exempt from the night curfew can produce any valid identity card that proves that they are engaged in essential services. DDMA has directed all district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to ensure strict compliance to the order. However, the order mentions that the restrictions fundamentally relate to the movement of people, but not to that of essential goods and services. There would be no restriction on interstate and intrastate movement and transportation of goods, both essential and non-essential. No separate permission or e-pass would be required for such movement. Apart from those engaged in essential services, others exempted include pregnant women and patients going for medical services, those going to neighbourhood shops on feet for purchasing essential items, those coming from or going to the airport, railway stations or ISBTs, and those appearing for academic or recruitment examinations or government officials involved in conducting it. Public transport such as Delhi Metro and buses in their stipulated time, and paratransit like autorickshaws and taxis have been allowed to operate during curfew hours. However, they can only transport those exempted from the curfew, while following prescribed Covid safety protocols. A night curfew is already in place in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Haryana between 11pm and 5am. Sources said the curfew would ensure that celebrations on New Year’s Eve and the days prior to it don’t lead to any crowding or “super-spreader” event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/night-curfew-e-passes-not-needed-for-those-exempted/articleshow/88531236.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Can’t forget Mother Teresa, will stand by her’||KOLKATA: Support poured in for the Missionaries of Charity (MoC) from different quarters, including an interfaith organization with representation from all communities. “We will extend all help and support required to Missionaries of Charity sisters and brothers in running their centres to serve humanity,” said United Interfaith Foundation-India general secretary Satnam Singh Ahluwalia. He told TOI people of Kolkata could not forget Mother Teresa’s contribution to society. “She gave up all worldly goods, slept on the floor, led a simple life and served humanity. She helped the poorest of the poor. We will stand by her organization at this time of need,” he said. Ahluwalia, also the founder of IHA Foundation that helped people with food through the pandemic and disasters prior to that, said no inmate of the MoC would go hungry. “Be it requirement for ration or meals or any other assistance, we will ensure that the Missionaries of Charity gets it,” he added. Though Missionaries of Charity superior general in a statement issued on Monday said its bank accounts had not been frozen, there was an acknowledgement the FCRA renewal application had not been approved, and hence, the centres had been asked not to use the FC accounts. MoC, which has chapters worldwide, gets volunteers and donations from everywhere. Though the arrival of volunteers has stopped in to the pandemic, philanthropists and the common man continue to contribute to the cause. “Funds for all the work that MoC does for the poorest of the poor comes from generous individuals across the world. This curtailment will be a harsh blow to their efforts to reach out to people in distress. This will be debilitating,” said Catholic Association of Bengal president Angelina Jasnani, urging the Union home ministry to find a way to ensure the poor did not suffer and at the same time all the norms of the FCRA were met. “If Missionaries of Charity is unable to use the FC account, all its work will come to a halt and the poor will again find themselves exploited,” Jasnani said. On allegations on religious conversion being cited in certain quarters for the rejection of FCRA renewal application, Sunita Kumar, a long-time associate of Mother Teresa, said she had never seen Christianity being thrust upon anyone in her 45 years association with MoC. “There have been allegations in the past, including those by British American journalist Christopher Hitchens, who called Mother a fundamentalist. I was shocked and angry to read the allegations because none of it was true. Mother Teresa wasn’t perturbed. ‘We will pray for him’, is all that Mother said,” recounted Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cant-forget-mother-will-stand-by-her/articleshow/88531238.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||2nd genome sequencing lab to start in Jodhpur from January||JAIPUR: To speed up tracking Omicron cases and other Covid variants, the state government is expanding its genome sequencing labs. It will soon start the state’s second genome testing lab in Jodhpur, which is expected to be functional from the first week of January. Currently, the only genome sequencing lab at Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital is functional for identifying the variants of Corona infected. The health department is maintaining that samples of each and every Corona infected should be sent for genome sequencing. “We are conducting genome sequencing of 50 samples daily at SMS medical college. Now, in Jodhpur we will start the same facility of genome sequencing,” Vaibhav Galriya, secretary health told TOI. So far, more than 2,120 samples have been tested positive for variants of concern in the state, including Delta, Delta-like, Kappa, Alpha and Omicron. So far, genome sequencing of 3,239 samples collected from different districts of the state has been done. Out of those at least 2,128 samples have been tested positive for variants of concern. Among those 75.79 per cent are Delta infected, 15.37 per cent are found to be Delta like, 4.04 per cent are Alpha and 1.79 per cent are Kappa, 1.36 per cent are B.1 and more than one percent are Omicron affected. A health department official said that since a lot of variants of concerns have been reported from the state, genome testing has become important. It is crucial to expand the network of the laboratories. Recently in a Covid review meeting, Galriya said, “The work on the genome sequencing lab is in progress and it is expected to be operational from the first week of January.” Tenders have already been issued and work orders have been given to speed up the project. By the end of December, the machines for the lab at Jodhpur will be supplied and the lab staff will be trained at SMS medical college in Jaipur. “We were sending samples for genome sequencing to Jaipur, but genome sequencing of our samples will be done here only,” said Dr Balwant Manda, chief medical health officer (Jodhpur).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/2nd-genome-sequencing-lab-to-start-in-jodhpur-from-january/articleshow/88531234.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Goa||FC Goa won’t change approach as they face off against former coach Juan Ferrando’s ATK Mohun Bagan||How do you prepare for a game where the rival coach knows everything about you? For a year and half, Juan Ferrando trained FC Goa and prepared them meticulously for all the battles. He knew every players’ strength, and weakness, and went to war with a plan. He succeeded many times. Now as Goa prepare to go to war again, they will find Ferrando in the opponents’ corner, guiding ATK Mohun Bagan, in what promises to be an intriguing Indian Super League (ISL) encounter at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday. This has been a strange season for Goa. They won the Durand Cup earlier this season with Ferrando in charge, and the Spanish coach left them to join ATK Mohun Bagan after just six ISL matches. “Our philosophy won’t change,” Goa’s new coach Derrick Pereira told TOI in an online interaction on Tuesday. “We will stick to our style. There will be few changes here and there, but the players understand their roles in different situations and different moments of the game.” Goa started poorly with three straight defeats and just when things were improving with two consecutive wins, Ferrando joined ATKMB, taking his former club by complete surprise. Pereira, the man who replaced Ferrando, didn’t make too many changes in his first match in-charge against Odisha FC which ended 1-1. However, with several players injured and three of them recovering from a bout of food poisoning, he might need an alternative plan. “We are working on what to expect from ATK Mohun Bagan and counter them and also look at ways to put pressure on them, create opportunities and defend well,” said Pereira. Goa will be boosted with the return of winger Jorge Ortiz from a two-match ban. But the defence, yet to keep a clean sheet after seven matches, will have to deal with former teammates Liston Colaco, Hugo Boumous and Manvir Singh. The trio along with Roy Krishna have combined well to score 13 goals. Ferrando has started well at ATKMB, tasting victory with his new team as they edged out NorthEast United 3-2. Even though the Spanish coach was in-charge only for a day, his new team played with more freedom and put on one of their best attacking displays. Last year’s finalists took 25 shots in their last match, the joint-most they have managed in a single match, and 20 of them were from inside the box, the most they have managed. They also had 647 touches of the ball, quite unlike the previous era when Antonio Lopez Habas was the coach. Ferrando knows his former side all too well but believes it will be a different team with a new plan, under a new coach. “This week has been strange when you prepare your team against your former team,” said Ferrando.“Normal occasions, you have time, days, but this case is very difficult. It is a confused feeling and emotions are difficult to explain.” Goa have experienced plenty of joy at Fatorda since the ISL kicked off in 2014. This season, it’s been different – the Goans have lost both games here, against Mumbai City and NorthEast United.  How they wish they can change the script, against ATKMB, coached by Ferrando, one of their own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-wont-change-approach-as-they-face-off-against-former-coach-juan-ferrandos-atk-mohun-bagan/articleshow/88553332.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Allahabad||Unlike Oppn, BJP believes in development: CM Yogi||Prayagraj: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that “the rival parties in fray against the BJP are not able to rise above ‘vanshwad’ (dynastic rule) and ‘pariwarwad’ (familism), while the BJP believes in ‘vikaswad’ (development)”. The CM also remotely inaugurated and laid foundation stones of 378 development projects in the district worth Rs 553.81-crore. Speaking at Jan Sandesh Yatra at Pratapgrah on Monday, Yogi said, “The rival parties in fray against the BJP are not able to rise above ‘vanshwad (dynastic rule) and ‘pariwarwad’ (familism). One party is of sister and brother (Congress), one is of uncle and nephew (SP) and another is of aunt and nephew (BSP). When the uncle and nephew are fighting among themselves, who will listen to the people?” He also asked the opposition parties as to why no one ever thought of development of Pratapgrah. “The voters of the district should ask as to why the Congress which ruled for several years, or the SP which had its government in the state for four times and was even supporting the Central government and also the BSP as to who had stopped them from thinking of the development in Pratapgrah,” he added. “BJP believes in worshipping ‘full moon’. It does not believe in incomplete work. We do not take 20 years to complete a project like the previous regimes. BJP undertakes a project and completes it in record time and the medical college of Pratapgrah is one such example,” the CM further said elaborating his government’s focus on development work. Comparing the previous regime with the BJP government, Yogi said, “While they believed in ‘politics of votes’ for which they did not hesitate in firing bullets on Hindus in Ayodhya, the BJP believes in honouring Ram bhakts, for whom a grand temple is being constructed in the holy city.” He also claimed that since 2017, the state has not witnessed any riot as “those who indulge in breaking the peace of the state know that if they indulge in any such act, they will have to pay the compensation for generations together”. He also said that today the overall impression of the state and the people living here has changed across the country. “Earlier, because of the negative impression of the state, people from the state were not given rented accommodation in other cities. However, now things have changed and this is because of the ‘double engine’ government which is taking UP to new heights of development,” said the CM. During the visit, the CM remotely inaugurated and laid foundation stones of 378 different development projects in the district worth Rs 553.81-crore. The projects which were inaugurated included a residential complex at Mandhata development block, primary health center of Kataiah in Nevada, VVPAT storage warehouse at Gaighat, building of upper primary school, Sangipur and New Kot Gaura, Naziapur a mini stadium and hostels of GGIC of Mandhata and Patti., beautification of Chauharjandevi Dham, visitor shed and campus boundary wall of Pratapgarh district jail among others. The projects whose foundations were laid included 120 projects of Jaljeevan Mission and Kataiya Nevada Polytechnic as well as many new roads, drains, government office buildings and government employees’ houses. UP ministers Rajendra Pratap Singh, Mahendra Singh, Suresh Pasi and Dharamvir Prajapati besides MPs Vinod Kumar Sonkar (Kaushambi) and Sangam Lal Gupta (Pratapgarh) along with MLAs Rajkumar Pal (Pratapgarh Sadar)and Abhay Kumar (Raniganj) were also present on the occasion. Union minister Mahendra Nath Pandey, who arrived in BJP’s Jan Vishwas Yatra at Pratapgrah, also expressed hope of change in Rampurkhas. Pandey, who accompanied the CM, targeted Rampur Khas in his address. “Yogi Adityanath broke the myth by visiting Noida and is the CM even today. In the same way, he is breaking the record of coming to Rampur as in the past 32 years no CM came here. In such a situation, ‘kamal’ (lotus, BJP poll symbol) will bloom in Rampur Khas,” said Pandey. He said that people who played the game of ‘tweets’ for two to three months were not seen during the Corona period. “Yogi Ji acted like a ‘frontline worker’ during the Corona crisis. With better law and order, he waved UP’s flag in the country and by controlling the criminals, he maintained the continuity of development,” Pandey said. Kaushambi MP Vinod Sonkar, who is leading the Jan Vishwas Yatra, said that this yatra, which started from Ghazipur on December 19, reached Pratapgarh via Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Mirzapur, Prayagraj. “Wherever the yatra passes, farmers, labourers and common man bless the party. How the government cared for all the sections without any discrimination of caste, creed or religion, is clearly visible by the support this yatra is gaining,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/unlike-oppn-bjp-believes-in-development-cm-yogi/articleshow/88531247.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Five-member team to probe bridge deck collapse||Ahmedabad: A five-member committee will investigate the reason behind the bridge deck collapse in Mumatpura on December 22. The five-member committee will involve a senior engineer from Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI), another from Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS), Gandhinagar, and three engineers from the roads and building department. The incident took place weeks prior to the flyover’s inauguration and was to be major relief for South Bopal residents. The contractor, Unjha based Ranjit Buildcon Limited which was allotted the construction work was carrying out the post-tensioning of the 114th box girder, the last one when the incident took place. The five-member team had visited the accident site last week and collected samples. There were 90 people at site when the bridge collapsed. The contractor has been awarded contracts of several bridge and highway structures, but a similar bridge structure collapse incident in Surat involving the same company had taken place in 2007 where a labourer was killed on the spot during a flyover span collapse between Udhna Darwaza, Majuragate and Athwa lines — the flyover was being built by the same company. Another structure failure was reported in the company’s 2016 flyover project in Anuvratdwar. The experts will examine whether the concrete was strong enough or ready to undergo post-tensioning? Did any of the 24 steel tendons running through the hardened concrete snap while the pressure gauge pulled the tendons? What was the quality of various parts of the devices used in the post-tensioning or concrete stressing activity, like the condition of the bearing plate, locker plate, extra collar, tension jack, master/pulling plate, master grip and even quality of the steel strand or tendons used in the girders. “Material samples from the site will be tested in our state roads and building department labs to ascertain whether the quality of the raw material was maintained or not,” said a senior AUDA engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/five-member-team-to-probe-bridge-deck-collapse/articleshow/88531239.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Schools asked to sell old and unused textbooks as scrap||AHMEDABAD: The state education department has directed the government and grant-in-aid schools to sell all undistributed textbooks for Class 9 to Class 12 as scrap. The Gujarat State School Textbook Board (GSSTB) distributes textbooks for free but due to some reason or another, many schools are not able to distribute all of them, said sources in the education department. “There have been instances in the past where some school officials had tried to siphon money by selling the undistributed books. In order to avoid such incident in the future, the schools have been asked to sell them as waste and reflect it in their school accounts,” said sources. GSSTB has decided to start the process of distribution of school textbooks early for 2022-23. The massive exercise involves reaching out to 1.25 crore students from Class 1 to Class 12. The decision has been taken after many schools and students complained that the textbooks did not reach them even months after the current academic year started in July. About 30,000 tonnes of paper will be used to publish a total of 8.5 crore textbooks for Class 1 to Class 12 students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/schools-asked-to-sell-old-unused-textbooks-as-scrap/articleshow/88531243.cms||---

Speaking at a public meeting here on Monday, Kodiyeri said that it was said in LDF’s election manifesto that K-Rail would be implemented. The support of all is needed for its implementation. This government will implement development projects ignoring wrong resistances. This was seen in the National Highway development, GAIL and KFON projects. He also said that the Sabarimala airport and Sabari rail too has to be implemented. “The VS government had prepared the plan for the SilverLine project. It could not be implemented as it was prepared towards the end of the tenure of the government. The Oommen Chandy government, which followed, envisaged the high-speed rail project worth Rs 1.18 lakh crore,” he said. Kodiyeri said that ecological issues are much less in the project announced by the present LDF government. “It is natural that the people who lose land will have difficulties. The LDF will be with them,” he said. Kodiyeri also said that Congress, UDF and BJP are opposing the project. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kodiyeri-cant-abandon-devpt-projects-over-political-opposition/articleshow/88531267.cms||---

The duo — Arfanabanu Sabirhussain Shaikh, a resident of Dariapur and Janak Panchal, a resident of Gandhinagar — were involved in showing fake export transactions and claiming input tax credit. The two accused operated using a modus operandi of floating shell companies by obtaining address and identity documents of poor people fraudulently to make GST registrations.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan man kills dad to claim Rs 4 lakh as insurance||JAIPUR: A 30-year-old man from a Bharatpur village along with his two friends killed his father to claim insurance money of Rs 4 lakh. The youth, Rajesh Singh, had purchased four insurance policies in the name of his father, identified as Mohkam Singh, with a total insurance claim of Rs 4 lakh after his death. According to Deeg police, who had arrested the accused on December 25 after the trio were found in suspicious circumstances near Kosi, the murder was made to look like an accident. The three were caught by a Deeg police patrol when they tried to hide themselves in the Kosi area from the cops. “When our team was passing, they hid themselves behind a tree. They were unable to give satisfactory replies to our questions. We arrested them for disturbing peace,” Deeg SHO Rajesh Pathak said. Later, on Sunday, the police found the bloodstained body of Mohkam Singh on the road near Kosi. “Prima facie it appeared to be an accident. However, it was found that except for some head injuries, the body did not have even a single mark on the lower back or shoulders which is usual in road accidents. So, we suspected it to be a murder. We enquired about his relatives and were told that Singh had a son who was in the village itself. Soon, we found that Rajesh Singh, the son of the deceased, was already lodged in our police station for disturbing peace. We interrogated him and he confessed to the crime,” Pathak said. “The three persons, Rajesh (30), Vijendra (25) and Kanha (26), who were arrested by us for disturbing peace, had committed the murder,” he said. Asked about the details of the crime, Pathak said, “Rajesh’s brother had died in a road accident a year ago when he was working in Faridabad as a delivery boy. Following his death, his wife had received a lot of money as insurance. This prompted Rajesh to insure his father and kill him to claim the money by making it look like an accident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bharatpur-man-kills-dad-toclaim-rs-4-lakh-as-insurance/articleshow/88531275.cms||---

This will include many domestic breeding checkers and other similar workers. We have informed all of them,” said an east corporation official. According to the official, it is part of the Delhi Municipal Act, which governs all the corporations, that the staff should be trained with at least the basic knowledge on their responsibilities and response in case of a disaster. “For this, we are planning to invite experts from other disaster training institutes and hold seminars in batches for the staff to be trained. There is also the worry of a third wave due to the new variant of Covid-19. That is also one of the reasons to train our staff,” added the official. There are around 3,500 domestic breeding checkers in the national capital, who are employed on a contractual basis by the three municipal corporations – North, South and East. During the peak of the Covid-19 cases earlier this year, many field workers were pressed into action by the corporations to assist the public with basic needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eye-on-third-wave-edmc-to-train-field-staff-in-disaster-management/articleshow/88531256.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Saffron party’s power troika in Gujarat||As the state heads into a crucial assembly election, there are three distinct power centres in the BJP — chief minister Bhupendra Patel, state BJP president C R Paatil, who some refer to as the super-CM, and Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, who has become more ‘visible’ in Gujarat’s political arenaBhupendra Patel hakespeare wrote in Twelfth Night: Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. The last part aptly sums up chief minister Bhupendra Patel’s coronation as CM. When Patel’s name was proposed as leader of the legislature party after Rupani’s exit, most in the meeting were understandably surprised. A bigger surprise was in store though. The entire cabinet of Vijay Rupani’s government was replaced with new faces, many of the first-time MLAs, who are now ministers in the government. Patel — a first-time MLA — has his task cut out. He is entrusted with the job of keeping people in good cheer as the ruling party faces elections in less than a year. C R Paatil Since his appointment as state BJP president in July 2020, everything C R Paatil touched has turned into gold. Within a couple of months of taking over, Paatil’s first test was getting Congress turncoat MLAs to win on BJP tickets. When results were out, the BJP bagged all eight seats. Subsequently, under Paatil’s leadership, the BJP put up a stellar performance in the local body polls — municipal corporations, municipalities, district panchayats and taluka panchayats. Over the past few months, Paatil’s clout in the party has grown hugely, with some even terming him as the super-CM. Anandiben Patel After being appointed governor of various states, it seemed as if former CM Anandiben Patel was no longer keen on following political developments in her home state of Gujarat. However, over the past few months, Anandiben has been seen meeting with political persons more frequently when she visits Ahmedabad. Most significantly, her protégé Bhupendra Patel is now at the helm of affairs in the state – a clear indication that her clout in state politics is intact. When she vacated her assembly seat Ghatlodia in the 2017 election, she insisted that Bhupendra Patel be given the party ticket from the seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/saffron-partys-power-troika-in-gujarat/articleshow/88531909.cms||---

Addressing the media here on Monday, Shaista Parveen said the local MLA and BJP leaders misled the CM to believe that the freed land belonged to Atiq Ahmad and used the issue for a political stunt. “The land is disputed and the case is pending in court. Local BJP leaders have misled the CM and made him perform ‘bhumipujan’ on a disputed piece of land,” she claimed. However, Shaista Parveen admitted that the property was earlier used by her husband for keeping banner posters and lodging party workers during elections. “If local MLA really wants to construct houses for the poor then Atiq Ahmad will give his ancestral land for the purpose. Another property near my husband’s office was demolished by the administration where dozens of poor families used to live free of cost. Houses will be constructed for the poor after my husband is released from jail. The local MLA (read UP cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh) has done nothing for development in his constituency and now he is doing political stunts to gain popularity,” she claimed. Now, we will transfer the land in our name from its owners and will even approach the Supreme Court for gaining its possession, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/lukerganj-land-does-not-belong-to-atiq-claims-his-wife/articleshow/88531271.cms||---

For the year 2021-22, centre’s share amounting to Rs 38.72 crore is yet to be received by the state government, and it is expected, the data stated. The data further states that in Ganganagar, UCs amounting to Rs 19.09 crore is yet to be submitted to the Centre. There are 131 incomplete works under thr programme in Ganganagar. In Jaisalmer, UC amounting to Rs 18.27 crore is yet to be sent to the Centre and 134 works are pending in the district. In Bikaner, UC amounting to Rs 10.26 crore is yet to be submitted to the centre and 44 works under the programme are incomplete in the district. And in Barmer, UC amounting to Rs 3.64 crore is yet to be submitted to the centre. In all, there are 98 incomplete works in Barmer. In all, there are 407 incomplete works under the programme. This matter was discussed during a review meeting by state’s chief secretary Niranjan Arya last month. “The state government hasn’t received funds for BADP from the centre for the past two years as utilisation certificates amounting to Rs 51.26 crore haven’t been submitted by the state government. This shows lack of monitoring and seriousness by the state-level officers,” said a senior official. “The first instalment of the fund is given unconditionally. For the release of the second instalment, the state government is required to submit a 60 per cent utilisation certificate of the first instalment and 90 per cent UC of the previous year,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-yet-to-release-funds-for-2-years-for-border-area-development/articleshow/88531266.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

Barely 10 days within three lions being captured from villages of Gondal taluka, pugmarks of a pride were found in Monpur and Pithadia villages of Jetpur. Over the last couple of days, lions were sighted on the villages of Gondal and Kukavav taluka which falls in Amreli district.The three lions were captured on the night of December 15 and released into sanctuary. This group was moving around in the villages of Jetpur and Gondal and people requested the department to capture the lions in order to avoid human-animal conflict. “In the last three years, different groups of lions are venturing into these areas, but this is the first time we have noticed that the same group came for the second time," said a senior forest official. Priyvrat Gadhvi, a member of state wildlife board said “It’s a challenging task for the forest department to sensitize local people and create a new habitat especially when the lion population is expanding.” A senior forest official said, “As a temporary solution, it’s good to rehabilitate lions to avoid conflict but it’s not a feasible long-term strategy. When lions are coming often, it has become a corridor for them and we need to prepare a habitat for them.” The lions first crossed Gondal highway in 2007 but till today the forest department is not ready to settle lions here. There is good grassland area and the forest department needs to build water points and work on increasing herbivores population as a prey base. Bhushan Pandya, another member of state wildlife board said, “It’s the lion’s nature to find new habitats and sub-adults will continue venturing into new areas. The corridors need to be protected." K Ramesh, chief conservator of wildlife, Junagadh said, “We generally relocate lions only when we get a number of public complaints. Farmers complain that labourers who are coming from tribal areas are afraid of going into farms. Our approach is to relocate lions when there is no other option. In the long run, we have to convince people about the lions' presence but it will take time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/within-10-days-of-capture-lions-return-to-rajkot-villages/articleshow/88530444.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Nagpur||DCP’s aims to keep 200 goons on radar with ‘wassup parade’||Nagpur: Around 100 goons with records of murders and cases of assaults along with an additional 100 with the background of burglaries and robberies are being summoned every week by Zonal DCP Lohit Matani to check their current status. Matani’s interactive meeting with criminals is learnt to be a part of the three-pronged multi-layer preventive strategy by CP Amitesh Kumar for micro-level policing with the basic agenda to keep them under surveillance. Firstly, the exercise of summoning a goon to the police station would ensure that the cops involved in the process visit his or her residence which would act as a deterrence. The home visit would also help police serve goons summons, warrants or any notice. Secondly, the goons would have to remain present and furnish their details of current workplace, source of earning, friends and family. Thirdly, the senior officials feel that such close interactions with the goons with past records help in strengthening the manual intelligence network. Matani, who had taken charge of Zone-1 around a month ago, said twice a week he tried to meet the criminals for interactions and mass counselling. “Those goons who avoid coming to the police stations to meet me are the ones who are then chased and closely being monitored,” he said, adding, goons are asked to furnish details whether they are having any enmity or rivalry with others. Matani also said employers many times are unaware of employees with criminal records. “We intend to alert employers regarding any criminal working in their organization,” said the Zonal DCP. Matani also said he is ready to help any criminal who is keen to reform and get rehabilitated. “Parading goons and interacting with them is a traditional policing method. We are merely trying to stick to the basic forms of policing of keeping criminals under surveillance,” said Matani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dcps-aims-to-keep-200-goons-on-radar-with-wassup-parade/articleshow/88530166.cms||Soumitra Bose

Many of them are decades old.TOI had highlighted the condition of the trees last month after incessant rain weakened them. While authorities assured to identify such trees and prune the branches to avoid accidents, very little was done in this regard.S Krishnan of Ram Nagar said that official did visit the next day, but took no action. “They need to be sensitive towards the lives of commuters as it is one of the busy roads in the city,” he said.While native species are planted along rural areas and highways, exotic species are seen in the city limits, said G Aravind of Gandhipuram, a nature lover. “Exotic trees are preferred as they grow fast, but they come at a cost, which commuters are forced to bear.”Such incidents could be avoided if the city corporation had pruned branches of vulnerable trees, said M Loganathan, state coordinator of the Federation for Sustainable Development. “The city corporation lacks a comprehensive database of such trees. Creation of such a database is need of the hour,” he said.A senior corporation official promised to take steps to identify vulnerable trees and prune their branches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/growing-concern-over-falling-trees/articleshow/88531276.cms||Sampath Kumar

Speaking to media in Kochi on Monday, he said that the opposition will not allow the government to implement the project unless it gives reply to the queries raised by UDF regarding SilverLine. Just like the chief minister’s failed attempt to become the leader of Kerala’s renaissance and subsequent backtracking, the SilverLine project also will be a tragedy, Satheesan said. He alleged that Pinarayi Vijayan, who opposed the Rs 6,000crore Vizhinjam terminal project stating that it is a real estate project, later compromised with Adani. “Such a person shouldn’t place the “cap of anti-development” on UDF. The cap will better suit CPM and Pinarayi Vijayan. The government hasn’t given reply to the questions raised by UDF, challenging the SilverLine project,” he said. The argument by the chief minister that Rahul Gandhi and Congress are trying to make a Hindu nation is absurd. It is regarding Hindu religion that Rahul Gandhi said. At the same time, Hindutva is the political agenda of BJP to grab power, Satheesan said. He alleged that CPM in Kerala has cordial relations with the national leadership of BJP. The chief minister, who holds press conferences every day and briefs on everything under the sun, keeps mum on the queries raised by the opposition regarding SilverLine, Satheesan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-trying-to-be-champion-of-development-satheesan/articleshow/88531283.cms||---
---||Lucknow||After 14 lakh jabs on Monday, 46% of UP population fully vaccinated||LUCKNOW: With over one crore vaccinations in the past two weeks and more than 14 lakh jabs being administered on Monday, Uttar Pradesh became the first state in the country with more than seven crore fully vaccinated people. Data from the CoWin portal indicated that 7.01 crore people in the state have taken both the doses of the vaccine. According to official data, total 15.04 crore people in UP are to be vaccinated which means over 46.6% of the eligible population is now fully vaccinated. On the national picture, Uttar Pradesh is now home to nearly 13% of the fully vaccinated population. In all, 19.59 crore doses have been administered in the state which is the highest in the country. In Maharashtra, the nearest contender, 13.16 crore doses have been administered. Maharashtra is followed by West Bengal (10.28 crore), Madhya Pradesh (10.16 crore) and Bihar (9.77 crore). An official statement said aggressive vaccination was an integral part of UP government’s comprehensive strategy to tame the coronavirus. Among all the districts in Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow tops in terms of both total doses administered and fully vaccinated people. The state capital is followed by Prayagraj, Azamgarh, Bareilly and Jaunpur in top five districts in terms of total doses administered. Lucknow has the maximum number of fully vaccinated people, followed by Ghaziabad, Agra, Kanpur, Gautam Budh Nagar and Jaunpur.

---||Delhi||Wives sacrifice career for family, earning capability no ground for denying maintenance: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has said that being capable of earning is no ground to deny an estranged wife interim maintenance, as many a time wives sacrifice their career only for the family. Justice Subramonium Prasad was recently dealing with a man’s challenge to pay Rs 33,000 as interim maintenance to his wife under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The judge highlighted that the object behind the CrPC provision was to prevent vagrancy and destitution of a deserted wife and bring down her agony and financial sufferings. The high court rejected the petitioner’s submission that his wife was capable of making a living as she was previously employed as a teacher and said, “The fact that the respondent is capable of earning is also no ground to deny interim maintenance to the respondent herein. Many times wives sacrifice their career only for the family.” It also rejected the husband’s contention that being an army officer, the maintenance claim would have to be decided in accordance with the Army Order by the Armed Forces Tribunal. “It cannot be said that the Army Order would override the provisions of Section 125 CrPC and that the Army personnel are covered only by the Army Order and that Section 125 CrPC would not apply to Army personnel,” the HC added, upholding the trial court’s decision to grant interim maintenance. However, the high court reduced the amount granted to the woman to Rs 14,615 per month on account of the fact that the children were no longer living with her. In his plea, the husband opposed the grant of interim maintenance on the ground that the wife was in an adulterous relationship and living with his army senior. However, the wife argued that there was no infirmity in the trial court order granting maintenance of Rs 35,300 and claimed the petitioner could not escape his responsibility even though their marriage fell apart. She alleged that the petitioner was an uncaring spouse and when she decided to live separately, he foisted the wild charge of adultery to avoid paying maintenance to her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-wives-sacrifice-career-for-family-earning-capability-no-ground-for-denying-maintenance/articleshow/88531282.cms||---

Follow-up action will be taken as per recommendations of EFC,” he told Gadkari. After former finance minister Arun Jaitley declared the premier institution for Nagpur on February 28, 2015, the city’s pharmaceutical fraternity and industry erupted with joy hoping that it would give a big push to the pharma industry in the region with renowned names like Lupin already operating in Mihan. Six years down the line, the project remains on the paper, thanks to apathy of Union chemicals and fertilisers ministry that failed to allot funds for it. The Maharashtra government did its part by allotting 40 acres at Mouza Kaladongri on Wardha Road in 2017. TOI had also highlighted many a times on how the ambitious projects was inordinately delayed by the central government mentioning that all other national level institutions like AIIMS, IIM, Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) and National Law University (NLU) have already started operations from permanent/temporary campuses. Vidarbha Economic Development Council (VED), which was the first one to raise the demand for NIPER in 2011 and followed it up rigorously, then approached the city MP for expediting it. The latter then wrote a letter to the fertilisers minister seeking his attention towards the delay in execution of the project. “A VED delegation met me recently and submitted a memorandum highlighting the need to expedite setting up of NIPER. VED been following this up for many years and attributes immense importance to having such a project that would boost the pharma sector,” Gadkari wrote to Mandaviya. He added that despite 24 hectares being allotted on Wardha Road, work could not commence due to financial constraints. “As mentioned by VED, the Maharashtra government is waiting for an agreement with the government for its establishment in the city. You are requested to have the matter looked into so that work on the project is expedited and completed at the earliest,” he said. Mandaviya, in his reply, said the proposals for setting up this premier institution in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan were announced in the Budget speech of 2015-16. Thereafter, the Maharashtra government allotted 61 acres in Mouza Kaldongri for its establishment. “Our department had sent a proposal for setting up the institute for consideration of the Union ministry of finance. In its meeting in March 2018, the EFC deferred the same and advised to review it after acceptance of recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/niper-proposal-pending-with-finance-ministry-mandaviya-tells-gadkari/articleshow/88531285.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Coimbatore||Semmozhi Poonga gets green light||Coimbatore: The state government has set the ball rolling to set up Semmozhi Poonga in the city, electricity minister V Senthil Balaji said on Monday.“Necessary government orders have been issued to set up the park,” he said while speaking at a function here to issue identity cards to beneficiaries of the urban employment scheme.The park was announced by late chief minister M Karunanidhi in 2010 during the World Classical Tamil Conference held in Coimbatore. It was proposed to come up at the central prison grounds in the city. However, the project was put on the backburner for 10 years during the AIADMK rule. After DMK won the election this year, chief minister M K Stalin, during his maiden visit to Coimbatore, said the project would be taken up by the government. In his November speech in the city, he said the park would be set up at a cost of Rs 200 crore. However, the nitty-gritty of the project was not announced then.Even now, Balaji did not go into the details of the project. Though the central prison grounds was said to be the site for the park when it was originally proposed, the state government has not made clear if it stood by that decision or if there would be a change in the location.Balaji inaugurated 54 road works measuring 14km at a cost of Rs 6 crore in the city. Recalling that Rs 200 has been allotted as a special fund to repair and relay damaged roads, Balaji said 89 roads measuring 17.87 km will be built in the first phase at a cost of Rs 10 crore. “Subsequently, all damaged roads will be repaired. During the CM’s visit to Coimbatore prior to the assembly election as well as during my Makkal Sabhai meetings with people last month, complaints pertaining to bad roads were the highest. Hence, road works are being taken up on priority. The delay in certain overbridge works is due to litigations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/semmozhi-poonga-gets-green-light/articleshow/88531286.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: Sibling IT entrepreneurs share office land free of cost for Kanpur Metro||LUCKNOW: Siblings and entrepreneurs, Priyank Gupta (36) and Ishank Gupta (32), were initially in a fix when they received a notice from the Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) regarding acquisition of the land, which they had purchased to set up their office, for Kanpur Metro project. After deliberations, the brothers showed a big heart and decided to share a part of their land worth Rs 48 lakh with UPMRC for the construction of Motijheel Metro station without taking a single penny. BTech graduates Priyank and Ishank own an IT firm which has offices in San Diego city in California (US), and in Noida and Kanpur in India. They had set up their firm seven years ago. Keeping in view the huge pool of IT talent available in Kanpur, the duo bought land in Swaropnagar to set up their office. “Kanpur has huge IT talent but lacks skill in blockchain technology. Therefore, we decided to expand our operations in our hometown and bought a commercial land at a higher price than the circle rate in the end of 2019, as paying the rent for office was causing a huge financial burden on us,” said Ishank, the younger of the two. “However, a month later, we received a notice from UPMRC regarding acquiisition of our office land for Kanpur Metro project,” he said. “Initially, we didn’t know how to respond to the notice as we were more focused on expanding our company. Moreover, the compensation amount offered for the entire land was low as compared to what we had paid for it. Finally, we decided to share our land with UPMRC after discussing nuances and came to a mutual agreement to support the government project,” said Priyank, who returned from the Netherlands where he worked as a tech developer for a Dutch airline. Priyank did his graduation from a Mathura-based private university while Ishank completed his graduation from Lucknow. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a UPMRC official engaged in the Kanpur Metro project, said: “Initially, we wanted to buy the entire land. However, as we required land for only two pillars, we dropped the initial plan. The Gupta brothers were humble enough to share their land with UPMRC without charging a single penny. In reciprocation, we also cooperated with them and gave them the entry and exit space for their under-construction office.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sibling-it-entrepreneurs-share-office-land-free-of-cost-for-metro/articleshow/88531923.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The main reasons for this jump is rise in cybercrime cases and crime against women. Cyberabad police commissioner Stephen Raveendra, during an annual press meet on Monday, said that due to the ease of reporting cybercrime through the national toll free helpline (155260), the number of cyber crime cases registered had gone up by 218%. Crime against women has gone up by 2% from 2,572 cases in 2020 to 2,621 cases in 2021. On rise in rape cases from 310 cases to 356 cases, Stephen said that except in two cases, in the remaining cases the accused were known to the victim. On the issue of the sensational accident in 2019, when an allegedly over-speeding car fell from the top of the Biodiversity flyover leading to the death of a woman, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Vijay Kumar said that chargesheet had been filed against the accused Kalvakuntla Milan Rao and he is facing trial in court. With regard to alleged cheating by Sandhya Convention MD S Sridhar Rao, commissioner said that till now 13 FIRs were registered against him and in two cases he had been arrested. In some cases, he obtained relief from arrest either from HC or local court. However, the investigation against him is on, he said. On the question of an additional SP-rank officer in Hyderabad police, who allegedly influenced Raidurgam police to make sure action is not taken against Rao, CP said, “I have already written a detailed report against this officer to Hyderabad CP. I am expecting action will be taken shortly. However, he refrained from answering why no criminal action was taken. When asked about cases against Shilpa Chowdary, accused of duping several elite persons, police said a forensic audit is on to discover any hidden assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cyber-fraudsters-drive-up-crime-in-cyberabad-commissionerate/articleshow/88531292.cms||---
---||Faridabad||Delhi: Conman arrested for duping over 500 people in land fraud||NEW DELHI: An alleged conman has been arrested for duping over 500 people on the pretext of allotting land in Faridabad. The accused collected money for building a residential complex and went underground. Joint commissioner (EOW) Chhaya Sharma said the accused, Sudhir Bidhuri (38), was a resident of Tughlaqabad. He started off as a small-time property dealer and later joined a reality firm and started duping people. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) had received around 32 complaints against Bidhuri and his firm, GRPL Globe Realty. The victims alleged that they had booked residential plots under a housing scheme in the name of “Krishna Kunj Township” in Greater Faridabad. The accused allegedly collected around Rs 5 crore from 500 investors. The residential complex was to have 496 plots with a total area of 48523 square yards, apart from a cemented road, footpath, temple, park, electrical connections, drainage system, sewage line, a club and a boundary wall around each plot. “The company lured people with the help of pamphlets, calls and other means by showing that it was ISO 9001-2008 certified. The project was supposedly approved by the competent authorities. Agreements were executed for the proposed residential plots, payment schedule, ikrarnama, full and final and issued receipts against funds obtained from the complainants,” said Sharma. However, the company failed to provide possession of the plots even after taking full payment from the complainants. Subsequently, multiple FIRs were registered and investigation was started. During investigation, it was found that the company did not have any land at Tilori, Faridabad and also did not have any permission from state and central government departments to develop any residential colony. “Still, the accused and the company’s directors lured people by making false claims,” said an officer. The probe also established that Bidhuri received Rs 54 lakh through bank accounts and the same was misappropriated by him with the help of his associates, whose role was being investigated. He issued slips to the investors under his signature and did not register any plot in their names, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/conman-arrested-for-duping-over-500-people-in-land-fraud/articleshow/88536749.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: National seminar on child issues likely next month||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) will organise a national seminar of all the child panels to discuss the various issues like child trafficking, child marriage and labour. Depending on the Covid situation, the seminar is likely to be held next month where child commissions of all the states are expected to participate. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, RSCPCR elaborating on the same said, “There are many instances especially when it comes to child trafficking and labour when the children are brought to Rajasthan from other states. We need coordination with other states so that rescued children can be rehabilitated in their own states. There is a possibility that we might sign MoUs also for the same.” The seminar will be held after consultation with chief minister Ashok Gehlot. During the course of various campaigns, officials found that the children who were forcibly brought from other states for labour and begging are freed but unnecessary formalities are involved in sending them back. Also, coordination with the officials of the respective states is not established because of which a need was felt to have the panels on the same platform. “There might be some good practices being followed in other states which we could adopt, and they can also possibly take back something from Rajasthan regarding child welfare to implement in their own areas. The dates will be finalised keeping the Covid situation in mind,” added Beniwal. According to an analysis of the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) report done by Child Rights and You (CRY) it was found that crime against children in Rajasthan increased by 39% from 2016 to 2020. This rate is more than double the national rate of crime against children in last 5 years which is 17%. The analysis was conducted, based on the findings of the latest edition of Crime in India (2020) report released by NCRB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/national-seminar-on-child-issues-likely-next-month/articleshow/88531299.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Man gets double life term for killing aunt||COIMBATORE: A 31-year-old man, who was accused of murdering his 55-year-old aunt at Anaimalai in Pollachi five years ago, was sentenced to double life imprisonment on Monday. Arukkani, wife of Palanisamy of Odaiyakulam, was found dead in her house on September 23, 2016. A seven-sovereign gold chain she was wearing was found missing. The Anaimalai police registered a case under Section 174 CrPC (suspicious death). As it turned out to be a murder after postmortem, the case was altered into murder. In 2018, police received information that Arukkani’s brother-in-law’s son B Ravi Prakash pledged a gold chain in a private financial firm in Anaimalai. When police picked up Ravi, he confessed to the murder. Investigation revealed that Ravi, a computer dealer, had approached his uncle Palanisamy for money to invest in the business. When Palanisamy refused to help him, Ravi borrowed from moneylenders. They started harassing him when he failed to return it. “Ravi had visited Palanisamy’s house when Arukkani was alone. He strangled her to death with a bed sheet and snatched her mangalsutra,” special public prosecutor K Karthikeyan told TOI. Ravi was booked under Section 302 (murder), 449 (house-trespass in order to commit offence punishable with death) and 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code. D Balu, judge of the sessions court for trial of bomb blast cases, sentenced Ravi to double life imprisonment and 10 years rigorous imprisonment. The sentences will run concurrently. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 15,000 on him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-gets-double-life-term-for-killing-aunt/articleshow/88531281.cms||---

---||Kochi||Hearing of employees under suspension to resume today||Thiruvananthapuram: The internal committee constituted by the city corporation to probe the fund fraud in zonal offices will resume hearing of employees under suspension in Nemom and Attipra zonal offices from Tuesday. The procedure is crucial to revenue recovery as corporation has lost around Rs 32 lakh from its account after the money paid as tax was never credited in the corporation’s bank account. The team had a hard time pinning the responsibility on a single official so that the amount could be recovered. With the police investigation also losing the momentum, the internal team has the responsibility to make the staff accountable and ensure that the money due to corporation was levied from the officials who had erred. The probe team had earlier confirmed the findings of the audit wing which had unearthed the series of fraud in zonal offices. As per departmental norms, memo needs to be issued to staff responsible and they should be heard before department-level action like censure, increment cut or any other measure could be recommended. At Nemom zonal office, the complaints filed by the corporation with the police were mainly against the charge officer and the cashier. All the other staff who were questioned by the internal committee at Nemom zonal office have so far denied of their involvement in fund fraud. This has left the committee with further questioning of cashier who has also denied of any misappropriation of funds. With police arresting some of the accused, natural hearing process could not be conducted. Some of the suspended staff also got infected with Covid, which further delayed the hearing. Also their bail conditions wouldn’t allow them to leave the residential limits. As of now, the probe has confirmed the findings of the audit wing. The next step is to place the responsibility on officials and initiate steps to recover the money. Sunitha, who was arrested by the police, had earlier told officials about how she was forced to sign on a paper which showed that she was solely responsible for all cash transactions in the Nemom zonal office. However, this demand to assume responsibility came up after the audit reported about loss of Rs 26 lakh collected at zonal office between 2020 and 2021. Unlike Sreekaryam zonal office, the city corporation is totally in the dark about where the money went. In Sreekaryam it was clear that one staff frequently took the money from the zonal office to the bank and when irregularity was detected, he was held accountable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hearing-of-employees-under-suspension-to-resume-today/articleshow/88529639.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Police said in some offences like wrong side driving, signal jumping spot challan will be issued. “We feel punishing such motorists on spot would create more impact,” CP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-wheeler-deaths-82-had-no-helmets/articleshow/88531304.cms||---

Two separate cases for alleged attempt to murder of police personnel and for arson and vandalism leading to destruction of public property have been registered in connection with the attack that took place in the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. As per the FIR registered for attacking the Kunnathunadu station house officer (SHO) V T Shajan, 100 identifiable people have been arraigned as accused. As many as 200 identifiable people have been arraigned as accused in the other case registered for arson and destruction of public property worth around Rs 12.05 lakh. Police said that as of Monday evening, 51 people have been arrested in connection with the assault case and 113 in the case for vandalism. Police said that as many as 50 accused were produced before the Kolenchery first class magistrate court by evening, which remanded them in judicial custody in the high-security jail at Viyyur. Police said that the rest of the accused will be produced before the court by the end of the day. “We have used all available resources for verification of the role of the accused, the preparation of remand report and production before court. Coordinated efforts were taken with the district collector and the district medical officer to ensure round-the-clock service of doctors for the medical examination of the accused,” said a senior official. Police have submitted before the court that the accused attacked the circle inspector, chanting ‘Usko Maaro’ in Hindi. The officer was attacked with sticks and stones and was allegedly hit on his back and head, inflicting a fracture on his left arm.

Labour commissioner told to submit report Minister for labour V Sivankutty said that he has asked the state labour commissioner to submit a report on whether there were any labour law violations at the firm. On the statements made by Kitex MD Sabu M Jacob that some people were trying to use the issue against him, the minister said that the statement was only a reflection of the anti-Left and anti-LDF government attitude of the industrialist. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said in Kottayam that the guest workers in the state should not be isolated because of this incident. Meanwhile, Congress MP Benny Behanan said that what happened in Kizhakkambalam was a Taliban-model attack. He said that the incident was shameful to the state police as the police were forced to flee from the spot. “This is for the first time that such an incident has happened for Kerala police. This is an example of the destruction of law and order in the state,” he said. He added that the responsibility of the attack falls on Sabu Jacob as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-record-arrest-of-164-people-in-two-cases/articleshow/88531312.cms||---
---||Delhi||Row over notification on counselling session for sex harassment at Jawaharlal Nehru University||NEW DELHI: A notification issued by Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on a counselling session to be organised for students on sexual harassment, states one of the reasons that the session is required is because “girls (are) supposed to know how to draw a tangible line (between them and their male friends) to avoid any such harassment.” The counselling session is being organised by the varsity’s Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) and is scheduled to be held on January 17. The other reasons on “why is the counselling session required” also include that students should be aware of what consists sexual harassment and that the ICC often comes across cases where sexual harassment takes place among close friends. The notice also mentioned that “boys generally cross (sometimes advertently, sometimes inadvertently) the thin line between friendship’s bantering and sexual harassment.” The statement that women should “know how to draw a tangible line to avoid harassment” has come under severe criticism from several sections of the student community. Aishe Ghosh, president of JNU Students’ Union, said, “The ICC time and again in JNU has passed such regressive remarks or conducted itself in a way to moral police the survivor. Such a remark creates a space where harassment will become rampant.” All India Students’ Association also issued a statement and said, “This exposes the attitude of victim blaming, which the ICC has been practising. This counselling session is a sham.” Senior officials of the university administration could not be reached for a comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/row-over-notification-on-counselling-session-for-sex-harassment-at-jnu/articleshow/88531334.cms||---

We have identified 12 others as well and have informed police to hand over them. Only 23 people were part of this incident,” said Jacob, adding that they identified them using CCTV footage. He said that all the quarters were numbered and out of the 984 labourers staying there, 499 were Keralites and 485 were guest workers. He said that police picked up only guest workers from quarters 10, 11 and 12. He said that the aim was to destroy Twenty20 and Kitex garments and added that the act of police was inhumane. “Please investigate this case correctly. Don’t take out the grudge against me on these poor people. If you want the closure of this company, please openly say that. I will even do that but please don’t destroy the families of the 151 innocents,” said Jacob. Senior police officers, however, said that the department was acting as per law. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-wrongly-picked-up-workers-kitex-md/articleshow/88531346.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Hindu hostel given on lease to AU for the next 29 years||Prayagraj: Hindu Hostel would now be part of Allahabad University for the next 29 years, 11 months, as the lease deed for formal transfer of Hindu Hostel and its adjoining grounds to Allahabad University (AU) at a nominal lease rent of Rs 1 per annum for the tenure has now been signed. The ensuing legal formalities have been completed on December 21, informed AU PRO Prof Jaya Kapoor, on the eve of the birth anniversary of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya, the great visionary nationalist leader and educationist, who had got the hostel constructed in 1901. It is in his honour that Hindu Hostel is formally known as Madan Mohan Malviya University Hostel. AU had initiated efforts to formally take over the trust-owned Hindu Hostel after the executive council, the apex decision making body of the central varsity, in a meeting convened on November 23, 2021, where the proposal was unanimously approved in this regard. The decision of taking over the hostel, having 184 double-seater rooms (with capacity of 368 students), had been first mooted and proposed by the Madan Mohan Malaviya Hindu Boarding Society (trust) more than 25 years back. Thereafter, the society has been regularly sending communication in the matter. With no action initiated on part of the university, there was no development in this regard for years. When Prof Sangita Srivastava took over as the vice-chancellor on November 30, 2020, a proposal to the effect was sent once again. She followed it up paving way for its formal takeover of it on lease by AU. “The hostel building will need some renovation and restoration work, apart from a clearing of a pending electricity bill of around Rs 2.5 crore before it can be opened for allotment to the students. Apart from this, there are also several proposals under consideration for utilizing the grounds available for research and teaching projects,” said Prof Kapoor. The final decisions in this regard will be taken in the near future as the university is preparing for the implementation of new National Education Policy (NEP)-2020 in the 2023-24 session, she added. The Hindu hostel was built by the visionary nationalist leader and great educationist Mahamana Madan Mohan with Rs 2.5 lakh at the time collected entirely as donations to help students coming from far corners of the country find easy accommodation. At the time its name was MacDonnell Hindu Boarding House. In 1951 its name was changed to Madam Mohan Malaviya University College. Till 1982-83, AU teachers used to frequently visit the hostel to organise seminars and conduct tutorial classes for the students. However, in recent years it fell to neglect with most toilets unusable and the building in poor state, due to lack of proper maintenance. The importance of this transfer can be gauged from the fact that cost of just the 10.10 acre land of the hostel located in heart of the city is estimated to be in crores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hindu-hostel-given-on-lease-to-au-for-the-next-29-years/articleshow/88531336.cms||---

Renovation work is being carried out on the twin bridges by a private contractor hired by UP Public Works Department (UPPWD). It will last till January 10. Half of the road on each bridge has been closed for repair work at a time. As a result, the roads have become narrow for vehicular traffic leading to congestion all day. However, the major problem occurs at night. Workers leave behind debris on the road, which if unnoticed by a driver, can cause accidents. What makes the situation worse is that there is no streetlight on this stretch. Stray monkeys and dogs increase the probability of fatal accidents. “With no streetlights and construction debris scattered all along the bridge, commuting becomes very risky, especially at night. A few times, I have lost control after my scooter hit a stone,” said Yashovardhan, a regular commuter. Tripti Singh said, “With no streetlights and stray animals moving around, it’s frightening to drive on this stretch at night. The situation is worse when there is fog.” UPPWD executive engineer Om Prakash said, “The electricity connection of the streetlights has been snapped for safety of construction workers as there is a threat of electrocution if while working their instruments hit a live wire.” “As far as safety of commuters is concerned, we will direct the contractor to ensure all debris from the road is removed after the day’s work and signages are put to guide people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/debris-on-dark-patch-a-threat-to-commuters-on-nishatganj-bridge/articleshow/88531951.cms||TNN

The health index of states titled ‘Healthy States, Progressive India’, has listed Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Assam as the top three ranking states in terms of annual growth performance. The report analysed the health conditions in the states between 2018-19 and 2019-20 and has said that Telangana is a top performer in many aspects. “Telangana emerged as strongest performer on both overall and incremental performance as for several indicators it had attained the best possible performance. For example, it attained universal full immunisation of children and total case notification of tuberculosis…,” the report says. While stating that all district hospitals certified under LaQshya and Kayakalp scored more than 70%, the report added there were “no vacancies of auxiliary nurse midwifes (ANMs) in sub centres and medical officers in primary health centres (PHCs)”. In terms of incremental performance, Telangana made major gains with nearly half the indicators in the ‘fully achieved’, ‘most improved’ or ‘improved category’. “In terms of overall performance, Telangana improved its position from fourth to third, Gujarat from seventh to sixth, and Punjab from ninth to eighth. Telangana performed significantly better in health index than Haryana or Jammu and Kashmir despite having same level of poverty. Several states/UTs could learn from Telangana on how it covered all district hospitals under LaQshya certification,” the report reads. It further said that only five larger states and two smaller states, showed good overall performance and continued to improve on their health index score from the base year (2018-19) to reference year (2019-20) for the analysis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-excelled-on-health-front-niti-aayog-report/articleshow/88531317.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Rachakonda sees rise in crime rate after pandemic lull||HYDERABAD: Rachakonda commissionerate limits saw an overall increase in cognizable offences by 9% in 2021 compared to last year, according to official data. Addressing the media during the annual press meet, Rachakonda commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat explained that owing to the Covid pandemic, the crime rate saw a decline during the lockdown period in 2020, but has increased again in 2021. While crime against women saw a decrease by a marginal 1%, rape cases saw an increase by 14%. Official data suggests that the offender is known to the victim in 368 cases and in a majority of 257 cases the accused happens to be ‘friend’ or ‘lover’ cheating the victim under the pretext of marriage. Property offences saw a 39% increase with detection rate dropping to 57% from 77%. On the brighter side, the property recovery rate increased to 57% from 50% this year. The commissionerate achieved conviction in 4,413 cases in 8,024 cases. One of the important convictions include the sexual assault and murder of a sevenyear-old boy in 2019. In total, 6,712 under investigation cases were brought forward from previous years while 23,045 cases reported in 2021. “We have managed to dispose 78% of the cases this year, thanks to active participation in National Lok Adalats,” the commissioner said. In terms of drugs, commissionerate booked 93 cases this year for illegal possession and transportation. When asked about arrests of kingpins, Bhagwat said police personnel are camping at Mumbai and other areas in AP to arrest the main accused.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra's poor pedestrian infra claimed 2,000+ lives in 2020||MUMBAI: Poor pedestrian infrastructure such as unclear zebra crossings, inadequate subways/ foot overbridges and encroached or missing footpaths resulted in more than 5100 road crashes and 2214 fatalities in Maharashtra in 2020. The data, released by the State Traffic Police, is particularly relevant when pedestrians and motorcyclists are the most at-risk road users. Experts have called for prioritizing action that protects these vulnerable road users. Nearly 25000 crashes were reported in the state last year of which 11569 were fatal. There's a need to construct better footpaths in many parts of Mumbai, according to Vidyadhar Date, who has authored a book on walking and non-motorised transport. "The civic body has created good walking spaces near seafronts such as Carter Road or Bandra Reclamation. But on the internal roads of Bandra, footpaths are uneven and walkers are compelled to use the carriageway which is dangerous," he said. Citing an example of Pune's JM Road where footpaths have been widened, Date said it's a pleasure to walk there or just sit and chat. "One can even play chess on the footpath. There are tables with chess boards designed over them," he added. The civic body has undertaken junction transformations at some locations in Mumbai such as Bharatmata junction, Worli Seaface, Nagpada, Wadala etc., to make them safer for pedestrians. But most other footpaths in the city are encroached by hawkers or obstructed with structures. "Pedestrians and motorcyclists were victims in 70% of all fatal crashes in Maharashtra in 2020. This has been a consistent trend for many years. Better pedestrian infrastructure and speed management, among others, are proven interventions that can save lives," said Dhawal Ashar, Senior Manager, Integrated Transport, with the non-profit, World Resources Institute India. In September 2020, a motorcyclist was seriously hurt and his friend seated pillion was killed after a barricade put up by MMRDA for road repairs fell over them and their two-wheeler subsequently collided with a truck. Police data shows that during ongoing road works like these or under-construction works led to 829 crashes and 341 fatalities last year. "Deployment of marshals is a must at all infrastructure work sites to guide motorists, besides proper barricading. Efforts should be taken to control the speed of passing vehicles and ensure there are no obstacles in their path," said activist AV Shenoy of Mumbai Mobility Forum. Potholes resulted in 181 crashes and 72 fatalities in the same year. "We received complaints of potholes even during lockdown. My team of volunteers and I filled up 550 odd potholes last year and more than 300 in 2021," said Dadarao Bilhore, a grocery store owner who lost his son to a pothole-related crash six years ago and has since been on a crusade to fill up potholes on Mumbai streets. Road engineers opine that the solution to potholes is improving the quality of road construction and repair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-poor-pedestrian-infra-claimed-2000-lives-in-2020/articleshow/88532442.cms||Nitasha Natu

Once the sanction comes through, it will be processed to the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts, Pensions (PCDA) (P), Allahabad. Last month, the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) had granted war disability pension to Sepoy Balwant Singh who was inducted in the 3/1 Punjab Regiment in 1943 and during a brigade attack in Italy on December 15, 1944 his left leg was blown off in a mine blast. The order of AFT had stated that the arrears from 2008 to 2011 with an interest of 8 per cent per annum till the actual date of payment, should be given to Sepoy Balwant Singh within six-months. The order explicitly stated that the payment of the arrears should be expedited and desist from delaying payments on specious ground. Hailing from village Gidaniya in Jhunjhunu district, Balwant Singh was transferred to Rajputana Rifles after the injury before he was discharged from the forces. Last month AFT ordered that the war veteran would get 100 per cent pension from 2008, which is prior to three years before he filed the case along with the arrears. The war veteran’s case had been in the AFT at Jaipur since 2010 and his family claimed that they did not even know that they could get the war disability pension till they came across cases post-Kargil war. His legal counsel retired Col S B Singh said that the case has been sent for government sanction. Hopefully it should be processed in about a week’s time. The government in 1972 had made a provision for a grant of war injury pension to all those who suffered injuries during various wars and were forced to leave duty due to battle injuries. However, the same was denied to those who suffered injuries or casualties during the World Wars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/world-war-ii-veteran-from-jhunjhunu-to-get-war-disability-pension/articleshow/88531339.cms||---

Around 23 such cases were reported including the notorious Chinese loan app scam and 15 of them have been detected. “Taking advantage of the financial woes of individuals affected by the lockdown and pandemic, several instant loan applications have surfaced which offer a loan at an exorbitant interest rate. The application would then access the contacts of the borrowers’ phone and soon begin to abuse them and demand they pay dues at abnormal interest rates,” Assistant commissioner of Rachakonda cybercrime police S Harinath said. Police made several Chinese nationals, residing either in China or other countries, accused in instant loan app harassment cases. Cops have frozen their bank accounts carrying an amount of Rs 40 crore from 24 mobile apps. Overall, cybercrime within Rachakonda commissionerate saw a 134% increase this year compared to 2020. Of 1,173 cybercrimes reported, 159 are related to social media harassment, 87 phishing cases, 60 OLX frauds, 43 job/visa frauds and 732 insurance scams.

I will ensure that my son takes it at the earliest. He is currently taking his ISC examination in school campus,” said paediatrician Sumita Saha of Fortis Hospital. In Bengal, while some schools have started opening up physical classrooms, some are still sticking to online mode. Now, the Omicron scare could delay the reopening of schools that were waiting for Covid situation to improve. “Even as my daughter’s school has reopened with the option for online mode, I have opted for the latter, as I am afraid to send her to school because she not vaccinated. I will be registering her name as soon as Co-Win opens up,” said homemaker Swati Biswas, mother of a 16-year-old. AGM Brand Promotions of Peerless Hospital, Suchismita Sharma, too is planning to get her son vaccinated at the earliest. “Once vaccinated, I would feel much confident of allowing him to go to school or to any other social events. Some subjects like maths and physics have become increasingly difficult through online classes. Once vaccinated I can at least send him to tuition classes,” said Sharma. Of the seven confirmed Omicron cases in Bengal so far, one is a child. And there is one child among those under institutional quarantine. Even as Omicron has proved to be a mild disease in other countries, doctors say we still don’t have enough data to suggest the same in India and strongly advocate vaccine cover for children. “A section of doctors are saying the un-vaccinated paediatric population could suffer the most in the next wave. In such a case vaccine roll out for this population is a welcome move,” said Debolina Sen, teacher at Ling Liang High School. According to the guideline issued on Monday evening by the union health ministry, all those aged 15 years (born in 2007 or before) or more will be able to register on Co-Win. They can either register themselves or register onsite. Similarly appointments can be booked onsite or online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anxious-parents-look-forward-to-enrolling-children-over-15-for-covid-19-vaccination/articleshow/88530490.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

"I have written it to the mayor as hoopers are not covering the entire area. Most people dump garbage on the roadside. Residents are having a hard time," said Kothari. Arvind Methi, councillor from Kishanpole, said although hoopers were coming into his ward, sanitation officials are not working properly as garbage depots were overflowing. He said he had filed several complaints but to no avail. Ashish Kumar, the deputy commissioner of sanitation, said the tenders for new hoopers will be floated on Tuesday and within three days, the situation of sanitation will improve. "Tenders will open on Tuesday. If the company bagging the contract is local, we will get new hoopers from Wednesday, but if it is from outside Jaipur, it will a few days to get it. But within a few days situations will improve," said Kumar. According to the officials of JMC-Heritage, around 100 hoopers did 300 rounds of the entire Walled City on Monday and 16 units are working on the ground, including dumpers, tractors, and loaders, to pick up garbage. Lalita Jaiswal, councillor from ward 72, JMC-Heritage, however, refuted the claims made by the corporation and said the condition of the Nehru market was pathetic as residents had been calling him repeatedly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-heritage-fails-to-put-trash-in-its-place-for-third-consecutive-day/articleshow/88531344.cms||---

The court was dealing with a petition by a 33-year old woman seeking permission to undergo medical termination of pregnancy, claiming that the foetus suffered from abnormalities of the heart. It decided to seek expert opinion after an initial medical report indicated the foetus was alive and might need medical care after being removed from the uterus at this stage. In view of the medical report, the question is not if the pregnancy can be terminated, but whether it should be, Justice Anu Malhotra said. AIIMS informed the court that the foetus has a heartbeat and in case of medical termination of pregnancy, there was a chance that the child would be born alive. Counsel for AIIMS, however, stated that the institute would comply with whatever orders are passed in the case. The court said that it shared AIIMS’ concern for the foetus being born with life. “It is very clear that the child is alive and if it is removed from the uterus also, it would continue to be there and it would need care and immediate attention and if it is not given, it may collapse but can a court order that? That’s my concern,” Justice Malhotra remarked. On December 22, the court had asked AIIMS to set up a medical board for the examination of the woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-opinion-of-aiims-on-termination-of-28-wk-pregnancy/articleshow/88531345.cms||---

The towing vehicles include two cranes and four trucks. Many say that due to very little traffic sense among a section of motorists in the city, there is little room for vehicular movement on roads in certain parts of the city. The roads along the Bytco junction in Nashik Road is congested throughout the day and it gets worse in the evening when private buses going towards the Pune side halt the vehicles to take passengers. Vishal Gaidhani of the Nashik Road area said, “When one private bus is parked on the road half of the road is occupied. Another bus like the city bus almost squeezes through the available space to proceed forward and if that is not possible then the entire traffic movement stops. This is a daily problem and nothing has been done so far. The police can at least ban illegal parking on the roadside so that there is sufficient space for such private buses to halt and sufficient space for the movement of other vehicles.” Atul Jawale of the Kamatwade Road said there is chaos on the road near Trimurti Chowk every day. Hence, towing vans are also needed in the Trimurti Chowk, Pawan Nagar area of Ambad. Assistant commissioner of police (traffic branch) Seetaram Gaikwad said that the current contract of the towing vehicles would end next month. Senior officials of the police will decide on increasing the number of towing cranes and trucks in the city when the decision to renew the contract of the towing cranes is taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-towing-of-vehicles-in-cidco-nashik-road-areas-of-city/articleshow/88529674.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Trichy||CM gives development subsidy to Kanyakumari, Pudukottai temples||Trichy: Chief minister M K Stalin handed over the enhanced administrative and development subsidy to temples governed by Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) department in Kanyakumari and Pudukottai districts in Chennai on Monday. Joint commissioner of Suseenthiram – Kanyakumari Devasthanam temples, R Gnanasekar, received a cheque of Rs 6 crore while the joint commissioner of Pudukottai Samasthanam, K Thennarasu, and executive officer G Saravanan received Rs 3 crore in this regard from the chief minister at the secretariat. The increased subsidy — from Rs 3 crore to Rs 6 crore for temples in Kanyakumari and from Rs one crore to Rs 3 crore for Pudukottai Samasthanam temples — was announced by the government in the assembly in the demands for grants for 2021-2022. An official statement said the control of 490 temples was brought under Kanyakumari Devaswom Board during the linguistic division of states when Kanyakumari district and Sengottai taluk in Tirunelveli district were included in Tamil Nadu. The annual subsidy of Rs 3 crore given by the state government was insufficient for the administration and maintenance of temples. Hence, a government order was passed to increase the subsidy to Rs 6 crore on October 10 this year. In Pudukottai, 225 temples were governed by Pudukottai Samasthanam with the income from over 35,500 acres of land and other assets owned by the temples. Since the income from the properties was insufficient to run the show, the land parcels were handed over to the state government in 1897 following which a government order was issued to provide Rs 1.18 lakh towards puja and maintenance fund to the temples. The subsidy was enhanced to Rs 1 crore on November 30, 2011. Taking into account the price rise, the state government passed the GO to increase subsidy to Rs 3 crore on November 12, 2021. HR&CE minister P K Sekar Babu, chief secretary V Iraianbu, principal secretary, Tourism, Culture and Religious Endowments department B Chandra Mohan, Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments J Kumaragurubaran were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cm-gives-development-subsidy-to-kanyakumari-pudukottai-temples/articleshow/88531356.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP: ‘Groundwater crisis grave, strict ban on extraction need of the hour’||LUCKNOW: Groundwater experts on Monday suggested a strict ban on groundwater extraction from shallow aquifers in alluvial regions of the state. Suggesting ways to handle the groundwater crisis in Uttar Pradesh, the experts also suggested that a roadmap with the help of reliable hydrological data must also be chalked out to handle the crisis. They also mooted integrated and periodic assessment of groundwater quality through extensive (district-wise) mapping. The suggestions were made by senior hydrologists and groundwater experts at the regional consultation workshop on ‘Perspectives on mainstreaming Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in Uttar Pradesh’ organized by Indian Environmental Law Organization in collaboration with India Water Partnership, Water Aid, and Ground Water Action Group at a private hotel on Monday. "We have to look at groundwater and surface water in totality and make concerted efforts for their management. Since there is a reduction in rainfall in the state in the last three decades, we have to change the way we make and implement our plans. Groundwater exploitation has become unbridled and it is affecting the small rivers fed by groundwater," said senior hydrologist (retired) and OSD, ground water department, RS Sinha He said that there is a need to have clarity on water availability, demand and supply. Also, we need to reconcile, validate, rationalize and analyze all water data and statistics for the correctness of data so that policies and plans can be implemented effectively, he added. "Creating a roadmap in water management; be it at the state level or only for a single settlement, requires a fair amount of accurate and reliable hydrological data. And in the case of Integrated Water Resource Management, basin mapping based on iterative systems of measurements is necessary to obtain accurate data to base future plans," said Venkatesh Dutta, noted environmentalist and convener of the workshop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/groundwater-crisis-grave-strict-ban-on-extraction-need-of-the-hr/articleshow/88531964.cms||---

Two-wheeler riders and motorists are just managing to pass through such roads by a whisker, while trucks or load carriers with protruding rods were unable to access the roads either without snipping off the cables or getting trapped in the bunch of cables. Residential areas in Woraiyur, Puthur and Thennur have several roads with low-hanging cables passing over. The cables, mostly belonging to the telecommunication firms and cable TV operators were sagging and causing difficulties for even pedestrians. “We are used to the sagging cables passing just above our entrances. The food delivery boys and guests are unaware of the danger posed by the low-hanging cables,” T Aiyappan, a resident of Ramalinga Nagar, said. The First Cross Main Road of Ramalinga Nagar that has health clinics and commercial outlets has multiple low-lying cables hanging over it. As the roads were re-laid and the pedestrian platforms redeveloped, the cables appear to sag much lower than before. Residents also pointed out that stray animals were caught entangled in the cables. As the low-hanging cables were tied firmly to poles at the corners of the roads, the cables might cause fatal accidents during night hours, the residents said. The recent monsoon was said to have made the situation worse. Local people urged the civic body to communicate to the telecommunication firms and cable TV operators to periodically monitor the status of cables passing over the roads. “We will inspect the residential roads, the operators will be asked to rectify the cables,” an official with Trichy Corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/low-hanging-cables-in-trichy-pose-threat-to-commuters/articleshow/88531343.cms||---

He said the policy was not only promoted self-reliance through skill enhancement but was also based on India’s cultural values. The governor was addressing the concluding session of the meeting of the State Universities Vice-Chancellor’s Coordination Committee at the Raj Bhavan on Monday. All 27 vice-chancellors of the state were present. Mishra said the universities should find ways to generate resources to become financially self-reliant. "Universities should spread awareness about India’s freedom struggle and popularise local heroes by organising exhibitions and seminars under the Amrit Mahotsav of Azadi," said Mishra. He directed the varsities to set up ‘Centers of Excellence’ and provide education through the state-of-the-art teaching methods through them. Adopting villages under social participation and developing them as smart villages with facilities with the cooperation of state government departments at various levels was discussed in the meeting. Chancellor Mishra directed that an integrated policy should be adopted for providing free education to specially-abled students in all universities of the state and the tenure of the post of the registrar in universities should be for a minimum period of two years. "A system of inter-student transfer in universities under the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) in the NEP should be developed. Uniformity should be maintained in making the Constitution Park and rest of the universities should also complete this work on priority," said Mishra. Minister of state for higher education, Rajendra Singh Yadav, said the vice-chancellors and registrars should work with mutual coordination considering quality education as the top priority in the university. He suggested the vice-chancellors should apprise the education department of the work plans of the universities so that proper provision can be made for them in the upcoming budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/guv-asks-varsities-to-implement-nep-at-the-earliest/articleshow/88531351.cms||---

Tests for classes X and XII at Jodhpur Park Boys’ High School and Jodhpur Park Girls’ High School — that were pushed back due to the civic elections — started on Monday. Though exams have been completed in other schools, teachers are reporting for official pending work.

WBBSE had issued a notice, directing them to complete the exams within December 13 and the HS Council had set the deadline for December 31. Both schools were unable to meet the deadline due to the poll-related disruption. “We informed the board and council officials about the situation and they gave us the relaxation. So, we have decided to utilise the holiday week to complete the exams, which will be done by the first week of January, before students have to fill in forms for the board exams,” said Amit Sen Majumder, headmaster of Jodhpur Park Boys’ Hi-gh School. Teachers at other state-affiliated schools are also back in campus to correct answer scripts, tabulate marks, upload marks of activity tasks for junior sections and complete admission procedure before the new academic session begins in January.

---||Goa||Last four games good for FC Goa’s confidence, we can defeat anyone: Ivan Gonzalez||Panaji: Quite unusually for a team that professes its love for attacking football in no uncertain terms, FC Goa have half the number of goals that league leaders and defending champions Mumbai City FC have scored this season. Goa are also the only team without a clean sheet in this edition of the Indian Super League (ISL). They have conceded 14 goals in seven games, conceding at the rate of two per game. If Derrick Pereira’s side fails to keep a clean sheet against ATK Mohun Bagan at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Wednesday, it will equal their second worst run. The worst was, of course, in 2016 when the team finished at the bottom. “It’s difficult to see that we don’t have a clean sheet because, as a defender, you want a clean sheet and a win,” Goa defender Ivan Gonzalez told TOI during an online media interaction on Tuesday. “We know if we keep a clean sheet, it can help the team win a game, but we are in this situation now. The start was difficult.” Goa started with three straight losses but picked themselves up with eight points from their next four games. It’s something that has helped steady the ship. “After three losses, it was difficult to play the fourth (game), but now we are in a better position. The last four games are good for the confidence of the team. This proves we can beat anyone in this league. Now the focus is on ATK Mohun Bagan and, surely, it will be a difficult contest,” said the Spanish defender. ATK Mohun Bagan were pre-season favourites for the title, but have had an indifferent start with three wins out of seven. With coach Antonio Lopez Habas parting ways, last year’s finalists caught everyone off-guard with the capture of coach Juan Ferrando from Goa. Gonzalez trained under Ferrando even before he got here. Till 10 days ago, the Spanish coach was on the Goa bench to guide the players. Now, he’s at the opposite end, plotting their downfall. “This is football, these things happen. In football, you don’t have time to think. In the ISL you play every three four days and this is good for the team because you don’t have time to think a lot. It’s a challenge for us (against ATKMB). We accept the challenge. We want to win. Of course, we wish the best for Juan but after the game,” said Gonzalez. Gonzalez’s strike against Odisha took his goal tally to three, the second highest behind the towering Mourtada Fall for a Goa defender. He has shown penchant for goals by moving up and hopes to add to his tally. “It’s a good feeling because it’s not normal for a defender to score. If you can score and help the team to get a draw or win, it’s good. I’ve scored three, and I hope to score more which can help the team,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/last-four-games-good-for-fc-goas-confidence-we-can-defeat-anyone-ivan-gonzalez/articleshow/88553435.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

This year’s toll has now risen to 23, the highest since 2017 when the official fatality count was 10. The six children include a 15-year-old boy from Mehrauli who died on October 28; a seven-year-old boy from Prem Nagar who died on October 29; an eight-month-old boy from Kirari who died on November 3; an eight-year-old girl from Dakshinpuri who died on November 5; a 13-year-old boy from Om Vihar Extension and a 10-year-old child from Tri Nagar who died on November 21. All of them succumbed to the disease in hospitals. As per procedure, the death audit committee of the corporations studies the fatalities that are suspected to be linked to dengue and submit a report confirming whether the cause of death is the vector-borne disease. Delhi’s overall case tally has now reached 9,545, out of which 6,344 were reported by SDMC, EDMC and North DMC. The remaining cases were reported by New Delhi Municipal Council, Delhi Cantonment and railways areas. In some relief, the number of dengue infections in the past one week has come down, from 154 in the previous week to 131. At 60 cases, North DMC accounted for most, followed by SDMC with 33 and EDMC with 23. The rest were reported by NDMC, Delhi Cantonment and railways areas. Officials in the public health department said while some cases may still be reported in the capital, they are waning. “We are seeing a decline in the number of dengue cases and mosquito breeding has also come down. The Delhi high court recently has asked us to constitute a task force to prevent the outbreak and we will do that soon,” said an EDMC official. In October this year, Delhi government, under the Epidemic Act, made it mandatory for all health facilities in the capital to report dengue cases to the administration. The city had in 2015 witnessed a massive outbreak of dengue, with the number of cases crossing 10,600 in October itself. It reported 4,431 cases the following year; 4,726 in 2017; 2,798 in 2018, 2,036 in 2019 and 1,072 in 2020, according to SDMC’s combined report.

He will be touring the districts and seeking to clarify concerns raised about the project. The first such interaction has been scheduled in Thiruvananthapuram on January 4. Eminent personalities from diverse fields have been invited for the meeting. The chief minister will directly interact with them and reply to their apprehensions and concerns. The CPM has also decided to launch a door-to-door campaign to clear concerns about the project. It has prepared a leaflet detailing the project to be distributed in households. Besides calling on people to rally behind the LDF government to create a vibrant Kerala, it has alleged an unholy nexus among the UDF, BJP and Jamaat-e-Islami to sabotage development projects. The opposition had raised serious questions about the project's economic viability, environment and social impact and estimate. Even within the LDF, there were reports of the CPI, the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad and even local CPM units opposing the project. Citing land acquisition for the development of national highway and implementation of the GAIL pipeline, Vijayan had maintained that the opposition to projects could be countered by scientifically analyzing them and interacting with the opponents.  Party committees have been asked to convene street and family meetings to explain the project to the common man. All these campaigns have been planned as part of the government decision to go ahead with the project despite opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-to-tour-districts-cpm-to-go-door-to-door/articleshow/88531369.cms||---

The three-day film festival, along with the proposed Film City project in Noida, Gorakhpur Lok Sabha MP Ravi Kishan said, will serve as an effective tool to prevent local talent from venturing outside of Uttar Pradesh in search of opportunities in the creative fields. Setting the tone for the UP polls, only a few months away now, Kishan also defended the timing of the festival’s launch. “Opposition says this was done with elections in mind. I say it reflects their own thinking. As far as we are concerned, we inaugurate 20 projects a day because that is the amount of work we have done,” Kishan said. Kishan also announced a ‘Natya Kumbh’, a gathering of 1800 theatre artists in Gorakhpur early next year, where he said they will celebrate lesser known heroes of Indian history under the theme of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ in the 75th year of Indian independence. State tourism, culture and charitable affairs minister and local legislator Neelkanth Tiwari also used the festival stage to assert that Prime Minister Modi has set India on the path to achieving ‘Ram Rajya’ as envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi, whether it is through the revamped Kashi Vishwanath corridor, the repeal of Article 370, or setting Muslim women “free” from the shackles of triple talaq. “Kashi is offering solutions to the problems of the world. When the PM launched the Kashi Vishwanath corridor, the world was watching. One problem festering for over 500 years was the Ayodhya one, the PM resolved that too,” Tiwari said. Lauding UP government and Film Bandhu for its effective promotion of UP as a go-to destination for film shooting, Union I&B secretary Apurva Chandra said the idea of hosting the Kashi Film Festival was conceived at the International Film Festival of India at Goa in November, keeping in mind UP’s rich contribution to the world of cinema. Veteran film actor Anupam Kher said the cinema was for the world and that creative talent should not limit themselves to geographies. He said the Kashi film festival will provide a platform to local talent from which to travel the world. Additional chief secretary Navneet Sehgal also said an investor’s summit hosted by the UP government in Mumbai had suggested that nearly 60% people working in the Bollywood film industry in various capacities were from UP. “This festival is an opportunity to promote local traditions and cultures in continuation of the Prime Minister’s efforts to improve Varanasi,” he said. The inaugural festival also saw performances by actor Manoj Joshi, singer Kailash Kher and stand-up comedian Raju Srivastava. The National Film Archives of India also showcased posters of 60 iconic Indian films – ranging from Satyajit Ray’s Joi Baba Felunath to Ram Teri Ganga Maili – shot in Varanasi. Many other celebrities like filmmaker Rahul Mittra, president of Indian Film & Television Directors Association Ashoke Pandit, directors Satish Kaushik & Madhur Bhandarkar will be seen in action during the next two days. While Anupam and Pandit will participate in a panel discussion on Varanasi’s cultural heritage, award-winning filmmaker Mittra will speak on the importance of Uttar Pradesh as a centre for film production, and the potential for regional cinema on the second day. This would be followed by performances of singer Kailash Kher and Hema Malini among others. Union I&B minister Anurag Thakur will preside over the function on the second day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashi-film-fest-pitches-up-as-filmmaking-hub/articleshow/88531988.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Jaipur||PSU banks should support loan waiver of farmers: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday said a proposal had been sent to the banks to provide relief to poor farmers by introducing a one-time loan waiver scheme ‘for waiver of crop loans of nationalised banks’. “By implementing this proposal, the nationalised banks should extend necessary support to the state government in loan waiver of farmers,” said Gehlot while addressing the 151st meeting of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) and NABARD’s loan seminar 2022-23 through video conference on Monday. He said in the one-time loan waiver scheme recently introduced by State Bank of India (SBI), agricultural loans classified as NPAs have been waived. “In this, 90 per cent of the loan has been waived by the bank and the remaining 10 per cent has been paid by the farmer. On similar lines, other banks should also provide relief to poor farmers,” he said. He said the state government was ready to give 10 per cent of the farmer’s share in this. “The objective of the state government and banks is to provide relief to farmers,” he said. Gehlot said, “As of now, Rs 14,000 crore co-operative banks’ loans have been waived, including the previous government’s loan of Rs 6,000 crore. Farm loans of nationalised banks, declared NPA on November 30, 2018, are yet to be waived.” The chief minister released the State Focus Paper of NABARD for the year 2022-23. He said NABARD has estimated the potential credit to priority sectors at Rs 2.50 lakh crore, which is 7.3 per cent higher than the estimated estimate of last year. “The state government has addressed these priorities in the budget. Banks and financial institutions should target lending to these identified sectors based on the capacity indicated in the document and prepare an annual action plan,” he said. SLBC convener Mahendra Singh Mahnot said the CD ratio of Rajasthan stood at 83.51 per cent in the September quarter, which is higher than the RBI benchmark. He said Ajmer and Dholpur have been selected as 100% digital districts this year. Jaideep Srivastava, CGM (chief general manager), NABARD, informed that it had given Rs 1,900 crore through RIDF (Rural Infrastructure Development Fund) in the last financial year, which is likely to be increased to Rs 3,000 crore in this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nationalised-banks-should-extend-support-in-loan-waiver-of-farmers-cm/articleshow/88531375.cms||---

Aiming to provide shelter homes at the Panchayat levels, RSLSA has also been creating awareness about the same. The Supreme Court on December 12, 2011, had asked the state chief secretary to provide shelter homes for the orphans and other downtrodden people in the state. “On the directions of Justice Manindra Mohan Shrivastava, executive chairman, RSLSA, a special drive along with the state government, was organized from December 22-24 to provide shelter to orphans and homeless people. This drive benefitted around 3340 persons,” said Dinesh Kumar Gupta, member secretary, RSLA, who is also district and sessions judge. He added that RSLSA aims at taking the shelter homes from municipal levels to the panchayat level. “In this shivering cold it is necessary to provide shelter to not only the poor in the cities but also in the villages,” Gupta added. RSLSA will also ensure timely benefits to the orphans and poor people through the social justice department in the government schemes. “As such people are unaware about the facilities including free stay, free food and medical aid, we will create awareness about the programme and its benefit,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-to-provide-shelter-to-orphans-footpath-dwellers/articleshow/88531391.cms||---

Inaugurating CPM’s Malappuram conference at Tirur on Monday, he said that while IUML had earlier faced criticism for taking a soft stand on extremist organizations and entering into tacit alliances with organisations like Jamaat-e-Islami and Popular Front of India (PFI) for political gain, now it is taking up the slogans and stand of extremist organizations. Vijayan said UDF was now taking up communal agenda to create communal polarisation as reflected in the Waqf Protection Rally organised by IUML in Kozhikode. He said that when some religious organizations and peace-loving people took a stand against IUML’s extremist stand, it dealt with those people in a harsh manner which exposed the intolerant attitude of the party. “The peace-loving people, who constitute the majority within IUML, should come forward against the extremist moves made by the party which will create religious strife,” the chief minister added. He said that right-wing forces could not come to terms with the LDF government returning to power and were resorting to false propaganda against the government. He added that UDF, BJP and Jamaat-e-Islami were all together in the moves against the government. He said that development will not remain stuck in the same place but move ahead with projects that would bring positive changes in the lives of people. Vijayan said that the government will not give up any development project that is required by the state. Meanwhile, responding to the allegations made by the chief minister, IUML’s national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said that the attempts to isolate IUML, which has always upheld its secular credentials, won’t do any good for the state. He added that it will be communal forces which will occupy the space occupied by the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cm-iuml-adopting-slogans-and-stand-of-extremist-outfits/articleshow/88531370.cms||---

The three-decade old foot overbridge has been shut for pedestrians for the last two years. KMC had engaged experts to conduct a structural safety test of the bridge before taking a decision to dismantle it. After an in-depth study and a subsequent load test experts found that the bridge could be used after making necessary changes. Biswajit Som, an expert and a consultant for the structural safety survey, said, “We have proposed restoration of the foot overbridge, which is located at a vantage spot and could serve the purpose of the pedestrians, if necessary steps are taken to strengthen it.” However, Som said they had suggested a roof cover for the restored bridge. “We may try to restore the bridge rather than dismantling it,” said a civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sealdah-fob-to-be-repaired-not-razed/articleshow/88530558.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Record revenue from IMFL sale||Thiruvananthapuram: This Christmas, the state earned a record revenue from the sale of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) through Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) and Consumerfed outlets. IMFL worth Rs 150 crore was sold in Kerala on December 24 and 25. On Christmas Eve, IMFL worth Rs 65 crore was sold through Bevco, which is Rs 10 crore more than the sale recorded last year. The highest IMFL sale by any outlet was recorded in Thiruvananthapuram. Bevco’s Powerhouse Road outlet sold IMFL worth Rs 73.53 lakh, while the outlet at Chalakudy sold liquor worth Rs 70.72 lakh. Bevco has 265 outlets. While Bevco sold Rs 65 crore worth IMFL, the outlets under Consumerfed sold IMFL worth Rs 11.5 crore on Christmas Eve. But this record revenue does not mean that the volume of liquor sold here has increased; the increase in revenue is due to the increase in prices of IMFL. Meanwhile, the price of IMFL sold through bar hotels and Consumerfed outlets have also increased as government has revised the wholesale profit margin of Bevco. In June this year, the profit margin of Bevco for its supply to Consumerfed was increased by 20%, while the margin for supply to bar hotels was increased by 25%. The government had revised the profit margin on the basis of a request from Bevco to improve its financial position. Bevco had then estimated a revenue loss of Rs 1,800 crore for the sales lost when all outlets were shut down due to Covid-19 in May and June. Liquor sales had begun on a positive note in the current financial year with the government earning Rs 970 cr (approx.) through sales from April 1-27. However, liquor sales had to be shut down from April 27. Last financial year, the state had earned a robust revenue from liquor sales. It earned Rs 11,743.99 crore through liquor sales during the last financial year, which is 5.28% less compared to the immediate year before it. In 2019-20, liquor sales had fetched the state exchequer Rs 12,398 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/record-revenue-from-imfl-sale/articleshow/88531424.cms||---

A few corporation officials have themselves expressed disappointment over the functioning of the automated sweepers. The two automated road sweeper trucks each with six cubic metres capacity were purchased at a total cost of Rs 1.73 crore. The vehicles can clean 16,000 sq m of area per hour and can be operated for eight hours straight. However, the frequency of operating the machines has been low and many residents are even unaware of such vehicles existing with the civic body. Although arterial roads in the city have silt gathered near the centre medians, the vehicles are not frequently operated. The corporation is using the vehicles once a week. Extensive usage of fuel by the vehicle was cited as one of the reasons for the limited usage. “Roads in Cantonment and Thillai Nagar still have silt accumulated, the vehicles can be used on a daily basis,” T Udayakumar, a resident of Anna Nagar added. While flat surface of roads was cleared properly, the machine struggled to remove silt from uneven area of the roads. The sweeper absorbs the silt only if there is a lot of on roads, officials claimed. “Minor modifications might be needed. We will increase the frequency of cleaning using the sweepers,” corporation officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/automated-road-sweepers-yet-to-be-deployed-in-trichy/articleshow/88531395.cms||Deepak Karthik

The court said the CCTV footage submitted by the accused puts a question mark on the allegations levelled by the complainant. “The CCTV footage was not collected by the investigating authority for reasons best known to them and the same has been collected now only in pursuance of the last order,” additional sessions judge Gangadeep Singh said in an order on December 10. The court granted anticipatory bail to the man and directed him not to leave Delhi without its prior permission. “As far as custodial interrogation is concerned, the replies filed till date by the investigating authority reflect that no such requirement is there. There is no possibility of applicants fleeing from the process of law in the said backdrop,” it stated. Advocate Pradeep Khatri, appearing for the man, had argued that he had been falsely implicated in the case and was fearing arrest. Khatri also submitted that the section of rape was added later to the initial FIR. He claimed that in the CCTV footage, the complainant can be seen using abusive language and assaulting the man and his family members. Police had opposed the anticipatory bail plea saying that the penal section for rape was added after the complainant’s statement was recorded by a magistrate and she was medically examined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-irked-at-cops-not-collecting-proof-gives-relief-to-rape-accused/articleshow/88531417.cms||---

He also rebutted allegations that outsiders were being allowed to buy land in large numbers. Responding to a question after inaugurating the first-ever Real Estate Summit in Jammu on whether he feels the need to set up a panel to review or repeal the AFSPA as is being done in Nagaland, Sinha said: “I am well-versed with the situation and there is no need for it… You need not worry about it.” The Centre on Sunday constituted a high-level committee, headed by a secretary-rank officer, to examine the possibility of lifting the controversial AFSPA in Nagaland, which seems as a move to soothe tensions in the northeastern state following the killing of 14 civilians. In response to another question about some leaders raising concerns about the government allowing people from other states to buy land and allow more private investment in the UT, he said: “I reject this outrightly. I will not react to statements of leaders… There is an attempt to mislead and incite people by certain sections. There will be no change in demography.” Rejecting the apprehensions of ‘no job’ to locals, he cited examples of how a large number of local people got work in hydropower, tunnel and highways projects in J&K. Taking on opponents and critics, Sinha said that there are “certain people” who don’t want common people in the UT to get benefits that others in the rest of India avail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/no-need-for-panel-to-review-afspa-in-jk-lg-sinha/articleshow/88534614.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Trichy||They used RTIs, memes to resolve Trichy’s civic woes||Trichy: With at least half of the year marred by the pandemic and lockdowns, 2021 saw the focus of authorities shifting to disease prevention while issues concerning basic amenities, road safety and civic grievances took a backseat. However, a few individuals with a zeal for social service stepped in to resolve road infrastructural defects in Trichy. Three of them stood out for utilising different grievance redressal platforms including right to information (RTI) petitions, complaint to CM’s special cell and the media effectively to find solutions. P Aiyarappan, 42, president of road users organisation: Until a year ago, the state highways department used to manage a portion of Trichy-Karur NH, which was dubbed a death trap for motorists. Aiyarappan, through several RTI appeals and sourcing accident data from police stations, was among the few to persistently raise the need for a wider road. Approaching the media with the RTI information, the activist brought the hardships of road users to the limelight. As a result, in mid-2021, state highways department widened the 11km stretch at a cost of Rs 55 crore. Now, an ill-maintained stretch of the NH near Dindukarai has also seen temporary maintenance work thanks to Aiyarappan who approached the relevant authorities. “Still, signboards were not placed on the widened road to caution users. I will keep a watch on the quality of the widened road to ensure that public money is not wasted,” Aiyarappan said. Changes made: Trichy-Karur NH now relatively safe after widening | New proposal drafted to replace damaged Kudamurutti bridge Modes: RTI and media H Ramachandran, 34, vegetable trader: While most road users were least bothered about the unscientific speed breakers in Trichy city though they were troublesome, Ramachandran was among the few to report the deviation to the authorities. “Just complaining will not help, we have to submit the evidence to make a change. Technology has come in handy to seek the attention of officials without visiting offices,” Ramachandran said. Because of the vegetable vendor’s constant follow-up, an unscientific speed breaker that had damaged several vehicles near Gandhi market was rectified. Rain-ravaged Dindigul NH also saw patchwork last month as Ramachandran raised a series of complaints. Taking the grievances to the notice of media also helped Ramachandran to persuade Trichy corporation to rectify the defects in roads and waste management. Changes made: Unscientific speed breakers modified, painted. | Bad roads near Gandhi market set for renovation Modes: Photos and print media Z Shabbeer Hussain, 27, architect: Having spent most of the year working from home in Khajamalai, Shabbeer Hussain, an architect employed in a Bengaluru firm, was busy creating memes and videos to help his area get relief from rain-hit roads. As Shabbeer circulated the pictures of bad residential roads in Khajamalai and K K Nagar as funny memes criticising Trichy corporation, the viral posts forced Trichy corporation to undertake repair work on the residential roads. “Cars were getting stuck on our roads, but the civic body was reluctant to repair. I made a few hard-hitting memes and took our grievances to media, which yielded results,” Shabbeer said. With the civic body filling potholes on roads and even levelling the surface, cars can access the roads with ease. The youth was also instrumental in closing unsafe and damaged culverts in his locality. Changes made: 1. Residential roads in Khajamalai get maintenance | Open culverts are now closed Modes: Memes and videos through media||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/they-used-rtis-memes-to-resolve-trichys-civic-woes/articleshow/88531435.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Extend thesis submission date for MPhil students: AUT||Trichy: Despite the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) order instructing universities to extend the date of submission of thesis for terminal MPhil and PhD students for six months beyond December 31, Bharathidasan University has extended the date only for PhD students. The Association of University Teachers (AUT) has urged the university to announce the date extension for MPhil students of all its affiliated colleges. The UGC had recently issued a circular extending the last date to June 30, 2022 for MPhil as well as PhD students based on representations from students who cited the delay caused by the pandemic. Meanwhile, a communique was issued by Bharathidasan University registrar to all principals, heads of departments and research supervisors of constituent colleges informing them about the extension of the submission date of a thesis to June 30 only for PhD students but not MPhil students. With the addition of nine new colleges during 2020-21, the total number of colleges affiliated to the university has now gone up to 161, including 123 arts and science colleges, 26 autonomous colleges and 12 approved institutions. Faculty members said around 1,500 MPhil students studying in various colleges affiliated to the university are left in the lurch as they have not been given extension. Most students were unable to complete their thesis due to the pandemic-induced lockdown and hence they need an extension. Otherwise, every student will have to pay Rs 1,500 as penalty for overshooting the submission date, N Saravanan, chairman of AUT, said. However, when contacted, registrar (in-charge) of the university Ganesh told TOI that based on appeal from the students, they had decided to extend the date for MPhil too, according to the UGC notification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/extend-thesis-submission-date-for-mphil-students-aut/articleshow/88531453.cms||---

---||Trichy||TN: Thanjavur hotel sealed for causing Rs 12 crore loss||TRICHY: The Thanjavur district administration has sealed a hotel functioning on revenue department land on charges of causing a Rs 12 crore loss to the exchequer by not remitting the required annual lease amount for years. The hotel authorities did not take the matter seriously despite sending repeated reminders, district collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver told reporters on Monday. The one hectare and 6,160 sq ft land was given to one Selvaraj on lease for 30 years sometime ago, where he built the hotel. There was a rule that the party who got the land on lease should not sublet it to anyone. However, Selvaraj violated it and sublet the land to two more people for commercial purposes, the collector further stated. “The hotel is located in a prime location of the city with 35 rooms, a restaurant, two party halls and a bar. The total value of the property is valued at approximately Rs 40 to Rs 50 crore. So, to avert further revenue loss to the government, we have taken the action jointly with corporation and police officials,” he added. A total of 15 guests who stayed at the hotel vacated their rooms on Sunday and their rent was also returned, the collector further stated. In a similar case, crime branch police arrested a man on Sunday and are searching for three others on a complaint lodged by Thanjavur city corporation accusing them of causing Rs 19.14 crore loss to the exchequer by not paying monthly rent to the corporation. In 1926, a 40,793sqft site belonging to the corporation located near the old bus stand was leased to Sri Sudarsana Sabha for more than 100 years. Sabha functionaries sublet 29,747sqft of it to a private party violating norms. On finding the violations, the corporation authorities sealed both the sabha and other commercial establishments three months ago. Meanwhile, based on a complaint lodged by city corporation authorities, city crime branch police booked sabha chairman R K Ramanathan and his three brothers for causing Rs 19.14 crore loss and arrested one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/thanjavur-hotel-sealed-for-causing-rs-12cr-loss/articleshow/88531458.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi villagers meet, vow to protect their roots as they seek ‘rightful development’||NEW DELHI: Vowing to fight to protect their roots, a meeting of Federation of Delhi Gram Panchayats representing the residents of the capital’s villages was held on Monday. Suffering rampant urbanisation, which had led to congested and chaotic living, the residents of around 151 villages were forced to open a front demanding rightful development from the authorities. “We are crying for help. The villages of Delhi are getting entangled in the vicious cycle of loot by the central and state governments. There is a multiplicity of authorities, land is with Delhi Development Authority, while the revenue department is under Delhi government. Thousands of acres of village land were acquired in the name of planned development. But neither the government nor the administration has tried to resolve the extremely challenging and deteriorating condition of the villages,” said Rajbir Singh, president of the federation. The move comes days after Delhi government announced that it would spend Rs 399 crore on village development projects. According to the villagers, most of these areas are being neglected in the name of development and their culture is being uprooted to expand the city. “Though many past reports and committees have recommended to the decision makers to act on the request of the natives, nobody has acted on the demands for basic facilities. As a result, the villages and quality of life continue to worsen. We demand an administrative review of Delhi government by the Centre to assess the amount of revenue collected from villages and not spent on development works,” said Pras Tyagi, co-founder of Centre for Youth Culture Law and Environment, a non-profit organisation working in the field of village policy reforms. At the meeting, the village representatives said though revenue was being collected by Delhi government in the name of development, the situation was such that unauthorised colonies were coming up. The villagers said development had stopped since Independence, but the population was increasing. In such a case, the current infrastructure was on the brink of collapse. “We are not at all happy with the land pooling policy, which aims to make a fool out of farmers. It exploits our position and our land is bought. It is high-time that the governments listen to us and meet our demands. Our fight is to protect the original Delhi,” said Solanki. Delhi government did not respond to TOI’s queries on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-villagers-meet-vow-to-protect-their-roots-as-they-seek-rightful-development/articleshow/88531456.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav told TOI that he has already diverted Rs 15 crore. “Another Rs 25 crore would be diverted soon for the same purpose,” he said. The NMC has already decided to curtail some unnecessary works worth Rs 170 crore due to drop in its revenue and requirement of money for preparation of the third wave. The curtailed projects include road and other unnecessary works included in the budget of the NMC for the current financial year. “The revenue of the NMC through various taxes like property, water and various taxes related to the town planning department of the civic body has been badly affected,” an NMC official said. “There is still shortfall of Rs 300 crore in NMC’s revenue through various taxes. Hence, the NMC has decided to curtail all unnecessary developmental works. Moreover, some of the amount saved through curtailment of the unnecessary developmental works are to be transferred for battling Covid,” he said. The NMC has spent Rs 55 crore during the first and second wave, while Rs 15 crore has been spent so far for the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-divert-rs-40-crore-for-covid-prep/articleshow/88529749.cms||Tushar Pawar

The CM inaugurated and laid the foundation for 378 development projects worth Rs 553.81 crore in Pratapgarh and projects worth Rs 116.83 crore in Sitapur. Speaking during Jan Sandesh Yatra in Pratapgarh, the CM said, “The opposition parties have not been able to rise above dynastic rule and family. One party is of sister and brother, the other of uncle and nephew, and third of aunt and nephew. When the uncle and nephew are fighting among themselves, who will listen to the people?” Yogi also asked the opposition why they never thought of Pratapgarh’s development. “Voters should question the Congress which ruled for so many years, to the SP which had its government for four times and supported the central government, and to the BSP as to who stopped them from thinking of Pratapgarh’s development,” he added. “We do not take 20 years to complete a project like previous regimes. BJP announces a project and completes it in record time. The medical college in Pratapgarh is one such example,” the CM said. “While they believe in ‘politics of votes’ for which they did not hesitate in firing on Hindus in Ayodhya, BJP believes in honouring Ram bhakts, for whom a grand temple is being constructed,” he said. The CM remotely inaugurated and laid foundation of 378 projects in the district worth Rs 553.81 crore. The projects included a residential complex in Mandhata development block, primary health centre at Kataiah in Nevada, VVPAT storage warehouse at Gaighat, building of upper primary school, Sangipur, and New Kot Gaura, Naziapur, a mini stadium and hostels of GGIC of Mandhata and Patti, beautification of Chauharjandevi Dham, among others. He also laid foundation of 120 projects of Jal Jeevan Mission and Kataiya Nevada Polytechnic, new roads, drains, government office buildings and staff quarters. In Sitapur, the CM slammed the SP over the raid on a Kanpur-based industrialist with links to SP from whose premises about Rs 150 crore cash was recovered. “Money is coming out of walls at homes of those from SP. Now we understand why Bua-Babua were opposing demonetisation,” he said. Talking about the government’s scheme of giving tablets and smartphones to students, the CM said the Samajwadi family could not tolerate such schemes because for them their family is the state while for BJP, the state is the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/oppn-parties-unable-to-rise-above-dynasty-politics-nepotism-yogi/articleshow/88532040.cms||Rajeev Mani

---||Kolkata||Bow Barracks Christmas festivity to be part of govt do from next year: West Bengal CM||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited Bow Barracks on Monday and told the residents that the Christmas celebration in the Anglo-Indian enclave, tagged the biggest and the most vibrant one in the city, would be part of the government’s year-end festivity from next year. As Banerjee’s convoy rolled into the central Kolkata alley, flanked by red-brick three-storey “garrison” buildings, residents gathered on the ground to welcome her. “I have heard so much about Bow Barracks and decided to visit the place once. This is my first time in Bow Barracks during this time of the year,” Banerjee told the residents, who were visibly excited over her visit, clocking selfies with the CM and exchanging Christmas greetings. “You all know we celebrate Christmas in a grand manner every year. From next year we want to include Bow Barracks in our Christmas celebrations. All the lightings and other programmes will be done by us. But you must remind me a few weeks before the festival,” she told residents. Banerjee’s visit to Bow Barracks, where most families practise Christianity, came two days after incidents of vandalism at churches, disruption of Christmas prayers and assault on members of the community in UP, Haryana and MP, were reported. Banerjee had condemned the incidents. Barracks families were thrilled when they first received the news that the chief minister would visit their neighbourhood. Many of them even cancelled their other plans so that they could stay back and meet Banerjee. “We are honoured that the chief minister visited Bow Barracks herself and wished us for the festival. Next year, we will extend an invitation to her to celebrate with us at Bow Barracks,” said Angela Govindraj, a resident. Earlier this year, the government repaired the six blocks of three-storey buildings at Bow Barracks, which had fallen to utter disrepair as no work had been for five decades. Bow Barracks was built as Garrisons’ mess in 1918, meant for the accommodation of World War I soldiers, but they had refused to stay there. Later, displaced Anglo Indian families were rehabilitated there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-bow-barracks-christmas-festivity-to-be-part-of-govt-do-from-next-year/articleshow/88530570.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Forest scanner on shoots with birds||KOLKATA: The state forest department has issued notices to several models, photographers and shoot coordinators who have been recently found posing with birds like owls and parrots during organized studio photoshoots and flaunting them on social media. A senior officer of Wildlife Crime Control Cell said they recently came across a trend on social media, where multiple professional models were found shooting with birds and other animals. At many posts the photographers or shoot coordinators even flaunted about the animals and shared their experiences about the shoot. So far around 10 people have been sent notices and asked to turn up for interrogation before the office of Forest Range officer in Howrah, within a week, failing which legal action will be initiated against them. They have been booked under sections 9, 11, 39, 48A, 49A, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 for illegal wildlife capture, transport and possession of the animals in violation of the act. If proved guilty, they can be jailed for up to seven years. The capture, transportation and possession of such animals, protected under wildlife protection act, is prohibited and a punishable offence. Officials said that the use of animals for images or videos is on a steady rise and in most cases, the offenders claimed they were unaware, due to the lack of proper knowledge, that they were committing a crime. “There were posts, where the models dressed as goddess Lakshmi posed with live Owl and there were also photos and videos of women holding live parrots in their hands. We have sent notices to all of them and asked them to appear for interrogation,” said an officer. “Some of the respondents claimed they didn’t know that they were committing a crime while organising the shoots with the animals. That is the situation with majority of us. People need to be made aware that it is illegal to cage and keep the animals and birds like owls, parrots, turtles and macaws as pets for several years. It is also illegal to use them in shoots without prior permission,” the officer said. When TOI contacted two such models, they claimed they did not know that shooting with parrots and owls was illegal. Both of them refused to be quoted. As per the Union law ministry’s advice to the information and broadcasting ministry, shooting with animals can only be done after formal approval of Animal Welfare Board of India and after prior intimation of date, time and exact location of the shooting are communicated to the board. If the details of shooting are not intimated to the board, it reserves the right not to issue NOC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/forest-scanner-on-shoots-with-birds/articleshow/88530574.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Forest department to end search for tiger in Wayanad||KOZHIKODE: The forest department is set to wind up the extensive search operations to capture the injured tiger at Kurukkanmoola in Wayanad. The decision has been made on the presumption that the tiger, which had suffered a serious snaring injury in the neck, has moved away from human habitation and is not likely to return. Wayanad had over the last two weeks witnessed an unprecedented mobilization of personnel and resources by the forest department to capture the injured tiger which killed as many as 16 domestic animals. Over 200 department staff, kumki elephants, two darting teams, apart from drones and five trap cages were deployed for the operation. The department has now decided to wind up the search as there has been no livestock depredation in Kurukkanmoola and nearby areas for the last 10 days and no presence of the tiger had been recorded in the area despite deploying around 70 camera traps up to 5km inside the forests. State chief wildlife warden has directed to immediately remove the five trap cages from the area as it could attract other tigers and leopards from the forests, leading to fresh conflicts. “The operation needs to be wound up as no immediate conflict is presumed and the staffs are required to attend to other important duties like preparation for the coming fire season,” chief conservator of forests, northern circle, Kannur, Vinod Kumar D K, said in a letter to the Wildlife Warden, Wayanad, dated December 27. It has, however, been directed that necessary arrangements may be made for responding to any conflict issues in the future by designating a response team. “Monitoring of tiger presence in the vicinity may be continued for some more time using camera traps,” the letter said. South Wayanad divisional forest officer A Sajna said that the monitoring committee constituted as per NTCA guidelines will meet on Tuesday and assess the situation and submit its recommendation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/forest-dept-to-end-search-for-tiger/articleshow/88531479.cms||---
---||Delhi||IIT-Delhi to start STEM mentorship programme for Class XI girl students||NEW DELHI: Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi is set to launch a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) mentorship programme for girls studying in Class XI. The programme, which will include writing papers and internships as well, is likely to be launched on December 30. As a part of the pilot project at the institute level, 10 students from various Kendriya Vidyalayas in the city have been shortlisted. The students will get a chance to interact closely with faculty members of the institute and even have dedicated mentors assigned to each. Senior IIT Delhi officials said that over time, the programme was likely to be extended to a wider range of students across different schools. Speaking to TOI, Pritha Chandra, associate dean of academic outreach and new initiatives, said, “This programme is meant for high school girls only with an aim of having an extended interaction between these students and the faculty members. The schools have nominated each of the 10 students who have already decided their stream of study. They were given a bunch of topics that are offered here and accordingly faculty members were allotted as their mentors.” Those part of the programme will begin with a winter internship, which will last for about a week or two before the schools reopen. According to officials, between the months of January and April, the students will get to interact with the faculty members while pursuing their regular school curriculum. “During the winter internship, they will be introduced to the basic areas of work that they will work on. Once their school reopens, they will continue their interaction with the faculty and even have access to teaching modules on various subjects. This will be a continuous interaction,” Chandra said. In view of the pandemic situation, the programme will be conducted in the online mode for now. If the situation improves, then the students will also get a chance to have a hands on experience in May or June. “On completion of the programme, they will receive certificates,” Chandra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-delhi-to-start-stem-mentorship-programme-for-class-xi-girl-students/articleshow/88531474.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Pune||Pune: Few takers for e-rickshaws amid rise in e-vehicle registrations||PUNE: E-rickshaws have failed to make an impression in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad though registrations of other e-vehicles surged in regional transport offices. However, officials claimed that the future of e-rickshaws was bright with a new variant of the same, resembling autorickshaws, becoming slowly popular. “In 2017, there were a few e-rickshaw registrations and in 2018 there were some more as well. As per the regulations of the transport department, e-rickshaws for passengers in the state can only ply on selected routes. Most of these vehicles don’t have enough speed and can cause a traffic jam. Somehow, the plan has not worked in Pune. However, a new model of the e-vehicle ‘LM5’, which looks exactly like an autorickshaw and has power and speed. It has been gaining popularity and is being registered too. In 2021, around five registrations have already been done, apart from general e-vehicles, which too are on the rise,”Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjiv Bhor said. Around 6,000 e-vehicles were registered with the Pune RTO till December 27, this year. The Pimpri Chinchwad RTO registered 4,400 e-vehicles. The transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said that as per regulations, e-rickshaws were allowed only on the designated routes as decided by the traffic police. In 2017, around 17 routes had been selected by the Pune RTO in coordination with the city traffic police. “There were concerns about charging of such vehicles and also the cost. Hence, they didn’t get popular in the city,” another RTO official said. However, those who had bought these vehicles said otherwise. They blamed the regular autorickshaw drivers and unions for the same. “E-rickshaws have been plying successfully in many cities for around five years now. We were simply not allowed to ply by the regular autorickshaw drivers, who felt that their monopoly would end. There were problems, arguments and squabbles and we didn’t get proper support of authorities. If planned and executed carefully, small four seaters would have been successful in providing the last mile connectivity. I changed my e-rickshaw to an e-cart,” a driver, requesting anonymity, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/few-takers-for-e-rickshaws-amid-rise-in-e-vehicle-registrations/articleshow/88531475.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Chennai||It’s time we make mental health a part of the curriculum||CHENNAI: Over the past couple of months, reports from across Tamil Nadu of suicides of schoolgirls who have faced abuse has brought back focus on personal wellbeing of children. Suicide is a predominant public health concern across the world. According to the National Crime Records Bureau 1,53,052 suicides were reported in 2020, which is 0.9% more than the previous year. In Tamil Nadu, the recent cases involved sexual harassment and in some cases the perpetrator was a teacher. There is no other form of cruelty that compares to a teacher harassing students as the teacher, after parents, has the capability to influence a child’s growth. The abuse could be sexual or any form of violence. The solution to this lies in awareness, confidence building and a preventive mechanism in schools. The first step is to have dedicated psychological counselling for teachers as well as students. Children at these mental health camps must be taught what constitutes sexual harassment, how, where, and who to turn to for help if they have been sexually assaulted. Children should be made aware of the idea of consent and what their behaviour should be in a particular situation. For instance, counselling can provide them with tools to act when they are in an uncomfortable position such as how to say no. Children should also be made aware that any one invading their personal space can be penalised, no matter who they may be. It’s also critical to make them realise that suicide is not an option. The effects of the pandemic have scarred many, making it imperative for teachers and children to have mental health camps at school. Some may have lost a parent, a close relative or sibling or could experience psychological fatigue after being stuck at home for months. In such cases, instructors can assist a child in healing. Similarly, teachers too could be bogged by grief, loneliness or pressure at work to adapt to the demands of a digital classroom. In case of any allegation, the school administration needs to be equipped to handle the matter with sensitivity and care. At the outset, the school administration should appoint an internal committee to investigate any complaint made by students without dismissing them. When a teacher who is helping children requires assistance, it is the state’s responsibility to provide it fully. A psychologist, a teacher at the school, an administrative personnel, child rights activists and members of the state Child Rights Commission should all be included in an administrative committee. Similarly, in government institutions the state should ensure that faculty are educated on how to handle students and what their rights as educators are. Realising the need for government intervention, the TN education minister had issued a statement about plans to appoint psychological counsellors in each district to provide psychological counselling to school students and teachers. Whether directly or indirectly, if we make our children aware of scenarios, offer them support and a safe space to share their experiences we can prevent young people from taking the extreme step.

---||Nagpur||Go for dual RT-PCR prior to sequencing, states told||Pune/Nagpur: The Union health ministry has advised affected states to adopt dual RT-PCR testing strategy to cut cost of genome sequencing and also ease burden on resources. As per the new plan, suspected patient’s throat/nasal swab samples will first undergo a test using standard RT-PCR kit. If detected positive, the same sample will be tested with an imported RT-PCR kit having an S-gene drop. “Only those samples testing positive for S-gene drop-out or S-gene target failure (SGTF) will be genomically sequenced for Omicron presence. In addition to cost-cutting, it will also help in picking up the highly probable Omicron cases and save resources,” a senior Union health ministry official told TOI on Monday. “The cost of genome sequencing goes up to Rs5,000 per Covid sample in India. This includes transport, human resource, and other heads including electricity and water that are key to performing the scientific exercise,” said the official. The cost of a standard RT-PCR kit and imported RT-PCR kit with SGTF is Rs19 and Rs240, respectively. The dual RT-PCR costs Rs260 and is way cheaper than sequencing every Covid positive sample to rule out the presence of Omicron, he explained. Besides mainly testing individuals with international travel history as well as their close contacts, these kits can also be used at government-run laboratories for routine Covid tests to rule out community spread from daily caseload having high viral load or below 25 cycle threshold (CT) value. Maharashtra government is among the first to have already started implementing the dual testing prior to sequencing the samples for Omicron presence. Quite a few districts with high floating population in the state have already received the imported kits to carry out the second test prior to sending all Covid positive samples for sequencing, which is a capital-intensive exercise. So far, 23 of 60 Covid positive samples have tested positive for S-gene drop-out in Nagpur. Instead of sequencing all the 60 samples, these 23 samples are being prioritized for sequencing in Nagpur. The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) at the city’s Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) — one of the key sentinel centres in Maharashtra — is carrying out the second RT-PCR test for SGTF prior to sending the samples for genome sequencing. IGGMCH’s head of microbiology department and principal investigator Dr SS Raut said, “The civic and district administrations are forwarding Covid samples from both public and private labs since December 7. We are testing them again using the specialized RT-PCR kits for SGTF.” Nagpur’s second confirmed Omicron patient — 21-year-old who returned from Dubai — was the first whose throat/nasal swab sample when tested twice with RT-PCR kit showed the SGTF. The sample was later genomically sequenced to confirm the presence of Omicron variant. As on December 26, India’s Omicron tally has surged to 578 of which 151 have already been discharged. Delhi accounts for the highest number of Omicron cases 142, followed by Maharashtra 141, and Kerala 57. Total 17 states have reported these cases so far. “If a person tests positive for SGTF in the second RT-PCR test, then we can take his/her sample for whole genomic sequencing on priority. The chances of the variant detection rise manifold in such cases. This will also save a lot of time and resources as genome sequencing is costly,” said Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, one of the key microbiologists involved in the INSACOG network. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), jointly initiated by the Union health ministry, and department of biotechnology (DBT) with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is a consortium of 38 laboratories to monitor the genomic variations in the SARS-CoV-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/go-for-dual-rt-pcr-prior-to-sequencing-states-told/articleshow/88531481.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Also, no deaths were reported between December 5 and 9. In November too, Nashik city had reported no Covid death for six consecutive days between November 11 and 16. The officials of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said the trend of no Covid deaths for five and six consecutive days in December has been seen for the first time during the second wave of the pandemic. This is despite, a marginal rise in active cases as on December 5, the city had 147 cases which has now increased to 240. The city had reported 18 Covid deaths in September and 14 deaths in October, while 11 patients succumbed to Covid in November. A total of 14 deaths have been registered in December so far.  NMC officials said the bulk of Covid patients are asymptomatic and did not require any oxygen or ventilator support. However, the officials have appealed to the people to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour due to the looming threat of the Omicron variant. Meanwhile, there has been a marginal drop in Covid cases as in November, 27 cases were reported per day on average while in December so far, 25 cases have been recorded per day. NMC officials said they have prepared for the expected third wave of Covid. The NMC administration has expressed its concerns over a section of people violating the Covid-appropriate behaviour. Some people are still not wearing masks in public places. NMC administration has already intensified a drive against the erring city residents at wedding functions and malls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-no-covid-death-for-6-consecutive-days-in-dec/articleshow/88529753.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Pune||Pimpri Chinchwad CP Krishna Prakash an Iron Man leading from the front, 24x7||PUNE: For a police commissioner, to lead a late night operation involving the risk of physical harm, is something rarely heard of. But not for Krishna Prakash, the man in charge of the Pimpri Chinchwad police commissionerate. A fitness freak with a penchant for participating and completing gruelling triathlon events at national and international levels, Krishna Prakash is the first Indian government servant, civil servant and uniformed services officer to earn the Iron Man title — one of the toughest sporting events in the world. He has the terrace of his house converted into a gym and a part of his living room into an cycling and running activity space. “I barely miss the daily hour-long exercise regime,” he told TOI during a one-on-one interaction on Monday evening. His colleagues and subordinate officers vouch for his hands on approach to policing. Sunday night’s operation to arrest three wanted murder suspects at Koye village near Chakan is just a point in case. Two days ago, the police chief was personally questioning suspects at Talegaon Dabhade police station in relation to a teenager’s murder. On Sunday too, he was at Alandi to collect investigation details of a Rs16 lakh ATM robbery, when the tip-off came about the trio’s presence in Koye. It barely took any time before Krishna Prakash got a 20-member team to set out for Koye village. “Our (police) commissioner was leading from the front,” said crime branch assistant inspector Harish Mane . “The entire planning and execution was his. All of us were enthusiastic because of his presence,” said Mane. Senior inspector Sunil Tonpe said, “Despite the physical discomfort and bruises to his right hand, stomach and forehead, we could see him chasing and picking up a tree branch and throwing it at the suspects to stop them in their tracks.” The police chief said, “I had gone to Mumbai on a day’s leave. But I had to cancel leave in the wake of the ATM robbery incident in Alandi. It is a serious case considering that the culprits had triggered a blast to commit the robbery. I was just collecting information from our crime team when news about the murder suspects whereabouts came.” He said, “It was difficult to trace them as they were not using cellphones for talking. Our team had traced them in Karnataka but they had escaped before reaching Koye. They were communicating with each through social media platform. They were using a dongle to get internet connectivity. We did not want to miss them. As I was near the spot, I decided to be with my team and rushed there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/krishna-prakash-an-iron-man-leading-from-the-front-24x7/articleshow/88531482.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 57k engineering seats vacant, last leg of admissions on Wed||PUNE: Of the 1.3 lakh seats available for undergraduate engineering courses across the state, about 73,000 students have confirmed their admissions after round 2, which leaves about 57,000 seats vacant. Colleges are hopeful that college-level admissions that are going on at the moment will fill up many seats. However, vacancies are more in courses such as mechanical engineering as compared to computer and IT branches due to better chances of placement in the IT sector, principals said. Prashant Patil, registrar at Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering said that students were still running around hoping to get admissions in computer/IT branches. “There are seats still available in the mechanical branch but all other branches are almost full. There are still students running around colleges, hoping to get admission in computer or IT branches. When they do not get in either of these branches, they are going for electronics and telecommunication. Trends in engineering admissions change every 10-12 years. Now everybody is after computer/IT branches, but in a few years, mechanical will be once again in demand,” Patil said. There are 1,30,836 seats available for undergraduate engineering courses. In Centralised Admission Round 1, 77,877 students were allotted while in Round 2, 87,272 students were allotted colleges. But not all allotted students confirm their admissions. After the end of centralised round 2, 73,109 admissions were confirmed by students in all engineering colleges across the state. Placement officers in colleges have said that candidates with certificates and degree courses from education technology platforms in fields such as data engineers, digital marketers and product managers are on top of the hiring list of the companies. The candidates who completed these were offered an annual package of Rs 25 lakh on an average by employers. The candidates were hired across sectors such as technology, banking, financial services and insurance, media and entertainment among others. Industrial certifications are becoming more useful during hiring. This is a newer part of skill sets required but it also depends on what type of a course one has done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/57k-engineering-seats-vacant-last-leg-of-admissions-on-wed/articleshow/88531476.cms||Ardhra Nair

A forest team led by the local DFO and ADFO is stationed at Dongashora village under Kultali block where the tiger is hiding in a mangrove thicket. A senior forest department official said that though they have managed to trace the tiger’s location, it’s not coming out of the thicket making it difficult for them to tranquillize it. “We have secured the spot with three layers of nylon net fencing to make sure that the big cat can’t leave its current location. We also have to keep in mind that the villages nearby remain safe,” said a forester. On Monday, forest staff, according to chief wildlife warden Debal Roy, even burst crackers to force the tiger come out of the mangroves so that it can be tranquillized. “We have already set up two machanas where our teams are ready to tranquillize it. But it’s not coming out. Without a clear view, it will be risky to dart it. We have also placed two trap cages with baits at the location,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sunderbans-tiger-yet-to-be-captured/articleshow/88530594.cms||TNN
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Assembly resolution to defer local body polls||Mumbai: The state legislature on Monday unanimously passed a resolution to recommend that the State Election Commission postpone future local body polls until the 27% OBC quota is restored. This comes two weeks after the state cabinet passed a similar resolution in the wake of the SC verdict earlier this month which de-notified OBC quota seats on the grounds that the state had not provided empirical data to support the quota. The resolution which was read out by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, was passed unanimously in the state assembly and council. By March 2022, the term of a large number of local bodies is set to lapse. This includes 15 municipal corporations including Mumbai, 10 municipalities, 25 zilla parishads and 380 panchayat samitis.  The state election commission said the it would not be able to follow the recommendation since it was bound to follow the apex court’s directions. “Unless empirical data is provided, there will be no provision for OBC quota seats in the local bodies once their terms lapse,” said a senior official. He added they were waiting to see the view taken by the SC on the review petition filed by the Centre on the OBC quota for local polls in Madhya Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-assembly-resolution-to-defer-local-body-polls/articleshow/88532482.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

A pen bearing the name of one of the complainants helped the police solve the multiple cases of theft. A team headed by senior police inspector (SPI) Bharat Jadhav, police inspector (PI) Mangesh Jagtap, police sub inspector (PSI) Sachin Jadhav and others arrested the trio, identified as Gajraj Motilal Verma (38) of Dhayari, Gore alias Rati Rana (32) of Panvel, and Shashikant Bhimrao Jadhav (32) of Karmala in Solapur on Friday evening, after a tip-off. The trio are criminals on police records and have been previously arrested for 24 house break-ins. Police found a ball-point pen with Verma, bearing the name of a man. When they checked records, they realised that the name was of a complainant who had registered a theft case at the Airport police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-recover-booty-worth-rs-29l-from-trio/articleshow/88531487.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Murder suspects fire shots, held after top cop & team give chase||PUNE: Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash and two policeman suffered bruises during a late Sunday night exchange of fire and chase at Koye village near Chakan, about 45km from the city, leading to the arrest of three suspects wanted in the recent murder of Yogesh Jagtap (36), a criminal on records, at Pimple Gurav. Krishna Prakash was leading one of the four police teams, which had encircled a house close to a farm field at Koye after establishing the presence of the three suspects there. The trio ran out of the house on sensing the police movement and two of them fired indiscriminately to deter the approaching policemen. The police fired two rounds in retaliation. No one was injured in the exchange of fire, but the suspects moved into the nearby farm field and became aggressive as they kept running towards a nearby hillock with the policemen running after them. “We were closing in on the house from the hillock side when we noticed the trio running away with our other teams chasing them. We also started chasing them and I picked up a fairly thick 6ft long tree branch and hurled it at the three men. Two of them fell on the ground and the third stuttered. That was enough for our men to zero in on and overpower them,” Krishna Prakash told TOI during a one-on-one interaction at his residence on Monday evening. “I suffered some bruises and abrasions to my hands and stomach, partly because of a slip while coming down the hillock towards the house, besides a crawling approach to the house for some distance. The incident also caused a shoulder sprain and I went for a medical check up on Monday. The doctor’s advised me a day’s rest.” Assistant police inspector Satish Kamble and another policemen, whose name could not be confirmed immediately, suffered minor bruises in the action. It was a 20-member police contingent which carried out the action. The police later recovered two country-made firearms, a cartridge and a motorcycle from the tri — Ganesh Mote (23), a criminal externed from Solapur district and main suspect in the Pimple Gurav murder, Mahesh Mane (23) of Sangvi and Ashwin Chavan (21) of Katepuram Chowk where Jagtap was shot dead at 10.30am on December 18. Mote and Chavan are from Mohol and Barshi, respectively, in Solapur district. Mane is from Pathsavangi in Bhum taluka of Osmanabad district. “In their preliminary questioning, the trio told police that they had opened fire thinking that their rival gang members were closing in on them,” Krishna Prakash said. On December 18, Mote and his aide had fired four rounds at Jagtap before snatching the bike of a passerby at gunpoint and driving away from the spot. A separate murder attempt case has been registered on the basis of the biker’s complaint. The police had since established involvement of 14 people in the conspiracy. “With the trio’s arrest, we have so far nabbed nine suspects and detained one minor. Four suspects are still on the run. Collectively, we have seized four country-made pistols from those arrested so far,” ” deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Anand Bhoite told TOI. As narrated by the police chief, the tip-off about Mote and his two aides came while Krishna Prakash was at Alandi on Sunday night to assess the investigation of the Rs16 lakh theft by some unidentified robbers who had triggered a blast at a private bank’s ATM at Chimbali village in the early morning hours. “Our chief immediately formed four teams that set out for Koye village. The chief was himself leading one team, while assistant commissioner Prashant Amrutkar, senior inspector Sunil Tonpe of the Sangvi police (investigating the Jagtap murder) and assistant inspector (API) Satish Kamble led the other teams,” said DCP Manchak Ipper. “One of the teams first carried out a recce of the spot and found a motorcycle, without a registration number plate, parked outside a lone house in the corner of a farm land at Koye. After establishing the trio’s presence in the house, the team signalled others and all the police teams started approaching the house from different directions around 11.15pm,” said Ipper. He said, “On seeing the policemen approaching them, the trio started running towards the nearby hillock. In the process, one of them first fired a round in the direction of the team near the hillock while another suspect opened fire in the direction of another team. In return, senior inspector Tonape and API Kamble fired one round each towards the suspects. Despite the bushes and trees, the police commissioner and the other teams were chasing them.” He said apart from the two country-made pistols, the police also seized a cellphone and a motorcycle from the trio. “A separate case under section 307 (attempt to murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code and under the Indian Arms Act provisions has been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pimpri-chinchwad-police-chief-2-cops-injured-in-exchange-of-fire-chase-to-nab-3-murder-suspects/articleshow/88531488.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Ahmedabad||Mudra loan NPAs swell by 48% in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: As micro-enterprises battle the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic, gross non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans outstanding under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana increased 48% in Gujarat. According to the latest report by the state-level bankers’ committee (SLBC), Gujarat, NPAs for Mudra loans stood at Rs 872.25 crore in absolute terms in the September quarter of 2021-22. NPAs went up from Rs 587.26 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2020-21, the report states. During the September quarter of this year, the total outstanding of loans extended under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) stood at Rs 9,300.5 crore. From April to November 2021, loans worth Rs 5,172.56 crore were extended under PMMY in Gujarat of which, Rs 3,083.34 crore was disbursed between August and November. According to bankers, non-performing assets went up in Mudra loans as micro enterprises continued to battle aftershocks of Covid-19. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, smaller enterprises and a number of players in the informal sector faced a lot of disruption. Consequently, their loan repayment capacities weakened and more NPAs were classified. “The situation, however, improved slightly in the September quarter this year, as businesses across the spectrum began to head towards normal,” said a well-placed source in the SLBC. Besides micro enterprises, a lot of small traders and vendors are also eligible for Mudra loans, and they were among the worst affected entities due to the Covid-19 lockdown, said industry sources. “The increasing prices of raw materials and growing uncertainty affected businesses across sectors and sizes. “The impact will be steeper on smaller enterprises because they don’t have deep pockets. At the same time, being classified as an NPA makes things more difficult for small enterprises because it makes getting finance from other banks difficult as well,” said Pathik Patwari, senior vice president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mudra-loan-npas-swell-by-48/articleshow/88531552.cms||Niyati Parikh

During the last two days, the NMC has slapped a total fine of Rs 2 lakh on five wedding halls and a city-based mall for not following the norms. Most of the people at the wedding halls and mall were found without masks. Moreover, some wedding halls had more than the permissible number of people, violating the government guidelines. An NMC official said their divisional squads visited five wedding halls where most of the guests were found without masks. “We slapped a fine of Rs 25,000 each on the owners of four wedding halls where most of the guests had not worn masks. Also, there was huge gathering in one of the five wedding halls. We slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on the errant wedding hall owner,” he said. “We also visited a newly-opened mall in Pathardi area of Nashik city where huge rush of people was noticed in violation of the government norms. There too we slapped a fine of Rs 50,000,” he added. As per new guidelines, the total number of attendees at any moment should not exceed 100 for enclosed spaces (like banquet and marriage halls, etc) and 250 for open spaces, or 25 % of the capacity of such spaces. Many owners said the restrictions imposed would hit them financially. Apart from ensuring every guest at the wedding ceremony is fully vaccinated, the owners will also have to ensure that the wedding halls and lawns are empty before 9 pm. There are close to 400 wedding halls and lawns spread across the district. Jadhav has already directed the officials to intensify the drive against those not wearing masks at weddings, functions, markets and public places. He has also directed the divisional officers to pay random visits at the wedding functions to ensure that the CAB is being followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/5-wedding-halls-a-mall-penalised-for-violating-norms/articleshow/88529773.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Lucknow||UP: Mayawati likely to hold rallies after naming all candidates||LUCKNOW: As questions about BSP chief Mayawati’s absence on the ground this poll season are gaining momentum, party members have said that she is likely to start her rallies only after the poll dates are announced. A major reason for the delay, said a senior member, is that only about 200 or so candidates have been finalized and since it will be their responsibility to organise rallies and meetings, the party chief will wait for the list to be drawn up. “When Mayawati addresses a rally, it cannot be a small affair. To ensure that there is a sizeable gathering, the candidate of the area will be responsible for ensuring that the rally is a success. As we do not have candidates in place, Mayawati is not keen on moving out right now. By the time the election dates come, we expect that the list of all 403 will be finalised or near complete, after which she can step out,” said a senior party member. Mayawati’s absence has become a talking point this election, even as senior leaders of other parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi—he has already addressed or is scheduled to address more than 15 rallies—and chief minister Yogi Adityanath have been moving from district to district for the past several weeks. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi have also been on the field. In BSP, national general secretary and MP SC Mishra has been addressing a spree of meetings over the past few months, beginning with Prabuddha Sammelans aimed at the upper castes and now, meetings in reserved constituencies which have become BSP’s focus for the 2022 assembly polls. The last time Mayawati addressed a gathering was at party founder Kanshiram’s death anniversary in October, when BSP had organised a major event at Lucknow’s Kanshiram Smarak. “The party has gone through a rough patch with most MLAs quitting the party or being suspended and joining other parties. Mayawatiji has been in Lucknow for the past several weeks, with the exception of a few days when she lost her mother in November, and has been holding meetings and reviews. In that sense, she has been actively monitoring election work but yes, her presence on ground will make a much bigger impact as compared to other leaders. However, as per our information, she is not stepping out till all candidates are finalised,” said a member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-likely-to-hold-rallies-after-naming-all-candidates/articleshow/88532064.cms||Neha Lalchandani

He said, “At the last hearing in Mumbai, Shukla had appeared before the commission and had sought time for filing an affidavit. The commission granted her request. Accordingly, she has filed an affidavit. The commission has now slated her deposition for January 18 and 19.” Then BJP-led government under Devendra Fadnavis had set up the two-member commission, comprising Justice J N Patel (retired) and former chief secretary Sumit Mullick, in the wake of the January 1, 2018, violence at Koregaon Bhima victory tower. Thousands of Dalit community members had gathered as a part of the Koregaon Bhima Shaurya Divas Abhiyaan to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battle between the Britons and the Peshwas. Rahul Fatangale, who ran an auto garage, was murdered at Sansaswadi, about 5km from Koregaon Bhima, as the violence spread to surrounding areas. Initially, the Pune rural police had registered a case, which was later transferred to the state CID for investigation. The CID has filed a chargesheet against three suspects. A fourth suspect was arrested later. This apart, the Pune rural police registered 36 cases related to the violence at various places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shukla-to-appear-before-koregaon-bhima-panel/articleshow/88531503.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cop video warns against sharing private photos||KOLKATA: Cops have warned netizens of sharing their personal and intimate photographs with others as these may be used for extortion in the future. The Bengal police tweeted this weekend: “Never share your nudity with anybody. He/she may be the nearest and dearest one because there is a high chance that the same will be used to extort you in future.” Cops also shared a video, saying that “sextortion” has been rampant across the state, especially in Kolkata. They said that the number of such complaints has almost tripled during the pandemic, despite multiple arrests being made from Haryana and Rajasthan. In the four-minute video, the DSP, Bidit Mondal, said that awareness about this new form of extortion is necessary these days. “Even if you consider the person, with whom you are sharing the personal pictures, to be close to you, the fact remains that you have never met him/her in person or learned about him/her personally. Once you fall in the trap, the accused will blackmail you to extort money from you,” said Mondal. “The accused record the chats and then superimpose the face of the victim with vulgar videos to claim that the victim is involved in obscene acts. It is dangerous to pay up the money, hoping that the accused will stop the extortion. Once you pay, the accused will keep demanding more money. In all such cases, the victim must approach the police and lodge a complaint with cops,” said Mondal in the 14th episode of the weekly cyber crime awareness drive undertaken by the police. Cops suspect that the members of Bharatpur (Mewati) gangs or their offshoots in the city are still indulging in such crimes. Recently, there have been four FIRs in this regard. Earlier this year, a 61-year-old paediatric endocrinologist, attached with several hospitals of the city, became a victim of cyber fraud after he offered to treat a patient, who wanted to consult him through a video call. Cops arrested two persons from Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-video-warns-against-sharing-private-photos/articleshow/88530603.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The minister said BJP believes in development and not appeasement. We believe in the idea of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ and are dedicated to make India 5 trillion economy and ‘world guru’. The minister announced that on January 8, cabinet minister Piyush Goyal will guide the businessmen and Vaishya community in big conclave “Agaz-2022” in Kanpur and the businessmen present there gave assurance to reach the Railway ground in Nirala Nagar Kanpur at 11.30am on January 8 to make the programme successful. The minister said BJP government has never discriminated on the basis of caste or religion as we believe in ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’. “The SP –BSP governments never thought of doing any good for the minority except speaking mere words. People like Azam Khan and Naseemuddin Siddiqui thought the ministry was their right and did nothing for them in reality. On the other hand, BJP never believes in appeasement but works for development of all. PM Modi is all set to make India a 5 trillion economy and ‘world guru’. During SP-BSP governments, Muslim children were confined to making puncture and BJP is taking them to computer,” said Nandi. “During any welfare scheme benefit distribution, Muslim women could be seen along with others and everyone gets benefit without any discrimination. There is no doubt that people will vote for BJP on the basis of the work we have done,” said Nandi. While enumerating the achievements of the BJP Government, he said, “BJP ended ‘gunda raj’ in the state and provided a safe environment to businessmen. UP has nine airports now and soon it will become the first state in the country to have 5 international airports.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bjp-believes-in-development-not-appeasement-says-nandi/articleshow/88531518.cms||Arjumand Bano

Chavan said there were three petitions filed in the Supreme Court against the memorial on the failure to hold public hearings, lack of a study carried out on marine biodiversity at the chosen site for the memorial, and insufficient information provided to the Centre for the environment clearance. “I would say that the previous government did not do due diligence. The Supreme Court has granted a stay and we cannot go against the court order. The matters have been transferred to the Bombay high court and we are giving all the compliances, which involves nine departments. The Covid pandemic too affected court hearings,” the minister said. The issue was raised via a calling attention motion by MLC Vinayak Mete, who sought to know why a one-year extension was granted to the contractor, Larsen & Toubro. Chavan said there was no cost escalation in granting the extension. “Had we terminated the contract and recalled again a lot of time would have been lost, hence we decided to grant extension. We are trying to expedite the court hearings and once this is complete we shall see how to reduce the construction period from the current three years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ashok-chavan-says-bjp-led-govt-slowed-down-memorial-to-shivaji/articleshow/88532498.cms||---

Yogi attacked the opposition after inaugurating and laying foundation stone of 83 development works worth Rs 116 crore in Sitapur and later while campaigning during BJP’s Jan Vishwas Yatra a day after the UP unit of BJP linked Jain to SP — a charge vehemently denied by the SP. “We have read in the scriptures that Goddess Lakshmi comes home on the day of Deepawali. But these sinners locked the money of the poor in the walls. Wads of currency notes are tumbling out,” he said. Yogi said the poor were deprived of the benefits of various schemes under the previous government which used to ‘loot people’ to fill ‘the family’s’ coffers. “They used to digest the ration of the poor. Had there been Centre’s free ration scheme in the SP regime, there would have been loot by the uncle and nephew,” he added. The CM reiterated that the ‘whole SP family’ went on a looting spree whenever vacancies were announced. “Now Babua has got a new problem — why are tablets and smartphones being given to the youth?” he said. The CM said that 18,000 houses were approved for Sitapur by the SP government in five years. “But the BJP government has given more than two lakh houses to the poor in the district in the last four and a half years,” he said, adding that the double engine is the wonder of the government. Earlier, housing was not available to the poor, where did the money go? Where did the free electricity connections money go, Yogi asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/notes-tumbling-out-of-walls-show-why-sp-bsp-opposed-demon/articleshow/88532089.cms||---

Saurabh Patel claimed except for the final, few people turned up and all Covid-19 norms were followed during the other matches, adding that 140 teams from his Assembly area took part in the tournament. “There wasn't so much crowd in the previous matches.

On Sunday evening, Jadhav came to the Karvenagar area to drop off his sister at an eatery where she works. The two boys and their accomplice followed Jadhav and assaulted him as soon as he dropped her off.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-minors-detained-in-karvenagar-murder-case/articleshow/88531531.cms||---
---||Lucknow||On December 31, Amit Shah to spur BJP poll campaign blitz in Ayodhya||LUCKNOW: In a development that could train the spotlight sharply on the saffron party’s tried and tested Hindutva narrative, Union home minister and BJP’s chief poll strategist Amit Shah will visit Ayodhya on December 31. Top BJP sources said Shah will visit Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanumangarhi before addressing a public rally at GIC ground under Ayodhya Sadar assembly seat at present represented by party MLA Ved Prakash Gupta. CM Yogi Adityanath, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh are also expected to accompany the home minister. Confirming Shah’s itinerary on December 31, BJP district president in Ayodhya, Sanjiv Singh told TOI that the organizational machinery has been pressed in to mobilize party supporters for the day. The party has set a target of bringing at least 20-30 people from all the 2,100 polling booths to Shah’s rally. It will be the first public rally by a top BJP leader in Ayodhya ahead of UP elections. Earlier, PM Narendra Modi had visited Ayodhya in August 2020 to lay the foundation stone of the Ram Temple after the Supreme Court had ruled in favour of Ram Janmabhoomi. BJP chief JP Nadda had recently visited Ayodhya with CMs of 11 states after attending the inauguration of Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi. Nadda had not addressed a rally in Ayodhya, though he flagged off the Jan Vishwas Yatra from the neighbouring district of Ambedkarnagar. Shah had last visited Ayodhya in 2013 as BJP’s UP in-charge for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and had steered the party to power with an overwhelming majority at Center. His visit to Ayodhya comes even as the BJP is raising the bogey of Hindutva to punch its political opponents, especially the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party, which has been aligning itself as the most potent rival to the saffron dispensation. Experts point out how both Shah and CM Yogi have been launching a barrage of salvos at SP accusing it of being driven by minority appeasement and not conforming to the faith of Hindus and the construction of Ram Temple. Shah, sources said, could send out a larger political message from Ayodhya days ahead of the announcement of the model code of conduct for the state polls. Though BJP had the Ram Temple high on its political agenda, Ayodhya has been a tough political turf for it until 2017 when it won all five assembly seats in the district. In the 2012 and 2007 assembly elections, BJP could win just one seat in the then Faizabad district — Rudauli (2012) and Ayodhya (2007). In fact, in 2012, when SP stormed to power with full majority, its candidate Tej Narayan Pandey made the biggest upset by defeating five-time BJP MLA from Ayodhya, Lallu Singh by over 5,000 votes. Singh, who had been winning the seat since 1991, later got elected as MP from Ayodhya in 2014 and then again in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-dec-31-amit-shah-to-spur-bjp-poll-campaign-blitz-in-ayodhya/articleshow/88532099.cms||Pankaj Shah

Those who have been dismissed cannot be reinstated immediately,” he said. Parab said schools, colleges had already started and the ST buses provided a subsidised service to these categories which on account of the workers strike they could not avail of. A three-member committee is already looking into the merger of the undertaking with the government, he said. Parab added that employees who died on duty during the Covid pandemic their families have been provided Rs 50 lakh compensation, he said.

---||Lucknow||BJP’s panel of Brahmin leaders to reach out to upper castes in UP||LUCKNOW: The newly constituted committee of BJP leaders to woo Brahmins will channelize its operations through upper caste leaders at booth and division level party functionaries in all 403 assembly seats in UP. This was among the key points put forth by the committee members during their meeting with party president JP Nadda on Monday, sources in BJP said. The committee is headed by BJP chief whip in Rajya Sabha, Shiv Pratap Shukla. Its members are Gautam Budh Nagar MP Mahesh Sharma, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha national general secretary Abhijat Mishra, and Gujarat MP Ram Bhai Mokhariya. The committee was formed at the instance of Union education minister and party’s UP election incharge Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday. A senior BJP leader said the committee will ensure that the benefits of various welfare schemes initiated by the BJP governments at the Centre and in UP reach the upper caste communities. Analysts say the BJP had banked on the upper caste votes before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections too when the Union Cabinet had cleared the proposal for 10% reservation for economically poor upper caste persons in government jobs. BJP sources said the party wants to consolidate the Brahmin community in its favour since it comprises around 8% of the electorate in UP and plays a pivotal role in deciding the electoral fortunes of any political party. BJP’s Brahmin outreach is significant since the opposition parties, specially SP and BSP, are playing out a soft Hindutva plank to counter the saffron dispensation which has the traditional backing of Brahmins since the days of Ram Temple movement. While SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has been promising installation of statues of Parashuram, an incarnation of Vishnu, in various districts of Uttar Pradesh, BSP chief Mayawati has entrusted party’s Brahmin face, Satish Chandra Mishra, to carry out Prabuddha Varg Sammelan, primarily to reach out to Brahmins. The BJP had countered the opposition by carrying out a similar campaign to consolidate the Brahmins through upper caste conventions in September this year. Political analysts say the BJP finds itself in an odd situation after the controversy over junior Union home minister and Lakhimpur MP Ajay Mishra Teni, also a Brahmin. Teni’s son Ashish is a prime accused in Lakhimpur violence in which eight persons, including four farmers, were killed. The opposition has been demanding sacking of Teni from the central ministry but the BJP has so far resisted the opposition pressure saying that SIT investigation is underway into the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-panel-of-brahmin-leaders-to-reach-out-to-upper-castes-in-up/articleshow/88532101.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Covid-19 in Mumbai: Keep beds, oxygen, staff ready for third wave, says BMC chief||MUMBAI: Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Monday directed officials to prepare for a possible third wave in the city by readying beds, manpower, oxygen systems and medicines. The jumbo centres, which had cut down on operations after cases dipped in the last few months, have been asked to start recruiting manpower and renew wards by the first and second week of January. Currently, around 9% of the city’s Covid-19 beds are occupied.  After a steady rise in cases and positivity rate for the past few days, Chahal called for a meeting with health department officials and hospital heads, and instructed all concerned to meticulously implement the Covid-19 preventive measures. He issued instructions to ensure immediate supply of oxygen to the hospitals. The municipal commissioner mentioned that the availability of oxygen should be more than the requirement as per the instructions of the state government.  Instructions were issued to all BMC hospitals and jumbo Covid hospitals to remain vigilant and well-equipped in view of possible outbreaks of coronavirus, including Omicron. Chahal said all the necessary facilities such as ambulances, manpower in the hospital, necessary equipment, stock of medicines-pills-injections must be checked and updated.  Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC jumbo centre, said he has started recruiting doctors, nurses and ward boys. The instructions for him are to recruit enough manpower so that all 2,328 beds can be activated by January 1. “We are recruiting 200 doctors, 250 ward boys and an equal number of nurses that is needed to operationalise all beds,” he said, adding that many who have worked at the centre during the second and first waves have been called back.  At the 925-bed Dahisar jumbo facility, authorities started running checks on oxygen pipelines and checking the drug inventories. Dean Dr Deepa Shriyan said that they will activate services once 50% beds of other jumbos are occupied. “We will start recruiting once the other jumbos start filling up fast. The tendering has already been done for manpower recruitment, medicines, et cetera,” she said. Both BKC and Dahisar are currently not admitting patients. The jumbos that are operational at present, including Nesco in Goregaon and Richardson & Cruddas in Mulund and Byculla, have been asked to start preparing to open more wards.  The BMC called for a regular review of the functioning of the ‘war room’ in all 24 wards. “Instructions were also given to test the capacity of BMC hospitals and jumbo Covid hospitals where oxygen plants have been set up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/keep-beds-o2-staff-ready-for-third-wave-in-mumbai-civic-chief/articleshow/88532114.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The police said the youth, Vinod Gite, was a resident of Moti Chowk at Savtanagar in Cidco. The Ambad police have so far registered a case of accidental death. The police said the accident occurred when he fell through the hole dug for renovation work along the corridor of the first floor of the hotel and went at least 35 feet down. The police said an iron mesh was kept over the hole but it was not strong enough. The police said Gite had stepped on the iron mesh and it crashed. The ground beneath was also dug up as part of the renovation work. The youth fell on the stones and rubble on the ground . He was taken to a private hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Alerted by the hotel management, the police rushed to the spot and conducted the panchanama. An officer said necessary action would be taken against the hotel management or the contractor of the renovation work under relevant sections of the IPC in connection with the youth’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/21-year-old-slips-through-35ft-deep-hole-in-nashik-hotel-dies/articleshow/88529849.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||ASI gets ownership of Bibi-ka-Maqbara land||Aurangabad: Bibi-ka-Maqbara, the historic monument which is a replica of the famous Taj Mahal, now officially belongs to the government. Settling a claim of ownership, the land records department has handed over the 84-acre land, on which the monument is built, to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Getting its name on the property card, however, is not the end of the battle for the ASI that is keen on claiming similar ownership of around 100 acre land around the monument. ASI superintendent archaeologist for Aurangabad circle Milan Kumar Chauley, on Monday, said the parking lot and adjoining area at Bibi-ka-Maqbara still are not owned by the government. “Ownership issues are being faced for a section of monuments that, in the past, belonged to the southwest circle of the ASI and is now looked after by the Aurangabad circle. The property documents of these monuments were carrying ‘question marks’ due to the ambiguity over the ownership. This led to certain elements encroaching upon the lands housing these heritage sites,” he said. ASI authorities said the offices of both the Aurangabad divisional commissioner and the district collector played vital role in helping ASI officially get ownership of the Bibi-ka-Maqbara after waging a fight against the encroachers. “Both these establishments had old land records of the Bibi-ka-Maqbara. Access to these documents helped us wage an effective battle over ownership,” authorities said, expressing confidence in freeing the remaining 100 acre of land from encroachers. The monument is a beautiful mausoleum of Rabia-ul-Daurani, alias Dilras Banu Begum, who was the wife of the Mughal emperor Aurangazeb. The monument is believed to be constructed by prince Azam Shah in memory of his mother between 1651 and 1661 AD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/asi-gets-ownership-of-bibi-ka-maqbara-land/articleshow/88529104.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sena calls for suspension of BJP MLA Rane||Mumbai: Shiv Sena MLAs demanded on Monday that BJP MLA Nitesh Rane be suspended from the state assembly for his inappropriate behaviour towards state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. Last week, Rane led a protest against Thackeray outside the state assembly where he was “cat-called” by BJP MLAs. Rane “meowed” at Thackeray, drawing laughs from the BJP MLAs. He later told reporters that he would do it again.On Monday, Sena MLA Suhas Kande said, “This behaviour is unacceptable. The BJP said it did not support this but Nitesh Rane was unrepentant and said he will do it again,” said Kande. “The Shiv Sena will not tolerate such insults,” he said. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that the party did not support Rane’s actions and would reprimand him. But trying to suspend him was undemocratic. “It is pre-decided by the government to keep suspending people from the Opposition,” he said.

---||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav: UP has slipped to bottom on health index||LUCKNOW: UP has slipped to the bottom of the health index of NITI Aayog, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Tuesday, adding that BJP is resorting to politics of lies, rumors, hate and deceit as it has nothing to showcase in terms of governance. He said the BJP governments at the Centre and in UP are now indulging in politics of conspiracies. “The NITI Aayog Health Index, on which UP figures on the bottom, is a government record and reflects what people of the state are facing on ground. The government is flying high on falsehood and factually incorrect information being depicted in advertisements,” he said. “The BJP has resorted to politics of lies, rumours, hate and deceit. BJP leaders are propelling lies in order to bury the truth. The Centre and state governments are hand in glove in the politics of conspiracies,” Yadav said and added that the growing resentment among the people against the misrule of the BJP strongly suggests that people will vote out the party which failed to deliver on all fronts. Akhilesh said it is common knowledge that Ram Temple is being constructed in Ayodhya as per the verdict of the Supreme Court and no one, including the BJP, can stop the construction work. Still senior BJP leaders are making false statements. He said had the government floated any welfare schemes or completed projects of public utility, the government would not have wasted time in false propaganda. “But they have nothing to show to the people, which is why they are resorting to conspiracies,” he said. Contrary to government claims of providing round the clock power supply across the state, Akhilesh said villages are not getting more than eight hours of supply while cities are also reeling under prolonged power cuts. “BJP can only make false statements,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-up-has-slipped-to-bottom-on-health-index/articleshow/88532106.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Aurangabad||Himayat Bagh PIL: HC passes strictures against authorities||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has said that joint efforts were expected from all the authorities to protect Himayat Bagh, a Mughal-era garden that is suffering due to official apathy. While hearing the public interest litigation (PIL), seeking biodiversity heritage tag for Himayat Bagh, among other prayers, the court said it does not find the respondents serious in the matter. Filed by Umbrella Welfare Foundation, a non-profit organisation through petitioner Sandesh Hange, different authorities including the Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agriculture University (Parbhani), the state archaeology department, forest department, biodiversity board and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change have been made respondents in the case. “All these parties are expected to come forward and show positive attitude in preserving the garden area. It is the oldest garden area in this region, having an area of more than 300 acre. The said garden has its own history and biodiversity importance,” the two-member bench of justice S V Gangapurwala and justice S G Dige said. The PIL seeks protection of Himayat Bagh under Biological Diversity Act, 2002, as well as under the provisions of the Maharashtra Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1960. With the state agricultural university is largely at the helm of affairs of Himayat Bagh, the court has said that it expects that the varsity will take immediate steps in the matter and move the archaeological department after ensuring feasibility of declaring Himayatbagh as biodiversity site. The court has also asked the university to take positive steps in this regard before the next scheduled hearing of the case on February 23 next year. “The forest and archaeological department shall also move into action and take steps accordingly without further delay and/or raising technical issues,” the court has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/himayat-bagh-pil-hc-passes-strictures-against-authorities/articleshow/88529113.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Nagpur||States told to carry out dual RT-PCR prior to genome sequencing||PUNE: The Union health ministry has advised states to adopt a dual RT-PCR testing strategy ahead of genome sequencing of Covid-positive samples for Omicron detection. Under the new plan, suspected patients’ throat/nasal swab samples will be tested using a standard RT-PCR kit and if detected positive, the same sample will undergo a second test with an imported RT-PCR kit having an S-gene drop. “And only those samples showing positive for S-gene drop-out or S-gene target failure (SGTF) will be genomically sequenced for Omicron. Besides cost-cutting, it will also help in picking up the highly probable Omicron cases and save resources,” a senior Union health ministry official told TOI on Monday. The Maharashtra government is among the first to have already started implementing the dual test strategy. Quite a few districts with high floating populations have already received the imported kits. “The cost of genome sequencing goes up to Rs 5,000 per Covid positive sample in India, including the transport, human resource, and other heads,” the official said, adding that whereas the cost per kit of a standard RT-PCR kit and imported RT-PCR kit with SGTF is Rs 19 and Rs 240, respectively. The dual RT-PCR costs Rs 260. Besides testing individuals with international travel history and their close contacts, these kits can also be used at government-run laboratories for routine Covid tests to rule out the community spread from daily caseload having high viral load or below 25 cycle threshold (CT) value. A total of 23 of 60 Covid positive samples have so far tested positive for S-gene drop-out in Nagpur. Instead of sequencing all the 60 positive samples, these 23 samples are being prioritized for sequencing in Nagpur. The Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at the Nagpur’s Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital— one of the key sentinel centres in Maharashtra — is carrying out the second RT-PCR test for SGTF prior to sending samples for sequencing. The hospital’s head of microbiology department and principal investigator Dr SS Raut said, “The civic and district administrations are forwarding positive samples from both public and private labs. We are testing these samples again using the specialized RT-PCR kits for SGTF.” Nagpur’s second confirmed Omicron patient, a 21-year-old youth who returned from Dubai, was the first whose throat/nasal swab sample when tested twice with RT-PCR kit showed the SGTF. The sample was later genomically sequenced to confirm the presence of the Omicron variant. “If a person tests positive for SGTF in the second RT-PCR test, we can take his/her sample for whole genomic sequencing on priority for confirmation. The chances of the variant detection rise manifold in such cases,” said Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, one of the key microbiologists involved in the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics (INSACOG) Consortium, a network of 38 laboratories to monitor the genomic variations in the SARS-CoV-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/states-told-to-carry-out-dual-rt-pcr-prior-to-sequencing/articleshow/88533581.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Surat||Surat airport under threat of winged visitors||SURAT: The Surat airport is a home of as many as 96 species of birds that flourish inside the airfield, a report by the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) has revealed. Not only birds, which pose a big bird-hit risk, the airport is home to mongooses and venomous snakes too. According to the data presented in the interim report, there have been 88 incidents of bird hits in the last five years at the Surat airport, which also has several prawn farms in the vicinity. Most of the bird hits were recorded during September, October and November. The interim report was submitted to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and SACON will present the strategies to manage the wildlife now. Security at the airport had become a serious issue after the infamous incident of a private airline’s aircraft crashing into the buffalo on the runway in 2014. Study was conducted after AAI invited SACON to take up a comprehensive study at selected airports to understand the bird community of the selected airports, identify the problematic birds and suggest mitigation measures to reduce the bird and wildlife-related hazards to aircraft. Surat airport was suggested by AAI among the first five airports where such studies were required and get scientific suggestions to mitigate the risks. The Coimbatore-based institute collected the birds and wildlife data from December 2020 to March 2021. A total of 154 species were recorded in the 10 km radius of the airport. “Concerning the waste disposal, Surat is an excellent model city and airport authority also works very closely with corporation and police officials in keeping the surrounding excellently clean. However, the airport is surrounded by wetlands, water bodies and seacoast with plenty of food resources for birds and wildlife,” the report states. “In order to understand and prevent these bird strikes, knowledge about the factors leading to the bird strikes is very important,” the report states. PV Karunakaran, co-investigator of study, said, “After submitting the interim report to AAI, we collected more data and started analyzing it. The final report with suggestions will take a few weeks.” In addition to scheduled airlines, the airport also sees many chartered flights of companies located in Hazira, VVIP movements etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-airport-under-threat-of-winged-visitors/articleshow/88530676.cms||---

Amid uproar over the rampant tree-cutting at the garden, the contractor looking after the orchards at Himayat Bagh too is found to have cut a large number of shrubs for fencing purposes. This has outraged the nature-lovers. Honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak, who visited the spots where fresh tree-cutting had taken place, said the shrubs play a crucial role in maintaining the biodiversity of the garden. “Lack of awareness has led to such indiscriminate cutting of shrubs at Himayat Bagh. The authorities should rein in the contractors at the Mughal-era garden,” he said. During their visit, nature-lovers also questioned the authorities on the large-scale illegal grazing at Himayat Bagh and alleged widespread presence of different addicts. Avinash Deole, the acting in-charge of Himayat Bagh, pointed finger towards the headquarters-based authorities of the Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University at Parbhani. “We had two security guards deployed at Himayat Bagh, but they are no longer in service due to payment issues. We have sought security apparatus for effective vigil,” he said. Deole also pointed to the need of police protection to deal with trouble-makers. However, he said no formal request has yet been made to the Begampura police, which has jurisdiction over Himayat Bagh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nature-lovers-seek-answers-from-himayat-bagh-authorities/articleshow/88529134.cms||---

Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid National Task Force member, told TOI, “Guidelines on how the government is planning to go with the entire exercise are unclear. There is a grey area in terms of the dose quantity available for these groups, vaccine to be used for precaution doses, availability with states, among other things, even as the vaccination for these groups is just a few days away.” The experts have suggested that the government could start precaution doses for all immunocompromised individuals, irrespective of age. “Global data is very clear that transplant recipients, HIV positive patients, those on immunosuppressants do not build an immune response after the second dose. This population may also be prioritized, especially with Covid cases surging now,” Dr Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19 and the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, told TOI. Dr Pujari said globally too, including the UK and the US, this group has been included in the category of those receiving booster shots. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said, “We still need clarity on what vaccine will be given as the booster, the same vaccine given for the first two doses or a different one. Also, another grey area is the dose amount of the precaution shot, whether it would be the same as the first two or will vary.” Dr Patil said there was also no clarity on the list of medical conditions that would enable a 60+ year old with comorbidities to avail of the precaution doses. “We don’t know whether the comorbidities’ list will be the same as suggested earlier for the 45+ age group or there would be a variation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-seek-clarity-ahead-of-childrens-vax-3rd-dose/articleshow/88531563.cms||Neha Madaan

Deputy mayor Dinesh Jodhani (50) and city BJP general secretary Kishore Bindal (69) got themselves tested after they felt mild symptoms of the virus. Jodhani and Bindal were present at the Surat airport when the CM arrived on Saturday night last. Jodhani had shared the stage with CM at an event at the VNSGU convention hall. “I did not feel any symptoms till today (Monday) morning. But due to a sore throat, I got RT-PCR done in a laboratory and the result was positive. I have isolated myself and I am doing fine,” said Jodhani.

Addressing reporters, GFP’s environment cell convener Vikas Bhagat said that BJP “misused” the public exchequer to reach out to the public on the eve of the assembly election. “The government had announced Rs 2.5 lakh to the kin of those who died of Covid-19. However, this government has failed to sanction this amount through the social welfare department. Officers from this department say that it will take another 2-3 months to process the applications,” Bhagat said. He said that while the people of Goa were dying due to mismanagement of Covid-19, BJP was busy in arranging programmes of Sarkar Tumchya Dari without expressing sympathies to the deceased families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/come-cleanon-sarkartumchya-darigfp-tells-govt/articleshow/88554176.cms||---

The state reported 1,426 cases and 21 deaths. The fatality reported by the state is the highest in 13 days since December 14, when the state reported 24 deaths. With this, the total caseload of the state rose to 66.59 lakh and 1,41,454 deaths. Active cases in the state crossed the 10,000 mark. Mumbai reported 788 cases and three deaths. Active cases in Mumbai are also nearing the 5,000 mark. Additional municipal commissioner said the city still reporting more than 800 cases was a cause for worry. The daily positivity rate was 1.82% on Monday. Although it was a weekend, nearly 43,400 tests were carried out. “We are not able to understand what is causing the surge. Whether it is driven by domestic travellers, people coming from abroad or the season of festivities and weddings is something that might get clearer in the days to come,” he said. While the previous genome sequencing report showed that Delta was still the predominant variant, a report from the next cycle expected in two days could shed some more light. Municipal commissioner I S Chahal called for a meeting of hospital heads and senior officials on Monday and directed them to prepare for a possible third wave. Kakani said all 10 jumbo centers, including the upcoming ones, have been asked to prepare to operationalise and scale up in the next few days. “We have instructed the existing five jumbos to finish recruiting manpower, check oxygen supplies, stock up on medicines and stay prepared by the first week of January,” he said. The new jumbos at Kanjurmarg, Somaiya grounds and Malad have been asked to inform how many beds they will be able to activate by January 8-10, he said. Leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the state has hidden several Covid-19 deaths and has also misused public money by making purchases at inflated rate. “There were a total of 40,671 deaths reported in April 2020 and 84,262 deaths in April 2021, of which only 14,164 covid deaths were shown. There is no record of the other excess deaths,” said Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-records-1-4k-new-cases-fatality-up-for-3rd-day-in-a-row/articleshow/88532157.cms||Bhavika Jain

He said that the whole idea behind bringing such a law is to maintain democratic values, peace and overall law and order and “not to appease any particular community.” He also lashed out at the BJP dubbing them as “the masters of creating false narrative and propaganda’ to divert people from the real issues. Last week, JMM-Congress-RJD coalition government tabled and passed — Prevention of Violence and Mob Lynching Bill of 2021 in the recently concluded winter session of the state assembly. However, Opposition BJP accused the incumbent regime of ‘appeasement politics’. In the past too, the coalition government was charged with similar accusation from the BJP over the Namaz room row at the state assembly. Defending their move, Soren on Monday said that ‘people and their welfare’ has solely been the centre stage of their work and dubbed BJP as ‘masters of propaganda’. Speaking to select media at his official residence at Kanke road, Soren said, “How is the anti-mob lynching bill an appeasement policy? Mob is a mob. It doesn’t have any religion. Therefore, the anti-mob lynching Act too doesn’t define mob through any religious or communal lens but talks about stringent punishment in the event of anyone taking law into their hands. But see, how they (BJP) are propagating it. They have an inherent talent and mastery over creating false narrative, propaganda and diverting people from the facts of the matter.” On the namaz row, which rocked the assembly during monsoon session early this year, he added, “Did we make any masjid or built any special structure for namaz. No. But recently, I was watching news about conclave of sadhus in BJP-ruled Uttarakhand where all kinds of speeches were made to establish a Hindu Rashtra. So what do we call that?” Charging the BJP-led government in the Centre, he said, “Ideally, the Union government should have done what we did by bringing strong laws against lynching, but since it didn’t do, we had to take the responsibility for larger good. It is because since 2014 when the BJP-led government took charge of the country, instances of mob attacks and incidents have undoubtedly increased manifold."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/anti-mob-lynching-law-is-not-appeasement-hemant/articleshow/88530717.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||‘I am not interested in national politics, I want to dedicate my time to tribals of state’||Ranchi: Chief minister Hemant Soren has decided to stay away from national politics and focus on development of tribal communities in Jharkhand. Ahead of completing two years in office on December 29, he addressed select media persons at his official residence on Monday. On forming a national coalition with or without Mamata Banerjee against BJP I am not interested in national or global politics. My priority is state and the tribals, Scheduled Castes and OBCs. I will continue to focus on my state for their welfare and development. On Centre-state relations The states with a “double engine” (referring to BJP-ruled states) are getting all the benefits and those with a single-engine government have to struggle. It’s like a wrestling match. On future outlook of government Jharkhand has been treated like a colony all these years. We are going to change this and expedite the opportunities available in the tourism sector, minor forest produce and skills of the local artisans. We have introduced the concept of transit fee and realized revenue of over Rs 600 crore. Similar lateral opportunities for generating revenue are being looked into and as many as 28 new schemes are being worked on. On JSPC irregularities It is a handful of people with vested interests who are trying to propagate falsehood about irregularities in JPSC. On several constitutional posts lying defunct I admit that several constitutional institutions in the state are lying defunct for lack of chairman or members but the problem is that in many of them the appointment cannot be done without the leader of opposition and here we do not have any. We are seeking legal advice on how to overcome this crisis. On law and order The situation has improved. We are going strong in controlling left wing extremism and none other than the national security advisor K Vijay Kumar has appreciated the state government’s efforts. We are worried about the incidents of rape and violence against women. On policy for locals We will take a call on the policy for locals at an appropriate time. We will also take a call on reservation for OBC candidates as it was a part of our election manifesto. On increasing marriageable age of girls It is upto the Centre to clear its intent why it proposes to increase the age as in most of the advanced societies, the girls are married after 21 years. On bureaucratic cooperation The system in the state rusted and it seems that there is an urgent need to re-oil the machinery. When the monitor of the class is not efficient, the entire class starts misbehaving. We have to see if the monitor improves or we have to be ready to punish the entire class (kabhi khud school me murga bane the ab pure class ko murga banana padega)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/i-am-not-interested-in-national-politics-i-want-to-dedicate-my-time-to-tribals-of-state/articleshow/88530735.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Responding to the question by TOI on Monday on his evaluation of 2021 on the employment front, ahead of completing two years in office later this week, he smiled and said, “The year is not over yet and a few days are still left,” indicating that his government still has time to fulfil the promises. “On a serious note, we are working sincerely towards this, despite being surrounded by host of challenges, mainly the Covid-19 pandemic. Wherever I am going to attend any government programme, I have been distributing job letters. I don’t recall that I have been to any programme where I have not distributed job letters. A few months back, 2,000-plus people, mainly women, were handed job letters for different textile firms. For the first time, we made direct recruitment of sportspersons. Recently, JPSC successfully conducted recruitment tests to fill up over 100 vacant posts in agriculture department. We held seventh to 10th state civil service exam recently which was bigger in scale than even UPSC exams. We paved the way by simplifying recruitment rules in many departments and the work is still in progress in some. Recruitments and jobs are a continuous process,” Soren said. He added that the new industrial policy launched by his government, too, will reap results soon. “Some investments have come and many are in pipeline. All these will gradually open gates for massive employment. Compared to other states, sectors like education, health etc are still not very developed here, which we are focusing on to revive. Seeds for overall revamp of key sectors are being laid and results of the conceptualized reforms will be visible in a long-term process. We are also focusing on skilling our workforce. And in that direction, we are soon going to launch a digital skill university, work for which will begin from the next fiscal year. We are doing this in association with PAN IIT foundation,” he underlined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/distributing-job-letters-wherever-i-am-going-says-cm/articleshow/88530753.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

State party president Deepak Prakash and former CM Babulal Marandi led the delegation to the Raj Bhavan in the evening. After meeting Bais, Prakash said, “No cultured society will ever support mob lynching and BJP, too, is strongly against such acts. But the current bill which was passed by the state government in the recent winter session is unconstitutional in all terms. It is also against the culture of Jharkhand and is only an attempt by the state government to appease a particular community.” He added that some of the provisions in the Bill will prove to be disastrous once it is enacted as law. “The bill wrongly interprets mob and if two persons are involved in any argument, it may amount to a mob-lynching bid. For example, even if a husband and wife (couple) happens to thrash anyone over any argument or to safeguard themselves, they can be wrongly booked under the proposed,” he said, adding that in a tribal state like Jharkhand, a community takes several strong decisions related to their people or place and under the new law, they may get prosecuted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/anti-lynching-bill-unconstitutional-bjp/articleshow/88530745.cms||TNN

Underlining the need for more vaccination, Gupta said the administration has been notified to identify those who have not been jabbed and ensure that they are innoculated as fast as possible. He added along with following the Covid protocols, vaccination is a must for anyone to remain safe. Officials of the administration are finding ways to locate those who are yet to get vaccinated, added the minister. Gupta, told TOI on Monday that keeping in mind the possible outbreak of a third wave of the pandemic and learning from past experience, instructions have been given to ensure that there is sufficient stock of oxygen for patients if required. During the second wave of Covid, there were allegations that many lost their lives in hospital and at home because of lack of oxygen. Gupta said oxygen-manufacturing plants have been set up keeping in mind the possible demand and more are in the pipeline. He said the state does not have a genome sequencing machine but efforts are on to install one soon. It will help in speedy testing of samples, which will help doctors here. If required, beds for children have been kept ready at various places across the state. Doctors have been trained to deal with any kind of emergency situation. Gupta said all over state 28,600 beds have been kept ready for Covid patients. Talking about the booster dose for frontline workers and those in the 60-plus age group, he said all should get the extra jab. He opined that children in the age group of 12 to 18 should be inoculated.

While the detailed schedule of how and where these youngsters will get jabs is yet to be declared, doctors in Nagpur confirmed that they will be getting the Covaxin that was administered to the adults during an earlier vaccination drive. Dr Vasant Khalatkar, principal investigator of phase III paediatric human trials of Covaxin held in Meditrina Institute, Nagpur, said that the 15-18 age group participants have shown astonishing results, both on safety and effectivity parameters. Dr Khalatkar termed it a big opportunity for youngsters who are at a key turning point of their careers. “Youths in this age group generally roam around in public and mix in society. They can be carriers in case the third wave hits. So, the government has decided to jab 15-18 age group of pediatric population first,” said Dr Khalatkar adding that all the participants of the paediatric trials in Nagpur are doing very well. “We have got data for 12-18 age group and the results are very good. I can’t share the data now. However, one can rest assured about the safety of vaccines,” he said. According to him, it’s highly possible that the next age bracket of 12 to 15 will be added to the vaccine schedule by mid-January. “Results of 6 to 12 and 2 to 6 year age groups will start coming in the next three weeks. Hopefully, they will also get vaccines by the financial year-end,” Dr Khalatkar said. According to the Association of Paediatricians India (API) data, nearly 15% of state population falls in the 15-18 age group, which means about 25 lakh in Vidarbha’s 11 districts will be eligible to receive vaccines from January 3. SHOT IN THE ARM - Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was tried on paediatric population in Nagpur - The trial was held at Meditrina Institute, the only pvt trial site in India - 55 participants in 12-18 age group participated, all developed good antibodies - Same Covaxin that is being administered to adults will be given to 15-18 group - Safety, as well as efficacy results of 12-18 age groups, are promising, as per doctors||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/adolescent-population-to-be-jabbed-with-covaxin-given-to-adults-doctors/articleshow/88530802.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||It’s spring season for tree protection||“Are you serious? Is felling of tree even real news?” “Huge scams are unearthing, elections are here and here she is writing about trees being cut.” “Don’t you have a real beat to cover?” This was six years back. Being the object of scorn, often deemed amateurish for writing on a subject that was not regarded “newsworthy”, right at the beginning of journalistic stint. Things changed as fast as the climate did. The same tree-felling news started dominating global headlines. It found a place in the front page of every newspaper, big or small, national or regional. Environment and climate change had become the new hot topic of mainstream media. Increased and visible climate catastrophes helped changed public opinion. One big change happened this year. While the increasing awareness and resistance against felling of trees was distinct, what gave birth to a green battle in this city was the announcement of the inter-modal station at Ajni, a prestigious project of policy-makers which was putting lives of thousands of age-old trees at stake. Even before the details could come out in public domain, an army of citizens – environmentalists, youngsters, senior citizens, doctors, architects, engineers, railway employees and many more was ready. The fight was not against city’s development but protecting the green heritage which the city can never get back. Need to confess something here. In the very beginning, while writing about the greens’ concerns, a prevailing thought would be that the loud voices drowned in the promises of development and a bright future given by policy-makers. It seemed impractical that a project this reputable would go off the cards only because some activists were worried about trees, which according to authorities were “easily replaceable”. Sometimes, it is so relieving to be wrong. Just when the media thought that the campaign is fading away, ‘Ajni Vann’ came alive. In no time, it was all over social media. Never did a local campaign was celebrated nationally, or even globally, the way Ajni Vann was. For months and months, its torch-bearers took genuine efforts to not let it die, to not let the news shelved. And what not did they go through? From criticism to alarming threats, financial crunches to internal disputes – but they kept it going. It was never written how they managed to keep political parties wanting to get mileage away, how they spent hundreds of days just gathering data through Right to Information and running behind administrative officials, how they ensured that every argument of theirs is backed up by science and logic. A big breather to the campaign came when the state amended existing Tree Act, tightening rules for large-scale felling and giving status of heritage trees. This happened at a time when Ajni Vann needed it the most. It’s been more than a year since TOI first published about trees at Ajni facing axe from the project. For now, the age-old irreplaceable trees are standing strong. And the fight goes on. So yes, felling of trees is real news; they give us life. It’s high time to really grasp what was taught in school. Well, for me, just glad on not letting the mockery and self-doubts change my beat.

On completion of the project, it is expected to be the first ever weapon system of this kind in India under the above-300 mm caliber category. It is billed to outperform the existing arsenal of similar systems with the forces, and also counter the A300 type of rockets with the Pakistani army. Currently, the Indian defence forces have the Russian Smerch rocket under this category. Smerch has a caliber of 300 mm. The 324 mm rocket of JSR has been designed to have a larger caliber and a longer range, said Deo. The Smerch rockets with India are unguided weapons, he said. The JSR rocket on the other hand is expected to have a range of 250 to 300km along with guided capacity, making it more precise on the target. The Smerch rocket has a range of around 100km. Deo says even with the advanced features there are plans to sell the rocket at a price lower than the current price of acquisition of other systems. The design has been made and the guidance system would be ready soon. JSR is in talks with a European company to provide highly specific impulse propellent. If it works out, some of the units may be sent for filling. The warhead would be made by JSR. The propellent gives a push to the rocket, and explosion is created by the warhead. The rocket is being independently developed by JSR using its own funds and is not against any request for proposal by the defence forces. On completion, the company plans to put it up before the army for evaluation. The company is open for exports to friendly countries too, he said. Once ready, the rockets are expected to be a game changer for the forces. This would also be the first of its kind of weapon designed and made in India, said Deo. Work is under way in both private sector and defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) for making the guided Pinaka rockets. However, Pinaka is of 224 mm caliber, and a shorter range. The guided Pinaka rockets have range of 70km. As against this, the conventional Pinaka can be fired upto 40km. JSR Dynamics was formed by Deo after he retired from service. The current investment stands at Rs63 crore. “We believe in operating at rather low margins as profit is not the motive,” he said. After the surface fired rockets, there are plans to make a variant which can be shot from fighter planes too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pvt-co-developing-250-300km-range-guided-rockets-for-india/articleshow/88531635.cms||Shishir Arya

The results prompted AAP national convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to call it “a sign of the change in Punjab”. North India’s first electoral exercise since the BJP repealed the three farm laws that had triggered a yearlong agitation left the AAP just short of a simple majority and the saffron party with 12 seats, eight less than its 2016 civic election score of 20 out of 26. The AAP victory also felled sitting mayor Ravi Kant and two former mayors of BJP. Congress, which had been looking to capitalise on the apparent anti-incumbency wave against BJP, doubled its 2016 tally to win eight seats and garnered the highest vote percentage of 29.8% overall. BJP was second in this respect, too, with a vote share of 29.3%. AAP’s share of votes on debut stood at 27%. Shiromani Akali Dal won one seat. “People of Chandigarh today have chosen the honest politics of AAP, rejecting corrupt politics. Many congratulations to all the winning candidates and workers of AAP. This time Punjab is ready for change,” Kejriwal tweeted, alluding to assembly elections in Punjab early next year. AAP functionary Raghav Chadha said, “Chandigarh is just a trailer, Punjab is the movie.” The party received the biggest mandate in the villages and colonies, traditionally the vote banks of Congress. In many wards, BJP candidates slipped to the third position after Congress. All the AAP candidates were newcomers. Besides failing to get its sitting mayor re-elected, BJP suffered a surprise defeat in ward number 25 that was previously held by its city unit president Arun Sood. He had backed Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha president Vijay Rana, who lost to AAP candidate Yogesh Dhingra. Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla’s son Sumit was among the prominent losers, finishing third in ward 14. Sources in AAP said the party now wanted to ensure BJP does not stand a chance of getting its nominee elected as the mayor. AAP has informally approached local Congress functionaries already for support in the mayoral race, they said.

Civic body engineers did not take any action despite being aware of the brazen violation. TOI had on December 13 alerted officials of NMC Laxmi Nagar Zone and Hotmix Department about trenches being dug to lay optical fibre cable along Sonegaon Road at Sahakar Nagar, and also on London Street Road. NMC engineers inspected the site, but have not initiated any action till date. The officials at that time refused to reveal what type of permission was given, and at how many spots in the city. Executive engineer Kamlesh Chauhan told TOI, “RJIL was given permission to lay optical fibre cable using HDD. The company cannot dig trenches on roads.” A spokesperson of RJIL assured to give the company’s statement four days ago, but informed on Monday no statement will come from the company on this issue. RJIL has committed similar violations at some more places. NMC sources said, “RJIL has been given permission to lay optical fibre cables using HDD method over around 70km in some parts of the city. RJIL is laying cables to launch 5G in the city. RJIL dug trenches at few places and laid cables using HDD at some places. Work of around 30km is pending.” It is learnt RJIL has sought permission to lay cables at many other places in the city too, and approval is awaited from NMC. The civic body faces damage to road infrastructure if trenches are dug, and it also inconveniences people. The impact is less in HDD technology. Restoration is rarely done properly when trenches are dug up for laying optical fibre or power cables or water pipelines. Potholes and trenches can be seen at many places due to improper restoration. NMC has routinely given permission to lay optical fibre cables by removing inter-locking tiles on newly constructed cement concrete roads. RJIL has laid cables using HDD in newly constructed cement concrete road connecting Old Airport Road to Khamla Square. The debris has been left behind as it is. NMC officials have assured inspection and promised to take action. IN A NUTSHELL * Telecom companies dig trenches on roads across city to lay optical fibre cables * Trenches cause mishaps, severe inconvenience to motorists * NMC allowed RJIL to lay cable using HDD method * Still RJIL laying cables by digging trenches on roads * No action taken despite alert by TOI and local residents * RJIL allowed to continue digging trenches at Sahakar Nagar * No action taken even 14 days later * NMC giving permission for laying cables under new cement roads||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/co-digs-trenches-on-roads-though-nmc-nod-was-to-lay-cables-via-hdd/articleshow/88531658.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The road is supposed to stay intact for minimum two years, but its surface layer has been damaged on many patches. Now, loose gravel has spread on to the road while the potholes are causing severe inconvenience to the citizens. The poor road work has drawn the ire of local residents. They have blamed the use of substandard material in the construction work and have raised the issue with local corporator and former mayor Sandip Joshi. In a letter to NMC’s deputy engineer of Laxmi Nagar zone, Joshi demanded immediate action and stoppage of the contractor’s payment over poor work. “The road was asphalted in November. NMC engineers should ensure good quality works. It is nothing less than a scam,” said Joshi. Joshi said the internal road was in bad shape and a proposal had been prepared for its recarpeting. In the meantime, the NMC, through a private contractor had started recarpeting a road in LIC Colony under Laxmi Nagar zone and Rs20 lakh had been sanctioned for the purpose. After renewing the LIC Colony road, it was found that huge quantity of tar and other material was found unused. “So, I have asked the zone officials to use the material to asphalt the small patch of tar road in Laxmi Nagar,” he said. Superintending engineer (public works department) Ajay Pohekar was not available for comments on the issue. Darshan Maheshwari, a local resident, said due to lack of responsibility and accountability of NMC, without any control, testing, and supervision by engineers, taxpayers are getting shoddy road works. The cost of road construction and maintenance is one of the biggest expenditures of the civic body after establishment expenses, he said. “But if such shoddy work continues, taxpayers’ money will continue to go to waste, besides putting human life in danger due to bad roads. If someone meets with an accident on this patch because of shoddy road works, who will be responsible? NMC engineers or the contractors?” he asked. “Even the cement roads built in the last 10 years don’t provide a smooth ride. After a promise of 50 years of life, the road can’t even last 5 years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-month-after-recarpeting-road-in-laxmi-ngr-develops-potholes/articleshow/88531667.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Health workers and front-line workers will get the dose first followed by senior citizens. Welcoming the move, infectious disease specialists in the city termed it as a major step in taking Covid-19 pandemic towards endemic. “Better late than never,” said Dr Nitin Shinde. “Instead of booster, we can call it third dose, which will eventually complete the vaccination schedule. It was necessary,” he said, adding the clause of doctor’s prescription should have been avoided. “I didn’t understand why the government is administering vaccines only on the doctor’s recommendation. It should be free without any endorsement by any physician,” said Dr Shinde. Healthcare workers will get the third dose on priority. “We need to finish off vaccinating healthcare workers fast so that they don’t land into mass infection, leading to absentism during the surge, which is unfortunately happening in the USA and the UK,” said Dr Shinde. The ‘boosted’ health workers can continue to work even during mild symptoms as per latest guidelines, he said. “This will ensure there is no shortage of doctors and health workers in case the third wave hits,” he concluded. Senior paediatrician and vice-president of Maharashtra Medical Council Dr Vinky Rughwani said the third dose to healthcare workers will ensure better management of the new wave. “Doctors and health workers will have protection, which will ensure enough manpower in hospitals in crucial time ahead. It’s a welcome step as medical fraternity was much in need of a booster at this time,” said Dr Rughwani. Epidemiologist Anand Thatte said the third dose to front-line workers will be a great benefit also for researchers. “Front-line workers include many under-30 people. We can study how they get benefited from the third dose, which will be of great help for the administration to decide if we can introduce the booster in this age group too,” he said. Precaution Dose Globally called as booster shots, third dose is termed as precaution dose in India Third dose can drive down cases of severe Covid-19 and death in older people It reduces infections in senior citizens and middle-aged adults Prevents new infections among younger individuals, eventually reducing spread Health workers and front-line workers will get much-needed relief through this||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3l-from-ngp-to-be-among-20l-in-vid-to-get-3rd-jab/articleshow/88531678.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: CP starts ‘defence helpline’ for Army personnel||NAGPUR: City police chief Amitesh Kumar on Monday started a ‘defence helpline’ (9405114422) as a confidence-building measure for the kin of the army and paramilitary personnel who are local residents. This facility, also extended to the retired personnel, would be beneficial, especially, for the personnel posted in remote places. The helpline was started by the top cop to ensure that the families of the defense and paramilitary personnel would not have to run pillar to post for any of their grievances. With their kin not available to cater to their needs due to their engagements in the remote border posts, Kumar wanted to create a ‘one-point contact’ for the kin to ensure their issues are addressed on a single platform. The CP said the facility would operate from the economic offence wing of the crime branch with an officer being made the in-charge of the cell. “The kin or the army or the paramilitary personnel are open to approach the local police stations but a parallel facility is now created to offer them more options to get help. Once we receive a complaint or grievances, senior officers would co-ordinate it with the concerned police station or unit to get the issues addressed,” said the CP. Kumar also said the help desk personnel would ensure the complaints are followed up, expedited and addressed in a time-bound manner. “It was observed and also being discussed informally that the kin of the army personnel are often left helpless in the face of some legal hassles. Sometimes, their family members faced harassments too,” said the top cop, adding, the police would go the extra mile to render assistance to the army and paramilitary forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-starts-defence-helpline-for-army-personnel/articleshow/88531681.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Uncertainty over events due to Covid, surge in tiger tourism but no room||Nagpur: With the sudden surge in Covid positive cases, especially with the Omicron variant leading to imposing of restrictions on various events and social gatherings in the city to welcome New Year, there is a spurt in demand for wildlife and nature tourism but there is ‘no room’ in popular parks in the region. “In the last two days, we have been flooded with calls about room availability and entry to popular parks like Tadoba and Pench but all entry tickets to not only the core but also from 14 gates in the buffer zone of Tadoba have been sold out. Even entry for a night safari from three gates is unavailable. Little known gates in the buffer like Keslaghat, Mamla, Karwa, and others are full,” said Nikhil Abhyankar, who runs a resort at Kolara. “With Christmas and December 31st and New Year falling at the weekend many have been on extended leave with families. There is no room even in our resorts at hill station Chikhaldara, Bodhalkasa, Pench and Tadoba,” said Shipra Bora, senior regional manager, Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), Nagpur. Bora added, “In the last two days many tourists visited our office at Civil Lines for room availability, but we have said sorry. This is the position since December 25. Though no specific events have been arranged for New Year at our properties, we will allow karaoke.” Some resorts around Tadoba that have banquet halls have also planned folk dances by local artistes to welcome New Year. “Similar dances have been arranged at select resorts in Madhya Pradesh side of Pench, where both entry tickets for core and buffer have been sold out till January 3. It is true that due to uncertainty about events in Nagpur, there are a lot of enquiries for stay, if not entry to the park,” said Sandeep Singh, a stakeholder. Stakeholders said even if there is no room availability, there are groups from Vidarbha who are coming for a day-long safari. “Chandrapur district has become prohibition-free and hence drinks would be allowed to the guests. Besides, several resorts also plan to cut the cake to welcome the New Year,” said a section of resort owners. Naturalist Himanshu Bagde says there are no international tourists. On the eve of New Year, most local tourists either prefer visiting beaches or adventure and wildlife parks. “With Tadoba having a variety of attractions like nature trails, butterfly park, bird watching, cycling, kayaking, it is the most sought destinations by tourists from other states,” said Bagde. However, Swanand Soni, one of the stakeholders from Pench, said, “Though entries to most-sought Sillari and Khursapar gates have been sold out, there is still scope from Chorbahuli, Kolitmara (West Pench), Kubala, Surewani entry gates of Pench. As of now, berths are available but by December 31, we can’t say if entries get full.” Contrary to other wildlife parks, the Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) has decided to close resorts inside the tiger reserve to avoid any revelry. “Though safari will be allowed on December 31, 2021, and on the New Year day, visitors will not be allowed to stay inside. We have already stopped bookings online,” said M Ramanujam, conservator of forest and field director of NNTR. “With five separate wildlife parks Navegaon, Nagzira, Koka, New Nagzira and New Navegaon in Gondia and Bhandara districts, tourists not getting berths elsewhere and wanting to come close to nature can visit these parks,” said Ramanujam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/uncertainty-over-events-due-to-covid-surge-in-tiger-tourism-but-no-room/articleshow/88531686.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||DRI’s probes into international betel nut smuggling cases under CBI lens||NAGPUR: The central bureau of investigation (CBI) is reinvestigating probes by the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) and other agencies into various irregularities pertaining to betel (areca) nut sourced from other countries for transporting, stocking and distribution leading to losses to the state exchequer amounting to crores of rupees through tax evasion and posing health hazards. The probe is revolving around the nexus between central and state government officials with betel nut traders. In its reply before the high court, the CBI has stated that it is scrutinizing 233 documents, contents in the four smart phones of suspects, one hard disk and other material seized during raids and searches conducted at 11 places in Mumbai, six places in Nagpur and two in Ahmedabad in June. The CBI has also claimed to have sent the evidence to central forensic science laboratories in Hyderabad and Pune for image copying. The searches were conducted following an FIR lodged against unidentified central excise and custom officials and private traders in March following a high court order. On December 23, the CBI had sought an additional three months from the Nagpur bench of high court to conduct probes into betel nut related irregularities. The court was hearing a PIL filed by Dr Mehboob Chimthanwala through his counsel Raspal Singh Renu. The probes were handed over to CBI after the petitioner’s counsel had raised objection regarding the DRI’s questionable role in the investigation into the cases it has registered regarding various irregularities. In the reply filed before the court last week, CBI also indicated possible lapses on the part of the sales tax department and food and drugs administration (FDA) to probe into the existing cases, including the seizure of betel nut stocks in 23 wagons from Millenium Express in 2016, which are now under its purview. CBI is probing four cases being investigated by the DRI spanning Mumbai, Nagpur and Ahmedabad. CBI has also stated in the reply regarding the various documents, receipts and records it has been collecting from different agencies and departments as evidences regarding irregularities in importing with huge tax evasion, transporting and stocking. The high court had also issued an interim order clarifying the role of police in cracking the whip on the betel (areca) nut traders if the allegations of material being sub-standard and of hazardous quality are substantiated by the laboratory reports. The court said the CP can take parallel action against traders with the support of substantive evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dris-probes-into-international-betel-nut-smuggling-cases-under-cbi-lens/articleshow/88531687.cms||Soumitra Bose

As per the new government resolution, planning and expenditure of all the works on the forest rights acquired land shall be done by the executive board constituted by the gram sabha in accordance with Section 4 (1) (E) of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) with the approval of the gram sabha. The works under the MGNREGA scheme will be carried out by incorporating schemes for forest growth, water conservation, and subsistence of forest rights holders in the CFR villages. All the works marked by the gram sabha will be submitted to the gram panchayat and its acknowledgement will be taken. Earlier, under the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Act, 1977 and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, gram panchayat was an implementing agency. For this, samruddhi (labor) budget has to be prepared every year by the gram panchayats with the approval of the gram sabhas. In this process, there was meagre participation of citizens from villages other than the panchayat headquarters. Therefore, it was found that not enough attention was being paid to the needs of other people. Now, every village, tolas, and padas will have to prepare a conservation and development plan for their area. This will have good and definite results as the residents of the villages will participate in it. With the approval of the gram sabha, the executive board will decide whether the planned activities of the gram sabha should be implemented by the panchayat samiti, by the gram sabha, or by other government departments. FRA activist and executive director of Vidarbha Nature Conservation Society (VNCS) Dilip Gode said, “More than 5,000 CFR villages in the state will benefit now. They will be able to create water resources, nurseries, afforestation, dams, ponds, closure of agricultural dams, and other complementary works which will increase agricultural yields and forest production. This will provide employment for tribals and other forest dwellers.” On the various works, officials said block development officer (BDO) will monitor the work at the taluka level. The BDO will be solely responsible for ensuring that the works proposed by any gram sabha are approved and executed on time. The project officers of the tribal development department, as well as officers from other departments at the taluka level, will be reviewed on a quarterly basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cfr-gram-sabhas-get-nod-to-do-mgnrega-works/articleshow/88531693.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The urban habitat development board tenement on Village Street had 24 flats that housed 80 people. Some of them had moved to the homes of friends and relatives on Sunday night. The rest spent an uneasy night in their homes, with bits of plaster falling and the building groaning. Around 9.45am a local activist arrived to videograph the state of the building and asked those who had remained behind to move out. By 10.10am everyone had left the building. Residents said the building collapsed 10 minutes later, even as they were standing around outside. Many families lost much of their belongings as they had planned to shift things later. Fire and rescue personnel have begun clearing the debris. They also brought sniffer dogs to the site to check if anyone was trapped under the debris. Chief minister M K Stalin announced a solatium of 1 lakh to each of the affected families and said they would be provided alternative housing. In a statement, he said the building that collapsed was constructed in 1993. Enumeration would be carried out to identify such old tenements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/minutes-after-evacuation-govt-housing-building-collapses-in-chennai/articleshow/88533234.cms||Sindhu Kannan
---||Mumbai||In second Covid wave redux, 88% of Mumbai cases last week in highrises||MUMBAI: More than 88% of Covid cases in the city last week came from high-rises. Slums are hardly reporting infections in big numbers, as per civic data. Seeing the surge in cases, the corporation carried out an analysis of the 3,300-odd positive cases reported in the previous week. "Almost 88% cases were from buildings. Most wards are not finding many cases from slum pockets," said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. During the second wave, a similar trend was noted, the reasons for which were attributed to higher exposure among slum dwellers to better immunity to a testing bias. Cases in some of the city’s wards with the highest weekly growth rates, including A (0.15%), D (0.13%), H-West (0.12%), G-South (0.12%) and KWest, are largely driven by building residents testing positive following international travel or a social do. Ward A covers Colaba to Fort, D includes Tardeo to Girgaum, H-West is Bandra to Khar, G-South is Worli to Lower Parel and K-West is Andheri-Vile Parle-Juhu. A closer look reveals the slum-building divide further. Take the example of M-West ward that covers Chembur and Tilak Nagar and has more than 1.5 lakh, or 35%, of the population living in slums. Yet, the ward has hardly found many cases there, admitted Dr Bhupendra Patil, the ward’s medical officer of health (MOH). “Almost all our patients are building residents,” he said. Only a few have a foreign travel history. “The commonest source we found during contact tracing was a recent wedding party or a social gathering they had attended,” he said. The trend is similar in N ward (Ghatkopar, Vidyavihar), where up to 60% of the population lives in slums, but cases are mostly in high-rises. Since the surge, the ward has been reporting 30-35 cases every day. “But hardly four or five would be from slums,” said Dr Mahendra Khandade, MOH of the ward. Most of his positive patients either gave a history of outing in a restaurant or attending the wedding of a friend or family member. “Restaurants were packed on Sunday despite a 9 pm curfew. We fined Rs 10,000 to five restaurants; so the crowd was slimmer on Monday,” he said. But low detection in slums shouldn’t mean there are no cases, Khandade said. “Often slum dwellers hesitate to get tested as they are worried about staying away from work. Some perhaps don’t take the disease too seriously as the symptoms (could be) mild,” he added. Since building residents get tested more proactively, there is an inherent testing bias that reflects in higher cases in affluent pockets, he said. Kakani said they have not been able to pinpoint any particular factor behind Mumbai’s exponential surge. “Whether it is weddings or people returning from abroad and testing positive subsequently, or domestic travellers coming to the city, we don’t know what is responsible,” he said. A ward official said, “It would be a real mystery; if Omicron is not causing it then what is?” The surge in cases is also leading to a corresponding rise in hospitalisations. Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital said they are recording admissions in double digits, although severe cases are few. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, CEO of Hiranandani Hospital, said on Monday that they saw 13 new Covid admissions compared to earlier 4-5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-second-covid-wave-redux-88-of-mumbai-cases-last-week-in-highrises/articleshow/88533214.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Chennai||Chennai: Wrong vaccination dates to delay booster||CHENNAI: After pleading with authorities at King Institute for Preventive Medicine for more than six months, a 56-year-old resident from Anna Nagar finally got her vaccination certificate in November. But due to a technical glitch on the CoWIN portal, the hospital authorities told her that the vaccination date on the certificate will be that of November. With the Centre insisting on a nine-month gap between the second dose and booster shot, she may have to wait for at least six more months exposing herself to the rapidly spreading Omicron variant. There are several others like her who got vaccination certificates much later after receiving both doses. "We told staff nurses to note down names of people on google sheets and upload them on the CoWIN portal later. But when crowds at the vaccination centres swelled, many staff nurses wrote down the names on paper and uploaded them on google sheets and the CoWIN portal after a long gap," said a senior official in the immunisation wing. Over a period of time, with huge backlogs, several names never made it to the portal. The state does not have details on the number of such complaints, but official staff nurses were forced to upload names of thousands of people late on the portal. The CoWIN portal allows individuals to make minor corrections such as name spelling or sex, but not date of vaccination. "It will be a laborious process for us to refer to records, verify vaccination dates based on hospital or PHC records," officials said. "As of now we have decided that booster doses will be given based on the date of vaccination mentioned in the certificates," he said. On Monday, health minister Ma Subramanian said the state will begin vaccinating 33.20 lakh teens between 15-18 years from January 3. "While instructions for teens are clear, we have not received any information about booster doses," Subramanian said. "We don't know whether people should be given the same vaccine or a mixed dose. We also don't know the dosage they will require," he said. The state, he added, is however prepared to start vaccinating priority groups including healthcare providers and senior citizens from January 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-wrong-vaccination-dates-to-delay-booster/articleshow/88533243.cms||---
---||Chennai||No provision for 2 dads, transgender man seeks 'parent' tag on kids’ passport||CHENNAI: Four decades, a marriage, two children and a divorce - that's what it took before Tarun (name changed) could finally publicly embrace his identity as a man of transgender experience. But the battle for his legal rights is far from over. The 42-year-old on December 13 filed a petition in the Madras high court requesting that the gender-neutral term 'parent' be included in Indian passports instead of the gender-specific 'mother' or 'father' so his name can be included in the passports of his minor children. "I can't travel abroad with my children now as the passport can only have the names of the father, mother or legal guardian. There is no provision to have the names of two fathers. But it wouldn't be a problem if the term 'parent' is used," says Tarun. "If my dead (former) name is on my children's passports, I won't be able to explain my relationship to them to immigration officials," says Tarun, an LGBTQIA+ affirmative counsellor. The HC, which heard the petition on December 16, asked the ministry of external affairs and the regional passport office to respond in eight weeks. Tarun*'s ordeal began at a very young age. Assigned female at birth, Tarun first came out to his parents at the age of two. "I have always told them I am their son and have tried coming out to them several times. but my mother never took it seriously and said it was my imagination," he says. Having to wear the uniform for girls and use their restroom at school traumatised him so much that he suffered stomach issues and had to be pulled out of school for one-and-a-half years. "That happened when I was in class III. I used to avoid wearing girls' uniforms by getting into sports and playing cricket so that I could wear a T-shirt and shorts." When he attained puberty at the age of 13, and started menstruating, it traumatised him. "I had read that sex reassignment surgeries (SRS) are done in Mumbai and told my mother that I wanted to get it done. But she asked me not to say it again," says Tarun, who dealt with it by immersing himself in sports and studies. "Since my father's business was running at a loss, I began supporting my family when I was in class 4 by offering tuitions for younger children. I did my schooling and college on a scholarship so I had to score above 90% to retain my scholarship." But as the years passed and his older and younger siblings got married, the pressure to get married got severe. "People would ask my parents if there was something mentally or physically wrong with me," says Tarun. With the trauma of trying to come out repeatedly in vain still fresh in his mind, he gave in. "I was also sexually abused by various people in the neighbourhood; my mother refused to believe me when I told her. So, I finally just lay low and did what they said," says Tarun, who got married at the age of 26. He began leading a dual life, revealing his true self only online. At 31, he had his first child and the second one at 35. "Parenting has been a joy. When I felt the child in me, I felt euphoria, which helped me combat my gender dysphoria." But, by 2017, the bubble exploded. "The dual life I led was eating me alive, I could no longer do it to myself. It felt like I was punishing myself for the sake of others. I had done enough for my family, siblings, and felt that I deserved to live my own life," says Tarun, who came out to his then husband and children in January 2018. His spouse initially dismissed it, then suggested they see a therapist. "She explained gender dysphoria to me. I began reading up, and watching videos to know more about it," he says. Explaining it to his children was a delicate matter. "I told them that I am a man and they need to call me 'appa' not 'amma', and use the pronouns he/him. The younger one immediately accepted it but my older child needed more sensitisation," says Tarun. In October 2019, Tarun filed for divorce by mutual consent citing gender dysphoria as the reason. "The same month I got my gender affirmative surgeries done and the divorce decree was granted by June 2020," says Tarun, who has got shared custody of his children. He also found a school, which assured him that his children wouldn't be discriminated against or harassed. "They said the gender identity of the parents doesn't matter to them." His name has also been legally changed on his Aadhaar, PAN and passport. "When I went for passport verification in January 2020, the cops were surprised but supportive," says Tarun. "I filed the petition for passports to have the gender-neutral term 'parent' as I don't want my parental rights compromised." Advocates Arun Kasi and Pradeep Raja, who are representing him, say using gender-neutral terms on passports would benefit the entire community. "This is the first time we are handling such a case, so we had to sensitise ourselves. We researched for a month, and looked for precedents in other countries. Even when we presented the case in court, it took us 20 minutes to explain the issue and state our case." Transactivists feel that bringing in gender-neutral terms is important not just for the trans community but for the equal rights movement. "If you see how the women's rights movement has evolved in the last two or three decades, the conversation so far has been more skewed towards bringing about equality between men and women, even in terms of language. But it is time we started taking the gender rights movement beyond just women and acknowledge that there are people of different genders who also need to be included," says Kerala-based trans activist Vihaan Peethambar. "We should be relooking at language to include people of different genders.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Car registrations this year up 13% over pre-pandemic levels||MUMBAI: The number of new private cars, including SUVs, registered in Mumbai in 2021 saw a 13% jump over the pre-Covid time (2019), the latest statistics of the state transport department on Monday showed. The statistics also showed that new car registrations this year were 47% more than last year. The data available with TOI revealed that while 56,689 cars/SUVs were registered this year at the four city RTOs between January 1 and December 26, the number of new car registrations in Mumbai in 2020 was 38,592 compared to 50,002 new private car registrations in 2019. The record rise in registrations of private cars this year indicates a trend of people buying more cars, especially SUVs, during the pandemic as it provided protection to the entire family during travel and was considered a "good form of social distancing", sources said. The statistics further showed that "overall vehicle registrations", which include bikes, buses and heavy goods vehicles, in Mumbai had also surpassed last year's registrations by 19%. In all, 1,95,109 vehicles were registered in Mumbai this year compared to 1,64,483 in 2020 and 2,57,386 in 2019. So, when it came to overall vehicles, the registrations lagged behind by 24% in comparison to the pre-Covid times, officials said. In the case of private cars, Tardeo RTO in island city had maximum registrations in 2021, with 15,195 new cars hitting the roads. This was followed by Borivli RTO in western suburbs witnessing 14,659 new car registrations. Andheri RTO in western suburbs and Wadala RTO in eastern suburb saw 13,702 and 13,113 new cars being registered, respectively this year. Amit Bhatt, executive director of integrated urban transport, WRI India, said, "The basic perception of getting infections due to shared transport has made people switch to personal vehicles. Unavailability of public transport during lockdown was another factor that made people to go for private vehicles." He further said that people opted for private transport, presuming it was a safer way to commute. "If you look globally, I don't think there is any empirical study which has pointed out that public transport is a carrier for Covid. In fact, if we maintain personal hygiene, wear masks and get fully vaccinated, it can protect us while travelling in shared transport. We need to allay fears and bring back people to public transport," he said. A V Shenoy from Mumbai Mobility Forum said, "People planned road trips with families in their SUVs, sedans, and hatchbacks to go to their native towns or to any tourist destination within or outside the state. The reason was simple - avoid going out with family in local or long-distance trains or by flights for the fear of catching the infection." Meanwhile, the transport statistics showed that 1.2 lakh bikes and scooters were registered in 2021, with the two-wheeler population crossing 24 lakh in June this year. The total vehicle population in Mumbai now stands at 41.5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-car-registrations-this-year-up-13-over-pre-pandemic-levels/articleshow/88533341.cms||Somit Sen

Armed police responded to a security breach at 8.30 am on Christmas Day within the grounds of Windsor Castle and arrested a 19-year-old man from Southampton on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon. The Queen was having her breakfast inside the castle at the time and other members of the royal family were present. The man has since been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The suspect has not yet been named by police but British newspapers named him as Indian-origin Sikh Jaswant Singh Chail, known to friends as Jas, who allegedly uploaded a pre-recorded video to Snapchat 24 minutes before the arrest in which a masked man, claiming to be Chail, said he intended to kill the Queen. In the video obtained by the Sun, posted to Chail’s friends on Snapchat at 8.06 am, a masked man holding a black weapon, wearing a Star Wars-inspired mask and a hoodie, and using a distorted voice, says: "I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I’ve done and what I will do. I intend to assassinate Elizabeth, queen of the royal family. This is revenge for those who have died in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. It is also revenge for those who have been killed, humiliated and discriminated on because of their race. I’m an Indian Sikh, a Sith. My name was Jaswant Singh Chail, my name is Darth Jones." In the fictional Star Wars universe the Sith are the ancient enemy of the Jedi and are devoted to the dark side of the Force. There is a framed image of Darth Malgus from Star Wars behind the man in the video. Darth Jones may refer to the American actor James Earl Jones, who voiced Darth Varder in the Star Wars films. Alongside the video is a message saying: "I’m sorry to all of those who I have wronged or lied to. If you have received this then my death is near. Please share this with whoever and if possible get it to the news if they’re interested." According to news reports, the £500,000 (Rs 5 crore) semi-detached family home of the Chail family in Southampton was searched by police on Christmas Day. Chail’s father, Jasbir Singh Chail (57) told MailOnline: "Something’s gone horribly wrong with our son and we are trying to figure out what. We’ve not had a chance to speak to him but are trying to get him the help he needs. From our perspective, we are going through a difficult time. We are trying to resolve this issue and it’s not easy." The suspect scaled a spiked fence on Long Walk with a rope ladder and entered the grounds of the castle, immediately triggering security processes. He did not enter any buildings. Following a search of the suspect, a crossbow was recovered. A Metropolitan police spokesman told TOI: "Enquiries into the full circumstances of this incident are being progressed by Metropolitan police specialist operations. Following the man’s arrest, detectives are assessing the contents of a video. We are not prepared to discuss further." The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place at a Baisakhi gathering on April 13, 1919 inside a historic garden close to the Golden Temple in Amritsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/man-arrested-inside-windsor-castle-on-xmas-day-believed-to-be-sikh-seeking-jallianwala-revenge/articleshow/88533359.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Kolkata||10 private hospitals in Kolkata to share load of Omicron patients, set up 3 separate Covid zones||KOLKATA: The state health department on Monday identified ten big private hospitals in the city to share the load of Omicron patients and suspects while Beliaghata ID & BG Hospital will continue to be the nodal hospital for Omicron among government facilities. At a meeting with representatives of private hospitals on Monday, health secretary Sanjay Bansal and director of health services Ajay Chakraborty discussed how best to deal with the new variant and chalked out several measures including setting up three separate zones in their Covid units - for general Covid patients, for Omicron suspects and for confirmed Omicron cases - to prevent the spread of the variant at the facilities. The private hospitals identified are the three units of AMRI at Dhakuria, Salt Lake and Mukundapur, Apollo, Fortis, Medica, Woodlands, Belle Vue, CMRI and Charnock Hospital. The ramp-up was driven by the detection of more Omicron cases as well as rise in the number of Omicron suspects. The state currently has five active cases of Omicron admitted in five different hospitals in Kolkata and at least five more suspected cases under institutional quarantine. Health officials expect both numbers to rise in the coming weeks. Genome sequencing for low CT count samples from New Town, BidhannagarWith more flyers testing positive on arrival and later, in home quarantine, we will require more beds to isolate them. We need more private hospitals to share this responsibility while these flyers have the option of getting admitted at ID Hospital,” said a senior health official. Medica Hospital group chairman Alok Roy said his facility currently has 10 single cabin beds earmarked for Omicron cases. “If needed, we can raise the strength,” he added. Belle Vue Clinic has set aside five beds for Omicron cases. “We have updated our Covid infrastructure. We now have 30 Covid beds, of which two are for international travellers and Omicron patients,” said Rupali Basu, Managing Director & CEO, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. The health department has also asked all laboratories in Bidhannagar and New Town, besides Kolkata, to send swab samples of Covid patients with CT load less than 30 for genome sequencing to detect community transmission of Omicron early. The lower the CT load, higher the possibility of the person transmitting the virus, said experts. The labs have also been asked to share details on vaccination doses of the tested person, travel history within the last 14 days, and the reason for getting tested. In case Omicron does get a foothold in the community, the health department has outlined a release protocol for patients. An Omicron suspect will be sent for home isolation if clinically stable once he tests negative for Omicron. But a confirmed Omicron patient will remain in hospital isolation till two consecutive RTPCR tests carried out 48 hours apart are negative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/10-private-hospitals-in-kolkata-to-share-o-load-set-up-3-separate-covid-zones/articleshow/88533382.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The CM wanted the screening done to reduce chances of any coronavirus spread among the gathering. During the festival’s duration, the mela grounds would be out of bounds for VVIPs and other ministers on duty. “VIPs coming to the mela with escort cars create chaos amid such huge turnout. I won’t allow any VIP during the mela time between January 8 and 16,” Banerjee said at a meeting in Nabanna. She will hold an administrative meeting after reaching Gangasagar on Tuesday. The CM will offer prayers at the Kapil Muni temple the same afternoon. Acting on the CM’s directive, the South 24 Parganas administration decided to increase the number of RTPCR centres from the 13 it had planned at the 13 entry points to Gangasagar. Banerjee said a 600-bed Covid hospital will be operational on the island, along with six wellness centres and eight safe homes. The administration has also arranged for 11 quarantine centres and 5 isolation centres on the island. Doctors and paramedical staff of Diamond Harbour Medical College & Hospital will man the health care facilities. The CM directed the administration to make masks mandatory at the congregation. She asked NGOs to distribute masks among the pilgrims. Two air ambulances would be stationed at Gangasagar to airlift patients in need, the CM said. The district administration has also planned an autopsy facility on the island in the event of any death due to Covid. The safety measures apart, the CM also focused on proper road signage to help pilgrims reach Gangasagar. She asked for billboards in Bengali and Hindi to be put up. The CM also wanted volunteers at every point to assist people at the mela site. The administration has installed 1,051 CCTV cameras and depoyed 20 drones to keep vigil on the island. It has requisitioned 50 fire engines to be kept ready at 10 fire stations on the island. Sunderbans affairs minister Bankim Hazra said marine vessels would operate for 18-20 hours daily to ferry pilgrims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-covid-tests-on-maidan-for-gangasagar-pilgrims/articleshow/88531349.cms||TNN

The police commissioner won’t spare you if you use unfair means. He will make you feel that the Modi government has sent the police commissioner,” Bhowmick further said, taking a cue from Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee. The MLA told candidates that they could win only if people voted for them. “You will win only if people vote for you. Else, the opposition will win,” he said. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar dubbed the Trinamool message an “eyewash”. “They gave the same message to Trinamool ranks ahead of the Kolkata civic polls. But that didn’t stop Trinamool from intimidating candidates or coercing voters during polls. It’s just an eyewash. They say all this in public and ask Trinamool ranks to continue with their old practice when it comes to votes,” Majumdar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dont-adopt-unfair-means-in-polls-tmc-mla-warns-party-workers/articleshow/88531333.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
