Locals spotted the half-burnt body in the morning and informed the police. Eventually, Budeshwar was arrested. The accused has confessed to the crime. Both the victim and the accused belong to the Sabar tribe. The police said lending of money was the reason behind the murder of Somwari, who was a daily wage labourer. “We are working on all angles to ascertain the exact reason behind the murder,” an officer said. The body has been sent for post-mortem. It will be handed over to the victim's family thereafter. The tribal-dominated area, where the incident took place, is nearly 15km from Jamshedpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/jamshedpur-neighbour-kills-sabar-woman-near-chandil-arrested/articleshow/88496723.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

Newly elected secretary of IMA and noted orthopedic surgeon Dr Saurabh Chaudhury said the members have been instructed to be on the lookout of such quacks toying with the lives of patients here. Dr Chaudhury said the IMA is preparing a list of such quacks in the entire Kolhan region and it would be handed over to the DCs of respective districts, so that stringent action can be taken against such people. He said these quacks along with putting lives of patients at risk, bring bad names to the entire medical fraternity. Pointing to a recent incident in Adityapur area in neighbouring Seraikela-Kharsawan district, Chaudury said, “Recently it came to light that a person claiming to be Dr Vinay Kumar, an ENT surgeon, was operating from his clinic. When his papers were checked it came to light that he did not hold a proper MBBS degree and was not authorised to function as a surgeon.” He added that there are several such quacks doing business in the city and in rural parts of the Kolhan region. Most of these are paramedical staff who run doctors’ clinics. In the past, there have been several cases in which patients have lost lives undergoing treatment under such quacks in the area. There are allegations that several such quacks run illegal ultrasonography (USG) clinics to determine sex determination of foetus, which is banned by law. Sources said the administration have unearthed such clinics in several drives in the past. Many such clinics in urban and rural areas perform illegal abortions too, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/ima-to-prepare-list-of-fake-docs-in-kolhan/articleshow/88496739.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||India||Covid-19: Vaccine for 15-18-year-olds, ‘precaution dose’ for health workers, 60+ with ailments||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi announced on Saturday that “precaution doses” (boosters) of Covid vaccines for health and frontline workers as well as for those above 60 with co-morbidities will begin from January 10. He also said vaccination for children aged 15-18, using Covaxin, will begin from January 3. The PM made the announcement in an ‘Address to the Nation’ at 9.45pm on Saturday, soon after the drug regulator granted emergency use authorisation to Bharat Biotech’s locally developed Covaxin for children above 12 years of age. Covaxin is the second vaccine, after Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D, to get the regulatory nod for restricted use among children in the 12-18 age bracket. The vaccination programme, however, will currently cover children above 15 only. Modi also said approvals for a nasal vaccine and the world’s first DNA vaccine are on the anvil. The PM began with Christmas wishes and then spoke of the emergence of the Omicron variant and its implications, urging people not to panic while observing Covid protocols such as wearing masks and hand sanitisation. He said the country has learnt from having delivered 141 crore doses and significant capacity addition by way of oxygen supplies has taken place. He said there are differing estimates and reports on Omicron, indicating that India’s policy response will be guided by its experience, infection prevalence and efficacy of vaccines in use in the country. The decisions bring down curtains over speculation as to when booster doses will begin. The PM said these calls will be based — as has been the case since the vaccine programme was rolled out on January 16 — on scientific analysis and assessments derived from studies and the vaccine rollout. People above 60 years with comorbidities will have the option to take the ‘precaution’ or booster dose on the advice of their doctors, the PM said, underlining that India has taken decisions after taking into account its local situation and data apart from global experiences. The decision on vaccines for children is expected to reassure students and parents, said the PM. So far, the Centre has been cautious, pointing to the wide prevalence of antibodies in the sub-18 population despite being unvaccinated. But the higher transmissibility of Omicron has increased risk of disease even though so far children have been spared the pandemic’s worst effects. “This has been done in the light of the amount of time that the frontline workers and health care workers spend in the service of Covid patients. In India, this has been called ‘precaution dose’ not booster dose. The decision of precaution dose will strengthen confidence of healthcare and frontline workers,” a government statement said. Even as active discussions were going on around Omicron, scientists in India assessed local data from 11 months of vaccination in the country, while also closely watching the experiences worldwide, which varied from country to country, the PM said. The assessment included impact of vaccination among the elderly, those with co-morbidities as well as vaccine response in terms of the gap between doses. Researchers have also evaluated data of re-infection as well as breakthrough infections in India as well as globally. The PM said the decision to introduce ‘precaution dose’ and immunisation of children will strengthen the fight against Covid-19 and aid normalisation of education in schools. The PM said the announcements will mark the occasion of Christmas and the birthday of BJP stalwart and late former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He emphasised that as the virus is mutating, the country’s capability and confidence to face the challenge is also multiplying along with “our innovative spirit”.

---||India||As Omicron cases rise, govt rushes teams to 10 states||NEW DELHI: In the wake of rising Omicron cases and low vaccination coverage in some states, the Centre on Saturday deployed multi-disciplinary teams in 10 states to assist them in addressing hurdles and suggest remedial measures. These 10 states are Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Mizoram, Karnataka, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Punjab. “In view of a rapid surge in cases and deaths because of Covid-19, ...it has been seen that a number of Omicron cases have emerged in some states. It has also been observed that the pace of vaccination in these states is less than the national average,” an official memorandum from the health ministry said. The seven-day rolling average of cases per million remains low as compared to several other countries, according to ‘ourworldindata’ website that tracks the pandemic and the bi-weekly changes (cumulative number of cases over the previous two weeks) is at 70 per million people while the rate is soaring in nations like France (12,200/million) and UK (17,233/million). But given the high transmissibility of Omicron, the Centre has renewed its push to increase detection and vaccination. The move comes soon after PM Narendra Modi directed officials at the Centre to work with a ‘whole of government’ approach and assist states in addressing issues so that containment of cases can happen. The teams will be stationed in the states for three to five days and aid efforts of state and district administrations for management of Covid-19. They will suggest remedial actions and submit a report by 7pm on health activities being undertaken, besides submitting the same to the states, the memo stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-omicron-cases-rise-govt-rushes-teams-to-10-states/articleshow/88497563.cms||---
---||India||Gujarat, Delhi bag top slots in good governance index||NEW DELHI: Gujarat has topped states in the overall Good Governance Index (GGI) for 2020-21 in the indicators launched by Union home minister Amit Shah on the occasion of Good Governance Day on Saturday. Gujarat was followed by Maharashtra and Goa. Delhi topped the list among all Union Territories. As many as 20 states have improved their composite GGI scores in 2021 with Uttar Pradesh showing an incremental growth of 8.9%. Speaking at the event, Shah said the Modi government has taken decisions that are good for the people even in the face of political damage. The home minister said there has not been a single corruption charge against the Modi government as it is a clean and transparent administration as he called it an evidence of good governance. “PM Modi has never taken decisions, which the people would like (jo logon ko acche lagen). He has taken decisions which are good for the people (jo logon ke liye achhe hon). There is a big difference between the two. Some decisions may bring you popularity for a short time but this means keeping the country in problems,” the home minister said. “People have kept saying that we have got independence (swaraj) long ago but when will we get good governance (suraaj),” he said. Shah said Modi has brought back people’s faith in democracy by taking good governance up to the grassroot-level. An official statement said, “The sector-wise scores attained by the states and UTs indicate strong performance in one or the other sector. Analysis of scoring also suggests that there is a very marginal difference among the states in their composite governance scores. This indicates that overall governance in the states of India is moving in the positive direction.” The GGI 2021 framework covered 10 sectors and 58 indicators. These include agriculture and allied sectors, commerce and industries, human resource development, public health, public infrastructure and utilities, economic governance, social welfare and development, and citizen-centric governance. The objectives of GGI are to provide quantifiable data to compare the state of governance in all states and UTs. Gujarat has performed better in economic governance, human resource development, public infrastructure and utilities, social welfare and development, judiciary and public safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-delhi-bag-top-slots-in-good-governance-index/articleshow/88497755.cms||---

Two prisoners linked with a Pakistani narco-terror cell were brought out of jail and remanded in police custody for seven days. The two prisoners are Singh Cheeta and Sukhwinder Singh, alias Boxer Baba. A woman cop once attached to the Khanna SP’s office and suspected to have been Gagandeep’s girlfriend was detained. Gagandeep used to work in the same office from 2015 to 2017. “The preliminary investigation suggests Gagandeep Singh was used to target the court premises with the intention of disturbing peace in the state,” the DGP said. “The police are investigating the case from all angles.” The Ludhiana unit of the Special Task Force (STF) had arrested Gagandeep in August 2019 and also charged him with possession of 385gm of heroin. The case against him was registered in Mohali. He got bail last September and was due to appear in the court of the additional sessions judge on Friday. The high-intensity explosion that killed Gagandeep and injured six people, including a lawyer and three women, occurred inside a public toilet in building No 1 of the court complex. The building, usually teeming with people, was less crowded on Thursday afternoon because of a lawyers’ strike. The DGP said the suspect wanted to create fear and panic on the court premises before the scheduled hearing of his ongoing case. The explosives he was possibly carrying have yet to be ascertained. “Samples have been sent to the forensic lab. An NSG team and forensic experts have inspected the site.” The forensic team collected, among other things, a damaged mobile handset and burnt clothes on the body of the deceased. Chattopadhyaya lauded the police force for “cracking the case within 24 hours after zeroing in on the identity of the deceased as Gagandeep Singh of Khanna”. He also added that the police were able to identify the deceased from a tattoo on his right arm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ludhiana-blast-suspect-wanted-to-create-fear-on-court-premises/articleshow/88497842.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Congress fails to put BJP on mat over kickback charges, bitcoin scam||BENGALURU: The expectation that the just-concluded Belagavi session would see fireworks from the opposition Congress against the government over the 40% kickback allegation by the state contractors’ association and the bitcoin scam that grabbed the headlines at national level did not come true. For, the Congress made no efforts to raise these issues with the seriousness they deserved. In fact, the opposition party meekly submitted to the government’s tactic to avoid a debate on the matter. This gave way to speculation that there was some kind of ‘match-fixing’ between the two parties. In the run-up to the session, the Congress, particularly KPCC chief DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramaiah, had said they would nail the government over these issues. “For the first time in history, something like this has happened. We will not only raise the issue in the session but also force the government to come clean on the allegations,” Shivakumar had said. Both had even met governor Thaawarchand Gehlot and sough imposition of the President’s rule in the state for what they claimed was “failure of the Constitutional machinery”, referring to the letter to the Prime Minister Office by the contractors’ association accusing ministers and officials of demanding 40% kickbacks. The party raised the issue in the legislative council and staged a brief protest after the government denied the allegations and sought evidence to substantiate the claims. In the assembly, the issue did not even come up for discussion. The party had given a notice to seek debate under the adjournment motion, but it was not taken up. On the last day, Siddaramaiah reminded the chair about the notice but left it at that. According to sources, the reason Congress went slow on the issue was the apprehension that the kickback allegation would boomerang on them. Two Congress functionaries, MA Saleem and VS Ugrappa, were recently caught on camera badmouthing Shivakumar and speaking about his alleged involvement in corruption when he was a minister in the Siddaramaiah and HD Kumaraswamy-led JD(S)-Congress coalition governments. Both Saleem and Ugrappa were in a private conversation minutes before a press conference. As far as the bitcoin scam is concerned, the party had no material or evidence to prove the involvement of officials or ruling party members. There was also speculation about the involvement of some Congress functionaries. Congress MLC PR Ramesh, however, cited lack of time as the reason. “The session was only for 10 days and there were a lot of issues to be debated. That is the reason we demanded extension of the session, but the government did not agree. In the next session, we will raise these issues,” he said. Another Congress functionary claimed it was part of a plan. “If the debate had taken place and the government had given its reply, the issue would have died down. We want to keep it alive till the elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cong-fails-to-put-bjp-on-mat-over-kickback-charges-bitcoin-scam/articleshow/88498103.cms||---

While four of them had international travel history, two arrived in Bengaluru from Delhi and another was a contact of a UK-returned person. Among the new patients is a 15-year-old, who tested positive on arrival from the US on December 20. The person’s gender was not disclosed. All the seven cases were from Bengaluru. Of the seven, six were fully vaccinated, except for the teenager. Two Delhi returnees among those positiveThe newly infected included two men, aged 76 and 62, who had returned from Delhi. The 76-year-old, who had tested positive in Delhi on December 6 and was in home isolation, arrived in Bengaluru on December 3 and further developed symptoms of Covid. The 62-year-old came to Bengaluru on December 20 and is being treated in a private hospital. One of these primary contacts has tested positive. A 63-year-old man who had travelled from Zambia, a 21-year-old man who returned from the UK, and a 30-year-old woman who had travel history to the UAE are the others with international travel history. A 54-year-old man, who was a primary contact of a UK-returned person has also been found to be infected with Omicron. Health minister K Sudhakar said that all the primary and secondary contacts of the persons have been tracked, traced and tested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/7-omicron-cases-from-bluru-ktaka-total-38/articleshow/88498104.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Speculation of leadership change still haunting BJP in Karnataka||BENGALURU: With assembly polls just over a year away, political uncertainty and frequent talks on leadership change seem to be denting the image of the BJP in Karnataka. Speculation of a change of guard started soon after the defeat in the byelection to Hangal assembly constituency in Haveri, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s home district. It intensified after the MLC polls for 25 seats in which BJP managed to win 11, just one short of securing a simple majority in the council. The unexpected results triggered talks within the party that the leadership is unhappy with Bommai’s electoral performance and is looking for a new face. Three names—Shobha Karandlaje, Murugesh Nirani, and Aravind Bellad — were floated as his successor. Last July, when Bommai was chosen as successor to BS Yediyurappa, Union home minister Amit Shah had said the state BJP would go to polls in 2023 under the former’s leadership. But Yediyurappa, while ruling out leadership change, has been saying that the party would fight the assembly polls under a collective leadership. Last month, senior BJP leader and RDPR minister KS Eshwarappa, who was sharing the dais with industries minister Nirani, had declared that latter would become CM soon. But Bommai himself, literally, let the cat out of the bag during a speech at his constituency Shiggaon, where he turned emotional and said: “no post is permanent”, raising more suspicion over his tenure as the CM. Nirani, who was sharing the dais with Bommai at the same event, added fuel to fire, saying: “Bommai will sooner if not later will become a Union minister like his father (late SR Bommai).” Later, the speculation spread like wildfire with reports that Bommai, who is often spotted limping, would go abroad in January for a surgery of knee membrane tear and the change of guard would happen when he’s on sabbatical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/speculation-of-leadership-change-still-haunting-bjp/articleshow/88498106.cms||---

We do not tolerate but respect and accept all traditions and cherish diversity since the beginning of our civilisational journey,” he said on Saturday.Khan delivered the fourth Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture on ‘Religion, Culture and Secularism Debates’ at BMS Engineering College, marking the 97th birth anniversary of former prime minister Vajpayee. The first three memorial lectures were held in New Delhi and organised by India Foundation, an independent research centre.Khan said exclusivity was the hallmark of western societies until they faced a clash between the church and the state, which ushered in democracy and pluralism. “On the other hand, diversity is the natural law for India. We did not become diverse with the arrival of Semitic people. Christianity here is older than European Christianity because it reached here in the first century. Some people in Kerala believe that one mosque in the state was built two years before the death of the Prophet,” he said.He explained that secularism means “being respectful to diversity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/india-accepts-respects-all-traditions-says-kerala-guv/articleshow/88498108.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru students bag seats in dream universities; essays crucial this time||BENGALURU: Students from Bengaluru are racking up seats in top universities across the world, show results of the early decision (ED) placements of foreign universities. From Stanford to Brown and Johns Hopkins to Imperial College, London, they have been getting offers from various institutions. ED admissions are binding on students. Those opting for it cannot back out of the process once admitted into a university. Sachin Singh, a student of Inventure Academy, will be joining Stanford University next year. “I am still to decide on the major, but it will be an intersection of science, politics and literature. My interests are broad and that is why a school like Stanford is the right fit for me. They emphasise on interdisciplinary education. My willingness to explore science and humanities helped my application stand out,” said Singh. Counsellors point out that with the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores becoming optional, essays have received importance like never before. “In my essay, I wrote about how I like to write and how I developed the process of writing over time. On the personality front, I showed how fun and light-hearted I was. The university as a whole has an upbeat culture… The most important thing that many people miss is to be likable, rather than brag about one's achievements. Stanford is looking for flawed humans, people who are ready to own up their fallacies...,” Singh said. Honesty the best policyChhavi Nahata of Mallya Aditi International will major in English literature with creative writing or psychology as minor at Stanford. A Bharatanatyam and ballet dancer, Chhavi also sent a seven-minute video of her performances along with her essays. Being a writer, Chhavi enjoyed the 12 essays she had to pen for Stanford. “I tried to be as honest as possible,” she said about her essays, adding that the one she wrote for all the colleges she applied to was called Metaphors of Love, in which she compiled many instances of her life and connected those with love. Pratibha Pradeep, a student of Indus International, has made it to Johns Hopkins University for biomedical engineering. “While I loved physics, chemistry, maths and biology, I was never able to make up my mind on which subject to choose. Biomedical engineering was, in fact, a marriage of all these subjects,” said the 17-year-old. Pratibha said in her essay she combined her experience of growing up in India and the healthcare system here. “I wrote about my growing up and how a dengue outbreak had affected the communities. I linked that to my growing interest in diseases, recoveries and vaccinations and this led me to biomedical engineering, where various subjects are integrated to solve different problems...” Mallya Aditi International said their students have made it to Stanford, Brown, Duke, Imperial College and Georgetown varsities, among others. “Unlike the last cohort, where a large number of students aspired to join US universities, this time, we are also seeing an equal number for the UK. This, we want to believe, is because of the changing policies of both the countries and the proximity to home...,” said Kalai Selvi, head of school, Vidyashilp Academy. Among the 15 ED offers, one of the students has also completed her interview for Cambridge University, the results of which will be out by January. “While students choosing US universities are flexible with the courses they want to pursue, those applying to UK universities are very sure about their specialisations,” Selvi noted. Uma Ravitharan, head of senior school at Indus International, said: “SAT was made optional. So, the only true picture colleges could get of students was through their essays.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-students-bag-seats-in-dream-universities-essays-crucial-this-time/articleshow/88498109.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BMRCL accused of hiring unqualified, overage HR staff||BENGALURU: A former Namma Metro employee and whistleblower alleged that BMRCL has appointed several employees without qualification and experience in its HR department. “Many HR personnel were appointed without following the due recruitment procedure of notifying the posts in newspapers and without holding interviews. According to Metro’s cadre and recruitment rules, candidates should have postgraduate degree in any discipline or MBA (HR), MSW (HR), and have relevant years of HR experience either in government or PSUs,” the whistleblower said in a complaint to the BMRCL management. “BMRCL has made a series of HR appointments, especially of retired government officers, without the required postgraduate degree and HR experience,” the complaint read. “Many of them are BA/BSC graduates, retired from government departments such as revenue, finance, police and aged 65 and above. The BMRCL HR department has become a rehabilitation centre for retired and aged government employees without qualification and experience, who are enjoying perks, salary and government pension at the cost of the public exchequer,” the complainant added. STOI has a list of nine officials appointed and five of them are above the age of 65. However, BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said: “We always look for an experienced person in higher positions on contract basis and we extend people above 65 years only in cases where the person is essential to the organisation. In general, we are cutting down heavily on employees over 65. The officers mentioned have years of experience in the government and public sector.” Centre seeks report on employee attendance Meanwhile, the Centre has sought a report from BMRCL on complaints of irregularities in biometric attendance of employees. BMRCL employees’ union vice-president Suryanarayana Murthy had approached the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) in this regard. “Many employees are marking biometric attendance by tampering with the system. They are either reporting to duty late, leaving office early or taking leave. There should be a thorough investigation into this,” Murthy said, adding there were also irregularities in the appointment of entry-level workers. In a December 21 letter to the BMRCL managing director, MoHUA said: “The grievance may be examined and a suitable reply addressing the points raised may be sent to the petitioner under intimation to this ministry.” Parwez dismissed the allegations, saying Murthy is a “self-proclaimed union leader who does not get much lift in BMRCL”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmrcl-accused-of-hiring-unqualified-overage-hr-staff/articleshow/88498111.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Accused providing handwriting, signature samples not self-incrimination, says HC||Bengaluru: Directing an accused to provide handwriting and specimen signature will not amount to self-incrimination, the high court observed in a recent judgment. “It is a mode of technology used for collecting evidence and it is in the domain of the investigating officer to collect material in order to find the truth. Hence, the contention that it amounts to self-incrimination and is violative of Article 20(3) of the Constitution cannot be accepted,” justice HP Sandesh observed. Partly allowing a petition filed by Vinod Kumar, a resident of Chandrabanda village of Raichur, who is an accused in a cheating-cum-forgery case, the judge directed him to appear before the investigating officer on December 27 between 11am and 2pm. Simultaneously, a direction was issued to the officer to collect the specimen signature of the petitioner and his handwriting. Yapaladinni police had registered a case against Vinod Kumar for cheating and forgery offences in connection with misappropriation of money payable to farmers. The FIR was submitted to a trial court and the petitioner voluntarily surrendered before the III JMFC court, Raichur. On June 24, 2020, he was granted bail. On June 10 this year, the magistrate court allowed the application filed by the investigating officer for collection of specimen signature from Vinod Kumar. On August 25, the second additional district and sessions judge directed the investigating officer to take the specimen signature in the presence of his counsel. This order was passed in response to a criminal revision petition filed by Vinod Kumar challenging the magistrate’s order. He then moved the high court, contending that the orders of the magistrate and the sessions court violated Article 21 and 20(3) of the Constitution and both courts had directed him to provide specimen signature and handwriting without properly understanding the provisions of section 311A of CrPC. His argument was that such proof can be obtained only if an accused gets arrested. On the other hand, the HC government pleader argued that money released in favour of farmers was misappropriated by the petitioner by creating documents and forging signatures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/accused-providing-handwriting-signature-samples-not-self-incrimination-says-hc/articleshow/88498113.cms||---

The increase was more than 300% since the pre-pandemic year of 2019, which saw 1,260 arrests. The value of seized banned substances — ganja, brown sugar, opium, hashish, hashish oil, synthetic drugs (cocaine and others), MDMA & MDs, ecstasy, yaba and LSD paper — saw an increase of almost 149%, up from around Rs 21 crore in 2020 to over Rs 53 crore in 2021. Compared to 2019 (Rs 3.5 crore), the jump was over 1,400%. In these three years, police arrested more than 10,000 people in 7,651 cases involving nearly 8,500kg of drugs. According to official data, cops arrested 1,260 people and seized 1,053kg of drugs in 768 cases reported in 2019. In 2020, they nabbed 3,673 and seized 3,912kg of drugs in 2,766 cases, while in 2021, they apprehended 5,208 people and seized 3,512kg of the contraband in 4,117 cases registered till December 14. Sources said the actual quantity of drugs seized so far this year is 400kg lower than the quantum in 2020, but their value is considerably higher with more high-priced items such as synthetic drugs and MDMA being seized. As per police data, there were no cases involving hashish oil in 2019. But there were four in 2020 with 9.3kg of the oil worth Rs 1.5 crore seized, while in 2021, 14 cases were registered and nearly 42kg worth over Rs 13 crore seized. Catching customers first “We have given top priority to curbing drug menace in the city. We’ve adopted the policy of nabbing consumers first and using information provided by them to get to the sellers. It helps us catch more drug peddlers,” Kamal Pant, police commissioner, said. According to an officer from the narcotics wing of Central Crime Branch, peddlers purchase drugs using the darknet and get them delivered through courier, while the payment is done through cryptocurrency transactions. The sellers pack drugs in food covers and supply them to customers in the disguise of food-delivery boys. In 2020, a few high-profile cases were reported, including a case in Cottonpet police station in which actresses, event organisers and politicians’ relatives were arrested. The alleged hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki and his gang were among those nabbed in 2020 on drug-peddling charges.

The plan should provide details of the locality and time required for relocating the transformers in a phased manner, the court has said.While fixing February 4, 2022 as the next date of hearing on the PIL — when the said action plan is required to be submitted — a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi emphasised that work on shifting of transformers should begin even before the next hearing.The court was informed that both Bescom and BBMP have constituted a high-level committee to identify the transformers which are required to be shifted and a detailed report has been prepared.According to the report, 5,245 transformers are identified to be shifted, which will take considerable time. Two agencies have been chosen and work orders will be issued soon, the court was told. The report also said 2,641 transformers cannot be shifted.The court is hearing a PIL filed last year by retired wing commander GB Athri, in which he has claimed that these electrical installations on roads/footpaths not only pose grave danger to human lives but also amount to rights violations and has sought for their removal as well as relocation within a time schedule. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-seeks-action-plan-on-shifting-5245-roadside-transformers/articleshow/88498116.cms||---

Traffic police said: “Urgent work needed to be carried out between pillar number 102 and 103 of the Peenya elevated highway (Dr Shivakumara Swamiji Flyover).” Officials from National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) visited the spot in the morning and closed the flyover for vehicle movement. Unaware, most regular commuters were forced to take diversions and use other adjacent roads, which saw traffic pile up for several minutes at multiple times in the day. Traffic police said the repair work will continue for another week and have advised vehicle users to take NICE Road to minimise traffic on Tumakuru national highway. “Vehicles moving towards Tumakuru should take a left turn at Goraguntepalya junction and enter NICE Road to get out of the city. Those coming from Tumakuru to the city should take a right at Madavara to enter NICE Road,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/repair-peenya-flyover-shut-for-a-week/articleshow/88498117.cms||---

Police seized 4.1kg of ambergris, estimated to be worth more than Rs 4 crore. Among the arrested, Panneerselvam, 30, and Ananda Sekhara, 45, are from Tamil Nadu, while Manju K, 40, is from Mysuru. Police said ambergris has high value in the international market. “Ambergris is produced in the gastrointestinal tract of sperm whales to ease the passage of hard and sharp objects swallowed by them. The sale of ambergris is prohibited in India as sperm whale was declared an endangered species in 1970 and is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act. It is used in manufacturing perfumes and other products,” police said. Cops added that information that the trio would sell ambergris on Lake Road around 9am on Wednesday helped them nab the men. A team headed by inspector RS Choudhari rushed to the spot and detained the suspects, who have since revealed they were hired by a person in Coimbatore to transport ambergris to Bengaluru and sell it here. Police have registered a criminal case under provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/three-arrested-for-trying-to-sell-ambergris-worth-over-4-crore/articleshow/88498119.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Whitetopping begins on Commercial Street||BENGALURU: Bengaluru Smart City Ltd (BenSCL), which has been working on redeveloping Commercial Street, has now decided to whitetop the 750m stretch. Work on this began on Friday. Some traders said this would affect their Christmas and New Year sales after they have already had to endure two pandemic years. Mayank Rohatgi, secretary, Bengaluru Commercial Association, said if whitetopping was all BenSCL wanted to do, it could have been done long ago without taking up about 18 months. “And, this is the one week of the year when our sales are high. That is also being affected now,” he told STOI. But Sanjay Motwani, president of the association, said there will be tests while trying anything new. “It is in no one’s interest to delay the project. A street so busy is open to massive movement of vehicles and pedestrians and then there are technical challenges in carrying out works,” he said. “There is some infrastructural inconvenience, but they (traders) need to bear with it for their betterment.” “There were two options before us — relay the cobblestones or finish the road work in a month through whitetopping. On consulting the traders and technical team in the government, we decided to whitetop the stretch,” said P Rajendra Cholan, managing director of Bengaluru Smart City Limited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/whitetopping-begins-on-commercial-street/articleshow/88498120.cms||---

The move comes close on the heels of KMF officials in Mysuru busting a racket involving repacking of Nandini ghee manufactured by the federation. According to KMF officials, in a special raid by a team of experts, suspected adulterated ghee sold under the Nandini brand in shops and warehouses across Bengaluru was seized. After officials found suspected fake ghee in retail stores in Jayanagar, Srinagar, and two warehouses in Hoskote and Maakali, it was revealed that most of the products had arrived from Mysuru. Now, KMF plans to introduce QR codes or holograms on ghee packets/bottles to enable end-to-end product tracking. It will also track delivery vehicles and make its drivers responsible for handing over the products that leave its facilities. New packaging and design is also planned to protect consumers from counterfeit products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kmf-to-adopt-new-tech-to-counter-fake-products/articleshow/88498121.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Metro in suburbs on fast-track||CHENNAI: The southern and western suburbs in the city, including a portion of OMR and Porur IT hub, may get metro connectivity first in the 118.9km phase-2 project. The stretch from Power House in Kodambakkam to Poonamallee on corridor 4 and CMBT to Sholinganallur via Madipakkam and Perumbakkam on corridor 5 and Sholinganallur to Nehru Nagar on corridor-3 covering nearly 54km are likely to get ready first as they are elevated and can be built faster, officials said. “We have set a 2025 deadline for Power House to Poonamallee stretch (corridor 4). In a few months, other elevated stretches will also be ready. We are pushing for the deadline, but it depends on the contractor,” an official said.  Work is going on briskly in Porur where the median space of stretches of Mount-Poonamallee road has been barricaded and concrete work is underway near the lake and the medical college. Pillars have been erected throughout the stretch. Once ready, a prefabricated viaduct will be hoisted and installed.  As of now, the plan is to operate this circular stretch with driverless trains parked at the Poonamallee depot. The trains originating from the depot can switch from corridor 4 to corridor 5 in the double-decker five and interchange stations between Alwarthirunagar and Porur Junction. From corridor-5, the trains can reach Sholinganallur and switch to corridor-3 up to Nehru Nagar on OMR. This entire circular stretch will be linked to phase-1 corridors at CMBT, Alandur, and St Thomas Mount.  The built stretch will link the Porur IT hub with the one in OMR via southern suburban localities. It will also connect localities which have poor public transport services. “Similarly, from Madhavaram Milk Colony, one side is partly elevated, and the other side is partly underground when the line nears Kolathur. We want to finish the elevated corridor faster. Underground stretches will take time,” the official added.  Officials said tunnel boring machine will arrive in 2022 and the work may start in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/metro-in-suburbs-on-fast-track/articleshow/88498123.cms||U Tejonmayam

This led to confusion among doctors as the corporation’s directions were different from the ones laid out by the Directorate of Public Health, under which mild cases could be home quarantined. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi clarified that there was a miscommunication from the side of zone-level officials and the circular was not accurate. The civic body later released a revised circular that said Covid-19 patients should be preferably treated at hospitals and if they are to be home-quarantined for inevitable reasons, the same must be informed to the civic body through email.  All the private hospitals have been asked to send the details of patients with Covid-19 like symptoms daily to gccpvthospitalreports@chennaicorporation.gov.in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gcc-withdraws-contentious-covid-circular/articleshow/88498125.cms||---

The husband, Akbar Batcha, has been admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for treatment of injuries he suffered on Thursday night when two men hired by his wife Nagavalli alias Yasmin Banu, 25, attacked him when he was on his way home around 10.30 pm after closng his mobile repair shop in China Bazaar.

---||Chennai||Racket offering fake AICTE jobs in Tamil Nadu busted||CHENNAI: The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has busted a major job racket in the state where scamsters targeted unemployed youngsters from the rural villages. Working till the last minute detail, the gang went on a fake hiring spree in the technical council for non-existent positions such as state coordinator, head inspection officer, and even taluk coordinators. The scam came to light when AICTE received calls inquiring about the vacancies. The racket was meticulously planned with scamsters conducting exams and selecting only those who scored above 50% marks for ppointment. They even came up with separate dress codes for male and female candidates at the exam centres along with mandatory trimmed fingernails and clean shave appearance for the physical interviews conducted in star hotels. The AICTE southern regional office came to know about the scam when some candidates cross-checked with the council about the vacancies. "It was ascertained from the phone calls that the recruitment process is being done confidentially and the interviews are being conducted in star hotels. They are using AICTE's logo and asking for the bank details of candidates. Around 18 people have been recruited," M Sundaresan, regional officer of AICTE, said in his complaint. The racketeers are mainly targeting youth in Thiruvannamalai, Vellore, Kanchipuram, Salem, Madurai and Coimbatore districts. Talking to TOI, Sundaresan said, AICTE has not advertised for recruitment for any post. "There are only 13 sanctioned posts in the AICTE's southern regional office. But the scamsters are recruiting 18 people in every district," he added. The racketeers are planning to start another interview round on Sunday. Those selected said their bank details were collected. Officials feared there is a possibility of fraudsters taking money from the selected candidates and police should immediately stop them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/racket-offeringfake-aicte-jobsin-state-busted/articleshow/88498129.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Chennai||Chennai: Panchayat office SWD awash in sewage||CHENNAI: The Medavakkam panchayat in the city suburbs is allowing tanker lorries to let out raw sewage into the storm water drain in its compound, say residents. A hole drilled in the compound wall to allow pipes to let out the sewage is covered by cardboard slabs to hide the act, they complain. “This has been happening since 2019,” said a resident, who first caught the illegality, on a condition of anonymity. Visuals shared by the resident showed a tanker parked along Mambakkam-Medavakkam Road letting out sewage into the compound. As the drains from Medavakkam connect to the Perumbakkam lake, this pollutes the water body, kills the aquatic life and also deprives residents of a pure drinking water source. “We have complained for two years. After the complaints, they stop it. But it soon resumes,” said civic activist David Manohar, who has raised the issue with officials in the past. “They do not bother to take action,” he said. The National Green Tribunal has on many occasions come down heavily on government bodies for allowing open dumping of sewage, but such acts continues unabated. While a few tankers are caught by officials, they are let off with a nominal fine, say activists and residents. No FIR has been filed till now. “The issue will be solved only if mini-pumping stations are expanded to many areas. Officials too are not going towards a solution,” said activist Pughalventhan V, whose complaints on the illegality have been taken cognizance by officials on various occasions. The pumping station nearest to Medavakkam is in Pallaikaranai, four km away, and tankers prefer to dump it illegally, he added. “This must no more be looked as a singular problem of just arresting the lorry driver but the government needs to put a solution to it," he said. Medavakkam panchayat officials said they were not aware of the act and said the driver could’ve illegally done it. “We will check,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/panchayat-office-swd-awash-in-sewage/articleshow/88498130.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu hold the aces in final||Chennai: Formidable Tamil Nadu will start as overwhelming favourites against rank outsiders Himachal Pradesh, eyeing their maiden title, when the two teams lock horns in the Vijay Hazare Trophy summit clash here on Sunday. The two teams made it to the final in a contrasting manner. While Himachal stormed into the final crushing Services by 77 runs, Tamil Nadu won a last ball thriller to knock out Saurashtra by two wickets. Having commenced the season by clinching the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Tamil Nadu would be eyeing their second crown. Despite his side having the tag of the favorites, Tamil Nadu coach M Venkataramana doesn’t want his side to take it easy. “Complacency is not something we would want. Himachal are a quality side that have made the final on merit. We expect a tough fight and hope we are able to execute our plans well,” Venkataramana told TOI on the eve of the clash. Tamil Nadu immensely benefited with the return of Baba Aparajith --- after featuring in India A's tour of South Africa --- as the right-hander had a major role to play in the victory against Saurashtra. His opening partner N Jagadeesan too has been in good nick, having hammered a ton against Karnataka and would be keen to put the failure in the semi-final behind and get among the runs.A line-up which includes Aparajith’s twin brother Baba Indrajith, skipper Vijay Shankar, the seasoned Dinesh Karthik combined with the finishing firepower of M Shahrukh Khan and M S Washington Sundar gives Tamil Nadu’s batting a formidable look. And, Himachal's rather inexperienced attack would need to be at their best if they hope to stop the TN juggernaut from running away with the game.Washington, on a comeback trail since being injured during the England tour, would take a lot of confidence from his superb knock of 70 in the semi-final, which played a key role in the team's win. Shahrukh with his power-hitting abilities, can change the complexion of the game in a jiffy and could probably be the difference between the two sides.TN’s troika of spinners- Sai Kishore, M Siddharth and Washington can be more than a handful for the Himachal batters. However, they would have to pull up their socks after the hammering received at the hands of Sheldon Jackson and company on Friday. Pacers Sandeep Warrier and R Silambarasan have more often than not struck early blows and this is something the Himachal team would be wary about.For Himachal, which has punched above its weight, skipper Rishi Dhawan would hold the key, with both the bat and ball. He would need to lead from the front if his team has to win its maiden Hazare Trophy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-hold-the-aces-in-final/articleshow/88498133.cms||---

It includes a 20.6 acre land parcel, which is the surplus course of Kosasthalaiyar River at Vallur in the northern suburbs belonging to a temple in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, which was being considered for a residential layout.The decision was based on revenue department records and litho maps, wherein these land parcels seeking reclassification were mentioned as water bodies in the second master plan of the CMDA, as well. While 3.8 acres of land at Ayapakkam in the western suburbs that is part of a tank as per official documents was applied for reclassification, CMDA sources said seven applicants have sought reclassification for houses built over an area of 0.4 acres in ‘Periya eri’ (tank) at Pallavaram. Official sources with the CMDA said the technical committee of the planning authority had concluded that these land parcels were water bodies, which was discusssed at the meeting on Thursday.Though the applicants have the option to appeal their rejection with the state’s housing and urban development department, urban planners say the appeals could be rejected since the officials who were members of the CMDA Authority meeting will be part of the review panel. K P Subramanian, former professor of urban engineering, Anna University, said the housing and urban development department minister and secretary are the chairman and vice-chairman of the CMDA that rejected the applications. “Even if the applicants prefer an appeal, it wouldn’t fructify. It is crucial to thwart any attempts for unauthorised developments,” he said. Chennai: Amid criticism over conversion of water bodies into plots for real estate, which is one of the major reasons for the city and suburbs getting flooded during monsoon, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has rejected three applications seeking reclassification of water bodies extending for an area of 25 acres.At a meeting on Thursday, the CMDA refused to give its nod for converting portions of water bodies for residential layouts.

The ED officials stumbled upon the fraud in Chennai Port Trust (CPT) and attached around 47 properties of the suspects who had swindled about 45.4 crore to a fake current account in the name of CPT by submitting false fixed deposit receipts. They retained the original fixed deposit receipts they had fraudulently liquidated after the opening of fake fixed account. Around 15.25 crore was withdrawn by cash by impersonating a deputy director of finance of CPT. The remaining amount of around 31.65 crore was transferred to many bank accounts through more than 49 transactions. Soon after transferring the money it was withdrawn from those accounts by luring gullible account holders in lieu of a small commission. The suspects used the money to purchase more than 230 acres of land in Chennai suburbs and a few other tier-2 cities in the state, apart from gold, luxury cars and deposit in bank accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-port-trust-fraud-ed-attaches-45crworth-assets/articleshow/88498137.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Think about anti-conversion bill with open mind: Araga||Mangaluru: Home minister Araga Jnanendra said politicians need to think about the Karnataka Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, 2021, commonly referred to as the anti-conversion bill, with an open mind. “The bill was passed in the assembly and now we need to think about it with an open mind. Our nation’s religious and cultural frameworks teach us to love all religions. However, such a ‘tree of love’ is under attack by termites in the form of conversion. This needs to be checked to maintain harmony. In 1947, the nation was divided on the basis of religion, not secularism. Each village will be divided in future if politicians do not think about it (the bill),” the home minister told reporters, on arriving at Mangaluru International Airport on Saturday. The minister was on his way to attend a cooperative bank’s programme in Puttur and visit Madhur Sree Madanantheshwara-Siddhivinayaka Temple in Kasaragod. “Only BJP could abrogate Article 370 in Kashmir and Congress could not do it since they believe in vote bank politics. How can those who depend on the vote bank of a community do this? We cannot do anything when politicians are worried only about power and their prosperity, instead of thinking about the future of the nation,” he said. To a query on communal clashes reported in Uppinangady in Puttur taluk recently, the minister said “Our police have brought the situation under control effectively. They waited patiently without reacting till they were attacked. They did not want a clash with civilians. Our police know how to tackle miscreants who take the law into their hands,” he said, justifying the lathicharge incident. On Maoist leaders from the state surrendering and the relevance of an Anti-Naxal Force, the minister said, “We cannot stop the anti-Naxal activities suddenly. We will have to wait till the number of Maoists in the state reaches zero. Many Maoist leaders have surrendered, and they are in the mainstream of society now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/think-about-anti-conversion-bill-with-open-mind-araga/articleshow/88496102.cms||---
---||Patna||Traffic cops equipped with body-worn cameras||PATNA: The state’s traffic police are now equipped with body-worn cameras that can be monitored remotely, as well as shot radar guns and interceptor vehicles. The cameras can capture images and interactions between the traffic personnel and the public while conducting routine vehicle inspections and issuing ‘challans’ to the violators. M R Naik, the inspector general (IG) of traffic, told this reporter on Saturday that 33 pieces of body-worn cameras had already been procured. Initially, 12 districts, including Patna, Nalanda, Chhapra, Bhojpur, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Begusarai, Munger, Bhagalpur, Katihar, and Purnia, were equipped with these cameras. Their use began on Friday in most locations. “We frequently receive complaints about traffic police harassing people or illegally obtaining money from them, as well as public misbehaviour after they are discovered driving vehicles without proper documentation. In any of these circumstances, the audio-visual recording by the cameras will establish the fact,” Naik explained. He added, “These cameras will instil a sense of responsibility in both the public and the traffic police and ensure that their interactions are appropriate.” Besides, interceptor vehicles have also been acquired to enforce traffic rules and prevent road crimes. Naik stated that 17 of these vehicles had already arrived and were awaiting registration with the transport department before being allowed to operate on the roads. “Five of them will be assigned to the Patna traffic police and the remaining 12 to districts with high traffic volumes,” he said, adding that the vehicles would be extremely beneficial in congested areas such as Patna in terms of intercepting cars, violators of traffic rules, and those fleeing after committing crimes. The traffic IG also laid emphasis on the use of speed radar guns that have already been made available in different districts. According to sources, the procurement of new gadgets is underway as part of the police modernisation plan, and more body-worn cameras and interceptor vehicles are expected to arrive soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/traffic-cops-equipped-with-body-worn-cameras/articleshow/88496418.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Railways likely to issue ‘yatra cards’ to local commuters||PATNA: The railways is likely to give a New Year’s gift to local commuters who travel on various routes under the East Central Railway’s (ECR) jurisdiction. It has proposed providing them with a ‘yatra card’ along the lines of Metro rail services, to alleviate the burden of standing in long queues at counters to obtain unreserved tickets. According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the railways has decided to install advanced automatic ticket vending machines (ATVMs) in the first phase at the Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patliputra Junction, and Danapur station. At least six ATVMs have been acquired for the Patna Junction alone and one each for the remaining stations. “The signalling and telecommunications and electrical departments are currently working on the process of installing the necessary data and information about the stations and the fares that will be charged from each passenger. The installation of these machines will enable passengers to obtain unreserved tickets without standing in long queues at the UTS counters,” the CPRO told this reporter, adding that passengers may be issued a ‘yatra card’ which they can easily recharge when their balance money runs out. Kumar continued, “The daily influx of passengers at the Patna Junction has been phenomenal. Thousands of people commute daily to the Patna Junction from Buxar, Ara, Bihta, Danapur, Jehanabad, Gaya, Barh, Mokama, and Rajgir. Thus, the ‘yarta card’ facility will benefit them by relieving them of the daily hassle of procuring their tickets from counters.” The railways also plans to implement this system at all major ECR stations in the long run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railways-likely-to-issue-yatra-cards-to-local-commuters/articleshow/88496357.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Patna||Teachers seek restoration of old calendar of holidays||PATNA: Teachers at universities and colleges in Bihar have expressed strong opposition to the recent reduction of Christmas holidays in the Raj Bhavan’s list of holidays for the year 2022 and demanded their immediate restoration. Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, the working president of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar, and Sanjay Kumar Singh, its general secretary, told this reporter on Saturday, “Since independence, university teachers have enjoyed eight to 10 days of Christmas vacation, which has been reduced to just two days.” They pointed out that prior to the implementation of the sixth revised pay scale, university teachers were entitled to 90 days of vacation per year, which included summer, Durga Puja, and winter vacations in addition to gazetted holidays. They had to forego 30 days of earned leave (EL) in order to take these vacations, as they were only entitled to three days of EL. Previously, non-teaching staff received 33 days of EL per year. When the sixth revised pay scale for teachers was announced, the University Grants Commission (UGC) increased the EL from three to 12 days. As a result, the state government drastically reduced teachers’ vacation time. Summer vacation was reduced to 30 days, and Puja vacation was eliminated entirely, leaving only gazetted holidays for government employees. Christmas was included in the teachers’ entitled vacation and granted even in the 2021 calendar, but it is not included in the 2022 calendar. Following an increase in the number of ELs, the UGC permitted colleges and universities to grant teachers a 10-week or 70-day vacation in addition to the gazetted holidays during a given academic calendar. “This standard is followed in all universities in the country, with the exception of those in Bihar. Teachers at Delhi University, for example, enjoy 55 days of summer vacation and 15 days of winter vacation, but teachers in Bihar receive only a monthlong summer vacation,” they said, demanding the restoration of the previous calendar of university holidays in the larger interest of higher education in a memorandum submitted to the chancellor on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/teachers-seek-restoration-of-old-calendar-of-holidays/articleshow/88496320.cms||B K Mishra

Locals said apart from paddy, the elephants also damaged banana, maize, sugarcane and horticulture crops. Farmers across parts of Vizianagaram district said the elephants move in search of food and water and destroy standing crops when they pass through the villages. They also alleged that they have received little compensation from the government when compared to the crop loss. Officials of the forest department have been mulling creating an emergency elephant holding facility in Vizianagaram to mitigate the jumbo menace in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.

---||Patna||Rs 1.5cr DA amassed by stenographer posted at Vaishali SP’s office unearthed||PATNA: Sleuths of the Vigilance Investigation Bureau (VIB) on Saturday raided the house of Anil Prasad, stenographer in the rank of sub-inspector in public grievance cell of Vaishali SP office, at Tejpratap Nagar under the Beur police station area in Patna and unearthed disproportionate assets (DA) worth more than Rs 1.55 crore amassed by him. Another special team raided his rented accommodation in Hajipur’s SDO Road. Sources said the VIB had registered a DA case against Prasad on Friday under relevant sections of Provident Funds Act, 1988 (amended 2018), after a preliminary inquiry. The special vigilance court, Muzaffarpur, had issued the search warrant on Saturday, following which the raids were conducted for several hours by two separate teams. According to sources, two buildings – a five-storey and a three-storey – constructed on 5,000sq feet of land at Tejpratap Nagar were searched by the special team. “The team recovered gold and silver jewellery worth at least Rs 5.5 lakh and immovable property (six land deeds) worth around Rs 1.5 crore. Apart from this, two deeds valued at more than Rs 10 lakh were mortgaged in the bank. The vigilance sleuths also seized the passbooks of 17 banks and five debit cards from Prasad’s residence. Documents related to investments in Bajaj Allianz and ICICI were also recovered. “We have seized all the papers. The probe against Prasad will continue,” vigilance sources said. The market value of his movable and immovable assets is wroth Rs 5 crore. “Prasad, who had joined service in 1985, misused his position to earn excessive wealth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-1-5cr-da-amassed-by-stenographer-posted-at-vaishali-sps-office-unearthed/articleshow/88496486.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Hubballi||Foresters propose building a zipline at Nrupatunga Betta||Hubballi: In a bid to add a slice of adventure to life in the twin cities, the forest department is contemplating the development of a zipline at Nrupatunga Betta. The zipline will stretch across 400m, and is estimated cost a sum of Rs 50 lakh. Officials of the forest department in Dharwad department have already drafted a proposal for the development of the pipeline at Nrupatunga Betta, one of the favourite weekend haunts among residents of the twin cities, and are expected to submit it to the government soon. Two private firms – one each from Mysuru and Pune – have already conducted a survey of Nrupatunga Betta, and both have expressed an interest in setting up the zipline. The forest department is expected to start inviting tenders once the government greenlights the project. The zipline from the summit of the hill to its foot is expected to be drawn at a height of 30ft or 40ft from the ground. While the zipline was once used for the transport of goods in hill stations, riding on the zipline is now an adventure sport for young and old alike. The forest department has already constructed a 400-metre zipline at Saalumarada Thimmakka Garden at Binkadakatti in Kappatagudda forest in Gadag. This is the solitary zipline in the whole of North Karnataka. The forest department is eager to add to this zipline by developing one at Nrupatunga Betta. A forest department official said that personnel will be trained to operate and maintain the zipline. The zipline at Kappatagudda in Gadag attracts youngsters from across North Karnataka, and the foresters hope that, once installed at Nrupatunga Betta in Hubballi, the zipline will prove as big an attraction. Deputy conservator of forests Yashpal Kshirsagar confirmed to TOI that a proposal for the development of a zipline at Nrupatunga Betta had been drafted. “Once the government gives its nod, we will start construction without delay.

Jaiswal said Bihar was the second state after Uttar Pradesh whose share in the central pool of taxes had been maximized. He was talking to media persons on the sidelines of the birth anniversary celebration of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the state BJP headquarters. Vajpayee’s statue made by sculptor Sharad from Patna was also unveiled on the occasion. “Even as the population of Maharashtra is more than that of Bihar, the increase in the share of the former was only 6% against Bihar’s 10%,” he said, adding if any other Finance Commission recommended the grant of special category status in the future, it could be considered for Bihar. On the observation of the NITI Aayog that Bihar had lagged behind in terms of household economy and other developmental activities compared to other states, Jaiswal said it could not be the basis for demanding the special status for Bihar, since the NITI Aayog does not assess the backwardness of a state historically. “It only gives its assessment of the outcome of the ongoing development activities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-doesnt-need-spl-status-reiterates-state-bjp-president/articleshow/88496488.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Patna||Four-member central team to reach Bihar today to assess Covid situation||PATNA: A four-member central team will visit Bihar on Sunday to assess the current situation regarding Covid-19 infections and preparations to combat the Omicron threat. Health minister Mangal Pandey told this reporter on Saturday that the team would stay here for three to four days and focus on contact tracing, including surveillance and containment operations, and Covid-19 testing. “The Centre has been requesting all necessary information from the state government regarding the spread and control of Covid-19 infections, and the deployment of a central team is a step in that direction. Even though the number of positive cases in Bihar is not alarming, necessary preparations are required in light of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant across the country,” the minister added. The Centre has decided to deploy such teams in 10 selected states, including Bihar and Jharkhand. Several of these are reporting an increase in Omicron and Covid-19 cases or a slow vaccination rate. According to sources, the central team is expected to assist the state and the district administration with Covid-19 management efforts. It will collaborate with health officials and examine the enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour, the availability of hospital beds, adequate logistics, such as ambulances, ventilators, and medical oxygen, and the progress of the vaccination drive. The team will also assess the situation, recommend corrective measures, and submit a report on public health activities being carried out each evening by 7pm, in addition to reporting to the state government. Meanwhile, the state health department has already advised all health officials and public hospitals to remain vigilant and prepared for any eventuality in light of the Omicron threat. The department’s additional chief secretary has formed a six-member team to monitor testing, contact tracing, isolation, and treatment of coronavirus-infected individuals on a continuous basis. The officials of the World Health Organization and the UNICEF have also been tasked with monitoring and surveillance responsibilities. “The health department reviewed the situation at a meeting on Friday and decided to intensify its monitoring and surveillance efforts throughout the state, in addition to ensuring that necessary facilities are available in all hospitals and health centres,” joint secretary Kaushal Kishore said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-member-central-team-to-reach-bihar-today-to-assess-covid-situation/articleshow/88496434.cms||B K Mishra

The government ensured that the maiden visit of Justice Ramana to the capital region after he became CJI was a grand event. The banners praising Justice Ramana for reaching the highest position of judiciary were everywhere in the city, especially on the roads leading to Siddhartha Institute where he received the lifetime achievement award by Rotary Club, Indira Gandhi municipal stadium where the chief minister hosted high tea in his honour, Kanaka Durga temple, and Novotel hotel. The banners described the CJi as ‘Telugu pride’, who hailed from a humble family to reach the highest position in judiciary. Most banners contained pictures of only Justice Ramana and chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy. — Srikanth Aluri||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/banners-greet-cji-on-vijayawada-visit/articleshow/88496539.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Delhi||Study: Plasma Therapy Effective At Early Stage||New Delhi: Days after the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended against the use of plasma therapy for Covid-19, a multi-centre clinical trial led by Johns Hopkins Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has reiterated the treatment is beneficial indeed. The trial findings conducted in the US have been posted on the preprint website MedRxiv. It claims that administering convalescent plasma at early stages reduces the risk of hospitalisation by half for outpatients with Covid-19. In Delhi, several hospitals had set up infrastructure to collect plasma from convalescent patients — those who have recovered from the disease and whose blood contains antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 – during the second wave. However, doctors said plasma collection was more or less discontinued due to contradictory reports on its efficacy. Dr S K Sarin, the vice-chancellor of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), which housed one such plasma bank, said they collected close to 7,500 units of plasma used in many patients during the second wave. “Right now, we aren’t collecting it for two reasons: First, there isn’t much demand for convalescent plasma and second, because the use of plasma therapy is discouraged due to contradictory reports on its efficacy,” he said. However, Dr Sarin said the new trial result might give it a new lease of life. The Johns Hopkins-led trial was conducted on 1,181 outpatients between June 2020 and October 2021. The researchers provided all participants with one dose each of either polyclonal high-titer convalescent plasma (containing a concentrated mixture of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2) or placebo control plasma (with no SARS-CoV-2 antibodies). The patients were 18 and older and had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within eight days before the transfusion, according to a news release posted by Johns Hopkins. It adds that the study found that 17 patients out of 592 (2.9%) who received the convalescent plasma required hospitalisation within 28 days of their transfusion, while 37 out of 589 (6.3%) who received placebo control plasma did. This translated to a relative risk reduction for hospitalisation of 54%. “The changing, often unpredictable landscape of the Covid-19 pandemic demands multiple treatment options — especially in low and middle-income nations where frontline therapies like vaccines and monoclonal antibodies may not be readily available. Our study provides solid evidence that antibody-rich convalescent plasma should be part of the outpatient arsenal,” said study co-lead author David Sullivan, MD, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Sullivan has a joint appointment in infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/study-plasma-therapy-effective-at-early-stage/articleshow/88497735.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The Amboli police on Thursday arrested Shahapur-based businessman Suraj Mohan Pardeshi (38) and his accomplice, and are still looking for three more persons in the case. Cops have booked the gang of five or six persons under IPC sections for impersonation, abetment of suicide, extortion, extortion by threats, as well as section 120-B relating to criminal conspiracy. On December 23, a 25-year-old woman Saniya (name changed) was found hanging in her flat in the western suburbs. The woman hails from a well-to-do family, which said there was no reason for her to end her life. During investigations, Saniya’s friend approached the police and submitted a series of voice notes from her. In the voice notes, the deceased is heard saying the accused, Pardeshi, Aasir Kazi, Nofel Rohe and two unidentified persons were harassing and blackmailing her. “She said that on December 20, she and her friend had gone to to party at a five-star hotel in the western suburbs when suddenly Pardeshi, who was known to them, called her and said they should leave the hotel immediately as the ‘NCB’ had busted an escort service racket in the hotel and she was under the scanner. Saniya and her friend returned home, but since then, the gang members had been calling on her mobile with threats,’’ said an officer. In one of the voice notes, the deceased said that she had already paid Rs12 lakh to the gang, but they were blackmailing her further. Saniya’s friend told the police that she was a happy-go-lucky person living a peaceful life until her visit to the hotel. The friend said that the deceased was shaken, and may have been driven to suicide due to mental torture by the gang. Cops said they have collected enough material to suggest the gang extorted money from the deceased and harassed her to the extent that she ended her life. The police said they are trying to find out how the accused came in contact with the deceased and whether they have similarly extorted money from other women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-dies-by-suicide-after-blackmail-over-escort-service/articleshow/88497304.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Ahmedabad||From 1,851 Covid cases in 82 days to 1,855 in 30 days in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: It is time to stop being complacent about Covid. December is proving to be a turning point in Gujarat’s battle against Covid. As many as 1,707 cases were recorded in the first 25 days of the month — nearly double the 898 cases registered in November. What’s more, the state recorded 1,855 cases in the past 30 days. This is higher than the 1,851 cases recorded in almost three months (82 days) prior to that. Saturday recorded a major spike in daily cases at 179 – the highest in 188 days. For Ahmedabad, the tally of 61 was a 186-day high. The active cases also zoomed past 800 to 837 – the highest in 187 days. What is worrisome is that Gujarat’s mortality rate has also gone up in December – 21 patients have died in these 25 days – the highest in the past six months. In comparison, 17 deaths were recorded in July, 5 in August, 1 in September, 7 in October, and 3 in November. “Analysis of daily cases reveal that they largely centred around municipal corporation areas. In the past 30 days, 70.6% of the total cases were recorded in cities like Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara. Ahmedabad alone accounted for 28% of total cases, followed by 14% in Vadodara and 13% in Surat,” said an epidemiologist from Ahmedabad. He added that the three cities recorded 55%, more than half the state’s total cases. Revealing a ray of hope, Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that hospitalisation has remained relatively lower. “Against 200-plus active cases in Ahmedabad, private hospitals have only 10 patients. Out of this, three needed ICU treatment or ventilatory support. But the rise in cases is surely a sign for us to brace for a further spike. We request citizens not to take the rise lightly and follow all Covid protocols including wearing masks and maintaining social distance to break the chain,” he said. Experts said that it may take some more time to ascertain whether the spike can be connected to the rise of the Omicron variant. As of Saturday evening, the state has recorded 49 cases of the variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/from-1851-cases-in-82-days-to-1855-in-30-days-in-guj/articleshow/88496963.cms||Parth Shastri

There is no need to impose a night curfew in Bihar as of now,” Nitish said after garlanding a life-size statue of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the occasion of his birth anniversary at the Pataliputra Park here. Governor Phagu Chauhan, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad several ministers paid floral tributes to Vajpayee at a state function organised at the Pataliputra Park. Though no Omicron case has so far been recorded in Bihar, the state’s health department has prepared a vigorous plan to check likely third wave of the pandemic. It has constituted six state-level committees of officers and doctors to monitor testing, contract tracing, isolation and treatment of Covid patients. A few weeks ago, Nitish had held a review meeting with the health department officials to discuss Omicron threat. He had asked the health officials to maintain complete surveillance across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/night-curfew-not-needed-in-bihar-as-of-now-nitish/articleshow/88496592.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Patna: Preschools witness significant decline in enrolment amid Covid||PATNA: The Covid-19 pandemic has altered several aspects of daily life, one of which is parents abandoning traditional playschools in favour of online classes for their children. Teachers at a few playschools acknowledged a significant decrease in child enrolment. “We admit children beginning at the age of two. However, following Covid-19, we saw a nearly 60% decline in admissions,” the branch head of a renowned preschool told TOI. Nikhat Bano, a teacher at a preschool in the Bakarganj neighbourhood, said, “While some parents have begun inquiring about admission, they are deferring due to the threat of a third wave and opting for online courses. However, virtual classes will never be a substitute for traditional classroom instruction.” Due to the fact that the admission process for kindergarten students has already begun at city schools, many children will enter the campus without having previously spent time with their peer groups at playschools. Parents are concerned about how their children will react in a new environment now that they have never been to a playschool. “My daughter is three and a half years old, and in the coming academic session, I will enrol her in any good school,” Raja Bazar resident, Nagma Parween, explained. “However, I am concerned because she has never attended a playschool and thus her performance may suffer,” she added. Swati Singh, another mother, had a similar concern. She said, “Due to Covid-19, I had not enrolled my son in school. Now that he is four years old, I am concerned about his performance during the admission interview.” Meanwhile, mental health professionals advise teachers and parents to exercise greater caution and patience when dealing with children, as the majority of them will be interacting with peers and people outside of their family for the first time. Dr Santosh Kumar, an associate professor of psychiatry at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, urged teachers to be more emphatic with children. “Kids may know the answer but remain hesitant to share it in public. Teachers must be aware of these considerations,” the doctor said. He did, however, encourage parents to enrol their children in school, stating that schooling and interaction with others aid in children’s cognitive development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/preschools-witness-significant-decline-in-enrolment-amid-covid/articleshow/88496711.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Bihar govt hopeful of crossing 10cr-vax mark by Dec 31||PATNA: The government will have to administer slightly more than 36 lakh doses of the Covid-19 vaccines in order to meet the new target of 10 crore doses by the end of this year. It had previously announced a six-month campaign to administer 6 crore doses by December 31. However, after exceeding this target significantly ahead of schedule, health minister Mangal Pandey said 10 crore doses would be administered by December 31. According to the data available on the CoWIN portal, the state had administered over 9.67 crore doses as of Thursday evening. Pandey told TOI that meeting the new target of 10 crore doses will be easily accomplished even if slightly more than 5 lakh doses are administered each day until next week. “On December 14, we crossed the 9-crore vaccine mark and in the subsequent 10 days, an additional 63 lakh vaccines were administered. On an average, 5 to 6 lakh doses are administered daily in Bihar and we will surpass the 10-crore mark in the next seven days. On Saturday, 2,72,253 doses were administered until evening,” he claimed. Pandey pointed out that the state has approximately 5.95 crore beneficiaries who are over the age of 18 and eligible to receive the Covid vaccines. “Bihar has a total of 7.22 crore voters over the age of 18. However, 14% are migrants, 2% death cases, and another 2% are not at their address. Without these, nearly 5.95 crore vaccines must be administered. Nearly 5.72 crore (96.13%) of these eligible beneficiaries have taken their first dose, while another 3.91 crore (66%) have received their second dose. Now, only 4% of the eligible beneficiaries have not received the vaccine at all,” the minister said. He added, “Each block has a refusal response team that counsels individuals who are unwilling to take the vaccine. Our team is going door to door, whether it is an agricultural field or a public space, to administer vaccines.” Pandey admitted that among the beneficiaries who had not received their vaccines were pregnant women, who were also counselled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-hopeful-of-crossing-10cr-vax-mark-by-dec-31/articleshow/88496693.cms||Sheezan Nezami

To start with, a high-tech drone will be used from January next year to ensure strict implementation of liquor prohibition in the state. The prohibition, excise and registration department on Saturday conducted a trial run of drones in Digha riverine area by engaging three agencies. Deputy commissioner (prohibition) Krishna Kumar said the department would award tender to one of the three agencies in the next couple of days. “The agency will be selected based on its performance. The drones will ensure river patrolling to check the smuggling of liquor in Bihar,” he said. “We will use high-tech drones in remote and inaccessible areas to stop illegal manufacture of liquor. With the help of closed-circuit television camera installed in the drone, we will get the pictures of people involved in illegal liquor trade,” Kumar said. During the trial run at Digha, SP (prohibition) Sanjay Singh told mediapersons that focus is on areas where people manufacture liquor illegally. “The drones will be handy in checking illicit liquor trade in far-flung areas.” The decision to use drones was taken at a meeting held in November this year on prohibition. The government has approved the proposal and the police will initially purchase five to six drones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/drones-to-be-used-to-check-illegal-liquor-trade-in-bihar/articleshow/88496677.cms||Faryal Rumi

Sources said the chilli exporter, who stocked large quantities during last season from commission agents, is yet to clear the dues. With the exporter having a track record of two decades, the commission agents were confident of repayments. The exporter allegedly invested huge amounts in real estate in Guntur and Prakasam with profits from chilli trade but land values depreciated recently leading to a crisis. It is alleged that the exporter has held lavish felicitations and birthday celebrations of a few senior political leaders. It is also alleged that the chilli exporter’s proximity to influential leaders has also made the commission agents to remain silent for long. Sources said the exporter has threatened a few commission agents who demanded money with dire consequences citing his proximity with top leaders. Agriculture market officials have brought the issue to the notice of market committee chairman Chandragiri Yesurathnam. As per rules, people facing criminal charges should not be named into the governing council. “We have not received any complaint from any trader. We came to know some people have approached the police for redressal of their grievances. It is not in our purview,” said Yesurathnam. He added that they would examine the issue if anyone lodged a complaint with the committee and conduct an enquiry before sending a report to the government for taking appropriate action. Meanwhile, a senior politician summoned the commission agents and the exporter to his office to settle the issue amicably. Sources said a few top commission agents have recovered about Rs 3 crore from the exporter in the last two days by exerting pressure through the senior leader. The exporter has reportedly promised to clear the dues by selling his properties.

While asserting that courts will never hesitate to interfere to protect the rights of people as and when the legislature and executive step out of their limits and violate the Constitution, the CJI added that if the executive and legislature work within their limits within the framework of the Constitution, courts will not have much work to do. Advocating better infrastructure for judiciary, Justice Ramana said he has been working to fill vacancies in judiciary and to provide better infrastructure facilities in the courts. “Courts in India have been struggling with various problems like lack of proper infrastructure and pendency of cases. There is a general opinion among people not to go to courts for dispute resolution and adopting alternate methods like going to some local leaders for settlements which is very prominent in places like Vijayawada,” he noted, while exhorting people not to hesitate to approach the courts to seek justice. Speaking on simplification of justice delivery process, Justice Ramana urged people to understand each and every step that is going on in the courts. “They should know what the court was saying about their case, they should understand what was there in the judgement. The process needs simplification and it needs to be more Indianised,” he observed. He also pressed upon the importance of one’s mother tongue. Recollecting the history of Vijayawada in the fields of literature and arts, he said the city seems to have left its heritage behind and called upon the younger generation to read Telugu literature. Praising the work rendered by Rotary Club, he said such organisations should also work on improving constitutional literacy of people. “Though the awareness on Constitution has increased among common people now, more emphasis should be given to educate people on their rights guaranteed by the Constitution,” the CJI added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/poor-infra-pendency-impede-courts-cji/articleshow/88496530.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: 15 students barred from exams for 1 year over ragging||RAJKOT: Fifteen students of Government Physiotherapy College in Jamnagar were found guilty of ragging their juniors by the institutes’ anti-ragging committee that submitted its report on Friday evening. Based on the report, the college authorities expelled six students permanently from the hostel and barred them from giving exams for the next one year. The anti-ragging committee had recorded statements of over 40 students in their report. Nine others were suspended from the hostel for one year. They will be allowed accommodation in the hostel only after one year based on recommendations from the anti-ragging committee. Though all will be allowed to take exams after one year, their results will be withheld till the anti-ragging committee don’t find their behaviour satisfactory. The action was taken by the college authorities after 28 junior students early this week alleged ragging by the seniors. The juniors alleged that senior students used to call them in their rooms and make them stand there for hours. They further alleged that seniors had made their own hostel rules which the juniors had to memorise. Juniors were also asked to memorise the names and room numbers of the seniors. If a junior failed to follow the hostel rules of the seniors, they would be subjected to humiliation in public. In-charge principal of the college Dinesh Sorani said that six students against whom serious charges have been proved won’t be allowed to take the exam for one year. “Even after that, results of all the students found guilty will be withheld till the time the anti-ragging committee don’t find their behaviour satisfactory. They will be given marksheets only after clearance from the anti-ragging committee,” Sorani told TOI. The college exams are due in July-August next year. The 15 students found guilty include those studying in the third and fourth year of physiotherapy while one is doing post-graduation. These students have also been barred from representing the college in any inter-college conference, sports or any other activity. “We have taken this incident very seriously and will not tolerate any disrespectful behaviour towards anybody. Juniors should not be asked to do anything against their wishes,” Sorani said. He said that they have also called the parents of these guilty students to make them understand what their sons have done. “If we receive any other complaint against these students, we will impose more stringent punishment. We will ensure that such act is not repeated in the college,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/15-found-guilty-of-ragging-at-govt-physiotherapy-college/articleshow/88496656.cms||---
---||Surat||Six held, 3 minors detained for Dang minor’s gang rape||SURAT: Police arrested six men and detained three minor boys on Friday for alleged gang-rape with a 14-year-old girl in Ahwa taluka of Dang about two months ago. The girl’s family approached the police on Thursday after the video of the crime went viral on social media. Those arrested include Vishal Pawar (20), Karshan Pawar (25), Shyamlal Dadvi (21), Umesh Bhoye (21), Sanjay Pawar (20) and Vasan Bhoye (25). The accused were remanded to police custody till Monday. The three minor boys, all aged 17 years, were produced before the juvenile court. “Of the nine accused, three persons allegedly raped the minor, while others helped them commit the crime,” said a police officer of Ahwa police station. According to police, the girl had gone to a marriage function in the neighbouring village with her three friends, two boys and a girl, in October. After the function was over, the other girl had left with her boyfriend. As it was 11 pm, the survivor asked the other boy (17) to accompany her. The boy took her into the forest where he allegedly raped her. Later, when they were waiting to catch a bus, eight friends of the accused came and took the boy and the girl again into the forest where three of them took turns to rape the minor. Police report stated that while others held the girl, Vishal shot the video on his mobile phone. When they noticed some light at a distance the accused escaped. “The girl did not tell about the incident to her family as her friend had shown her the video the next day and threatened to make it viral if she opened her mouth,” police added. Meanwhile, as the video went viral on social media, her relatives informed the family about the incident.

No casualties or injuries were reported. According to sources, the blast was caused by an incorrect cooling process of the tuyeres. A circular crane was burnt in BF-2, cooling pipes were damages and large quantities of coke and iron ore were scattered in the oven after the blast. Officials at VSP said tuyeres bursting are common at steel plants and the incident was a minor one. They added that production is likely to resume in the next 24 hours. Workers, however, said the loss to production and equipment would run into crores and restoration would take five days. Workers complained that a lack of maintenance of and focus on the cooling system had caused the mishap. “Cooling of tuyeres is important. Earlier, manpower was used to regulate the cooling process but now machine technology has been adopted. Apart from this, instead of coal, the pulverized coal injection method (PCI) is adopted, which means coal dust is added to the fire, which causes the hot metal to melt immediately. The mishap has caused a loss of more than Rs 10 crore to the plant,” a worker in BF-2 told STOI on condition of anonymity. Fire tenders rushed the spot and brought the blaze under control, VSP officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fire-breaks-out-at-vsp-blast-furnace-none-hurt/articleshow/88496286.cms||Siva G
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Two directors booked for culpable homicide||VADODARA: Directors of the chemical company where a blast in a boiler had led to the death of four persons were booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder on Saturday. The company’s authorities landed in trouble after providing housing to workers near the boiler that exploded on Friday morning. The blast at Canton Laboratories Pvt Ltd had left four persons dead and 11 others injured. Two of the deceased used to stay in a room near the boiler which burst. “Investigations in the case revealed that the four rooms were shown as storage in the plans of the unit. However, workers used to stay in three of these rooms,” said assistant commissioner of police S B Kumpavat. So far, it has come to light that those staying in these rooms included Varsha Chauhan (30) and her daughter Riya Chauhan (4). Varsha’s husband Kamlesh Chauhan, Vinu Bhoi and Vinu’s son Mahendra Bhoi also stayed in the rooms. The police questioned the directors of the company, employees as well as others before registering the offence. The directors Tushar Patel and Ankit Patel have been accused of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under sections 304, 308 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code. Apart from the mother-daugher duo, two workers were also killed in the incident. These include Ravi Vasava (19) and Satish Joshi (65). Joshi was the boiler operator at the unit while Vasava was a helper. Manjalpur police had initially registered the incident as an unnatural death and started investigations. After recording statements and gathering documents, the offence against the directors was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-directors-booked-for-culpable-homicide/articleshow/88496576.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Covid graphs of first, second waves plot similar trajectories in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh reported its first Covid-19 case on March 12, 2020. The state went on to accumulate 8.82 lakh cases in 2020. But there were hardly 3,200 active cases by the end of the year. Amid the preparations for the rollout of mass inoculation drive of the Covid-19 vaccine, 2021 started with a mood of guarded optimism. With the beginning of the vaccination process, it seemed the endgame in the fight against the novel coronavirus was on the horizon. But cases started to surge in March 2021, similar to the previous year and hinting at a possible second wave. Both waves followed an almost similar trajectory with the recovery rate touching the 99% mark by the end of the year. The state, which has breached the 20-lakh case mark, currently has about 1,300 active cases. Going by the infection numbers, the lockdown and subsequent unlocking process seem to have helped in suppressing or at least deferring the spread of infections during the first wave. But due to unhindered public movement and increased economic activity, the state added the second 8.8 lakh infections in just 110 days during the second wave. This is equivalent to the entire caseload in the state from March 2020 to February 2021. The intensity of the transmissions during the brutal second wave can be gauged from the fact that the state reported 5.91 lakh infections in May alone, or nearly 30% of the total infections in the state since the onset of the pandemic in March last year. This can be largely attributed to the highly transmissible Delta variant dominating the second wave. The manifold jump in the number of daily infections caught the state off guard in May, forcing the health system to stretch beyond its breaking point. Gasping for breath, even the most severe cases had to wait for treatment outside hospitals that were overwhelmed. In both waves, the number of cases started to stabilise around October. The state is currently reporting 100 to 200 new infections a day as was the case in December 2020. Now, amid the fears over the Omicron variant, the state is bracing itself for a possible third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-graphs-of-first-second-waves-plot-similar-trajectories/articleshow/88496521.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Taiwan guava edges out mango in Krishna district||VIJAYAWADA: Driven by high yield and strong demand, Taiwan guava cultivation is emerging as a profitable alternative for mango farmers in west Krishna and Nuzividu region. Nuzividu and parts of Mylavaram are famous for mango cultivation. Chinna Rasalu and Banginapalli varieties which are cultivated in this region have huge demand across the world. However, pests and infections like sooty mould have prompted farmers to look for alternatives to mango crop. Guava cultivation has increased significantly here in recent times and one of the reasons for its popularity is round-the-year yield. The Taiwan variety is profitable for farmers who are cultivating pink, white and golden yellow guavas. As per the suggestions of agriculture department officials, farmers are following a high-density pattern in which around 450 saplings are planted per acre.  Mokkapati Madusudhan Rao, an 83-year-old farmer who is cultivating Taiwan guava on 18 acres of land near Adavinekkalam, told STOI: “Mango is a prime crop in our region and we cultivated it till 2013. Despite huge demand, middlemen looted us and we used to earn only Rs 40,000 per acre a year. We initially planted Indian variety guava and failed to get good returns. Then we shifted to Taiwan variety and now we are getting at least 25 kilos of fruit per tree a year. We are selling fruits to local vendors and exporting them to Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai and other metro cities.” Many guava farmers in the region are using innovative pest control measures to protect the crop. There is minimal use of chemical-based pesticides and fertilizers. “Fruit flies and thrips are common pests affecting guava. On the suggestion of horticulture authorities, we are wrapping the fruits in polythene bags and also placing light traps. These techniques are helping us achieve high yield and best crop,” said Akunuru Sivannarayana, another farmer from Velagaleru in Krishna district.  Horticulture officials said farmers are being urged to not give up mango cultivation entirely, even while focusing on new techniques of cultivating guava on available land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/taiwan-guava-edges-out-mango-in-krishna/articleshow/88496275.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Patna||JD(U) in talks with BJP for seat sharing in UP election: RCP||PATNA: Union steel minister and former JD(U) president Ram Chandra Prasad Singh on Saturday said his party had no problem with the BJP on the issue of seat-sharing in Uttar Pradesh assembly election and the two parties would contest in alliance there. Talking to mediapersons at his residence here, Singh said the JD(U) and BJP had a warm relationship in Uttar Pradesh, just like the two parties have in Bihar. “When we have a warm relationship, the question of BJP not leaving a respectable number of seats for the JD(U) does not arise. Both the parties will amicably decide seat-sharing in UP, without ignoring the interests of each other,” RCP, who has been authorized to hold talks with the BJP on seat-sharing for the UP polls, said. Asked about the possible alliance between former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Majhi-led HAM(S) and Mukesh Sahani-led Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) in the UP polls, despite both the parties being allies of the NDA in Bihar, RCP said, “Every political party is free to take its own decision. HAM(S) and the VIP can contest the UP polls, as the NDA has a different set of partners in Bihar and UP. The HAM(S) and VIP are NDA partners only in Bihar.” On Friday, JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh had said the BJP has agreed to form an alliance with his party in the UP election. Lalan also said the JD(U) has submitted a list of assembly constituencies where the it is interested to contest in alliance with the saffron party. A few weeks ago, JD(U)’s Uttar Pradesh state president Anoop Singh Patel had told TOI that his party had identified 35 seats to contest in alliance with the BJP in the 2022 assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-in-talks-with-bjp-for-seat-sharing-in-up-election-rcp/articleshow/88496667.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh on gem of mission: To launch hunt for diamonds||AMARAVATI: Nearly three centuries after some of the world’s most famous diamonds including the Kohinoor were discovered in the Krishna river basin, the AP government is now set to launch a massive search for gemstones. To begin with, the state government has focused on Upparapalle, a nondescript village in Kadapa district. The move comes after a preliminary survey by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) hinted at the presence of diamonds in Upparapalle. One of the blocks in Upparapalle spread over 37.5 sq km would be taken up for a detailed study to zero-in on the area where the diamonds are present. The state government has decided to grant a composite licence through competitive bidding to explore the area. A high-level committee comprising special chief secretary (industries) Karikal Valaven, principal secretaries of mines and geology and finance and senior officials from the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) and the GSI sanctioned permission for the survey in Upparapalle. The successful bidder will take up the survey of the area. Once the survey pinpoints the regions where diamonds are present in abundance, the government will go for the next step – exploration of the gemstones. The survey spans three phases – G-4, G-3 and G-2. The GSI has already conducted G-4 or preliminary studies. G-1 studies involve detailed exploration. The company that would win the bid would take up G-3 and G-2 studies that involve preliminary and general exploration respectively. The high level committee has also decided to invite tenders for the issue of a composite licence to explore gold reserves in 11 blocks in Anantapur district. The state government has turned its attention to diamond and gold reserves following an amendment to the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act (MMDRA) by the Centre recently. Previously, there was a ban on the issue of licences based on the preliminary survey. With subsequent phases of surveys involving huge investment, the Centre thought of roping private agencies for survey and exploration. To facilitate this, the Centre has amended the Act. Andhra Pradesh is known for its now defunct diamond mines. The river basins of Penna and Krishna once harboured large diamond mines. But overexploitation had led to their extinction. However, several research studies in recent times revealed the presence of diamonds deep inside the earth. And the government has big plans to unearth the diamonds bringing back the old glory to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-to-resume-300-yr-tryst-with-diamonds/articleshow/88496210.cms||Samdani MN

SVF Entertainment on Friday moved the commercial court at Alipore, challenging the production of a Feluda series.

---||Mumbai||Deshmukh case: ED grills 12 officers||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recorded the statement of 12 Indian Police Service (IPS) and State Police Service (SPS) officers of the rank of superintendent of police and deputy commissioner of police in the money-laundering case linked to former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The agency is investigating if these officials obtained their posting through consideration during Deshmukh’s tenure. Earlier, the ED had recorded the statement of former state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte—he is now principal advisor to the chief minister—to get details of the transfers-postings as he was additional chief secretary (ACS) home during Deshmukh’s tenure. Kunte had told ED officers about the process and recommendation his office had received related with the posting-transfer of these 12 officers. The ED had also recorded the statement of Kunte’s then junior—deputy secretary (home) Kailash Gaikwad. Under the Maharashtra Police Act, transfers and postings of senior police officers of and above the rank of deputy superintendent of police is recommended by the Police Establishment Board (PEB) headed by the ACS (home). The recommendations are sent to the home minister and then to the chief minister’s office for final approval. The file then returns to ACS (home) for issuing the orders. As per the Act, the PEB has a recommendatory role and ministers usually agree with it, but it’s not mandatory. The home minister may make changes after PEB clearance and cite reasons for the same. The ED is investigating two aspects in the money laundering case it has registered against Deshmukh based on the CBI FIR. Deshmukh has been accused of misusing his post as home minister and asking now dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar and restaurant owners for him every month. The ED is also examining the allegation that Deshmukh had favoured police officers for desirable transfer-posting for consideration. Last year, then state intelligence department commissioner Rashmi Shukla had recorded telephonic conversations of some influential persons who were allegedly discussing transfer-posting of police officers, including IPS officers, in exchange for money. Shukla had submitted the report to then DGP Subodh Jaiswal, who forwarded it to then ACS (home) Kunte to discuss it with the CM for required action. But the government had not acted on the report and later Shukla and Jaiswal opted for central government deputation. Deshmukh resigned from the home minister’s post in April after former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh made corruption allegations against him. Last month, the ED had arrested Deshmukh in the money-laundering case. He is in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-case-ed-grills-12-officers/articleshow/88497325.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||29 minors who came to Delhi for better life freed from child labour||NEW DELHI: An eight-year-boy Raju (name changed) along with four other children left his village in Bihar around five months ago in the hope of better education and life. A villager had promised his father, a daily-wage labourer, that he will get Raju enrolled in a good school in Delhi and will make him work just for a couple of hours. However, instead of enrolling him in a school, the villager forcefully made Raju and the four other children to work in a papad factory in Delhi. They were made to work for around 12-13 hours in a day and if there was an excess order of papad, the kids were forced to work for 18 hours in a day. Though Raju was promised Rs 4,000 per month, he would get just Rs 50-100 per week. They were even denied a proper diet. Raju was among 29 minors who were rescued recently in a joint operation led by sub-divisional magistrate and supported by Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) during a raid in Madipur village under Punjabi Bagh police station in west Delhi. The labour department, Delhi Police and CISF personnel also took part in the rescue operation. “Raju told the rescue team that he could sleep for just four to five hours daily. If he or the other children overslept, they were abused and beaten. All the trafficked children were made to sleep in a group. Most of them appear to be weak and tired,” said Manish Sharma, director, BBA. Officials said the process of filing an FIR was underway. A BBA official said these 29 rescued children were trafficked and brought from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. They were employed in different factories and dhabas. The rescued children are aged 8 to 16 years and some of the children were paid a monthly salary of just Rs 2,000. These children were made to work for 8-16 hours a day. “In the last one year, BBA has rescued more than 9,000 trafficked children across several states from trains, buses and factories with the help of law enforcement agencies. As predicted by the organisation, children became the biggest victim of Covid pandemic and trafficking of children became rampant in the entire country,” said Sharma.He added, “We support the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021 and hope it will be passed in the upcoming session.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/29-minors-who-came-to-capital-for-better-life-freed-from-child-labour/articleshow/88497337.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The executive subsequently approached the Bandra police station and lodged a complaint. The 58-year-old complainant stated that he received a text message asking him to call up his mobile service provider and urgently update his KYC documents. The text message had a number mentioned in it. Unsuspecting, the complainant dialled that number. A man answered and identified himself as an employee of the mobile service provider. He asked the complainant for his debit card and net banking details as part of ‘KYC procedure’. The complainant shared the same. Within minutes, a sum of Rs2.5 lakh was deducted from the complainant’s bank account in a series of nine transactions. He then realised that he had been conned and approached the Bandra police. In a separate case, an author trying to sell his used furniture online was duped of Rs40,000 by a cyber fraudster posing as a potential client. An FIR was registered by Goregaon police on December 21. The 30-year-old complainant gave an advertisement wanting to sell his used bed and cupboard. He received a call from a potential buyer expressing interest in buying his furniture. The fraudster sent him a QR code which the author scanned. As soon as he did this, a sum of Rs 10,000 got debited from the author’s bank account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-duped-of-rs-2-5lakh-in-online-kyc-update-fraud/articleshow/88497330.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Another year of losing battle against garbage in Mohali||Barinderjit.Saluja Mohali: Another year has gone by with garbage heaps, overflowing sewer lines, open manholes and missing toilets blocks in markets remaining a constant in Mohali. As before, residents continued to grumble about the health hazard posed by the sorry state of sanitation. Despite the MC making efforts to address the problem, garbage heaps remained a nearly permanent feature on roads, particularly those inside sectors. Dustbins also flowed over, spewing garbage around. For a city with a population of over 10 lakh and 2.98 lakh households, the MC has only around 2,200 sanitation workers even though the sanctioned strength is around 4,500. Residents often complain of sanitation workers not being regular. In the Swachh Survekshan Survey 2018, the city slipped to the 29th rank from the 11th spot in 2017 and second in 2016. Residents complain that they have been living in unhygienic conditions. K N S Sodhi, president, Mohali Environment Society said, “Garbage heaps along the roads or in vacant plots in Mohali are challenging the sanitation and cleaning system of the Municipal Corporation. The MC has been receiving five to six complaints for removal of garbage heaps from city roads. Overflowing sewer lines emit a foul smell, making life in such localities difficult.” The corporation has also been struggling to effectively implement waste segregation at source. The civic body paid Rs 13 crore annually to a private company roped in for a period of five years in 2015. Many councillors have objected to the hefty payment. The contract ended in August 2020 but was extended due to the Covid pandemic. Surjit Singh, a resident of Phase VII said, “Mohali MC has again failed to figure in Swachh ranking this year. It is all because of poor sanitation conditions in the city. Blocked sewerage lines, garbage here and there and stray cattle defecating on roads underlines the pathetic condition of the city.” This year too, Mohali failed to make it to the top 100 clean cities’ list in the country. Instead, its position in the Swachh Survekshan 2020 slipped to 157. In 2020, Mohali scored 2,790.72 points out of 5,000 securing 55.8%. The city slipped from 153rd rank in 2019, 109th position in 2018 and 121st in 2017. Mohali also slipped in its top five ranking within Punjab state. Now the seventh cleanest city in Punjab, it was 4th cleanest in 2019, second in 2018 and first in 2017. BOX: No garbage segregation at source Despite a warning issued to the Mohali Municipal Corporation (MC) by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the civic body is yet to push for garbage segregation at source. The civic body is not imposing fines if garbage is not segregated at source. Also, garbage is not supposed to be lifted if not segregated. Mohali MC has already missed the deadline of January 31, 2021 for making door-to-door garbage segregation a success and enforcing the solid waste management system. Sources in Mohali MC said directions had been issued to sanitation department officials to serve a notice on residents warning them that they had time till December 31 to start garbage segregation at source, after which they would be penalised and unsegregated garbage would not be lifted. However, this was not done because of the Covid pandemic. NGT recently directed Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to seize bank guarantees of Zirakpur, Banur and Nayagaon Municipal Councils. The committee directed PPCB to encash Rs two lakh each bank guarantees of the three MCs for failing to collect and manage door-to-door garbage within the time limit of three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/another-year-of-losing-battle-against-garbage-in-mohali/articleshow/88496735.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Delhi||Delhi: ‘No hike’, businessman’s staffer gets his son abducted for Rs 1 crore||NEW DELHI: A city businessman’s son was recently abducted from an east Delhi market for a ransom of Rs 1 crore. The kidnappers negotiated with the businessman and released his 18-year-old son after receiving Rs 50 lakh. Police have arrested four people, including a woman employee of the businessman who had allegedly hatched the plot with her boyfriend. The accused claimed that she had incurred a huge debt after Covid-19 and was not getting any hike or promotion. Police have recovered Rs 36 lakh of the ransom amount. According to DCP (east) Priyanka Kashyap, the abduction happened on December 17, while an FIR was filed a day later. The businessman received a call around 3.45pm and told that his son had been kidnapped from the flower market at Ghazipur, Kashyap said. The victim said he and an employee, Richa Sabarwal (32), a flower decorator at his father’s banquet, had gone to the market to buy flowers. They were getting into the car after making the purchase when a man wearing a black jacket with a hood, a cap and a mask held a gun — apparently a toy gun — at them and asked the driver to go towards Ashok Vihar. On the way, the kidnapper made a WhatsApp call from the victim’s phone to his father. He threatened to kill the victim if police were approached. The businessman managed to arrange Rs 50 lakh and paid it at Ashok Vihar. The kidnapper released the boy, the driver and Sabarwal, and asked the businessman to drive the car. He got off at Paschim Vihar and asked the businessman to pay the rest at the earliest. From CCTV footage, the cops spotted a suspicious scooty following the car on the entire route. The rider was identified as Kamal Bansal (36), and his arrest led to the kidnapper, Gurmeet Singh (36), both friends and residents of Omkar Nagar. Both claimed Sabarwal, Singh’s girlfriend, was the mastermind. Both she and her mother, Anita (56), were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-hike-bizmans-staffer-gets-his-son-abducted-for-rs-1cr/articleshow/88497342.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC elections 2022: ‘Jai Bhim’ movie, games in NCP’s campaign||MUMBAI: Though there is little clarity on ward boundaries and alliances, the NCP has hit the ground running for the BMC election. The NCP has begun its outreach campaign by screening the popular film ‘Jai Bhim’ and organising sports tournaments in the city. The NCP recently screened Jai Bhim for residents in Ghatkopar. The screening was led by housing minister Jitendra Awhad. The film drew crowds and will be taken around, said leaders. The Tamil film, dubbed in Hindi and other tongues, was one of the most popular in 2021. “The screenings got a very good response. The film tells the story of repression against Dalits and tribals, who are at the bottom of the caste pyramid. The film had a good social message and so we decided to screen it. We have taken all the required permissions and will screen the film in other localities in the area too,” said NCP functionary Nitin Deshmukh. NCP corporator Rakhi Jadhav last week held an arts and sports festival.It was attended by MLA Rohit Pawar. “Visited ‘Ghatkopar Arts, Sports and Cultural Festival’ organized by Rakhi Jadhav. I also enjoyed playing badminton and had discussions with residents who attended the festival,” Pawar tweeted. The NCP’s Amol Matele organised a cricket tournament for NCP supreme Sharad Pawar’s birthday. Despite the success of the MVA in rural local body polls, the Shiv Sena is set to go it alone in the BMC polls. The party, which has ruled the BMC for over two decades, is preparing to fight over 200 seats and expand its base in Mumbai. Analysts said the Shiv Sena might tie-up with the NCP after all as the party might ask for a fewer seats compared to the Congress. The NCP has just eight corporators. “The NCP has little presence in Mumbai. They can take 30 seats and still improve their strike rate. This will be a win-win for both the Sena and NCP. There is no way the Congress will agree to an alliance with Sena for less than 80-100 seats,” an analyst said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/jai-bhim-movie-games-in-ncps-bmc-campaign/articleshow/88497339.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mangaluru||Illegal slum with more than 400 huts found on beach stretch||Mangaluru: The Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC), in association with the youth clubs in Baikampady and Meenakalya, have decided to launch a drive to make the stretch between Baikampady and Meenakalya a slum-free beach. Nearly 400 makeshift huts have come up on the beach stretch. According to officials and local residents, the huts have been rented out to migrant labourers, without providing toilets. As a result, families are forced to defecate in the open, thus littering the beach. MCC senior health inspector Sushanth K told TOI that the city corporation has received several complaints from local residents, about the unhygienic condition of the areas where the huts have been built illegally. “Youngsters Panambur and Youngsters Yuvaka–Yuvathi Mandala members have brought to the notice of the city corporation about a large number of huts made of different types of sheets constructed by some local residents. They collect nearly Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 per head as rent from the migrant labourers. Some owners have more than 150 such sheds being rented out to migrant labourers, without providing any basic amenities like washrooms and toilets. Since these single room huts are not connected to the underground drainage system, locals fear that they will cause the area and the sea to get polluted,” Sushanth said. Yathish Baikampady, former CEO, Panambur Beach Tourism Development Project, said that to create awareness on cleanliness, youth clubs of the area will organise a swachhata campaign on the beach stretch from Panambur to Meenakalya, on Sunday. “Villagers will unite to make the beach stretch free from illegal huts, and keep the area clean. The awareness programme is planned to bring the issue to the notice of the district administration and the city corporation,” he added. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar said, “Those who are residing in illegal slums on the beach will have to be vacated and re-accommodated. We are discussing the modalities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/illegal-slum-with-more-than-400-huts-found-on-beach-stretch/articleshow/88496143.cms||---

Similarly, police from Rajasthan have also intensified checking. Security has been tightened at major check-posts like Ratanpur border in Aravalli district, Rani and Kheroj areas of Sabarkantha district and Neenava in Banaskatha. According to the superintendent of police Sabarkantha, Neeraj Badgujjar, vehicle checking has been intensified as bootleggers seem to become active as New Year approaches. “The demand for liquor grows phenomenally during New Year. Due to the increase in Covid-19 cases, the revelry during New Year has raised concerns,” he added. The round the clock vigil is also meant to stop any criminal activities. According to deputy SP Bharat Basiya, the checking will continue till January 1, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cops-intensify-checking-at-guj-rajasthan-border/articleshow/88496684.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Facelift for Kamathipura: Tenants, landlords unite||MUMBAI: There's barely enough space for two people to stand together and spread their arms. There’s a loft hanging low overhead, which provides additional space to lie down. In rooms as tiny as 40-100 sq feet, over three generations of families have lived together and continue to live. “I feel like a caged animal,” said Pramila Jatla, tears welling up in her eyes. “My husband used to work with Khatau Mills. He lost his job when the mill closed down and ever since I have been doing odd tailoring jobs in the locality,” said Jatla. She lives in a building on the 7th lane in Kamathipura. Pramila was born in Kamathipura, married here, and now awaits the birth of her grandchild. For the 800 landlords and over 8,000 tenants of Kamathipura, who have waited years for their properties to be redeveloped, hope is finally on the horizon. On July 21 this year, the state government increased the incentive for cluster redevelopment for an area above 25 acres. The new incentives make the revamp of one of Mumbai’s oldest and most centrally located neighbourhoods financially viable. Kamathipura was first settled around 1795 during the construction of causeways that connected the erstwhile seven islands of Bombay. Initially known as Lal Bazaar, it got its name from the Kamathis (workers) of Telangana state who were labourers on construction sites. Though it was within the poorer quarters of the native town, the emergence of European brothels in the late 19th century soon made the place synonymous with sex work. The tag has stuck for over a century now. Last week, Mumbadevi MLA Amin Patel led a delegation of landlords and tenants from Kamathipura to appeal to the state government to appoint the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (MHADA) as the nodal agency for the area’s redevelopment. The Kamathipura Punarvikas Samiti has all the landlords and tenants as its members. Landlords admit they are too poor to redevelop properties on their own and the size of each plot too small to evince much interest among builders. The plot size varies from 50-150 sq metres. Patel said only a handful are over 100 sq metres. Over the years at least a hundred buildings have collapsed; so far only four have been redeveloped. “The new notification allows a developer an incentive FSI (Floor Space Index) of 130% as against the earlier 100%. Residents will get 508 sq feet tenements as against the earlier 390 sq feet flats. In case of commercial establishments, the government has allowed an existing area or 225 sq feet whichever is more,” said Sunil Deole, one of the architects who has worked on the design for the area’s redevelopment. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said government will form a Special Purpose Vehicle with MHADA as nodal agency to rebuild Kamathipura. “The redevelopment will be similar to that of Motilal Nagar in Goregaon. MHADA will be the facilitator. The housing authority will appoint a private developer and take a share of the profits,” he said. Awhad said within a month the government will issue a notification disallowing redevelopment of individual buildings in and around Kamathipura. “We want to encourage only cluster redevelopment,” said Awhad. The redevelopment of single buildings elsewhere in the city has created an uneven skyline and irregular spaces for civic amenities such as roads and gardens. “There is no space for parking or pavements, and no open spaces or other amenities are created,” said Patel, who has watched with alarm as many old quarters of south Mumbai change in a disorderly manner. “The 16 lanes in Kamathipura are narrow and congested, the area has only one playground. Cluster redevelopment will ensure better civic amenities,” he said. Sunil Kadam, the Punarvikas Samiti’s working president and a landlord, said they had appointed a project management consultant to survey and prepare a development plan, which they have now presented to the government. “We took the plan to several developers but none showed interest as it was not financially viable. Now it seems doable. The redevelopment we have proposed will be done in six phases. Only during the first phase would tenants need to be moved into transit camps,” he said. Shekhar Chaudhari, who is a tenant and member of the Samiti’s managing committee, said it is the redevelopment of the BDD chawls in central Mumbai that has revived interest in redevelopment. “The tenants are willing to go for redevelopment if MHADA becomes the nodal agency. The government being a participant provides a sense of comfort,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/facelift-for-kamathipura-tenants-landlords-unite/articleshow/88497372.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Delhi||Delhi: Wife hid schizophrenia, man gets divorce||NEW DELHI: It is not easy to live with a partner who has mental health issues, the Delhi high court said, ending a 16-year-old marriage where the estranged wife hid that she was suffering from schizophrenia. “Marriage is not made of only happy memories and good times, and two people in a marriage have to face challenges and weather the storm together. It is not easy to live with a partner who has mental health issues, and such ailments come with their own challenges for the person facing the problem, and even more so for the spouse. There needs to be an understanding of the problems in a marriage, and communication between the partners — especially when one of the two partners in a marriage is facing challenges of their own,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh noted, allowing the husband’s plea. The high court also took adverse view of the wife’s failure to disclose her mental health disorder before her marriage, pointing out that this “constituted a fraud perpetrated upon the appellant.” It noted that the wife never made the husband aware of her disorder, and instead passed it off as headaches. “Headaches by themselves are not a disease. They are only symptoms of a disease. The respondent does not state what caused her such serious and frequent headaches, which debilitated her from completing her studies,” the court noted. The court also noted that the wife’s refusal to undergo medical examination by the medical board of experts “leads to the inference that she was not prepared to face the medical board as that could have exposed the condition of her mental wellbeing, and would have established the allegation that she was suffering from schizophrenia. Why else would such a spouse — who claims to not be suffering from any mental ailment — who has preferred a petition to seek restitution of conjugal rights, and expresses her desire to live with the appellant husband, not undergo such medical examination?” It noted that the wife scuttled the court’s efforts to arrive at a definite finding of the truth. “The only way of conclusively determining the mental health of the respondent is by subjecting the respondent to an examination by an expert medical board. The appellant has significantly discharged the onus by leading cogent evidence, and raised a preponderance of probability that the respondent is suffering from schizophrenia,” it observed. The high court said the conduct of the wife and her father has resulted in a situation where the life of the husband “has been ruined and he has remained stuck in this relationship for 16 years without any resolution. In the most important years of his life, when the appellant would have otherwise enjoyed marital and conjugal bliss and satisfaction, he has had to suffer due to the obstinacy displayed by not only the respondent, but even her father, who appears to have been calling the shots in relation to the matrimonial dispute raised by the appellant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wife-hid-schizophrenia-man-gets-divorce/articleshow/88497375.cms||Abhinav Garg

The accused turned himself in and informed the police about the murder. The incident took place in the prominent Kalyanbaug Society near Deep Chambers in Manjalpur at around 11am. Vishal Amin used a hammer to murder his mother-in-law, Savita Patel, by hitting it on her head repeatedly. Vishal then went to the Makarpura police station and informed the policemen there about the murder. It was the police that informed Vishal’s wife Rinku Amin that her mother had been murdered. When Rinku rushed to her mother’s residence, the body was lying in the kitchen and the hammer was in a sink there. Rinku stated in her complaint that her brother Rahul Patel was involved in selling liquor. Due to this her husband had to go to the police station often. Vishal wanted Rahul to leave the bootlegging business and had been raising the issue often with his in-laws. However, according to Rinku, her mother Savita used to take Rahul’s side. Vishal used to have arguments with Savita over the issue. Rinku suspected that this was the reason why Vishal murdered Savita. While Vishal had appeared before the Makarpura police, the house where the murder took place was located in the precincts of Manjalpur police station. An offence was registered at the Manjalpur police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-kills-mother-in-law-with-hammer-surrenders/articleshow/88496598.cms||---

The notes of Christmas carols that 15 visually challenged artistes from Shree Sharadha Andhara Geetha Gayana Kala Sangha, Sringeri in Chikkamagaluru district sang, provided a vibrant experience for the passengers. Sarvamangala Trust, Mangaluru, which empowers the differently abled, trained these artistes. The place next to the tastefully lit Christmas décor at the departure hall of Mangaluru International Airport, served as the platform for the artists to showcase their talent. The carols sung by them, soaked passengers in the Christmas spirit. Denver Roche, a professional singer, who worked with these artistes for the past month, anchored the event. Muthuraj from Sarvamangala Trust played the joyful Santa Claus, and handed treats to passengers and others present at the airport. The passengers bought the limited-edition Christmas gift hampers consisting of greeting cards and other stationery items, that the trust had readied. Proceeds from the sale of hampers went to the trust, to impart competitive training to the differently abled.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Not so bad now, but still difficult to marry off girls’||Mamata Jadhav (70), a resident of 14th lane in Kamathipura, is tired of promises of a larger home. “On three different occasions, the dalals called meetings of the residents, collected copies of our rent receipts and electricity bills, made us sign consent agreements, and then nothing,” she said. Jadhav lives in a 40 sq feet home with her son and daughter-in-law. The tiny room has a bunker bed where kitchen utensils are stacked up during the day. A small bathroom is an addition they have added within the space. Every floor in every building has a minimum of six rooms and there is one common bathroom with a common toilet. Water supply is from 4.30 to 7 am and every family gets 20 minutes to draw water for their day’s requirement. “Every morning you stand on the road and you can hear the familiar sound of families fighting for their share of water,” said Suresh Shetty, the local Shiv Sena shakha pramukh. It is not just the small space but its upkeep that is also bleeding them. Nandu Gangan points to the decrepit condition of his building which is now under repairs. “The repairs will cost us Rs 13 lakh, the MLA has provided Rs 3 lakh and the rest has to be raised by us. Every seven years we need to carry out repairs,” he said. The pencil-thin buildings are 80-100 years old, sharing common walls which help them to continue standing despite lack of adequate repairs. Moving into a larger home has been an impossible dream for the vast majority in this low-income neighbourhood in the heart of Mumbai. The area’s central location is the main reason families have not abandoned these hovels entirely. “In some larger families, some members have moved to Kalyan, Vasai-Virar... but here everything is within walking distance including hospitals, schools, and colleges,” said Satyanand Gajelli. The infamy of being Mumbai’s red-light district has reduced as the women and their business are shifting out, but the reputation rears its head each time a girl in the family is to be married. “It is not so bad now, but it is still difficult to find a groom,” said Shetty. Now the redevelopment of BDD chawls has rekindled hopes. “If the government can provide for slum dwellers who are basically encroachers they must help us who pay rent and repair cess,” said Bal Dhontul, president, Kamathipura Punarvikas Samiti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-so-bad-now-but-still-difficult-to-marry-off-girls/articleshow/88497387.cms||Clara Lewis

AP farmers have grown cocoa in 40,000 hectares of land and produced 11,000 tonnes of cocoa in 2020-21. In 2016-17, cocoa in AP was cultivated in 24,000 hectares and 7,700 tonnes was produced. Experts said cultivation of cocoa has almost doubled, while production has increased substantially in the last 4-5 years. Tamil Nadu stood second with cocoa grown in 32,000 hectares but it produced only 2,800 tonnes. Kerala surpassed TN in production at 9,600 tonnes by growing cocoa in 17,400 hectares. Replying to a query from Rajahmundry MP Margani Bharat in the Lok Sabha, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said India occupies 14th position globally in the production of cocoa. “The cocoa beans produced in India are comparable to Ivory Coast beans (the best beans are produced in Ghana followed by Ivory Coast) and many MNCs involved in grinding of cocoa are taking a lot of interest in Indian cocoa beans,” said Tomar. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Plantation Crops Research Institute has developed five hybrid and high yielding varieties and three clones of cocoa for the benefit of growers. The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd collects both wet and dry beans from growers, processes through its chocolate factory and exports cocoa butter and cocoa powder. Under Scheduled Castes sub-plan/tribal sub-plan programmes, cocoa seedlings are supplied to farmers of AP and Karnataka.

BJP said that the allegations are ‘unfounded’. “After the trifurcation of MCD, the north corporation alone had collected Rs 1,232 crore. This money does not belong to the corporations, but to the employees. It is a part of their pay that gets cut for a payout at the time of their retirement,” Bhardwaj said. “The BJP-led corporations gulped down all that money and the account now has only Rs 6 crores left in it,” he alleged. Bharadwaj said the money deposited before trifurcation was about Rs 1,197 crore, which, he claimed, the three corporations have decided to divide among themselves. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the unified MCD was trifurcated into three civic bodies in 2012 and the employees were given a chance to choose from corporations and since then, they receive their salary and pension from the corporation they work under. “Unfortunately, the GPF was not distributed amongst three corporations, which has now been done and is fully justified,” he said, adding that no one can cash withdraw from GPF, and so there is no question of funds being siphoned off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gpf-anomalies-at-corpns-alleges-aap/articleshow/88497384.cms||---

Hinjewadi police officers said the ambulance, which had started from Taloja in Navi Mumbai for Mehboobnagar near Hyderabad, had stopped after one of its rear tyres deflated. Driver Mahesh Vishwanath Sarwade (44) was replacing the tyre, while the woman, Sitabai Hari Chavan (54), and her two sons, Raja (35) and Manohar (26), were standing nearby. At this moment, the truck, which was on its way to Satara from Pimpri, came from the rear and hit the ambulance that was standing on a jack. The ambulance, in turn, hit the victims under the impact of the dash, leaving Sarwade and Chavan dead and Raja and Manohar seriously injured. Senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant of the Hinjewadi police said, “Fearing any assault by people, the truck driver kept driving ahead for some distance before stopping and abandoning the heavy vehicle. We are searching for him and have contacted the truck owner from Pimpri.” The officer said, “The two injured men have been admitted to a private hospital and are out of danger. The relatives will decide where and how to take the bodies of the woman and her husband,” said Sawant. Sitabai was a housewife. Hari (56), who was an autorickshaw driver by profession, died of cardiac arrest on Friday morning. Sub-inspector Ajit Kakade said, “The family members decided to take Hari’s body to their native village at Mehboobnagar near Hyderabad for the final rites. They started from Taloja in an ambulance. As the ambulance tyre deflated, Sarwade, Sitabai and her two sons got down from the vehicle.” He said, “Sarwade started replacing the tyre and the other three stood near him. The truck following the ambulance was proceeding at a heavy speed. The truck driver failed to locate the ambulance on the road and hit it. The rear section of the ambulance subsequently hit the four persons.” Sawant said, “Infrastructure development project is going on in the Chandni Chowk area. The police will study if the infrastructure work contributed to the accident on the spot or whether it was the truck driver’s fault.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/truck-hits-ambulance-with-mans-body-wife-driver-die/articleshow/88496772.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The Domestic Cargo Terminal is functioning under AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Company, a subsidiary of Airports Authority of India. Selva Kumar M, cargo manager, MIA said domestic cargo was handled by a private firm till June 25, 2020. After it wound up operations, the operations were carried out along with international cargo. However, there were objections from the Customs Department since domestic cargo cannot be handled at international cargo facilities. A new facility was set up close to the MIA. “We have fulfilled all criteria laid down by the competent authorities. An advanced dual-view X-ray inspection system and explosive trace detector machine has been installed along with a surveillance system. It was completed months ago and are awaiting final clearance from BCAS. We are ready to handle any amount of domestic cargo once it is approved,” said Selva Kumar, adding that low cost carriers used to ferry around six tons of cargo every day from MIA. Selva Kumar said that 90% of domestic cargo received at MIA comes from a security press in Manipal. The cargo is received at the cargo terminal and segregated sector wise. Later, it is sent via road to Kempegowda International Airport and after fulfilling criteria, later it is shipped across the country. “As a result of cargo moving to KIA, it is delayed for 12 hours. There will be no more hassles once MIA Domestic Cargo is given permission and becomes fully functional,” added Selva Kumar. Big push for chilled fish export On the export of chilled fish from the coastal districts of Udupi, Uttara Kannada and Dakshina Kannada, Selva Kumar said, “We have been able to discuss the export opportunities with stakeholders. If all goes well, it may start soon at MIA.” The coastal districts have not been able to make it big in the chilled fish business despite having abundant resources as well as demand in gulf countries. The frozen fish is shipped only from New Mangalore Port Trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/domestic-cargo-ops-at-mia-delayed-due-to-bcas/articleshow/88496174.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The CJI was addressing the audience at Ramineni Foundation awards function held in Hyderabad on Thursday.

The accused had gunned down the duo while they were returning home in a car. Singh was reportedly close to SP leader Azam Khan. Nine people were named in the FIR. Three were acquitted due to lack of sufficient evidence. The court also slapped a cash fine of Rs 78,000 on each accused. Divulging details of the judgment, additional district government counsel Ram Autaar Saini said, “Ten people were charge-sheeted for murder and rioting. The case was heard in the court of additional sessions judge Vijay Kumar, who pronounced seven accused guilty and awarded life imprisonment to six of them." Saini added, "One of the accused, Avaran Singh, who is hospitalised at the moment, has been pronounced guilty and the court will announce conviction after he is discharged. We had produced 15 witnesses and the case was heard on priority.” The incident was reported from Deenpur village under Shahzad Nagar police limits three years ago. Parwat Singh was going to meet someone along with Umrao Singh and Harpal Singh when his car was intercepted by the accused who were on a tractor-trolley. They started firing indiscriminately at Parwat. Harpal somehow managed to move out safely but Parwat and Umrao were killed. An FIR was then registered on the complaint of Parwat’s uncle Naththu Singh Yadav against several suspects.

---||Delhi||Delhi University teachers unhappy with NEP credit, research norms||NEW DELHI: Delhi University teachers’ groups have written to Yogesh Singh, the university’s vice-chancellor, raising strong objections to the two models of the National Education Policy (NEP) framework, which have been sent to the colleges and departments for feedback. Both the models are out of sync with what was passed during the meeting of the statutory bodies, they claim. The framework suggested by DU has reduced the credits to be earned. In the academic and executive councils’ meetings, a decision was taken on students requiring 148 credits for a three-year degree course and 196 credits for a four-year degree programme. However, in one of the models, it is 140 and 184, respectively, while in the other, it is 124 and 164. Reduction of credits will mean loss of academic rigour and change in workload affecting the jobs of teachers, the groups claim. A letter from National Democratic Teachers’ Front (NDTF), which has been signed by 25 teachers, states, “The two new proposed alternatives of course structure have reduced the total number of credits in three years honors courses, which will ultimately result in diluting the course content as well as the teaching workload/teaching positions. In one of the new proposed structures, all the discipline specific courses and general elective papers are reduced to 4 credits instead of 6 credits and there is no scope for practical classes.” They have also claimed dilution of the ability enhancement compulsory courses. Another teacher group, Democratic Teachers’ Front (DTF), stated, “The model 1 framework with 184 credits stipulates-the minimum credit to be earned by a student per semester is 18 credits and maximum is 30 credits. However, students are advised to earn the respective credits per semester as specified in the framework. A student through this provision can either have a four-year degree with as low as 144 credits or as many as 240 credits. This is too huge a variation.” DTF president Nandita Narain said, “Both these drafts do not have provisions for programme courses— BA, BCom and BSc. The one passed by the academic council incorporated these courses under different nomenclature. These courses are amongst the most popular courses for students.” The teachers have also raised objections to the research/project component being included at the mass level. “This will lead to massive plagiarised work at the undergraduate level or its outsourcing,” added Narain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-teachers-unhappy-with-nep-credit-research-norms/articleshow/88497397.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Pune||Water discharge for winter crops begins||Pune: The irrigation department on Saturday started releasing water from the Khadakwasla dam for winter crops. About 4 TMC water would be released in the canal in the next two months. The irrigation department said the city’s ongoing water supply would not be hampered because of the release of water for crops. This is the first rotation of water discharge during winter. Another release will be planned during February, the irrigation department has said. The collective water stock in four dams in Khadakwasla circle was at 25 TMC (85.9%) on Saturday, which was about one TMC less than last year’s stock dams had on same day. The winter release, generally begins in October, has been delayed by almost two months this year. The release has been delayed following sporadic spells of rain received in the downstream areas. An official from the irrigation department said, “Spells of rain were received last month and early December in the rural parts. Hence the water release was postponed. The department has now demanded from rural parts to initiate water release. We have alerted the authorities to keep watch on the water flow and any instances of water theft.” Vijay Patil, an executive engineer at the irrigation department, said, “A total of three rotations of water discharge have been planned as of now. These include two during winter and one in summer. We are trying to save maximum water so that it can be utilized during summer. Instructions are issued to the authorities to stop the discharge after the water requirements of rural areas are met.” The maximum storage capacity of four dams is 29.15 TMC. The PMC annually lifts around 15 TMC water from Khadakwasla. The irrigation department has requested PMC to use water judiciously to avoid water scarcity during summer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/water-discharge-for-winter-crops-begins/articleshow/88496796.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: SC kids shun midday meal after Dalit cook’s ouster||PITHORAGARH: To protest the removal of a Dalit bhojanmata (cook), who was dismissed from a government inter college at Sukhidang village in Champawat after several upper caste students refused to have the meal prepared by her a few days ago, Dalit students of the school have now boycotted the mid-day meal cooked by her replacement, a woman from the suvarna (upper) caste. On Friday, 23 Dalit students of the school refused to have the meals cooked by the bhojanmata and instead got their own lunch from home. The same day, Prem Singh, principal of the school, wrote a letter to the block education officer, apprising him of the entire episode. Taking cognisance of the incident, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has now constituted an inquiry in the matter. When queried about the issue, Himanshu Kafaltia, SDM Tanakpur, said, “The district magistrate has formed a committee which will conduct a fair probe. Also, we will ensure that a bhojanmata is recruited in keeping with all the rules.” TOI had earlier reported that the Dalit woman had joined the school, which has a student strength of 230, as bhojanmata on December 13 but the very next day, several upper caste students refused to eat the meal cooked by her. The chief education officer of the district, RC Purohit, after reviewing the matter, termed the appointment of the Dalit woman illegal, and dismissed her. A parents-teacher association had also alleged that the Dalit bhojanmata was appointed without taking due approval from the deputy education officer. The matter has been brewing since then with villagers in the area increasingly getting divided on caste lines. Differences among the gram sabha members also added to caste-related tensions in the village on Saturday, with five upper-caste gram sabha members tendering their resignations after revolting against the gram pradhan, a Dalit, alleging that he doesn’t take their opinions into account while making decisions. Officials of the Champawat district administration held a meeting with the village administration, following which the gram sabha members took back their resignations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sc-students-refuse-mid-day-meal-to-protest-removal-of-dalit-bhojanmata/articleshow/88495631.cms||Prem Punetha

---||Rajkot||SU takes punitive action against principal, students||RAJKOT: A day after six persons, including a college principal, were arrested by cops for their alleged role in the paper leak, the Saurashtra University (SU) officials on Saturday announced strict punitive measures against the accused. On Friday police had arrested the accused for allegedly leaking the paper of ‘principles of macro-economics-I’ of BCom semester three of SU on Wednesday. Dilawar Qureshi, principal of Sardar Patel Law College in Babra, two other staff of the college and three students were arrested for their alleged role in the paper leak. On Saturday, SU officials declared permanent termination of examination centre at Sardar Patel Law College. The educational recognition of Qureshi — who as the principal of the college had the custody of the paper — was cancelled. SU officials have also initiated the process of cancellation of the law college’s affiliation. Apart from Qureshi, the cops had arrested Rahul Panchasara, clerk of this college, Bhikhu Sejaliya peon of this college. The three arrested students were identified as Paras Rajgor, Divyesh Dhaduk and Elish Chovatiya. The SU in a statement said that enrollment of all the three students involved in the paper leak will also be cancelled. Apart from universities across the country, the Bar Council of India will also be informed about these students and the college, the statement added. But many are saying that the university officials, who must be blamed equally for the paper leak, are trying to escape their responsibilities by announcing strict punishments. Police officials investigating the case too echoed similar sentiments. “After sending question papers to respective exam centres, the SU officials don’t bother to check if rules and prescribed procedures are being followed or not. The seals should be opened in presence of four to five persons, including SU observers, and the entire process should be video recorded. Nobody in the SU bothers to monitor this,” a police official said.  The cops are now investigating if the accused had leaked more papers in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/su-takes-punitive-action-against-principal-students/articleshow/88496690.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi second most polluted city in country, not much hope soon||NEW DELHI: Hoping for rain that is likely over the next 24 hours to improve its worsening air quality, the national capital on Saturday turned out to be the second most polluted city of the country in terms of air pollution. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) on Saturday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 431 against 415 a day earlier and 423 a day before that. Track the pollution level in your cityOn Saturday, while the air quality saw some sign of improvement over the daytime, sudden spike in the moisture levels towards evening hours led to the accumulation of the pollutants. The national capital had been recording severe air quality since December 21 as an active western disturbance let to a drop in the wind speed and rise in humidity, which accounts for the meteorological factors responsible for poor ventilation and more accumulation of the pollutants being generated locally and from neighbouring NCR towns. The particle pollutants, primarily PM2.5, which saw slight improvement earlier also, worsened. The PM2.5 worsened from 240.4 micrograms per cubic metres towards the daytime to 289.6 units by 9pm, against a safe limit of 60 units. According to SAFAR, the air quality is likely to remain within severe or very poor levels for next two days. “For the next two days (26th and 27th), winds are likely to be low, reducing the ventilation of pollutants. Light rainfall due to western disturbance is likely tomorrow afternoon. AQI is expected to be in ‘upper end of very poor’ or ‘lower end of severe’ category for the next two days. From December 28, improvement in air quality is likely due to relatively high wind speed during day time. However, gradual dropping of minimum temperature from December 28 enhances accumulation of pollutants during night time. Mixing layer height continues to be low (less than 1.0km). The net effect is that AQI tends to be within ‘very poor’ range,” a statement from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Friday said. On Saturday, the local transport, industries, residential emissions, construction remained the major contributed to city’s overall PM2.5, while in NCR, the major contributors were Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Bulandshahr. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city is likely to see light to moderate rain on December 26 evening or afternoon. “There are chances of drizzling on December 27 as well. The easterly winds will continue till December 28,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. “The cleaning of the pollution levels will depend on the intensity of the rainfall,” said another weather official. On Saturday, the city recorded maximum and minimum temperatures of 23.6 degrees Celsius and 7 degrees Celsius, respectively, against 22.9 and 6.9 degrees Celsius a day earlier. According to IMD, the maximum and minimum are likely to hover around 22 and 8 degrees Celsius on Sunday, along with rain or thundershower towards the second half of the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-2nd-most-polluted-city-in-country-not-much-hope-soon/articleshow/88497431.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Sanghvi, who is the CEO of Alumbra Entertainment, is one of the partners in a construction firm, along with Jitendra Jain, the director of Kamla Landmarc. Jain was arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in 2016 for allegedly cheating home buyers; later, multiple FIRs were registered against him and his company. Sanghvi, arrested on Monday by a special investigating team (SIT) of the EOW, was on Saturday produced before the holiday court. His judicial custody will be till January 7. During the course of investigations, the police had summoned Sanghvi’s chartered accountant, who was asked to produce documents including Sanghvi and his firm’s balance sheet, bank statement, transaction invoices, and income tax returns. “While reviewing the documents, the accused informed us that the money received from Kamla Landmarc was transferred to the firm PB Lifestyle. He then allegedly invested money in four different companies in which he suffered huge losses,” said an officer.  The police said that in all, five offences are registered against Sanghvi. He has been charge-sheeted in two; three are pending, said the police. The fresh case pertains to a complaint by Sujal Developers, who had purchased three flats in 2013 at Turner Road from Kamla Infra and Kamla Landmarc Properties, both companies belonging to the Kamla Landmarc Group. On Jain’s request, the complainant rented out the three flats to Alumbra and Metalica Pvt Ltd. Though the flats were on rent, without the complainant's knowledge, Jain, Sanghvi and a few others sold these to a third party and caused an alleged loss of over Rs 13.7 crore. “At the time of purchase, Jain had offered the complainant handsome rents for these units. An 11-month leave and license agreement for three units was signed between the complainant and Jain’s sister companies, Alumbra and Metallica,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-producer-held-in-13-7cr-hsg-fraud-now-in-judicial-custody/articleshow/88497423.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Delhi||July date for study to identify real-time pollution sources in Delhi's air||NEW DELHI: A project involving a real-time source apportionment study to identify the sources of pollutants in Delhi’s air will become operational in July 2022. Though Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT Kanpur in October this year for the study, officials said they were in the process of buying equipment for the study and developing indigenous software for the interpretation of data. Track the pollution level in your cityThe project will identify the sources of pollution at a location on an hourly basis and forecast the contribution of different sources in the next three or seven days. It will help identify the factors responsible for the spike in air pollution at any particular spot and reveal the real-time impact of various pollution sources like vehicles, dust, biomass burning and emissions from industries. Based on the results, the authorities concerned will be able to take the necessary actions to curb the sources of pollution. An official associated with the project said, “We are in the process of procuring the equipment for the project. The team from IIT Kanpur is developing an indigenous software for interpreting data and an emission inventory for NCR is being prepared.” According to officials, the source apportionment will be done at one site where the laboratory will be set up. This site will be called the super site. Besides, a mobile laboratory will be deployed at different locations periodically to know the contribution of sources. The mobile laboratory will be stationed at a site for at least three days and then sent to other areas and hotspots of the city. A DPCC official said, “The project will begin from next year. Once the main site is selected, the field work will start.” Mukesh Sharma, a scientist at IIT Kanpur who is leading the study, said, “The project is expected to start from July next year. We will provide hour-to-hour sources of pollution and later compile detailed daily and weekly reports on different sources.” He added, “We will also forecast the air quality and predict how much different sources will be contributing to Delhi’s pollution in the next three to seven days.” Apart from IIT Kanpur, The Energy and Resource Institute, IIT Delhi, IISER Mohali and AirShed Planning Professional will provide technical support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/july-date-for-study-to-identify-real-time-pollution-sources/articleshow/88497437.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Shashank Chaudhary, a resident of Mandawali village, said, "People were informed that a chopper would do 'pushp varsha' on them around 12:30 pm on Saturday. We enjoyed the moment while sitting on our terrace at home. Chaudhary's move was a unique attempt to garner attention of the public. No one has done this before in Bijnor." This is not the first time that Chaudhary hired a helicopter for showering flowers. He had hired one during the Ganga snan in November but the same helicopter was booked by another BJP leader, Sakendra Pratap Singh, who is the present district panchayat board chairman. Both leaders were at loggerheads with each other as the two wanted to shower petals on lakhs of devotees who congregated on the banks of the Ganga to take the holy dip. The programme was later cancelled. Sakendra Chaudhary's supporters later filed an FIR against the helicopter firm on charges of cheating. The chopper was not allowed to take off until the company returned the advance payment. Lately, there has been a tug of war among BJP leaders to stake claim to a BJP poll ticket in Bijnor assembly segment. Suchi Chaudhary is the sitting MLA in Bijnor. According to a senior BJP leader who did not wish to be named, there are over 20 contenders for the party ticket, including MLA Suchi Chaudhary, Sitaram Singh Rana, Prince Chaudhary, Vinod Rathi, Birbal Singh, former district president Tejpal Verma, Ranjit Singh, Vinay Rana, Manju Chaudhary, Kavita Chaudhary and Ravendra Singh. There are over 26.4 lakh voters in the district with eight assembly segments. BJP had won six seats out of eight in Bijnor district during the last assembly election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bjp-man-showers-flowers-from-chopper-on-atals-birth-anniv/articleshow/88496229.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Madurai||HC dismisses plea to include SCs on Palamedu jallikattu committee||MADURAI: Madras high court has dismissed a plea which sought a direction to permit members of all scheduled caste communities, particularly those of paraiyar community, to be on the organising committee to be constituted for the conduct of jallikattu at Palamedu in Madurai district. The court was hearing a petition filed by Alagu. According to the petitioner, around 1,000 people belong to the paraiyar community in Palamedu village. However, not even a single person of the community got representation in the organising committee named ‘Grama Pothu Mahalinga Swamy Madathu Committee’, despite their continuous requests to be included in the jallikattu conducted in the previous years. A division bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan said that the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017, which came into force on January 21, 2017, defines jallikattu. The act further mentions that jallikattu is conducted with a view to following and promoting tradition, culture and safeguarding the native breeds of bulls. The judges said that in consonance with the act, Tamil Nadu Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Conduct of Jallikattu) Rules, 2017, were also framed, which prescribe rules for the conduct of jallikattu. Accordingly, the collector should constitute a committee headed by officials from revenue, animal husbandry, health and police departments to monitor its conduct. The judge said that the rules also allow the constitution of an organising committee, which may be an individual, organisation or a group. Such organisers should also obtain prior permission from the collector. The relief sought by the petitioner to include the scheduled caste communities in organising jallikattu would not come under the above said rules, since only the collector can constitute a committee. If at all the petitioner is aggrieved, he may approach the collector, said the judges. Observing that the court cannot specifically give a direction to include any particular caste or community to be part of the jallikattu organising committee, the judges dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-to-include-scs-on-palamedu-jallikattu-committee/articleshow/88497428.cms||---

Wazir, who was arrested early this month for allegedly extorting Rs 3.25 crore from a sugar factory owner after honey-trapping him, had taken the bracelet from the Bandra jeweller without paying him. Police said that they recovered the bracelet from Andheri jeweller Shailesh Jain. Jain admitted that Wazir had sold him the bracelet for Rs 10 lakh, police said.  Sources said Jain also told them that in the past, too, he had purchased gold ornaments from Wazir. The police are likely to make him a witness in the case. The Crime Branch unit 10 had last week arrested Wazir for duping a Bandra jeweller. He said that Wazir, posing as a celebrity, came to his shop on Turner Road bought some jewellery to win his trust. Later, one day, she arrived in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, and on the pretext of showing jewellery to her husband, she took a diamond-studded gold bracelet worth Rs 28 lakh and never returned it.  “She started giving false excuses and later refused to give any money,” said an officer. The jeweller later lodged a complaint with the Bandra police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-28l-bracelet-sold-by-con-woman-in-honeytrap-recovered/articleshow/88497441.cms||Ahmed Ali

Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said the deputy commissioner of police has issued no notification to impose restrictions on BS-III vehicles under the Delhi Control of Vehicular and Other Traffic on Road and Streets Regulations of 1980 for such permits and the authorities have “merely omitted to provide an option in the drop-down menu of the online portal.” The court also noted that authorities have “neither issued any order or notification nor issued any direction but have simply omitted the option for applying in the drop-down menu on the online portal, the action of the respondents cannot be sustained.” Justice Sachdeva was hearing a petition filed by the Foundation of Azadpur Tempo and Truck Welfare, and pointed out that merely because a vehicle is BS-III compliant and not BS-IV or above compliant, it will not achieve the object of reducing congestion on roads. The petitioner sought directions to Delhi government and Delhi Police to permit the owners of BS-III compliant commercial diesel vehicles to apply for grant or renewal of “all-time no entry permission” to operate their vehicles in the capital for supplying essential commodities such as fruits and vegetables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/portal-relief-likely-for-bs-iii-vehicles/articleshow/88497453.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Status quo on alignment work of Ambil Odha||Pune: The Bombay high court has ordered a status quo on the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s work to straighten the alignment of Ambil Odha, a natural stream that flows through parts of the city, in response to a writ petition filed by activists Kishor Kamble and Meghraj Nimbalkar. “Until the next date, status quo as of today in the respect of the work of straightening the alignment of the stream shall be maintained,” the HC bench of Justice A A Sayed and Justice Abhay Ahuja said in an order on December 23 and posted the matter for next hearing on January 10, 2022. Nisha Chavan, the PMC’s officiating chief law officer, told TOI, “We will go for an appeal against the status quo order. Our advocate has requested the court to keep the matter high on board as it is urgent.” The petitioner’s grievance is that the PMC is in the process of altering alignment of Ambil Odha by straightening it, thereby affecting the natural curved alignment of the stream. The bench observed, “We note that in the report of PriMove Infrastructure Development Consultants Private Limited (hired by the PMC) dated April 2020, it is interalia recommended in clause 6.1 – ‘Avoid diverting natural nallas / stream’ (page 94 of the petition).” The bench then went on to order the status quo. Both Kamble and Nimbalkar, told TOI, “The PMC has not followed the provisions of the MRTP Act and the Development Plan Control Rules while going ahead with the plan to straighten the course of Ambil Odha. The PMC has also not completed the necessary procedures required to initiate the work. After witnessing lapses in the process and violation of acts, we approached the HC.” Nimbalkar said, “We are also concerned that a change in the course of Ambil Odha will increase the velocity of water and it will likely lead to flooding in the area. A report by a private firm that the PMC is using to justify the change in the alignment of the Ambil Odha has itself recommended that the natural course of the water body should not be diverted.” According to Kamble, “The PMC was supposed to obtain the hydraulic feasibility report, but the work was initiated before obtaining it. The PMC has also not sought the permission of the director of the state town planning department. The PMC has no right to change the course of natural nullah”. Anant Gharat, a local activist, said that the PMC did not take local residents into confidence while going ahead with the plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/status-quo-on-alignment-work-of-ambil-odha/articleshow/88496825.cms||Sarang Dastane

Shahnawaz Ali, also wanted in 13 other cases, had fled after securing bail from the high court and was living in Jammu and Kashmir, selling socks and woollen scarves in the local market. He was brought back to Saharanpur on Friday. SP City (Saharanpur) Rajesh Kumar said that Shahnawaz had killed a person named Ahmed Ali, who was his own aide, in 1991. He was immediately arrested. “The cops managed to recover the crime weapon and collect sufficient evidence against him. The chargesheet was filed in the court in two months. After a trial of three years, the local court in Saharanpur awarded life imprisonment to the accused,” Kumar added. During the trial, Shahnawaz had served four years in jail, from 1991 to 1995. His lawyers applied for bail in Allahabad HC in 1995 from where he managed to get the same but on the condition of turning up before the court, whenever required. “The accused, however, took advantage of the bail and fled. When he didn’t turn up for hearing for several months, the court issued a non-bailable warrant against him. The police also placed Rs 25,000 on his head,” the senior cop said. “We arrested him after a tip-off and he has been sent to judicial custody,” the SP City said, adding that more sections will be added against him in the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/murder-accused-arrested-after-26-years-he-was-living-in-jk/articleshow/88496255.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Truth-vigilantes help break the chain of viral fake news with Times Verified||"Crypto banned as a currency, worldwide”. This was among thousands of forwarded messages ranging from “Indian judiciary forced Twitter to change their CEO to an Indian” to “Elon Musk to sell his shares to an Indian origin businessman” that TOI busted as fake through its campaign ‘Times Verified’. Launched in West and South India on November 21, the initiative—which was born in Mumbai on April 17—aims to break the chain of viral misinformation and disinformation that has been infecting social media groups in the backdrop of a mutating virus. Under this campaign, readers send unverified or suspicious messages doing the rounds on social media on the WhatsApp number 9819888887 and our expert panel—comprising reporters, editors and representatives from the BMC and the government—tap into their sources to verify its credibility. Since last month, TOI has received over 13,000 messages of which 40% have been verified. “This message is fake,” cried the bold red stamp sent by our panel in response to dubious messages including the recent: “All petrol pumps to have EV chargers by 1st March, 2022.” In an email interview, US-based physician Dr Seema Yasmin—whose book speaks about how misinformation spreads faster than microbes in times of crisis—had told TOI that the rapid spread of false information during a pandemic can cost people their lives. In this scenario, the job of our “chain-breakers”—readers who have been forwarding dubious messages to help TOI identify red flags and vaccinate you with the truth—becomes significant. Among these vigilant chain-breakers are Tamil Nadu’s S Arvindan who helped us bust the message: “Commercial food brands add flavour enhancers containing aborted foetal cells” and Maharashtra’s Reina Gidwani who brought to our notice this suspicious headline: “Maharashtra government to provide free rides for single women to reach home at night from 10pm to 6am”. If Karnataka’s K Narayana alerted us to the fake message “Karnataka police have added location trackers for all auto rickshaws for women safety”, Delhi’s Abhay Garg helped us call out this falsehood: “If you go from one place to an-other and come back within 12 hours, you will not be charged anything at the toll booths.” To join the chain-breaking brigade, send dubious news circulated on social media to our expert panel and let the green tick in the Times Verified logo counter the tyranny of the grey curved arrow of forwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/truth-vigilantes-help-break-the-chain-of-viral-fake-news-with-times-verified/articleshow/88497452.cms||---

Four labourers carried out a stunning heavy-duty robbery assaulting two security guards, mounting three heavy conductor drums weighing 15 tonnes of high-tension electricity wires using a crane on a truck and then selling the heavy aluminium wires all the way in Kolkata! And the local crime branch (LCB) in Anand got a severe jolt when the robbery came to light on December 16.  Investigation in the robbery reported from the outskirts of Palaj village in Petlad taluka of Anand district has revealed that all the accused were labourers working at a site where Unitech Power Transmission Limited (UPTL), the leading engineering and turnkey contracting company, was laying high-tension line. Accused were working for a contractual job of laying the high-tension transmission line, said cops. “After tying the security guards at the site, the accused had hired the crane claiming that they had to shift the heavy conductor drums to another location,” said LCB police inspector K G Chaudhary. The conductor drums are valued at Rs 24 lakh.  Each conductor drum weighed 5 tonnes. “Using the crane, the conductor drums were lifted and mounted on a Eicher truck,” he said, adding that CCTV footage has revealed how the accused fled with the conductor drums from the site. Cops have arrested Sadiqali Muslim, a 27-year-old labourer, who was staying in a tobacco factory, located just behind the factory premises. The three other accused on the run have been identified as Naseerali Sabedali Muslim, Barkatali Muslim and Atabur Alamali Muslim, native of Rampur village in Purnia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/labourers-use-crane-to-steal-15-tonne-high-tension-wires/articleshow/88496890.cms||---

This is the second protest by these teachers working in Delhi government schools demanding a policy towards their regularisation. Regularisation of around 22,000 teachers in the schools was a promise made by Aam Aadmi Party government during the election. The government tried to introduce a bill and then a policy towards their regularisation. However, it did not get cleared from LG’s office. Now, as the chief minister promised regularisation of teachers in poll-bound Punjab, the teachers here have renewed and revived their demands. On Thursday, the government had announced that they will be increasing the salary of teachers, after Sisodia met another group of guest teachers. On Saturday, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Anil Kumar also joined the protest extending the party’s support to the demands of guest teachers. In the protest held earlier outside the CM’s residence, Congress leader Navjot Singh Siddhu had joined the teachers. “The guest teachers have been betrayed as they have not been regularised despite AAP promising to do so in its three election manifestoes,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/guest-teachers-protest-again/articleshow/88497492.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

All churches were decked up with bright and colourful lights from Friday evening to welcome the faithful for midnight mass.

Hand sanitisers were given to them before entering churches. "Every year, we would visit the church for midnight mass to ring in Christmas. But last year, we could not because of Covid norms. This year, we are happy that we could visit the church and offer prayers,” said Philomina Kumar of Peelamedu. At home, Christians exchanged cakes and sweets with their neighbours, spreading the joy of Jesus’s birth. Houses were also decorated with bright lights.

As many as 75 students of Rathinam College of Arts and Science and Dr NGP College of Arts and Science in Coimbatore visited the Waterfall Estate in Valparai to kickstart the drive with the help of Anamalai Tiger Reserve deputy field director M G Ganesan and Monombolly forest range officer A Manikandan. The alien plant was introduced here as an insect repellent, said Ganesan. “It was planted around tea estates to protect tea plants from insects. Now, the invasive species has spread across shola forests that provide green fodder to elephants. The alien species has shrunk shola forests,” he told TOI. The department sought the help of college students as it lacked manpower to destroy the plant. “Each plant produces 300 flowers and each flower has 60 seeds. Our aim is to destroy the flowers to check the spread of the plants. We collected one tonne flowers on Saturday. The flowers will be torched on Sunday,” said Ganesan. The department plans to rope in 1,000 volunteers to destroy the plants in two weeks. “Only then can we protect shola forests. The alien species has started to spread across Ulandhi forest range also,” the official added. As it lacks money to feed the volunteers for two weeks, the department is seeking help of eco-conscious entrepreneurs and NGOs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wanted-more-hands-to-weed-out-alien-plant/articleshow/88496828.cms||A Subburaj

Citing official data, councilors pointed out that the expenses incurred on diesel for the collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) increased by Rs 2 crore in the period between September and November this year as against the expenses for the same period last year. However, the data compiled by the AMC suggests that the quantity of garbage collected decreased by 3,392 metric tonnes. This was also reflected in the drop in city’s ranking in the central government's annual all-India cleanliness survey, Swachh Survekshan 2021, with Agra city dropping to 24th rank from 16 position in 2021. Similarly, its ranking in UP also slipped from second position in 2020 to fourth this year. According to the AMC records, last year from September to November, a total 62,035 metric tonnes of solid waste was collected from the 100 municipal wards of the city and ferried to the Kuberpur landfill site. During the same period in 2021, 58,643 metric tonnes of MSW was collected. However, the consumption of diesel increased by 2,17,122 litres costing over Rs 2 crore as against last year. As compared to last year, diesel consumption increased from 1,40,143 liters to 2,22,458 in September, 1,53,474 to 2,32,267 in October and 1,51,875 to 2,07,889 in November, this year. Besides a decline in garbage collection, AMC diesel consumption on fogging gas also significantly rose. According to the AMC records, 57,835 litres of diesel was consumed in fogging exercise from September 1 to December 15 last year. During the same period in 2021, diesel consumed for fogging increased by 33,505 litres to 91,340 litres. Smelling a rat, Motiganj councilor Rakesh Jain said, “AMC officials have no valid answer to justify the increase in diesel consumption when there has been a decrease in the quantity of garbage collected. City’s rank in the cleanliness survey has also fallen. Fogging was also not properly done as people across the city suffered from vector-borne diseases”. Mayor Naveen Jain said, “Taking cognizance of the issue highlighted by the councilors, the additional municipal commissioner has been directed to investigate the high expenditure on diesel. Strict action will be taken against those found involved in malpractices. We are working on various plans to improve the garbage collection in the city” ReplyReply allForward||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rs-2-cr-scam-in-garbage-collection-by-amc-suspected-probe-ordered/articleshow/88496319.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Agra||SP plundered Uttar Pradesh, appeased one community: CM Yogi Adityanath||AGRA: Launching a scathing attack on opposition parties, especially Samajwadi Party, in the wake of seizure of around Rs 175 crore unaccounted money from an alleged loyalist of party president Akhilesh Yadav by a team of directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI), Ahmedabad, in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday accused the former chief minister of “plundering” the state when SP was in power. “They have been out of power for several years but still have unaccounted money with them. The seizure proved that SP is corrupt,” said Yogi while addressing a public rally here. “Instead of working for the people, they pocketed public money. They could have given free ration to the people as BJP has done, but they preferred to amass public money through illegal means,” said the CM. Accusing the previous government of appeasing only one community, the CM said, “Instead of appointing Sanskrit teachers in schools, they had spent money on appointing Urdu translators and making cemeteries.” The CM was in Agra’s Bateshwar, the native village of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to lay the foundation stone of around 11 public welfare projects worth Rs 230 crore on the birth anniversary of the former PM. The CM announced that his government would develop Bateshwar as a pilgrimage site. “Atal Ji was the one who had started the free ration scheme and construction of highways," said Yogi. He also inaugurated a photo exhibition on Vajpayee. The DGGI team recovered Rs 175 crore unaccounted cash from the residence of Kanpur businessman Piyush Jain. The raid on Jain's premises in Kannauj was on and the recovered sum is likely to increase. The sources in the department said as many as 11 premises of three persons, including two partners of Jain, were searched on Thursday and Friday. The premises included factory outlets, offices, cold storages and petrol pumps of perfume trader Piyush Jain and his partners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sp-plundered-up-appeased-one-community-yogi/articleshow/88496341.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The priests claimed her dance moves in the video are "obscene" and has maligned the image of Brajbhoomi. A Hindutva organisation also staged a protest and shouted slogans against the actor on Saturday. Members of the organisation also filed a police complaint demanding that an FIR be filed against her. Superintendent of police (city) MP Singh said no FIR has been registered so far. “Such videos should be banned and the actor must tender a public apology for her act. We cannot tolerate obscenity in the name of ‘Radha Rani’,” said Mahamandleshwar Yogi Naval Giri of Vrindavan. He added that they will write a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the matter. Expressing similar views, Mohini Bihari Sharan Maharaj from Vrindavan Chatur Sampraday said it (dance video) had hurt the religious sentiments of the entire community. “This is the cheapest form of gaining publicity in the name of Radha Rani,” he said, adding if the government doesn’t ban the song, they will approach court. President of Sri Krishna Sena, Sanjeev Singh baba, said, “The dance video has maligned the image of Brajbhoomi. We have filed a police complaint against her urging that an FIR be registered in the matter.” The video album, titled ‘Madhuban’, was released by Saregama Music on Wednesday featuring Sunny Leone, and sung by Kanika Kapoor and Arindam Chakraborty. The song was originally sung by Mohammed Rafi for the 1960 film Kohinoor.

Lobo is the wife of science and technology minister and BJP’s Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, who also joined her in a door-to-door campaign in Siolim. The Lobo couple has started distributing a manifesto for Siolim. “I appeal to all Siolim voters to vote for change this time, I will come with my symbol very soon,” she said. The Lobos visited a temple and church before beginning their campaign. They also said that a detailed manifesto would soon follow. “We have mentioned some development work (in the manifesto) which have already started in the constituency, including a ground, a badminton court, a cricket pitch, and started work in the education sector,” he said. Delilah has been in active politics since 2007, as a panch, and has served as Parra sarpanch for the past 10 years. “We are asking for your valuable vote, and we will give you development that you have wanted to see for the last 25 years,” the minister said, adding that the people should give them “one opportunity to work”. In 2017, Michael had said that Delilah wanted to contest from Saligao, but that former CM and Union defence minister Manohar Parrikar visited his residence and convinced her not to. Last month, Michael said that both Delilah and he would contest the upcoming assembly election on the same party ticket. Michael wants to contest from Calangute (which he currently represents). “We will not hurt anybody,” Michael said. “We will give what is required for the people in Siolim constituency, including personal and village development.” For almost six months now, Michael has kept BJP guessing on whether he will continue in the party or join another, to contest the 2022 election. Recently, Michael said that he is ready to leave BJP if the party does not want him, and that he would win six out of seven seats in Bardez. He made the comment after meeting BJP’s Goa election in-charge and former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjps-lobo-couple-launch-own-poll-campaign-in-siolim/articleshow/88511097.cms||---

On Saturday evening, Harak Rawat met chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami at the latter’s residence and a consensus was reached, according to sources. The two leaders also had dinner together. BJP state chief Madan Kaushik, health minister Dhan Singh Rawat, Raipur MLA Umesh Sharma Kau and Uttarakhand BJP general secretary Ajay Kumar were also present at the meeting. Before the in-person meeting, Harak and Dhami also had a telephonic conversation. “During the conversation, the chief minister assured Harak Rawat of paying immediate attention to his demands. Later, Harak reaffirmed that he was a true soldier of the BJP,” the source added. Earlier in the day, Kau had also dismissed the rumours of Harak Singh Rawat tendering his resignation. He told reporters, “Harak Rawat raised some crucial issues pertaining to his constituency in the meeting. His disappointment was justified as he has been working towards delivering on his promise of establishing a medical college in Kotdwar for a long time now. The chief minister has agreed to his demands and a government order regarding the same would be issued on Monday.” Notably, there have been widespread speculations that Harak Rawat and Kau, along with a few other former Congress MLAs who had joined the saffron party after revolting against then-CM Harish Rawat in 2016, are now planning a ‘ghar vapsi’ ahead of the polls scheduled next year. Kau has dismissed the assumptions, claiming that ‘all issues are resolved’ although Harak himself has not yet spoken on the matter. The speculations of Harak joining the Congress ahead of assembly polls had started after he was spotted with leader of opposition Pritam Singh a few times. Later, Harak and Singh flew to Delhi in the same airplane, further fueling the speculations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/uttarakhand/news/uttarakhand-bjp-manages-to-keep-flock-together-for-now/articleshow/88755764.cms||Kautilya Singh

The HC held that the cabinet minister acted within his powers to delegate the matter to the junior minister. The bench of Justice S V Gangapurvala and Justice S G Dige on December 23 directed all parties to appear before the minister of state in the proceedings. Beed civic council president Bharat Bhushan Kshirsagar had moved the HC challenging the cabinet minister’s communication of March 3, transferring the hearing before the minister of state, and a March 5 communication that asked for a report on Kshirsagar from the Beed district collector. The petitioner had argued, among other things, that the complaint for his removal filed by NCP MLA Sandip Kshirsagar before the cabinet minister was politically motivated to settle political and personal scores as he (Bharat) is the brother of a Shiv Sena functionary. The minister of state to whom the matter has been transferred, represents the NCP whereas the cabinet minister represents the Shiv Sena. He also argued that as per the rules of business made by the Governor, the cabinet minister had no powers to delegate quasi-judicial hearings to the junior minister. Besides, the district collector in the past had thrice filed reports with the government, exonerating him from any misconduct as alleged by the complainant-MLA. The HC, after hearing both sides and referring to citations, held that the delegation of hearing was permissible as the rules of business are directory in nature and not mandatory. The only exception being the case involving financial implications wherein then the business rules are mandatory. “The procedural rules made by the Governor for the convenient transaction of business of the state government apply also to quasi-judicial acts, provided those rules conform to the principles of judicial procedure. ……. the Governor of Maharashtra issued instructions for more convenient transaction of the rules of business of the Government of Maharashtra.” “Clause 4 of the said instructions permits the Minister In-charge by means of Standing Order to give such directions as he thinks fit for disposal of cases in the department. In the light of said clause, the Minister In-charge was within his powers to delegate and/or transmit the matter to the Minister of State. It cannot be said that he did not possess the power to delegate or transmit the matter to the Minister of State. The said powers seem to be legitimately complied,” the bench held. On the March 5 communication seeking collector’s report, the HC said, “Merely because for more than two times reports are called itself would not be sufficient to quash the reports or the proceedings. The petitioner will have every opportunity to controvert the report from the Collector, if it is against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mins-move-to-delegate-hearing-to-jr-min-upheld/articleshow/88495767.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Pune||Experts flag ‘grey area drinking’ among a section of those on WFH||Pune: Wellness experts, doctors and counsellors have expressed concerns over a growing tendency of “grey area drinking” among a section of professionals working from home in the time of the Covid. Poddar Wellness director Prakriti Poddar says “grey area drinking” falls between the extremes of alcohol abuse and occasional drinking. “Grey-area drinking usually progresses over time if a person is not mindful and starts drinking more than usual. With time, the person builds alcohol tolerance, thus needing to drink more to feel a buzz. Slowly, it can turn to full-fledged alcoholism,” says Poddar. Most “grey-area drinkers” are in denial of their habits, says Mukta Puntambekar, director of Muktangan Rehabilitation Centre. “The most important sign is when family members are concerned about the increase in alcohol consumption. Drinkers cannot accept their drinking pattern has changed or is worrying and hence are difficult to counsel,” says Puntambekar. Other important signs include drinking alone, frequently waking up with hangovers, experiencing withdrawal symptoms, weight gain or loss and other medical problems, says Puntambekar. Counsellor Bhoomi Kanojia feels that the pandemic has caused an increase in “grey area drinkers” among professionals aged between 20 and 40 years due to less supervision during work, and older people aged between 40 and 55 coping with the stress of the pandemic. General physician Prathamesh Sonawar is of the opinion that not being able to socialise with friends or colleagues in the evenings or weekends led more people to drink at home during last year’s lockdown. “Having the time and freedom to do so while working online can develop into a habit, which, if left unchecked, can lead to health problems, says Sonawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-flag-grey-area-drinking-among-a-section-of-those-on-wfh/articleshow/88496893.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The two people, who have been arrested for possessing the swords, have been identified as Mohammad Mehmood Abdul Rashid Ansari alias Mastan, a resident of Kamalpura, and Mohammad Bilal Shabbir Ahmed alias Bilal Dada, a resident of Islampura. The raid was conducted after the superintendent of police (Nashik rural) Sachin Patil got a tip-off that the duo was carrying the swords with them illegally. Patil immediately instructed the additional superintendent of police (Malegaon) Chandrakant Khandvi to verify the information and take action. Subsequently, the Malegaon police prepared a team under senior officers of Malegaon city police station after which a raid was conducted at a shop near Dalwala Chowk in Mominpura area. The two people have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Arms Act and Maharashtra Police Act. The police said they were investigating the case to find out from where the duo had procured the swords and purpose for it. Khandvi said the suspects were produced before a court that remanded them in five days of police custody. Prima facie it appears that the swords were procured from out of the state. Both of the accused have serious offences registered against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/malegaon-police-arrest-two-people-30-swords-seized-in-a-raid/articleshow/88495783.cms||---

Similar restrictions have been imposed in Mussoorie as well. The decision comes in the backdrop of Delhi and Haryana banning gatherings during the festive weekends and Uttar Pradesh imposing a night curfew from 11pm to 5am. In his order, Dehradun district magistrate (DM), R Rajesh Kumar, said, “Christmas and New Year’s eve events should conclude by 10pm. Organisers are required to follow strict Covid protocols and guidelines. Tourists should carry full vaccination certificates or a negative RT-PCR report not more than 72 hrs old.” There has been an increase in demand for parties during the festive weekends, organisers said. “For Christmas eve, we had reservation requests a week before. Similarly, we are already booked for New Year’s eve. People are mainly coming from Delhi-NCR,” said a pub manager. The festivities had been subdued last year because of which more people are venturing out this year, hoteliers said. On Saturday, hill towns like Mussoorie and Nainital were buzzing with tourists. In Mussoorie, the district administration has issued guidelines under which it is mandatory for hoteliers to ensure that the guests checking in should either be double vaccinated or carry a negative RT-PCR report.Sanjay Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Hotels' Association, said, “Hoteliers will strictly follow the guidelines. This is important for the safety of guests as well as of our staff." Meanwhile, in Nainital, where no night curbs have been placed, hoteliers said they are almost 80% booked for the New Year weekend. DM Dheeraj Garbiyal said that tourists have been asked to come with either a negative RT-PCR report or a double vaccination certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cap-of-100-guests-for-ny-parties-in-doon-mussoorie-festivities-allowed-only-till-10-pm/articleshow/88496375.cms||---

The company has begun the process of uploading steel girders over the lower deck’s pillars and casting the upper deck’s pillars. Following his appointment as Saran district magistrate, Rajesh Meena had directed the construction company and the officials concerned to expedite the flyover work by resolving the bottlenecks in November. Sushil Kumar, the executive engineer of Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited which is the flyover project’s executing agency, told this reporter that ramps would be constructed at Municipal Chowk to connect Thana Chowk (towards the southern side) and Gandhi Chowk to connect Nehru Chowk (towards the northern side). “To accomplish this, the district administration has been tasked with acquiring necessary land in both locations,” he explained. The proposed alignment will begin at Police Lines and end near Rajendra Sarowar on the town’s western outskirts, passing through Gandhi Chowk and Rajendra Chowk. The flyover’s lower deck is intended to be used by vehicles approaching from the east, including Patna and Hajipur. On the other hand, the upper deck will terminate near the bus stop and will be used by vehicles arriving from Siwan, Baniapur, and Uttar Pradesh, among other places. For the purpose of construction, the 3.5km-long double-decker flyover has been divided into five zones — Bhikhari Thakur Chowk to Gandhi Chowk (1265.50m), Gandhi Chowk to Katahari Bag (197.40m), Katahari Bag to Salempur Chowk (951.30m), Municipal Chowk to Rajendra Sarowar (661.20m), and Rajendra Sarowar to bus stand (427.70m). Dineshwar Pathak, the deputy general manager of the construction firm, stated that the width of the flyover’s lower and upper decks would be 5.5m, while the road on the ground would be 8m wide. “The flyover will have a height of 7.5m between its two decks and a total height of 15m above ground. Drainage must be constructed on both flanks,” he added. In July 2018, chief minister Nitish Kumar had laid the foundation for the double-decker flyover. The ambitious project, which is being funded to the tune of Rs 411.32 crore, was initially scheduled to be completed by June 2022 but has been pushed back to 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/double-decker-flyover-project-gathers-momentum-in-chhapra/articleshow/88496396.cms||H K Verma

Apart from the concern of ensuring every guests at the wedding ceremony is fully vaccinated, the owners will also have to ensure that the wedding halls and lawns are empty by 9 pm.. There are close to 400 wedding halls and lawns spread all over the district. Sunil Chopda, the president of the Nashik Wedding Halls and Lawns Association, said, most of the wedding halls have been booked as there are still some muhurats until the end of 2021. After that, the wedding season begins from January 18 and it will continue right till May-end. “As of now, the concern among many wedding hall owners is to call up the parties, who have booked the halls/lawns and inform them about the new guidelines issued by the government,” he added. As per the new guidelines, the total number of attendees at any moment should not exceed 100 for enclosed spaces (like banquet and marriage halls, etc) and 250 for open spaces, or 25 % of the capacity of such spaces. Many owners said the restrictions imposed would hit them financially as well. “This happened during the second wave when the restrictions came into force. Many parties opted to conduct the wedding in farm houses or smaller locations due to the restrictions that were imposed for guests. When there are fewer guests, the wedding parties do not spend on decoration or opt for bigger catering services. Hence the business of decorators and catering services is also badly hit,” said Upendra Bhilare, a decorator of Nashik Road area. The wedding hall owners said in view of the safety of everyone, they would mandatorily have to follow guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/wedding-halls-owners-in-a-fix-with-new-norms/articleshow/88495807.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Aurangabad||Touching woman without consent is modesty violation, says Bombay high court||AURANGABAD: The Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad has held that touching any part of the body of a woman without her consent, that too in the dead hour of the night by a stranger, amounts to violation of modesty of a woman. A single-judge HC bench of Justice M G Sewlikar on December 21 dismissed a criminal application by a 36-year-old man from Partur in Jalna district challenging an August 21, 2021, ruling by a sessions court that upheld a magisterial court’s judgment of June 25, 2015, sentencing the man to one-year rigorous imprisonment for outraging modesty of the woman. The HC had completed the hearing of the plea October 29 and had reserved the judgment, which was pronounced on December 21. The man, residing in a neighboring house, had entered the woman’s house around 11pm on July 4, 2014 — after learning from her earlier in the day that her husband was to return late from out of station — and touched her feet while she was sleeping. The woman sensed his intent and raised an alarm, prompting the man to flee but not before she and her grandmother-in-law had seen him. The bench held the applicant’s counsel “could not give any answer, much less any satisfactory answer”, to a query as to why the applicant was present in the house of the victim at dead hours of the night. “The applicant did not enter the house of the victim with any sublime motive. He had ensured in the evening from the victim that her husband would not be present in the house at night. Therefore, the applicant ventured to enter the house. This clearly indicates that the applicant had gone there with sexual intent and violated the modesty of the informant,” the bench said. Referring to SC judgments on outraging modesty, including the famous 1996 ruling in the Rupan Deol Bajaj vs KPS Gill case, the bench observed, “When this test is applied to the facts of the instant case, it is clear that the act of the applicant was capable of shocking sense decency of any woman.” “In the case at hand, the applicant was sitting at the feet of the victim and had touched her feet and was sitting on her cot. This behaviour smacks of sexual intent. Otherwise, there was no reason for the applicant to be in the house of the victim at such an odd hour of the night,” the bench said. The applicant had taken an alibi that he was in Jalna city and was not present in Partur at the time of the alleged incident, besides the woman had not bolted the house from inside and that there was a delay in the registration of the FIR. The bench, however, observed that the applicant did not establish the alibi nor did he produce any evidence to show that he was employed at Jalna. Moreover, the victim and her grandmother in law had seen him. As such, the trial and the appellate courts were right in discarding his alibi. The bench further observed that the victim had properly explained the delay in lodging FIR as she and her grandmother in law were alone when the incident occurred, and they waited for her husband to return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-touching-woman-without-consent-is-modesty-violation/articleshow/88495814.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The bullock cart race was being organized by former Shiv Sena MLA Anil Kadam. Recently, the Supreme Court allowed Maharashtra to organise bullock cart races. They were banned in 2014. Inspector Ashok Rahate of the Ozar police station said that though the apex court has allowed bullock cart races to take place in Maharashtra, it is binding on the organisers to take prior permission of the police for organising the event. Moreover, on the backdrop of the spread of Covid-19 and the new variant, the state government on Friday clamped certain restrictions to stop the spread of virus. In view of this, the police rushed to the spot of the event. Rahate said that the police teams rushed to the race venue as soon as they came to know about it being organised. The police reached the venue of the race at around 11.30 am. By the time they reached the spot, a large number of people and bullock carts had started gathering. “We stopped the event before the races could commence,” he said. Speaking to the media, Kadam said that they had been appealing people to follow Covid norms at the time of the race. However, no such co-operation was seen on the venue. “On this backdrop, even we decided to stop the event before it could commence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-stop-bullock-cart-race-at-ozar-for-not-taking-prior-permission/articleshow/88495816.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The latest order prohibits more than five people from gathering at common areas, and cuts down the number of attendees at social gatherings or even religious/political functions to a maximum of 100 people in case the event is being held indoors, and 25% of the venue capacity in case of an outdoor event. It also allows only fully vaccinated people access to shopping malls, shops, establishments and gatherings. “Given the fresh government order, we will reactivate the NMC and police teams in the respective divisions of Nashik city. These teams will patrol the areas and conduct surprise visits to check for violations of the order,” said NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav. The officer said the current order only restricts the number of people coming together between 9 pm and 6 am and, hence, the stress would be on to ensure the limits set on attendees are not violated. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said that while the gatherings and programmes can be held, it must be ensured that only fully vaccinated people — those who have taken both the vaccine doses and have completed a minimum of 14 days since — are allowed at the venue. “All organisers, citizens in general and the authorities in particular need to ensure that the vaccination norms for the organisers of programmes, participants and even service providers are followed,” he said. In case of a violation, a fine of Rs 500 will be levied on an individual and Rs 10,000 will be imposed on the organisation. The commissioner has appealed to the people to get vaccinated and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/civic-police-teams-to-check-for-govt-order-compliance/articleshow/88495823.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Nashik||No entry for unvaccinated in Ahmednagar offices, shops||Nashik: The district administration of Ahmednagar has announced ‘No Vaccine, No Entry’ norm across all the government and private establishments with immediate effect. The aim is to ensure all eligible citizens take at least the first dose of the Covid vaccine. District collector R B Bhosale, who is also the chairperson of the district disaster management authority (DDMA), has issued the orders asking the officials of all establishments, shopkeepers and traders to make sure that they serve only those who are fully or at least partially vaccinated. The district administration has now made it mandatory for all government offices, private establishments, halls, restaurants, shopping malls and shops to set up a mechanism that will ensure that only those with at least first dose of the Covid vaccine are allowed entry into the premises. Officials added that having the first dose of the vaccine or being fully vaccinated does not mean a person was free to remove the mask and enter the premises. Ensuring proper sanitization, wearing masks, maintaining physical distance are compulsory and violation of these norms will also likely to attract penalty. “The members of the DDMA discussed the issue of vaccination and the current rate of Covid spread across the globe. It was concluded that vaccine coverage must be increased. Therefore, stress has been laid on the ‘No Vaccination, No Entry’ policy at all offices across the district,” he said. In the discussion, the authorities also took note of the fact that the district had cases being reported each day and also had one case of the Omicron variant. The experts across the globe have stated that the Omicron variant was highly contagious and all the steps related to keeping the infection at bay should be taken. Also, if a person is infected despite vaccination, it has been revealed that vaccine protects against severe disease. “Considering this, the district administration has decided to take more measures to ensure 100% vaccination as unvaccinated people are not only more likely to get the infected but also more likely to need hospitalisation and critical care. It is better that they protect themselves,” another senior officer from the district administration said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-entry-for-unvaccinated-in-ahmednagar-offices-shops/articleshow/88495828.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Considering the gravity of the case, Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta has tasked the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) with the investigation of the case. As per the complaint lodged by Sunil Kasbekara, a 60-year-old opthalmologist, he shared family relations with the suspect couple and owing to the mutual trust, he purchased three plots in gat number 171/5 of the Harsul area. The transaction was carried out long back in the year 2007, but the victim has been waiting for the couple to register and transfer these three plots in his name, for years. Kasbekar said that until recently, he was under the impression that the suspects would definitely transfer the plots, having market valuation running into tens of lakhs at present. Over a year back, the person who sold the plots to Kasbekar passed away. DS Singare, an inspector at the economic offences wing, while citing the complaint, said that the opthalmologist kept on requesting the widow of the deceased man to transfer the plots in his name, but in vain. It was after she allegedly refused to do so, Kasbekar reached out to the city police chief, who first ordered a preliminary probe. The police after finding substance in the complaint, registered an FIR against the couple including the deceased man.

---||Nagpur||Permissions for all New Year gatherings cancelled, says CP||NAGPUR: The city police, while following directives issued by state government in order to prevent cases from spiralling due to Omicron, have cancelled permissions given to New Year celebrations in the city. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar has made it clear that parties will not be allowed not only in hotels and restaurants but also in residential societies. There will be increased patrolling by police and heightened vigilance, he said. “Fresh restrictions have come into force to check the spread of Covid-19 amid concerns over detection of a new variant of the virus,” said Kumar. Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code came into effect from 9pm to 6am from Saturday night. “Police are urging citizens to stay indoors during the restricted hours,” he said and added that action under Section 144 will be taken if there is assembly of five or more persons after 9pm in public places. He said security will be intensified at malls and other crowded places. All local police officers, including zonal deputy commissioners of police, will be on the streets during the night hours. The CP said additional police force will be deployed at city’s entry and exit points on Wardha Road, Bhandara Road, Amravati Road and Koradi Road having maximum number of restaurants in the vicinity. The top cop said patrolling teams have been formed under every police station to ensure strict implementation of the new protocol. Besides 2,500 police personnel who have been deployed across the city, crime branch and special branch squads will also patrol the city. He, however, said that autorickshaws and cabs will be allowed to operate. “Check posts and barricades will be put up on roads, especially near bars, clubs and lounges to check instances of drunk driving,” he said. The city police had earlier given permissions to many establishments to organize New Year celebrations. “All these permissions have been modified and organisers have been informed that all their events stand cancelled,” the CP said. Hotels association worried Terming the decision to cancel permissions for New Year celebrations as unwise, Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NRHA) said that our businesses have suffered a lot in the last two years and now most of the local customers will travel to neighbouring states for the celebrations. “The hospitality industry does business of almost Rs100 crore during New Year celebrations, but now it will be zero. Though being a regulated business, all such restrictions are enforced on us while the weekly and roadside markets are openly flouting Covid rules,” he said. “This is step-motherly treatment to commercial establishments in Vidarbha, particularly Nagpur city,” said Renu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/permissions-for-all-new-year-gatherings-cancelled-says-cp/articleshow/88496931.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Aurangabad||2 booked as Aurangabad businessman duped of Rs 24L||Aurangabad: The city police have booked two Delhi-based suspects on the charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust after they — on the pretext of allotting a harvester dealership — allegedly duped a city-based businessman of Rs 24 lakh. An offence against the duo has been registered with the Cidco police station. Authorities said they have initiated steps to collect all evidence related to the transactions carried out between the complainant and the suspects. Inspector Sambhaji Pawar told TOI, “The complainant in the case is into agro industries and, through common contacts, came in touch with the suspect duo.” The officer said that Balu Khandagle, who hails from Kannad, was looking for business opportunities, when two men, who had earlier worked with the suspects, introduced Khandagle to them. After the initial communication, the suspects visited Aurangabad and stayed at a star hotel located on the busy Jalna Road, where the entire deal was carried out. As per the complaint lodged, the suspects, around January this year, took Rs 3 lakh as a fixed deposit, and later took another Rs 21 lakh through RTGS as advance. Falling prey to the trap, the complainant transferred the money to the suspect duo, who since receiving the money allegedly started avoiding Khandagle. After several months of follow ups, the suspects handed him a cheque, but due to insufficient funds, it was not honoured. On realising that he has been taken for a ride, Khandagle lodged a police complaint. Pawar said the police are investigating if the suspects even owned a harvester manufacturing unit. “Prima facie it appears that the suspects impressed th businessman by making tall claims. We are checking if some others have also been duped by them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-booked-as-aurangabad-businessman-duped-of-rs-24l/articleshow/88495835.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The stretch at Myadaneri Cross in Yelburga taluk, Koppal district, where wild animals venture to forage for food, has become a graveyard for many an animal that comes under the wheels of speeding vehicles. Among others, deer and bears step outside the forests that line the highway on either side, looking for food. But crossing the narrow stretch that bisects the forest is proving a perilous adventure for these poor animals. On December 21, a sloth bear was killed at Myadaneri Cross while crossing the road at night. Activists told TOI that it was mostly bears and deer that became victims on the road. “In addition to their being killed, many of them sustain serious injuries, incidents which go unreported. The problem is that signboards erected by the forest department are not visible to motorists during the night. The department must take steps to save the lives of these poor animals,” said an activist. Assistant conservator of forests, Koppal, Shivakumar Beelagi said that they had they had erected several boards, urging motorists to reduce their speed while driving along the stretch, but to no avail. “Motorists do not heed our warning. Last years, one or two bears were killed coming under the wheels of vehicles, while the death of the sloth bear on December 21 was the first fatality reported this year. We have approached the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), demanding that speedbreakers be built along the stretch. We also want to erect more signboards on both sides of the road. Meanwhile, we have stepped up patrolling on the roads in the wake of the sloth bear’s death,” Beelagi said. He attributed the accidents to reckless driving. “People who drive after consuming alcohol too are responsible for such accidents. We will start work on building speedbreakers on the road soon,” Beelagi added. Range forest officer KM Nagaraj said that farmers in the villages abutting the forests cultivated watermelon, maize, et al. “As a result, wild animals from Sullikeri, Meragall, Chilakmuki and other areas in the forest stray into these villages looking for food at night,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/stretch-on-myadaneri-cross-on-hospet-kushtagi-rd-a-death-trap-for-animals/articleshow/88496203.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

The overnight drop of three degrees caused a wave of concern among the grape farmers in the region. This is the season’s lowest temperature recorded by the weather observatory of the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research Centre at Kundewadi in Niphad. Grape vineyards are the mainstay of the taluka and the temperature remaining low for a long time is going to harm the product, hence the farmers are worried. “Niphad is known for cold temperatures due to a lot of vegetation, Godavari river and other factors. But the drop in the temperature is leading to concerns among the farmers,” said Ramakant Karpe, one of the farmers in the taluka. While Nashik city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.5 degree Celsius on Saturday. Usually, the difference in temperature in Niphad and Nashik is about two to three degree celsius. For the farmers who have sown wheat, the season and the temperature is a relief as it will boost production. However, the lower temperatures and prolonged cold could be devastating, especially for grape growers. “The chill slows the growth in plants and the fruit. Also, the berries are likely to crack. The farmers have to use several tricks including sprinkling water over the fruit, lighting up bonfire etc.,” said Mangal Kadam, one of the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/6-5c-in-niphad-cause-of-worry-for-grape-farmers/articleshow/88495836.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The preliminary probe has revealed that the 16-year-old student wanted to purchase a cellphone. Considering his family’s difficult financial situation, he thought stealing from a bank would be the easy way out. Superintendent of police Rakesh Kalasagar told TOI, “About two months ago, the teen had visited the bank to open an account for receiving an educational scholarship. During the visit, he had seen a large amount of cash being received and disbursed by the cashier.” This gave him the idea to commit a bank heist. After thinking about it for good two months, the teenager, late on Friday night, left home with an iron rod and went to the rear wall of the bank. Unaware of the CCTV cameras installed there, he started trying to break the wall. A a few hours later, when he realized that it was much harder to break the wall than he had thought, the boy began hitting the wall with a rod. This attracted the attention of neighbours, who alerted the police. Soon, a police patrol team reached the spot, but the minor managed to flee. Later, the police managed to nab the minor with the help of locals. Rakesh Kalasagar said, “The minor claims that he desperately wanted a cellphone that he could use to attend online classes and listen to music.” The minor was produced before the child welfare committee on Saturday, following which, he was sent to the correctional home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/minor-makes-futile-attempt-to-break-into-bank-detained/articleshow/88495856.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Both samples tested negative for the Omicron variant,” said Dr Vishal Patil, the coordinator for Covid in Dhule district. The mother and her child, who returned to Dhule from the United Kingdom on November 29, had tested Covid positive on December 13. The woman’s parents also had tested positive. “All of them tested positive and were asymptomatic. They were isolated even as their tests for Omicron variant was being carried out,” Dr Patil said. The genome sequencing report of the two – who returned from the UK —suggests the absence of the Omicron variant. The conditions of all the patients are stable as they hardly had any symptoms, he said. Since the isolation period of all the patients is over and they have tested negative for Omicron, all the patients have now been discharged. The swab samples of all the contacts related to the patients also tested negative. However, the officer appealed to the people to follow all the Covid-related guidelines and maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Since the Omicron is highly contagious, the best thing is that the people get vaccinated and keep themselves away from the infection by wearing masks, washing hands and maintaining social distancing,” he said.

In the latest reshuffle, several woman officers were given key responsibilities by the government. The all-important change at the helm of affairs in Hyderabad police, replacing Anjani Kumar with CV Anand, has surprised many. Though the possibility of appointing Anand as commissioner had been doing rounds for the last three months eversince he returned to state after completing central deputation, the delay gave an impression that the government might continue Anjani Kumar, who was recently promoted to director-general of police rank, for some more time. Additional commissioner of police (Crimes) Shikha Goel, deputy inspector general of police-ank officers — Avinash Mohanty, AR Srinivas, Vishwa Prasad, AV Ranganath, Kartikeya — and several others though they got promotions long time ago, were retained in the same post. Interestingly, Rachakonda commissioner of police Mahesh Bhagwat, who has been holding the post since 2016, is retained in the same post, raising eye brows in the department. After the latest reshuffle, additional director-general of police-rank officer Shikha Goel would be the director of Anti-Corruption Bureau, but she has to again report to Anjani Kumar. In the past, ACB DG post was held mostly by additional director-general of police rank officers. In Hyderabad city, the unit head of traffic wing and crimes would be deputy inspector general of police-rank officers AV Ranganath and AR Srinivas- instead of the traditional practice of inspector general of police rank. The DIGs have been given SP-rank officers — N Prakash Reddy and Gajarao Bhupal — as deputies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cp-pick-surprises-many-women-cops-get-key-roles/articleshow/88496959.cms||Srinath Vudali

The daily Covid cases reported from the district are in single digits. But, most of the cases reported are from the city. The task force of KMC recently concluded that the increased movement of people coupled with lack of vaccination especially among the younger population is causing the rise in Covid cases. In a video message, Balkawade said, “We have achieved over 94% of the first dose vaccination. We still have 42,000 people, who are yet to take the second dose of Covid vaccine. At the same time, the Covid cases are on the rise. For complete immunity to stop the expected third Covid wave, we must ensure all citizens are fully vaccinated. The citizens are advised to follow social distancing and other Covid-appropriate behaviour as Covid is still there, rather it is popping its head in different forms, Omicron being the latest,” said Balkawade. Most of the foreign returnees who have tested positive are on the path to recovery. The genome sequencing reports of some of them are awaited and the reports, which have arrived, shows no Omicron variant. According to the health officials, most Covid patients from the district have Delta variant of Covid, which was dominant in the second wave. Currently, the city has 32 active patients, 19 of them, are home isolated and the rest are admitted. The death rate of Covid patients in Kolhapur city is almost negligible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-cases-increasing-42k-people-yet-to-take-2nd-dose/articleshow/88495861.cms||---

In the past three days, the state recorded 388 cases at the average of 129 daily cases. In perspective, the daily average cases in December from 1 to 22 were 60, and 30 for the entire month of November. While the experts link the spike with the possible rise of Omicron variant, the statistics by the state health department reveal that in terms of spread, the spike is following the same pattern witnessed in the second wave. A senior official of the state health department said that in the past 30 days, nearly seven out of every 10 cases are recorded in 16 to 60 years age group. While the sub-adult population has recorded 8% cases, the senior citizens account for 25%. A significant share of the new cases is of fully-vaccinated population, indicated officials, a clear warning for those who consider the vaccination status as the ultimate protection against the virus. “But if one studies the hospitalization, severity and mortality figures, it’s significantly lower compared to the second wave, primarily thanks to the high rate of vaccination,” said a senior official. Among the deceased in December, about 90% were above 60 years of age and majority had one or more comorbidity or old age-related health issues, said department officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/60-of-covid-cases-in-dec-from-16-60-years-age-group/articleshow/88496977.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Schools to seek parents' opinion on offline classes||AHMEDABAD: Increasing incidents of school children testing positive for Covid in Ahmedabad, Surat and Rajkot has led the state primary education department to rethink the option of holding offline classes. The department has now instructed schools through district DEOs and DPEOs to seek consent forms from parents once again to know whether they are okay sending their children to school or prefer online instruction. “We are keenly observing the situation right now. For now, we have instructed schools to seek consent from parents on whether they would prefer online or offline mode of education. We should not forget that children are yet to get vaccines,” says state education minister Jitu Vaghani. The minister also claimed that parents and teachers associations are also being approached for the purpose. State education department officials claim that they are being cautious. “The department does not want parents to go into panic mode. Cases are rising. Meanwhile, schools are pressuring for offline education and slowly get off online platforms,” says a senior education department official. The official also claimed that there are chances that schools that have already closed for Christmas and New Year vacations may have to extend the break by another fortnight if Covid cases rise steeply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-schools-to-seek-parents-opinion-on-offline-classes/articleshow/88496997.cms||---

This propelled a 75% increase in disbursals of home loans, against the corresponding period, i.e. April to September, in 2020-21. According to the latest report of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Gujarat, housing finance disbursals went up from Rs 5,283 crore to Rs 9,232 crore in this period. The 171th SLBC meeting was held in Ahmedabad on Friday. M M Bansal, convener of SLBC Gujarat, said, “Disbursals increased both due to a surge in demand and progress in construction activity. Loans are disbursed as construction progresses. Last year, a lot of sites were shut during the lockdown and loans were thus not disbursed. This year, not only did construction activity pick up pace but fresh demand opened up as well.” Developers also said that the demand has risen significantly in the residential segment. “After the pandemic, there is good demand for bigger homes in Gujarat as people have realised the importance of spacious properties. People are also investing in farmhouses, plotted developments and weekend homes. Attractive interest rates, as low as 6.5% in some cases, is also fuelling demand for residential real estate,” said Ajay Patel, chairman, Credai Gujarat and director, Synthesis. The number of home loan accounts to which funds were disbursed also went up from 47,411 to 68,397, a 44% increase.The relatively low increase in borrower numbers but greater amount disbursed points to higher loan ticket sizes. “The real estate sector has revived well over the past year. Market sentiment is good and demand has opened up. This is especially true for middle-income groups and high-income groups, whose monthly incomes were not badly affected. As a consequence, overall demand for real estate improved due to which housing loan disbursals have gone up,” said a banking sector source. “As far as low-income groups are concerned, their monthly incomes are yet to be restored to pre-pandemic levels because of which demand in the affordable housing segment is low compared to the luxury segment,” the source further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-home-buyers-push-loan-disbursals-up-by-75/articleshow/88496993.cms||Niyati Parikh

The student was driving allegedly under the influence of alcohol. In the last two weeks, six accidents, due to drunken driving, took place at Banjara Hills, Narsingi, Kompally and Petbasheerabad and seven persons died.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana to get tough with YouTube channels, seek all details||HYDERABAD: Even as the controversy over body shaming of minister KT Rama Rao’s son on a YouTube channel rages on, the Telangana government has decided to get tough with YouTube channels which have mushroomed all over the state. The government will write to YouTube India management to insist that all the YouTube channels operating in Telangana give their proper office address with responsible persons’ names and other details along with phone numbers. They should also openly display grievances and phone numbers to reach out to them in case if any person has an issue with the content. “The state government has already spoken to the YouTube India team and conveyed its concerns over objectionable content being posted in the channels. We will be officially writing to the YouTube management on Monday,” Telangana digital media director Konatham Dileep told STOI on Saturday. The authorities have confirmed that as many as 200 Telugu YouTube channels are operating from the state. A majority of them do not have any office address and operators’ names are also not known. With the YouTube channels resorting to mudslinging and telecasting defamatory and objectionable content, the state government is unable to trace them as well. Official sources said apart from targeting prominent personalities and officials in the government, some channels were misleading the public by giving different thumbnails and posting photographs irresponsibly. “Recently, a YouTube channel posted a picture of a Padma Shri awardee instead of a sub-inspector who was involved in an extra-marital affair with a woman. When we tried to trace the channel, the office address or phone number was not available. YouTube management takes its own time to remove such content or rectify the mistake,” Dileep said. The state government is also exploring ways to take action against persons resorting to mudslinging on people using social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Official sources said as per the new IT Act, the government has a limited role in taking action against persons and cannot make its own rules. However, the TRS government wants to talk to legal experts on what can be done on the IT Act issue. Sources in the government said if any channel or social media platform telecasts any derogatory, defamatory and objectionable content on any person, the YouTube management either can stop the advertisements or block the channel. But it takes several days or several months to act upon on the issue despite bringing it to the notice. Officials also police are also helpless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-get-tough-with-youtube-channels-seek-all-details/articleshow/88496983.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: KDCC poll campaign begins, Shiv Sena plans meets on Monday||KOLHAPUR: Campaigning for the Kolhapur District Central Cooperative (KDCC) Bank poll began on Saturday with senior minister Hasan Mushrif and several local functionaries of Congress, NCP, BJP and other parties holding meetings. The Mushrif-led panel’s poll plank is the work the bank has done for farmers over the past five years of the directors body led by Mushrif. He is emphasising on the achievements, especially bringing the bank from losses and helping it become a Rs 100 crore profitable institution. Not many central cooperatives in the state are currently making profit. Mushrif is also dealing with the political setback of Shiv Sena parting ways and forming it’s own panel. Mushrif has been assuring the voters — who are mostly representatives of the cooperative societies that get lendings from the bank — that Sena will remain with the Congress and NCP in the assembly and local body elections. Speaking at Kolhapur, Mushrif said, “We had offered Sena two seats, but they wanted three. It is not possible to accommodate everyone. However they will be with us for other elections.” Sena is going to start its campaign on Monday. Meetings will be held at every taluka place. Sena has formed a panel along with the Peasants and Workers Party, Republican Party of India and others. Vijay Devane, Sena district president, said, “We have been betrayed by Congress and NCP leaders. They accommodated BJP leaders, but not those from Sena despite the state-level alliance. We supported Congress and NCP in every previous poll. This time, the voters will show them their place for the betrayal.” Six out of 21 seats of the bank have already been elected unopposed from the Mushrif camp. Mushrif now needs just five candidates to win the panel and become the president of the bank again for the next five years. The election is taking place for 15 seats and 33 candidates are in fray. The voting is on January 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kdcc-poll-campaign-begins-sena-plans-meets-on-monday/articleshow/88495873.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||‘Land given to film director in tune with govt policy’||Hyderabad: Stating that allotting land to film studios and film personalities at lower costs is nothing new, Telangana municipal administration principal secretary Arvind Kumar said that the state’s latest allotment of five-acre land at Mokila in Rangareddy district for Rs 5 lakh per acre to film director N Shankar too was made on similar lines and was in tune with this policy. “It was only after examining the genuineness of the applicant, the need for setting up a film studio near Hyderabad and the recommendation made by the film development corporation that the state cabinet has decided to allot 5 acres of land,” he said. This was in addition to the Rs 5 crore deposit he made with a promise to bring in Rs 50 crore investment to build a modern studio that offers complete facilities for making full-fledged films and also advertisements that portray the journey of the new state, Arvind Kumar said in a counter-affidavit filed before the court. The state government has examined the 35 years of experience Shankar has in the film industry and his commitment to the industry and society. The principal secretary was responding to the allegations made in a PIL filed against the allotment. In fact, Shankar has been making representations to the state to enable him to build a world-class film and TV studio for several years now. “The Rs 50 crore investment promised by Shankar was only an initial investment and with this, he promised direct employment to 100 persons, indirect employment to 200 persons apart from directly employing 1,000 cine workers on a daily basis,” Arvind said. The proposed studio involves not only ‘start to finish’ facilities but also creates highly technical and underwater filming facilities in Hyderabad. Moreover, Arvind said quoting film development corporation that there is a substantial increase in film and TV production activities in Telangana. He said that with the volume of activity increasing, permanent sets of police stations, hospitals, streets, etc are required to be set up in a studio. “N Shankar being a native of Nalgonda has all the qualifications to set up such a studio. The state wants to promote local talent which deserves encouragement,” the principal secretary said in his affidavit. The case will come up for hearing on January 3, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-given-to-film-director-in-tune-with-govt-policy/articleshow/88496985.cms||---

Dr Pathak was speaking at a seven-day seminar organized at Sivananda Ashram on yoga and lifestyle disorders including diabetes and hypertension. “I have worked as a surgeon for over three decades, and my interest to understand the body better drove me to yoga. Contrary to popular belief, I don’t see yoga as exercise, but a way of life to stay healthy,” said Dr Pathak. In his demonstrations, he connected the medical practices with notions of yoga. “Practices such as kapalbhati can improve breathing rhythm and kunjal kriya, jal dyuti and different vaman can cure a person of intestinal illnesses.” Dr Pathak and his associate V P Singh said that after Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a rise in awareness and practice of Yoga among all age groups primarily to improve lung capacity and overall well-being.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/yoga-can-cure-covid-like-illnesses/articleshow/88497004.cms||---

For the past two months, after assuming the charge, Dipak Patil, the Regional Transport Officer (RTO), along with the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) officials and district police authorities, carried out surveys to ascertain whether to add or delete the stops and to increase or decrease the rickshaws permitted at particular stops. For a long time, the autorickshaw unions and passenger associations were demanding an increase in the number of stops. Patil told TOI, “It was important to ensure that the stops proposed at a particular site does not cause traffic congestion. After discussions and site visits, we have finalised 173 stops. Currently, we have over 7,000 permitted autorickshaws plying in the city and the increased number of the stops will cater to the increasing number of autorickshaws.” Patil said that an increase in the number of stops would help reduce illegal autos from the city. It has been observed that the auto drivers bypass stops to pick the passengers waiting away from the stops. “The formal list of the auto stops will help the traffic authorities take stringent action against such illegal practices. We are hopeful that now since the auto stops are properly designated and marked, the drivers will refrain from such illegal activities,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rta-approves-revised-list-of-173-autorickshaw-stops-in-kolhapur/articleshow/88495881.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Two boys had earlier drowned at abandoned site||HYDERABAD: The abandoned government construction site in KPHB colony where three girls drowned on Friday had witnessed a similar incident about four to five years ago, when two 12-year-old boys had drowned. After the incident, the property was fenced to stop people from entering the area. The 35-40 feet deep pit that was reportedly dug up for construction work years ago, remains filled with rainwater. The deceased were the children of a tea stall vendor. The children had started using a small pathway that went through the abandoned site as a shorter route to reach their school barely 10 days ago as the pathway was recently cleared of bushes. On the fateful day, the children were playing with their toy utensils and while playing, they had gone to fetch water from the pit, where they slipped. “The fencing was intact except for a small gap to get in but usually nobody ventured there. These kids sometimes used the small pathway to go to school. I had told them a couple of times to not use that pathway,” said Kuntala Avinash, a resident of the area. Locals said that they saw four girls playing near the fence. While none of the locals saw them drown, a few locals said that after sometime the girls had disappeared and that they assumed that the girls have gone to another place to play. “After the three girls drowned, the fourth girl went to the marketplace where their family runs a tea stall and alerted them. Unfortunately, nobody paid heed to her as the stall was quite busy at the time and the family thought that the girl is not serious. Within an hour, we saw police and NDRF teams rush to the spot. That is when we realised what had happened. We used to see those kids play here and interacted with them sometimes,” said Avinash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-boys-had-earlier-drowned-at-abandoned-site/articleshow/88497007.cms||Amrita Didyala

The ban on gatherings in groups from 9pm to 6am in the state pertains to those public places that have not been specifically mentioned in the order. However, rules in orders issued by the local bodies pertaining to restaurants, multiplexes and other such establishments will still be applicable to them,” said Chakraborty. Covid restrictions order said, “Without prejudice to comprehensiveness of the directions above, it is clarified that restaurants, gymnasiums, spas, cinema halls and theatres will continue to operate at 50% of the capacity as declared by the licensing/ permitting authorities.” Earlier in the day, top representatives from the hospitality and multiplex sectors said while the order mentioned restaurants, cinema halls and theatres to continue to operate at 50% of the capacity, it also stated that “there shall be a ban on any assembly of people in groups of more than five from 9pm to 6am throughout the state at all public places”. Vikram Shetty, owner of Sadanand Resort and Sadanand Regency, and secretary of Poona Hoteliers’ Association, said, “We had been receiving calls from members as they thought that restaurants were also expected to shut at 9pm after the latest order owing to the ban on assembly of more than five people in public places.” Prakash Chaphalkar, secretary of the Multiplex Association of India, confirmed that there was some confusion in the industry over the two points in the order..”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ban-on-assembly-doesnt-apply-to-restos-chief-secy/articleshow/88497025.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Pune: Probe consent to illegal mining unit in Mulshi, says NGT||PUNE: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the state chief secretary “to enquire about the conduct of the persons responsible for granting a consent to operate” to a mining and stone-crushing unit close to the Tamhini wildlife sanctuary in Mulshi taluka of Pune district without an environmental clearance and an environmental impact assessment. The absence of environmental clearance renders the plant totally illegal, a special bench of the green tribunal said and added that the permission to allow it to operate was also in violation of the Supreme Court directives. It has also constituted a multi-member expert committee to assess the amount of compensation and oversee recovery after it was noticed in a district collector’s letter to the state pollution control board that the project proponent had excavated over Rs26.96cr worth mineral from July 5, 2019, to September 17, 2020. “The value of mined material needs to be recovered apart from compensation for damage to the environment on ‘polluter pays’ principle, having regard to the environmental services forgone forever and deterrent element, having regard to the financial capacity of the project proponent,” the NGT said. “The officers responsible for permitting illegal mining and granting consent to operate without requisite EC need to be dealt with,” the tribunal said. Lawyer Supriya Dangre, representing applicant Laxman Thombare, had submitted, among other things, that the project did not conform with the environmental norms as it had no valid environmental clearance for mining undertaken on a 10-hectare land. Moreover, the plant is located within the prohibited distance from ‘Tamhini’ wildlife sanctuary at Jamgaon in Mulshi taluka of Pune district. The same is within 60 metres from the national highway, 100 metres from a settlement and 400 metres from the village in violation of environmental norms. The state pollution control board, the forest department, Pune district collector as well as the project proponent had filed their responses in the matter. The state pollution control board had informed that the ambient air quality measurements exceeded the consent standards and mining was in excess of permission. Moreover, the consent to operate was granted on August 14, 2019, subject to grant of environmental clearance. The tribunal observed that the project proponent denied that it had no environmental clearance but failed to produce one and in absence of environmental clearance mining is illegal. “In view of the undisputed fact that no environmental clearance has been obtained and no environment impact assessment conducted as required, the entire mining undertaken by the PP is illegal. Consequential remedial action needs to be taken in the light of judgments of the Supreme Court,” the tribunal said. “A joint Committee of Central Pollution Control Board, State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority, State pollution control board and Divisional Commissioner, Pune, may assess the amount of compensation and oversee recovery, in accordance with law,” the bench added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/probe-consent-to-illegal-mining-unit-in-mulshi-ngt/articleshow/88497026.cms||Vishwas Kothari

As part of the exercise across the country, officials of Hyderabad BIS randomly inspected 70 jewellery outlets and collected 70 samples in the city. “A team of BIS officials inspected 70 jewellery outlets in Abids, Secunderabad, Madhapur, Gachibowli, Kukatpally and other parts and collected the samples to check HUID which contains a six-digit number. These samples have been sent to BIS referral lab in Chennai,” head and scientist-E, BIS, Hyderabad, KV Rao told STOI. HUID number is a six-digit alphanumeric code consisting of numbers and letters. HUID is given to every piece of jewellery at the time of hallmarking and it is unique for every piece of jewellery The lab authorities will check the weight of jewellery, jeweller’s name, assaying and hallmarking centre’s (AHC) name and match it with the details provided by the jewellers and send a report to the BIS. “The samples are drawn either by cutting or drilling or scrapping. This facility is available with all the BIS-registered jewellers,” Rao said. He said the report takes a month at least. BIS Hyderabad branch office also maintains the database of the samples collected. City-based jewellers told STOI, “We are strictly following the HUID code for the benefit of customers. If we ignore this norm, our outlet name and fame will be tarnished.” The BIS also has powers to initiate action against the jewellers and AHCs if a negative report received from the Chennai referral lab, a senior BIS official said. Sunil Agarwal, vice-president of South Zone Indian Association of Hallmarking Centres, Telangana, agreed that the BIS officials have the liberty to check their outlets and AHCs and collect the samples. “We are requesting the BIS to enhance the collection fee from Rs 30 per piece for HUID code to Rs 60 per piece,” he said. He said there are 2,000 to 3,000 jewellers doing gold jewellery and silver articles business in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bis-checks-city-jewellery-outlets-takes-70-samples-for-huid-code/articleshow/88497020.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Mergers lead to 250 PSB branches closing in Q2||AHMEDABAD: Several mergers of public sector banks (PSBs) have led to a massive reduction in public sector bank branches across Gujarat. According to the latest report of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Gujarat, some 271 bank branches were shut by the end of the September quarter of 2021-22. Of these, at least 250 branches were of public sector banks. According to the SLBC report, the total number of bank branches fell from 10,065 to 9,794 during this period. PSB branches reduced from 5,172 to 4,922 branches in the state. Banking sector professionals attribute the closing of branches to the mergers of PSBs that have taken place. Janak Rawal, general secretary, Mahagujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA), said, “Bank branches were shut due to the merger of public sector banks that took place over the past three or four years. Branches which were in close proximity were rationalized. The reduction in branches has increased the customer rush at certain branches causing a lot of inconvenience to customers.” Rawal also said that with rationalization of branches, recruitments to public-sector banks have come to a standstill. “Over the past years, public sector bank branches have not made fresh appointments in place of retired employees and this affects recruitment in the banking sector,” he further said. On one hand, while public sector bank branches reduced, private sector bank branches increased by 119 in Gujarat in the same period. Even small finance banks added some 42 branches across the state.

Essential services, however, will remain exempted from the restrictions,” Shisve said. The Pimpri Chinchwad police are yet to issue an order in this regard. “We will soon issue an order after going through the state directives,” said Pimpri Chinchwad police chief Krishna Prakash. Earlier in the day, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and district collector Rajesh Deshmukh also issued similar orders for their respective jurisdictions i.e Pune city and Pune and Khadki cantonments, besides rural Pune, reitering the state guidelines. Shisve told TOI, “We shall follow the guidelines issued by the government and will not allow gathering of five or more than five people at any public place.” Asked how the police plan to implement the directives, Shisve said, “The state government has already issued detailed guidelines and all we have to do is to ensure that the same are strictly adhered to. Action under Section 188 (disobedience) of the IPC will be taken against such persons who will violate them.” Shisve, however, avoided getting in the specifics of what constitutes a public place. Police will issue permissions for marriages and important functions and political programmes. A senior police officer said, “People cannot gather in large groups at public places such as community halls, religious places and others in a manner that will violate the limits prescribed by the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-curbs-for-essential-services-police-order/articleshow/88497038.cms||---

Jewellers said this move was a huge relief, especially for those in rural areas where the footfall is very low. “Following this decision, the jewellers can obtain registration without paying any fee to the BIS and get their jewellery hallmarked from the AHCs,” said a BIS official. Manohara Chary, a goldsmith in Pot Market in Secunderabad, said they were yet to recover from huge losses suffered during hte pandemic and lockdowns.  “It is very difficult for us to pay Rs 10,000 to get our jewellery articles hallmarked. Regular customers continue to visit our small outlets only because of decades long trust and connection,” he told STOI. S Badhraiah, a goldsmith, said the exemption of Rs 10,000 was a major relief. “Our turnover per annum is between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh. We do not get bulk orders,” he said.

A team led by principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and state chief wildlife warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj sighted the birds close to the Chemplast salt pan near Kalwakarai pump house west of the Great Vedaranyam Swamp. “The arrival of the flamingos to Point Calimere happens after several years. The forming of the Great Flamingo Wall made our observation an amazing experience,” PCCF Niraj told TOI. PCCF called the sighting of two chicks in one of the congregations as notable. “We cannot conclude that the flamingos were breeding here. Since they cannot fly for a long distance, flamingos would be nesting and breeding somewhere closer, most probably in Trincomalee or Mannar area of Srilanka in the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/flamingo-wall-awes-point-calimere-wildlife-sanctuary/articleshow/88497040.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana okays New Year events, but with Covid-19 precautions in place||HYDERABAD: Contrary to expectations that the government may ban New Year parties and events in the wake of rising Omicron variant Covid-19 cases, the Telangana government has prohibited rallies, public meetings, but allowed events involving public congregation with Covid-approriate behaviour — maintaining physical distance, wearing mask and thermal screening at entry points of venues— till January 2. As Omicron cases have been steadily increasing in the state, crossing over 40 cases and Telangana emerging among top three states with the new variant cases, the high court a few days ago had asked the state government to put in place curbs on public gatherings and festivities during Christmas, New Year and Sankranti to prevent further spread of coronavirus. The Centre had also expressed concern over increasing number of Omicron cases in the country and suggested the states to impose restrictions. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar, in a GO issued on Saturday, said while public gatherings and rallies would be prohibited till January 2, other events involving public congregation would be permitted, provided physical distance, wearing masks and thermal screening were followed. At the same time, the government would strictly enforce imposing fine for not wearing mask in public spaces, he said. The chief secretary asked collectors, superintendents of police and police commissioners to implement the restrictions. Official sources said the state government wants to impose further restrictions after reviewing the situation, especially Omicron cases, after January 2. “The state government is fully alert on new variant cases and monitoring the situation on day to day basis while completing vaccination,” a senior government official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-okays-ny-events-but-with-covid-19-precautions-in-place/articleshow/88497045.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Next two weeks crucial, Maharashtra government to keep watch: Chief secretary||PUNE: The Maharashtra government will keep a close watch on any cluster outbreaks in the community, after the state’s Omicron case count climbed up to 110 on Saturday. Chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty told TOI that the next two-three weeks would be crucial for the state to check on any cluster outbreaks. “We shall keep a close watch on the patterns of cluster outbreaks next two weeks or even more. More samples would be sent for genome sequencing to keep tabs on the situation.” “We have readied our hospital infrastructure, but since Omicron cases are mild, local authorities have to strengthen the home isolation monitoring system in case of any possible cluster outbreaks or community spread,” he said. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate told TOI that the state had directed both Mumbai and Pune to send more samples for genome sequencing as a part of community surveillanc. The state on Friday issued a detailed letter regarding the community surveillance after Omicron’s emergence. “The duration of the community surveillance will be December 21-31. The RT-PCR positive samples from Mumbai, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in this period would be referred for whole genome sequencing. From Mumbai, 300 samples would be sent for genome sequencing daily. From Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, a total of 100 samples would be sent each day,” he said. The government has also introduced curbs to check the spread of Omicron. It is the fifth state after Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to do so. The rationale behind it is to restrain groups from gathering in public places. The chief secretary said the curbs were imperative to check on the huge gatherings in the festive season and suggested by the state task force members. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said as of now Omicron cases in the state and the country were sporadic and travel-related only. “But there has been a rapid rise in daily Covid cases in the state from three digits to four digits. We need to keep a close watch on any cluster outbreaks,” he said. Joshi said people should not resort to self-testing in case of any SARI/ILI in the winter season. “The transmissibility rate of Omicron was many times higher than the earlier strains of coronavirus. The three ‘T’s have to be followed as a part of monitoring and people should behave responsibly,” he said. The expert said, “It is imperative that people follow the Covid protocols irrespective of their vaccination status.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/next-two-weeks-crucial-govt-to-keep-watch-cs/articleshow/88497047.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: No plan to transfer TET scam case to CBI, says deputy CM Ajit Pawar||PUNE: The investigation into the malpractices in the Teacher Eligibility Test, and other examinations, would continue to be handled by the city police and the government had no plan for a CBI probe into the cases, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on the sidelines of inauguration of the Maharashtra State Faculty Development Academy here on Saturday. Commissioner of Maharashtra State Examination Council, Tukaram Supe, was recently arrested for his alleged involvement in the case. Asked about a possible transfer of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Pawar said that the premier investigation agency has a lot of work already and that the current investigation mechanisms are working properly. “Pune Police are doing very good work. We have 100% trust in them that they will bring to the fore all the people involved. Do not bring politics into it. The CBI has a lot of work. It is involved only when the present system is not working well. Previously, the CBI was given 2-3 cases. What happened to them? In Sushant Rajput’s case, the CBI came to the same conclusion as the police that he committed suicide,” said Pawar. The deputy chief minister said a false narrative is being created in the society that the police system does not work and, hence, the CBI should investigate. “But in the end, all of them are government systems. Some are under state government and some are under the central government. If we feel that the investigation is not up to the mark or if we feel someone else, too, must be involved or if others have a problem with it, then the government will take a call on whether to get the CBI or others involved or not,” said Pawar. “Nobody has the right to play with the future of our boys and girls. The investigation will be done till the end, and the guilty will be punished,” added Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-plan-to-transfer-tet-scam-case-to-cbi-says-deputy-cm/articleshow/88497042.cms||Ardhra Nair

In the 5th state representatives’ conference held at Srirangam in Trichy, the BKS raised concern about the wastage of rainwater, which is not utilized to fill tanks, lakes and ponds in several areas in Tamil Nadu. Citing the abundant rainfall in the monsoon this year, the BKS said that though the rainwater filled several waterbodies, their full capacity was not reached and lakes and ponds in many areas remained dry. In the meeting, which was attended by national president I N Basava Gowda and national organising secretary Dinesh Kulkarni, state vice-president N T Pandian was made the state president, while state spokesperson N Veerasekaran was promoted as the state secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/concern-over-wastage-of-rainwater/articleshow/88497034.cms||---
---||Trichy||Food safety dept initiates steps for Trichy’s first street food hub||Trichy: The food safety department has initiated the process of establishing Trichy’s first clean street food hub on VOC road near the central bus stand by entrusting an audit agency with the job of conducting food quality tests in the existing outlets to be part of the hub. After streamlining food preparation, serving and dining practices, the authorities will modernise the food carts of around 50 vendors in a uniform manner at the hub. As part of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India’s (FSSAI) pan-India project to improve the infrastructure of street food hubs, the food safety department here had identified central bus stand and Chathiram bus stand as venues. A sum of Rs 1.15 lakh was paid to a food safety training and testing centre in Chennai for conducting a safety audit in the existing street food carts in the next few weeks. The money came through the corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund of Sarathas textile showroom. The audit agency will examine the quality of water, oil and other food products used and suggest corrective measures through the food safety department. A post-audit survey will also be conducted to verify adherence to the corrective measures. “If we are satisfied with the cleanliness and hygiene of the vendors, we will issue the safety certificate under the clean street food hub scheme. The certification will be periodically validated,” Dr R Ramesh Babu, district food safety officer, told TOI. As the existing pushcarts used by around 35 street food vendors were unsafe and not uniform in appearance, the department will suggest and sponsor modifications in the carts. The carts will get proper roofing and glass shields to protect food from dust, most likely in the same colour. At present, there are around 35 street vendors, but the number could be increased to 50. “We are looking for sponsors to modify the carts which will cost around Rs 3 lakh,” the food safety officer added. As VOC road near the central bus stand’s parking lot has serious hygiene concerns in solid waste disposal, sewage overflow and open urination, the department has sought the support of Trichy corporation to facilitate hand wash and urinals for the city’s first street food hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/food-safety-dept-initiates-steps-for-trichys-first-street-food-hub/articleshow/88497056.cms||Deepak Karthik

Kumar was a liaison officer of the GA Software Company, tasked with setting the paper and conducting the TET (Teachers’ Eligibility Test), 2018, besides declaring its results. The police have registered a separate case related to the TET-2020 malpractice. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake told TOI, “Our team visited Bengaluru and conducted searches at the residence of Kumar. We shall assess the seized property in due course of time.” The city cyber police early on Tuesday arrested Maharashtra State Council of Examination’s (MSCE) former commissioner Sukhdeo Dere (61) from Sangamner in Ahmednagar district and Kumar (49) from Bengaluru on the charge of altering the marks of some candidates during the TET-2018 in connivance with six others to secure illegal gratification. The test was held on July 15, 2018, and its final results were declared online on October 12 in the same year. The FIR of 2018 TET exam names the now suspended MSCE commissioner Tukaram Supe, GA Software’s director Pritish Deshmukh and four others. The police are searching some premises in Sangamner, related to Dere, and questioning people known to Supe for more recovery in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2kg-gold-seized-from-suspects-home-in-bengaluru/articleshow/88497057.cms||---

The order on new Covid restrictions in the state had stated that in the case of marriages, where movement of attendees is generally staggered, the total number of attendees at any moment of time should not exceed 100 for enclosed spaces (like banquets/ marriage halls among others) and 250 for open-to-sky spaces, or 25% of the capacity of such spaces, whichever is lesser. Amit Sharma, the vice-president of PHA and general manager of Amanora The Fern, Pune, said, “Hotels have been impacted adversely after the latest order. Earlier also, the guest list for weddings was curtailed at nearly 200 in an enclosed hall with a capacity of 400 people. Further reduction in guests for an event will impact revenues.” Sharma said, “We have weddings at the hotel till month end and many have already sent out invitations to their guests. To ask the remaining guests not to attend the event is a big mental harassment for clients.” Vikram Shetty, the owner of Sadanand Resort and Sadanand Regency, said, “We have two weddings in the next couple of days and around seven in February. The restricted guest limit for weddings will cause an increase of Rs 100-200 per person cost depending on the banquet. This would be done to cover up costs of holding the event in the banquet, which can accommodate more guests than 100 in number.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/banquets-wedding-clients-in-a-fix-over-latest-restrictions/articleshow/88497054.cms||Neha Madaan

The matter came out after district collector Dr T Prabhushankar made a surprise visit to the school on Saturday and checked cooking materials in the kitchen. The collector said that verification showed that all the provisions were in good condition. Eggs supplied to schools are coded red, green, blue and brown to identify the date of supply. Around 200 eggs coded red, which were supplied to the school on Monday, were tested by putting them in water and were found to be of good quality. However, some eggs coded blue supplied more than a week ago were found rotten. The collector said that these eggs should have been discarded by this time but they did not do so. Subsequently, the collector suspended noon meal organiser Thenmozhi, cook Lakshmi for not discarding the eggs, and headmistress Dhanalakshmi for failing to monitor the process. In this case, the attendance of over 180 students of the school was erratic. So, a certain number of eggs remained unutilized even as the next batch of eggs was supplied. Hence, the noon meal organiser and the cook kept them in the kitchen. “The inquiry ensured that none of the rotten eggs was served to the students,” T Prabhushankar told TOI. The collector has decided to issue a circular to all schools to comply with the instructions in discarding rotten eggs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rotten-eggs-in-school-hm-cook-suspended/articleshow/88497048.cms||---

The partners in the deal added that they will be using Cranberry’s flagship water management and predictive analysis tool, Recon, with the deal being Cranberry’s first foray in markets outside India. They added that such tools are essential in regions, such as the Middle East and the UAE, the latter being one of the highest per capita consumers of water per day in the world. Cranberry is largely known for its work with the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), with which it partners regarding water supply management, billing, and supply augmentation, along with monitoring supply trends daily using a network of sensors and big data analytics. “We are delighted to partner with ConsultValiant UAE in promoting effective solutions to address the impending water stress in the Middle-Eastern region. The UAE is home to 6% of the world’s population and has access to just 1% of the world’s freshwater resources,” said Shishir Thakur, co-founder and director of Cranberry. “The region is in urgent need of analytics-driven insights which will help to take critical action and narrow the gap between water demand and water supply,” Thakur added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/water-management-firm-makes-uae-foray/articleshow/88497062.cms||---

We do not want people to face more restrictions. So, I am making an appeal to people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Wearing a mask is very important,” he said. Tope said though Omicron cases were increasing rapidly, the patients were showing mild symptoms and not ending up in ICUs. Nor did they need supplementary oxygen, he said. “A close watch is being kept on the cases. The third wave is likely because of the Omicron variant and so all care has to be taken. We request people to follow the norms and abide by the curbs, considering the increase in Omicron cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lockdown-only-if-oxygen-need-rises-health-min/articleshow/88497059.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Six days before the deadline for 100% first dose vaccination in Maharashtra, he said the local administrations should scale up the inoculation programme to meet the targets. “After the ongoing assembly session, there would be an assessment on the way forward to scale up vaccination,” Tope told TOI. “If people cooperate and the vaccination is scaled up every day, the target of 100% first dose vaccination should be achieved in the next 15-20 days. The local administration cannot be laggard, especially in the wake of increasing threat of Omicron,” he said. Currently, the first dose vaccination coverage in the state is 87%. It is 56% for the second shot. The first dose coverage in 22 districts is below the state average. Chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty told TOI that the underperforming districts would come under the radar for sure. “Ahead of December 31, a detailed review meeting would be held with the health department and the local authorities of the districts registering poor vaccination,” he said. Tope said migration was a key hurdle on the way of immunisation. “Many such people took their shots outside the districts where they are included in the beneficiaries’ list. It is being checked.The names of those not staying in their ‘home districts’ would be deleted from the list,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dists-below-par-on-vax-front-will-be-pulled-up-says-tope/articleshow/88497066.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The state has a stock of less than three lakh RT-PCR testing kits to upscale it to the recommended level. “Telangana had been following the opposite ratio even during the first and second waves. Majority of the tests done are through the rapid antigen test (RAT) method even now. In fact the supply of RT-PCR kits is limited in many areas,” said a source from the state health department. As per the state health department, the state has stock of 2.91 lakh RT-PCR testing kits and 27.04 lakh RAT kits. During a review meeting by the Centre on Covid-19 status and preparedness in states in view of Omicron, the Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan directed states to ramp up RT-PCR to RAT ratio. On testing and surveillance, states were asked to keep a close watch on number of Delta and Omicron cases, case positivity on a day-on-day and week-on-week basis, the doubling rate, and new emerging clusters and initiate containment in these areas. “Conduct tests as per extant ICMR and MoHFW guidelines. Ensure right proportion of RT-PCR: RAT (at least 60:40) tests in total tests being conducted daily. This can be ramped up to 70:30 ratio,” a statement from the central health ministry says. “The RTPCR test is used judiciously not just because of stock position but because of the time, manpower and other logistics required. With the current level of manpower it is not possible to ramp up to that level,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lack-of-stock-a-hurdle-to-more-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/88497068.cms||---

When she read up about this, sure enough, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s rules stipulate that owners must register pets and collect NoCs from at least three neighbours. Failing to register a pet may result in facing a penalty of Rs 1,000 to Rs 50,000 depending on the violation, apart from having your pet taken away from you. “My neighbours do not have a problem at all with my Mimi (her Indie dog). It is the people on the first floor who complain about the barking, and they claim that pets are not allowed in the apartment,” Ambica, who resides in an apartment in Banjara Hills, said. Animal lovers in the city fear that the illegal bylaws of residential societies and the GHMC rule would deter people from adopting dogs. Daisy Mary, an animal lover who rescues and provides shelter for around 11 dogs currently, points out that there have been several instances when people who adopted a dog from her had to come back to return them. “There are instances when the owner and his family shift to another apartment which doesn’t allow pets, they then return the dog to us. Some of them are returned within five months after adoption. I try to counsel them to fight back and cite Supreme Court orders which clearly state that people are allowed to have how many ever dogs they want. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t,” Daisy told TOI. While the GHMC’s rule exists, less than 700 dogs have been registered with them while the city has more than 50,000 pet owners, according to official data. “Most of the time, the action is taken only on the basis of a serious complaint. We also try to give the person a warning and make them register before enforcing the rule,” a GHMC official said on the condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rules-for-pet-dogs-deter-adoptions-animal-lovers/articleshow/88497079.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

As the structure housing the memorial was damaged in the monsoon, the CPM renovated the structure and opened it for public access on Saturday.Several left and pro-dalit movement cadres gathered at the monolithic red granite memorial and pillar etched with the names of the deceased to pay floral tributes. CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan, who opened the renovated memorial, said that caste-based atrocities were not completely eradicated even as half a century has passed since the Venmani incident. “Only after farmers protested for 378 days, the Union government was forced to kneel before the farmers and repeal the controversial farm laws. Working-class is still protesting for their rights,” K Balakrishnan said. On the performance of the newly-elected DMK government in the state in the past six months, the CPM leader appreciated the measures taken by the state to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic and mandating Tamil language for state government jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/venmani-martyrs-remembered/articleshow/88497082.cms||---

He is desperate to sell it off now. “I cannot sustain it anymore. With the cost of petrol on a high, a mileage of 30-35km per litre is not what I can afford now after facing substantial salary cuts owing to the pandemic. I want to sell it off and buy a simple scooter. I am talking to my friends, colleagues and second-hand dealers and trying to negotiate a price,” Chitre, who works in Hinjewadi phase-3, said. Many owners of high-end bikes and cars in the city are considering selling their gas guzzlers even at low prices. Dealers said that they were witnessing an increase in the sale of high-end cars and bikes for the past two months. “In the car segment, the number of people approaching us to sell their cars costing Rs50lakh or more has increased by around 20%. The sellers are mainly businessmen going through bad times and they do not want to pay high EMIs now. In the two-wheeler segment, the increase has been around 25%. Most people owning high-end bikes now want to go for simple two-wheelers or e-bikes,” a Mundhwabased dealer said. Pune RTO officials told TOI that the number of transfer of ownerships of vehicles till October this year is set to surpass last year’s figures. “Last year, the ownership of around 47,800 vehicles were transferred. This year, the figure stands at 47,600 already. With more than a month to go for the year to end, we are looking at a 30% increase this year compared to 2020. While around 4,000 pre-owned vehicles were sold per month on an average last year, this year we expect the monthly average to be more than 5,000 vehicles,” an official said. Sarang Kenjale, founder, Blitzkrieg Riding Club, said that the high fuel prices have impacted the rides organised by them. “While some have sold their bikes, the rides we organize have gone down drastically. Long rides to places like Ladakh are out of the question now due to high fuel cost as we cover almost 10,000km one-way. We have to think twice even to go to Lonavla now. From organising four rides a month, we are down to one,” Kenjale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/steep-fuel-prices-trigger-rush-to-sell-high-end-bikes-cars-in-past-2-months/articleshow/88497081.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||From January, over 69 crore Covishield doses transported from Pune airport||PUNE: More than 69.58 crore doses of the Covishield vaccine, weighing over 19 lakh tonnes, have been transported from the city airport despite its infrastructural constraints between January and December 23 this year. “Everyone, including the airlines, their officials and cargo handlers, have played an important role in the transportation of the vaccines from Pune to different parts of the country,” a senior airport official told TOI. The transportation of the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), began in January this year, with the first consignment leaving the Pune airport for Delhi on SpiceJet and Air India flights. Officials at the Kool-ex Cold Chain Limited — the firm in agreement with the SII for transportation of the vaccines — maintained that only small consignments of the vaccine were being sent via air, while large consignments were being sent via road in temperature-controlled trucks. “The cargo hold area of the airport is small. We have been pushing for shifting the spot to a 2.5-acre plot belonging to the Indian Air Force. The process is on, but taking time. However, despite the constraints, we have been able to successfully transport the vaccines from Pune to both domestic and international locations,” the official said. In an earlier conversation, Pune MP and airport advisory committee chairman Girish Bapat had said that the cargo hold transfer issue had hit a roadblock as the IAF was asking for Rs 1.38 crore as yearly payment for the plot. Bapat had said the matter had been referred to the ministry of defence and infrastructure panel chief Nitin Gadkari. With Omicron cases increasing, the quantity meant for transportation could grow in the future. “We will continue to do our best and facilitate the transportation from the airport. It is a major responsibility for us,” another airport official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/from-january-over-69-crore-covishield-doses-transported-from-pune-airport/articleshow/88497087.cms||Joy Sengupta

Two months ago, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati ordered the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to sever drainage connections of all those industrial units in the city, which discharge their effluents illegally in sewage lines. This industrial wastewater mixed in sewage damage the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and improperly treated wastewater was discharge into the Sabarmati river causing more pollution. During a hearing on Friday, the high court ordered AMC and GPCB to take criminal action against industrial units that still continue to discharge their effluents in sewage water. Following this, the screen printing association issued a notice to its member units, situated in Behrampura and Danilimda, on Saturday and instructed them to keep units closed from December 27, 2021 to January 27, 2022 or until further notice. The association stated in its notice that the work for drainage connections of member units with CETP has been 96% complete. Till the drainage connections with CETP are completely established, the members units should stall all production activities. The association has also stated that if any member unit is found open during this period, the AMC, GPCB and the association would take strict action against the defaulting unit. It has also threatened to send the defaulting unit’s name to the high court, which has already ordered AMC for public shaming of polluting units and their owners. The printing association also told its member units that since all drainage pipelines are diverted to CETP, each of the members should deposit its share of contribution for this diversion within two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/river-pollution-720-printing-units-to-remain-closed-for-month/articleshow/88497041.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fresh curbs lead to wave of party cancellations citywide||MUMBAI: The state government’s Covid-driven imposition of night curfew and curbs on New Year parties, weddings and gatherings has caused a wave of cancellations citywide. The Christmas-New Year spell is a peak revenue earner for the hospitality industry, plus the marriage season is under way in full swing. Embarrassed families are revoking wedding invitations that were sent out weeks ago as the government’s order states that not more than 100 guests will be allowed at weddings held in closed venues and at open air venues, the limit has been set at 250 guests or 25% of capacity, whichever is less. Hotels and clubs have called off parties and music shows for which bookings were taken, and are arranging refunds. TOI spoke with managers, party planners and event organisers affiliated with five-star hotels, restaurants, clubs, gymkhanas, wedding lawns and banquet halls. Each was counting the losses of the state’s last-minute strictures. Some expressed upset, most spoke off the record fearing reprisal. Restaurateur Hossein Mehrazar of Cafe Mommyjoon, Bandra, said, “The night curfew that starts at 9pm will impact footfalls because mo-st diners head out at night.” His brother Mohsen, who owns Lucky Restaurant in Bandra, said, “People have made preparations, passes have been sold and tables booked. If the circular had arrived in advance it would be better. The hospitality industry has been the worst hit during the lockdown. And just as we were recovering comes another closure. Still, I believe the government must surely have had a plan in mind before taking this step. After all, we cannot lower our guard against the pandemic.” Henrison Lobo, partner of Blossoms Lawn in Andheri, said, “Everything about this order is unfortunate. Costs are calculated by number of guests. The fewer the guests the greater the expense. Given the see-sawing rules, people will postpone weddings till March-April 2022. And I wonder if Covid spares crowds and political rallies.” On Saturday, a leading hotel in the western suburbs was processing refunds after being forced to call off its New Year musical soiree. “We offered clients the option to keep a credit note. But people want their money back given the uncertainty over a new Covid wave and another lockdown,” the banquet manager said. Contract workers of a prominent gymkhana in south Mumbai said wedding lists are being downsized. “In this case it is the wedding party that is burdened since they still pay the same amount for hiring the venue, decorator and caterer. Of course we suffer too, since new bookings have halted. And we will still have to pay employees,” said the decorator. Industry associations are at their wits’ end. “This decision is unfortunate as it is New Year. It will have a huge impact on the industry. Revellers are planning to travel to neighbouring states to party, so it will be a revenue loss for our state government too. We are following all SOPs,” said Shivanand Shetty, AHAR president. “After two years of being restricted indoors, people want to enjoy New Year. But the cancellation brings tremendous loss and disappointment. Our staff is vaccinated and we are following rules,” said Pradeep Shetty, senior VP, HRAWI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fresh-curbs-lead-to-wave-of-party-cancellations-citywide/articleshow/88497164.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Man digs mom’s grave, brings home decaying body||TRICHY: A 38-year-old man who dug his mother’s grave and brought home her semi-decomposed body was detained by Kunnam police in Perambalur district on Friday night. The body recovered from the man’s house was sent to Perambalur government hospital and police are planning to cremate the mortal remains in the presence of family members. Police identified the man as V Balamurugan, a resident of Paravai village near Kunnam. Unmarried and unemployed, he was under the care of his parents Velu and Mookayi. While his father died a decade ago, Balamurugan’s mother Mookayi, 65, who took care of him, fell ill and passed away about 10 months ago. Balamurugan, who became mentally disoriented, used to frequent the burial site in the village and talk to himself. In the early hours of Friday, he discreetly dug up his mother’s grave, brought home the semi-decomposed body and safeguarded it. The incident came to light only after one of his relatives who visited the house to provide him dinner found the body in the house with foul smell emanating from it. As locals and Kunnam police were alerted, the mortal remains were moved to the government hospital. Balamurugan was detained for an inquiry. “He had previously attempted to retrieve his mother’s body but was stopped by the locals who had caught him at the burial site. He seems to be mentally disturbed,” a police official said. Since the house is less than a kilometre away from the burial ground, villagers did not notice the man carrying the corpse to the house. Kunnam police are investigating the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-38-digs-mothers-grave-brings-home-decaying-body/articleshow/88497091.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Siddis seek ST tag for their brothers||AHMEDABAD: People of African descent, the Siddis reached the shores of western India centuries ago, when they were brought by Arab traders, Portuguese or other seafarers. As the years turned into decades and decades into centuries, Gujarat became homeland to the Siddis, who followed the local customs and traditions In fact, a majority of Siddis speak and understand only one language – Gujarati. Such have the Siddis’ traditions been imbibed in Gujarat’s culture and heritage that their dance and music have charmed world leaders who seek to delve into Gujarat’s cultural diversity. Over the past few decades, like other communities, the Siddis have also relocated to other parts of Gujarat from Junagadh and its surrounding regions where they were residing for generations. However, this natural progression for better livelihood prospects, has led to a rather peculiar challenge for the community – Siddis residing in select districts of Saurashtra are considered tribals, while those elsewhere in Gujarat aren’t. Following the letter of a notification granting tribal status to Siddis, the Gujarat government only recognizes Siddis of Saurashtra as tribals. All the other Siddis – despite being identical to those living in Saurashtra but spread out and settled in other districts – are not classified as Siddis. They are deprived of all the benefits and schemes of both the state and central governments that the tribals are entitled to. And while Gujarat’s babudom has been pleading helplessness although some realize the inadequacies of the notification, some from within the Siddi community have set out to put things right. “When we enthral dignitaries from around the world with the ‘Dhamaal’ performance, all the performers are Siddis. The truth is that a Siddi from Saurashtra is a tribal, but the one from Mehsana is not,” says 37-year Salim Siddi, who has taken upon himself the task of convincing the government to rectify the flawed official document. For the past few months, Salim and others from the community have been reaching out to government agencies in various districts, applying for ST status. But, they have been running into a dead-end every time. “Over the past one month, we met chief minister Bhupendra Patel and other government functionaries. While they agree that Siddis residing outside Saurashtra are at a distinct disadvantage, most have said that they are helpless,” says Bilkis Makwana, president of Junagadh Adijati Parishad. “My son would have been studying medicine in one of the reputed medical colleges if I had a tribal certificate,” rues Younus Badshah, a Siddi businessman settled in Bharuch district and engaged in supplying firewood to industries in Ankleshwar. “My elder son is preparing for the armed constabulary examination and my younger son is studying pharmacy. Had I been classified as a tribal like my other Siddi brethren, it would have been a different story,” said Badshah. Supposedly presented as slaves by the Portuguese to the Nawab of Junagadh more than 300 years ago, the Siddis primarily live in districts around the Gir sanctuary. To be fair to the state government, the Siddis inhabited only parts of Saurashtra perhaps until five decades ago, when the notification that accorded them ST status was issued. While the 2011 census puts the number of Siddis with ST status at 8,611 in six districts of Saurashtra, those working for the welfare of the community say that the number of Siddis could be around 2 lakh today. Over the years, a sizable number of them, about 50,000, according to Salim Siddhi’s Bilali Adivasi Seva Trust, have settled in districts mainly Kutch, Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Vadodara, Surat and Banaskantha. The dichotomy According to the original government notification, Siddis residing in six districts of Saurashtra – Junagadh, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Surendranagar, Bhavnagar and Amreli were given ST status. Over the years, newer districts have been carved out from these, namely Gir Somnath, Porbandar, Devbhumi Dwarka, Morbi and Botad. Siddis of these 11 districts enjoy ST status while all others in Kutch, north Gujarat, central Gujarat and south Gujarat are not eligible for ST status. ‘Dhamaal’ entertained world leaders Whether it be showcasing Gujarat’s rich cultural diversity before global dignitaries at successive Vibrant Gujarat Global Summits or at other important events over the decades, Siddis have enthralled onlookers with their Dhamaal dance. Wearing colourful clothing and body paint, the Siddis dance vivaciously to the beat of the drums. Although, over the centuries, the Siddis have adopted the language and customs of Gujarat, the ‘Goma’ dance and music form has been preserved by the Siddis. The term is believed to have been derived from ‘Ngoma’ – a traditional drumming and dance form of the Bantu people who inhabited parts of the African continent. What Siddis outside Saurashtra are missing Of the state’s total budget, 14.75% outlay is earmarked for tribal welfare schemes. Apart from the ambitious Vanbandhu kalyan yojana, tribals can also avail benefits of various central schemes. From education to livelihood and economic development and from health and hygiene to marginalised societies, the government runs a number of schemes for those belonging to tribal communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/siddis-seek-st-tag-for-their-brothers/articleshow/88497106.cms||Meghdoot Sharon

Unlike in previous years, this time parking will not be allowed in the fields along the Chogm road opposite Calangute church, said Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins. Instead, large outstation tourist buses, tempo travellers and other large vehicles will be parked in the fields at Bhokovod on the Calangute-Mapusa route and further in the fields at Nagoa for traffic coming from Panjim and Mapusa. Vehicles coming from the Anjuna side will have to park near the Wax Museum in Arpora just before the Arpora-Calangute bridge, Martins said. Small private vehicles will be allowed to proceed towards the parking areas in Baga and Calangute. In Candolim, with no mega music festival in the peak Christmas season, no special arrangements have been made. Tourism stakeholders said the tourist inflow is still subdued, probably because of the Omicron scare, but expect the crowd to swell in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-panchayat-puts-parking-plan-in-place/articleshow/88511793.cms||---

Chief minister M K Stalin will inaugurate the bus terminus, which is in the final leg of redevelopment at a cost of Rs 18.80 crore, along with other infrastructure projects on December 30. The redeveloped terminus has two terminals to halt city and mofussil buses. The bus stand will have 54 shops, a restaurant and a two-wheeler parking lot. Inspecting the final phase of work, the minister said that additional retiring rooms for the transport corporation staff will be built. “As a part of the CM’s visit, a GO for releasing Rs 400 crore towards the integrated bus terminus will be released in the first phase. An integrated vegetable market is also planned. The CM will lay the foundation stone for the new terminus,” the minister said. Two elevated corridors proposed for the city between Cauvery bridge-Odathurai bridge intersection and Mallachipuram via Kalaignar Arivalayam and between Melachinthamani and Trichy railway Junction via Head post office are likely to be announced by the chief minister during his visit to the city. “The zoological park proposal is revived. We will facilitate water connection. The minister concerned and senior forest officials have promised to open the facility by the next year,” K N Nehru said, reacting to the status of the long-pending M R Palayam zoo.  Trichy Corporation sources said that the Rockfort hillock illumination project, a part of the heritage tourism development proposal under the smart cities mission, may also be commissioned by the CM. The process of fixing 108 multicolour LED floodlights around the hillock was already completed and a trial run was done. However, officials said that the Teppakulam laser light and sound show project, another component of the heritage tourism proposal, will take a few more weeks to get commissioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichys-smart-city-projects-ready/articleshow/88497092.cms||---

The former Union minister urged NHAI to hold discussions with the state government for resolving the constraints in completing the highway projects. Reacting to the road transport ministry’s decision to foreclose six crucial road projects including six-laning of Sriperumbudur - Walajapet, four-laning of a stretch between Tamil Nadu-Kerala border to Kanyakumari and four-laning of the road from Vikravandi to Cholapuram, Anbumani said that dropping projects midway could defeat the purpose of initiating the proposals. “NHAI has said they have planned to construct the highway where the land acquisition was over, leaving behind areas where land acquisition is not completed. Such a decision is unfair,” the MP said. The MP urged NHAI to explore options such as discussing and gaining the government’s cooperation in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/anbumani-urges-nhai-not-to-foreclose-highway-projects/articleshow/88497096.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Christmas sermons focus on fighting intolerance, Omicron||Kolkata: Heads of the Catholic Church and the Church of North India (CNI) prayed the Omicron scare be over soon and not turn into a horror experienced not too long ago. Addressing the Christmas midnight mass, they also spoke about the need to fight against intolerance that was dividing people. “We pray for deliverance from coronavirus. Though the new variant is here and is spreading panic, may the Lord bless us that it be a phase that is soon over without causing any damage to lives and livelihoods. Though I am not a man of science, I hear that Omicron may be heavily contagious but may not be very harsh on human lives. I pray to God on Christmas that he take us within his fold and protect us from this scare. May this Christmas be one of peace, prosperity and everlasting hope,” said Archbishop Thomas D Souza. He read Midnight Mass at The Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary and said special prayers for Christmas on Saturday morning at the chapel of the Archbishop House. “Intolerance of different points of view is on the rise, creating a rift between people. This is damaging our social fabric. I spoke about staying united in the face of all adversity,” said Reverend Swarup Bar of St Andrew’s Church. City churches opened early on Saturday as the faithful braved the chill and arrived in their Christmas finery to attend the special prayer service and the sermon which presents the guidelines on one’s duties towards the society and fellow citizens. In most churches, the sermon centred around the teachings from Jesus Christ’s life and the Bible and were contextualised for present times. At Duff Church, where the authorities had requested those above 60 to follow the proceedings online from home, Reverend Father Biswajit Biswas spoke of how important it was to safeguard everybody against the pandemic and its new variant. “Being compassionate to a fellow human not only means helping them with food or resources. It also means we take all precautionary measures against the pandemic so it doesn’t spread because of our callousness. We might be strong to fight the virus, but somebody else might not be so. The Omicron variant is concerning,” he said. Bishop Paritosh Canning prayed the fear of Omicron passes quickly and the pandemic be over soon at the midnight mass at St Paul’s Cathedral and other churches where he read mass in the morning. He used the symbol of the Christmas Tree, saying, “The Christmas Tree never dies. Even in the midst of heavy snow that threatens to snuff out lives, it stands tall and remains evergreen. Human life in care of the Lord remains like a Christmas Tree, the scare of coronavirus and Omicron notwithstanding. May the Lord lead us to light, leaving darkness behind.” The vicar general of the Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church, Father Dominic Gomes, said Omicron will soon be a thing of the past with fervent prayers. He spoke at a heavily attended Christmas mass at St Anthony’s Church on Saturday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/christmas-sermons-focus-on-fighting-intolerance-omicron/articleshow/88496567.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Kolkata||Sales soar at restos as city raises a toast to Christmas||Kolkata: City restaurants witnessed high footfalls on Christmas and food and liquor sales jumped by 30% compared to 2019. With liquor turning cheaper at most restaurants following a price slash last month, sales could double by New Year Eve, predicted the Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI). The higher footfall could also be due to a ‘reverse Omicron effect’, felt HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar. Restaurants and bars now have a 70% ceiling on occupancy. “With Omicron cases being reported in the city, many are scared that restrictions could be imposed next month and are eager to make the most of this festive week. This made the younger crowd flock to restaurants and bars in huge numbers. The crowd will keep swelling till New Year’s Eve,” said Poddar. As the city raised a toast to Christmas with extra pegs of liquor, overall sales surpassed all expectations. “This time, we have a predominantly young crowd since the elderly are now preferring to stay indoors. This has pushed up our liquor sales,” said Poddar. There has been 25%-30% jump in liquor sales across some Park Street restaurants. Most, however, are yet to slash alcohol prices. “We have seen a 30% rise in liquor orders since last week. Food orders, too, have jumped since families have started dropping in. We expect a daily 10% rise in orders of both food and drinks over the next seven days,” said Pratap Daryanani, owner of Oasis on Park Street where liquor prices have been reduced. Chapter 2 on Southern Avenue has seen a 25% spike in liquor orders over last week. “While this is the trend every year, this year we expect orders to rise even sharply since prices have come down. We are in the process of reducing liquor prices,” said owner Shiladitya Chaudhury. Mocambo and Peter Cat are yet to slash liquor prices since old stocks are yet to run out. Liquor orders are yet to change significantly, said owner Nitin Kothari. “But overall attendance has been better than expected,” said owner Nitin Kothari Bar-B-Q, too, recorded a high footfall. “Both food and liquor sales have gone up steeply since Christmas Eve. It was even better on Christmas,” said owner Rajiv Kothari. Some others like Chili’s, however, have seen a drop in footfall from 2019. “It’s probably due to the Omicron scare for there’s no other reason why people should stay away from restaurants during this time,” said owner Hrishi Bajoria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sales-soar-at-restos-as-city-raises-a-toast-to-christmas/articleshow/88496569.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Post a year’s break, devotees in church for 25/12 service||KOLKATA: Most churches in the city had over 90% attendance — both for midnight mass, and morning and evening mass, on Christmas. They said they were relieved it was not a repeat of last year when the mass was virtual and parishioners could only join in through links. Some seniors, however, opted to stay home, fearing infection. But they rued that they could not join the services since virtual links were not provided this time. Devotees wore masks, kept hands sanitised and sat with adequate distance among one another. Parish priests ensured that no one flouted Covid norms and even announced how important it is to maintain all protocols since the Omicron scare is in the air. The enthusiasm among devotees was palpable, who said they had feared that churches would not hold physical mass because of the Omicron scare. They admitted they were relieved when churches finally announced the prayer timings. “I even took my youngest grandchild along. We didn’t want to miss the opportunity to physically attend church once again,” said Sunil Baptist, who attended the 8.15pm service at St Teresa’s Church near Moulali. There were several people of the community who said they were obligated to go to church on Christmas and had sorely missed it last year. “So what if I am 87? I got up early so I could go across from my Park Lane residence to St Thomas Church on Middleton Street. It was so nice to hear the priest speak at the 10.30am mass,” said Dorothy Manuk. This was echoed by Margaret Coelho, another senior who attended midnight mass at Our Lady of Vailankanni Church at Picnic Garden. “There were nearly 1,000 people, but they were divided into batches and mass was held on several levels of the church. It was a relief to be back for physical mass,” she said. But her husband Pius, who is in his late 80s, could not attend church and said he missed the virtual links that allowed people to join in from home. Linda O Brien could not attend mass because of age and a problem in her legs, so the priest of Christ The King church came home to give her and her husband, Errol, communion. “We felt blessed,” he said. Another member of the church, 82-year-old Edwin Arthur Patrick Eccleston, also stayed home fearing Covid, though he lives near his church. “I did not want to risk it. I would have attended the mass virtually had the link been given. These days I join mass in churches of the US and Canada, thanks to the opening up of the virtual world through links they provide,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/post-a-yrs-break-devotees-in-church-for-25/12-service/articleshow/88496572.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Hubballi||Christmas in Dharwad: Devotees offer prayers for an end to pandemic||Dharwad: Prayers seeking an end to the pandemic marked Christmas festivities, which kicked off on Christmas Eve on Friday. The week-long celebrations in the twin cities were marked by devotees cutting across religions, offering prayers for world peace. On Friday night, devotees burst crackers to signal the start of the celebrations. Members of the Christian community started trooping into churches late on Friday night, and commemorated the birth of Jesus Christ by singing carols and participating in the Mass. Meanwhile, the Hebich Memorial Church, the All Saints Church and the Catholic Holy Cross Church on the premises of the Saint Joseph’s School were all decked up with flowers, and ornamental lights to ring in the festivities. Devotees exchanged sweets, while Pastors led the prayers, delivering sermons that touched upon the solemnity of the occasion, and evoked the qualities of Christ. Celebrations at home were merry affairs, with many Christians inviting friends for dinners, where wine flowed, along with joy. The Basel Mission Church was illuminated, while balloons, bells, ribbons and buntings added to the atmosphere of gaiety. In his address, newly-elected Bishop of CSI’s Karnataka Northern Diocese, Reverend Martin Borgai said, “May the New Year usher in prosperity and establish peace in society. Jesus Christ preached peace and harmony 2,021 years ago, and his message remains relevant to this day. The true celebration of Christmas will be for members of all religions to partake of each other’s festivities together.” The festivities will continue till New Year’s day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/christmas-in-dharwad-devotees-offer-prayers-for-an-end-to-pandemic/articleshow/88496305.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

All teachers under departments of higher and technical educational institutions, including vice chancellors, registrars etc, will be trained at the institute. The aim of the institute is to provide teachers with continuous training rather than just a foundation course. In a few years, the building will also be home to the directorate of technical education and other higher education-related offices in the city, becoming a one-stop solution for all higher education needs of both students and colleges. Nipun Vinayak, executive director of the organisation, said that the academy will provide multidisciplinary and inclusive training to teachers, helping them to move out of the traditional silos of education, and move towards a holistic development. “Teacher training is an important part of the new national education policy. Through this academy, we will be able to train about 1 lakh professors in more than 4,000 colleges and one and a half thousand technical education colleges in the state. Moreover, all the universities in the state will be the sub-centres of the institute, and training facilities will be made available through them,” said Vinayak. Uday Samant, the minister of higher and technical education, said that many reputed organisations are working with the academy and that tech giants like Infosys, too, have agreed to help via its CSR activity. “Apart from professors, non-teaching staff will also be imparted modern training. This is a Rs60crore project and this is the first phase of it. We also plan to scale this up by bringing all the offices related to higher education in one place on the same campus as the institute. Instead of making it just a 9-5 office space, we also hope to use the space here for training students for UPSC and MPSC exams,” said Samant. Aditya Thackeray, the tourism and environment minister, said that students should be encouraged to ask questions. “Asking questions is considered wrong, not just in classrooms, but outside, too. This needs to change. Teachers are responsible for shaping the next generation and hence keeping them updated is important,” said Thackeray. The academy logo, designed by Sir JJ School of Art College, was also unveiled. Meeting with striking staffers on Monday Non-teaching staff of Savitribai Phule Pune University and some other educational institutes have been on indefinite strike since December 21 over demands such as implementation of promised career progression scheme, arrears in salary, implementation of seventh pay commission etc. Uday Samant said an online meeting will be held on Monday to solve their grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/faculty-development-academy-starts-in-pune/articleshow/88497135.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Submit no. of juveniles shifted to JJ homes: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has asked the city government to furnish the number of children/juveniles who were transferred from adult jails to juvenile justice homes/child care institutions in the last five years. The court said it would help it better understand the systemic flaws that lead to delinquent children/juveniles ending up in adult jails. Issuing a slew of directions to streamline the functioning of the juvenile justice delivery system, the high court also ordered the Delhi government to fill the seven vacant posts of District Child Protection Officers within six weeks. A bench comprising justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani asked the city government to state when and how many juveniles were admitted to Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails and then transferred to the child care institutions as well as the offences allegedly committed by them. The bench was dealing with various issues pertaining to the interpretation and effective implementation of some provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act. “To better understand the systemic flaws that lead to delinquent children/juveniles ending up in adult jails, to begin with, we direct the Govt. of NCT of Delhi to furnish to this court the number of children/juveniles who were transferred from adult jails to juvenile justice homes/child care institutions in the last 05 years, with the details of the numbers found in Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails, respectively; along with the date they were admitted and the date on which they were transferred from adult jails to juvenile justice homes/child care institutions; as also the offences with which they were charged. Let this information be filed before the next date of hearing by the State,” the court directed in a recent order. It directed that every Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) shall call for an “Individual Care Plan” and a “Rehabilitation Card” of a delinquent child from the superintendent of the concerned home and review the progress of the child once every three months and issue necessary directions in case of unsatisfactory implementation. It further stated that all JJBs must ensure that the post-release plan to recommend the aftercare for such child, which is required to be drawn-up two months before he/she is due to leave a child care institution, is placed before the concerned JJB and the child is produced before it two months before release. The JJB must vet the post-release plan and issue necessary directions for its modification, monitoring and implementation, the court added. It noted that several pending cases of petty offences against juveniles have been disposed of by the JJBs and Individual Care Plans have been called in many matters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/submit-no-of-juveniles-shifted-to-jj-homes-hc/articleshow/88497642.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Arrangements have been made for Calangute, Panaji and Anjuna with one-way system imposed in some areas and additional police force deployed round the clock. “We are proposing to put a total of 700 police personnel on duty that day. It will be closely supervised by PIs on duty,” said North Goa DySP (traffic) Salim Shaikh. Buses and large vehicles will be parked only outside the Calangute panchayat area and other open spaces in the jurisdiction so ensure that there is no traffic congestion. Similar plans are being drawn out for Panaji and Anjuna, with unused fields to be utilised after permissions from the panchayats for parking of vehicles. Adequate sign boards and barricades are being placed to ensure discipline. A staff of 500-600 people will be posted in three shifts from 7am to 2pm, 2pm to 8pm and 8pm to 7am. They will be deployed on duty from December 27 onwards, Shaikh said. They have deployed staff from other traffic units where not much celebration takes place such as Bicholim and Canacona. Staff has also been drawn from the district police, India Reserve Battalion and guards of the Goa human resource development. Civic agencies have also been asked to expedite pending roadworks at the earliest to ensure that the roads are in proper condition for the New Year’s Eve, Shaikh said.

---||Delhi||Lights, camera, iconic monument replicas: Delhi's Bharat Darshan Park now open to public||NEW DELHI: After a wait of 22 months, the Bharat Darshan Park at Punjabi Bagh was finally thrown open to the public after its inauguration by union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday evening. The park, which has replicas of 22 historical monuments from 14 states, is unique in many ways. All the replicas have been built with waste and scrap material. The venue also has solar trees to fulfill its energy requirements. The entry ticket to the venue will cost Rs 100 for adults and Rs 50 for senior citizens and children (aged between 3 and 12 years). For kids below three years, no ticket will be required. During evening hours, when the whole complex and monuments will be lit with decorative lights, South Delhi Municipal Corporation will sell premium tickets, which will cost Rs 150 for adults and Rs 75 for children (3-12 years). For 10 lakh students studying in the three civic bodies’ schools, entry will be free and for students of other schools, it will cost Rs 40. “This is the first park of India in which replicas of 22 historical monuments are displayed at one place in a beautiful and attractive way. The monuments were constructed with scrap/waste material like old vehicles, fans, iron rods, nuts & bolts, etc, which were lying unused/abandoned at SDMC’s stores. These replicas have been made under waste to art initiative,” said SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti. The park will have replicas of Qutub Minar, Taj Mahal, Char Minar, Gateway of India, Konark Temple, Mysore Palace, Meenakshi Temple, Hampi, Victoria Memorial, Sanchi Stupa, Gol Gumbaz, Azanta & Ellora Caves, Hawa Mahal, Khajuraho Temple, Nalanda University, Junagarh Fort, Tawang Gate, Rameswaram, Dwarkadhish, Jagannath Puri, Badrinath and a banyan tree. Addressing the public, union home minister Amit Shah said, “The park is best example of ‘kachra to kanchan’ and inaugurated on a day, which also happens to the birthdays of two dignitaries Bharat Ratna Madan Mohan Malviya and late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. SDMC is conveying the relevance of waste to art, Swachh Bharat, promoting tourism and sharing the importance of monuments representing various cultures to the general public through this park.” “Despite witnessing Covid pandemic and its cascading effect, the entire park was developed in a period of 22 months. During the pandemic, work at the site was halted. Getting everything in place was a difficult task, but we still managed to achieve results,” said an official. The park is spread over 8.5 acres and Rs 20 crore was spent on it. Special lighting arrangements have been made to add to the aesthetic charm of the replicas. “Around 109 kW of electricity will be produced from solar and wind energies at the park to meet the power demand. At least, five solar trees having capacity to produce 5 KW of electricity each and a solar rooftop having capacity to produce 84 KW electricity have been installed at the park. To highlight each of these replicas beautifully, an adequate arrangement of light has been made inside the park, including 755 facade lights, 3 LED screens, 600 bollard lights, 1 DJ set and 102 compound lights. 51 CCTV cameras are there for safety purposes,” the civic body stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lights-camera-iconic-monument-replicas-bharat-darshan-park-now-open-to-public/articleshow/88497650.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nagpur||Spike of over 20 Covid cases after 168 days in district||NAGPUR: The district registered a sudden jump of 24 cases most likely for the first time since July 10, on Saturday. The district had struck baseline sometime early July when cases suddenly fell below 50 and by July 10, remained under 20 a day till Saturday. More often, the cases were also under 5 and the district achieved zero Covid reports on a couple of occasions. The day’s new cases included 21 from the city limits and rest from rural, but only two patients recovered in the day. The new cases were detected from 3,897 Covid tests for a test positivity rate (TPR) of 0.61%. So far this month, the district has witnessed 202 cases against a TPR of mere 0.22%. Of these, 154 were from the city limits, 23 from rural and rest from other districts. The city’s TPR is 0.22% and rural’s 0.1% for this month. On December 1, the district had just seven cases while 9 had recovered. This led to active cases dropping under 50, which have now jumped to 79. All of these patients need to be under mandatory institutional quarantine as per NMC protocol. In the last seven days too, the daily cases ranged between 4 and 13. The low positivity rate emboldened the administration to permit pubic gatherings, cultural events and reopening of educational institutes. On September 8, the district had seen 18 cases after which the numbers remained mostly under single digits. Experts warned that though the Omicron threat looms large, Delta continues to be a bigger threat. Some vaccinated patients have caught severe Covid infection and are under treatment in private hospitals. A 1% increase in test positivity rate will indicate onset of third wave as such spikes will keep springing up, they said. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said the next one week is crucial. “If it’s consistently high for a week, then we are in a better position to predict the next wave. Positivity rate is the best marker. We need to track it. Isolated spikes will come and go. But undercurrent will start now. If TPR goes up by more than 1% to 2 %, it’s surely the beginning of 3rd wave. But our baseline immunity will contain the cases for the initial period of time,” he said. Dr Shined said Delta variant is still causing serious illness even in some vaccinated people. “Anecdotal reports say Omicron is not associated with high hospitalization rate. Delta is still mighty in severity than Omicron,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/spike-of-over-20-covid-cases-after-168-days-in-district/articleshow/88497168.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s 24-hour Covid count rises for 5th day in a row||MUMBAI: The city’s Covid graph climbed for the fifth consecutive day, with the BMC registering 731 cases on Saturday. The state’s daily tally rose correspondingly to 1,485. A closer look at the daily Covid update revealed that the Mumbai region (comprising Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Palghar and Raigad) accounted for 68% of the state’s Saturday’s caseload. Of the 1,485 cases, 1,011 are from the Mumbai region. Pune region is a distant second with 289 cases. The only encouraging sign is that Mumbai for the sixth time in December recorded zero deaths. The state added 12 deaths to its 1.4 lakh toll. The rest of the parameters -- daily test positivity rate, the number of sealed buildings and bed occupancy -- are showing an upward trend. The positivity rate increased from 0.53 on December 10 to 1.8% on December 24. The number of sealed buildings has gone up from 11 at the start of the week to 17. Of the 15,299 Covid beds in the city, occupancy has risen from 879 on December 19 to 1,176 on December 24. However, BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said this increase is mainly because Omicron suspects are being quarantined in hospitals. Navi Mumbai detected 71 new Covid cases, the highest in the last three months. The rise in cases in the last few days has also led to swelling patients’ volume in the Covid health care centres. The number of active cases has increased to 446 now from the previous low of 225 a fortnight ago in Navi Mumbai. Officials say they have ramped up testing from 7,000 per day to nearly 9,000 per day. Active cases in the state and Mumbai also continue to rise. State government officials said districts have been directed to ramp up testing and even ensure that the people in home isolation are following protocols. The Centre has sent multidisciplinary teams to Maharashtra for better monitoring and suggesting any changes in the protocols to curb the spread of Omicron. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said the public health machinery has to check the spread of cases. “We now have sporadic cases, but if transmission continues to increases and case doubling rate decreases, we could see large cluster outbreaks between January 15 and February 15,” said Dr Joshi.

---||Delhi||BJP improved Delhi’s infrastructure: Amit Shah||NEW DELHI: Inaugurating the Bharat Darshan Park at Punjabi Bagh on Saturday, union home minister Amit Shah highlighted efforts made by the Centre and the civic bodies, which are run by the BJP, in improving infrastructure in the capital. He pointed out that they had “beautified the area below flyovers, developed 31 vacant sites as parks, installed 1,100 open gyms, developed 27 sewer treatment plants, revived five water bodies and made the first park after rejuvenating a water body in it under Jal Shakti Abhiyan.” “I want to tell Kejriwal if the pending dues of Rs 13,000 crore were given to the municipal corporations, they could have done much more work,” he said. Shah claimed that it was because the three municipal corporations were run by the BJP that the Modi government had been carrying out various welfare programmes in the capital. “We started the process for regularising 1,731 colonies which benefited 40 lakh people and then gave relief to thousands of jhuggis under the in-situ slum rehabilitation housing projects by providing pucca houses. The project at Kathputli Colony, Kalkaji and Jailorwala Bagh, besides others, will benefit 85,000 jhuggis,” he said. Shah pointed out that the central government had allotted Rs 12,000 crore for extension of Delhi Metro in different phases. “Before 2014, the Metro rail lines were expanding at a speed of 14 km each year. And after 2014, these started to expand at a rate of 25 km per year. Till date, 112 km of new lines have been laid after Centre spent Rs 12,000 crores. Further, to reduce traffic jams from Kalindi Kunj to Mehrauli, we are also working on a decongestion project,” he said. Taking a dig at CM Arvind Kejriwal over advertising the government’s work, the home minister said there were two types of work culture — one which actually carries out development work and fulfils promises and the other which gives only lip service. “We have provided free vaccines to 130 crore people, introduced administrative reforms, come up with a new education policy, implemented development programmes and now plan to give 25 kg of foodgrains till Holi to 80,000 poor people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. But we never made any noise about these achievements,” he said. “And the other is karo ya na karo, advertisements do, TV interviews do. People of Delhi have now realised who is actually doing developmental work and who just pays lip service,” he said. Shah said there was a time when people used to mock the BJP saying it wanted to construct a Ram temple at Ayodhya but was not disclosing the date when it would be open. “But now these people are going for darshan and everyone has seen that a grand Ram temple is being built in Ayodhya at the initiative of PM Narendra Modi,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-improved-capitals-infra/articleshow/88497681.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nagpur||Buldhana Omicron patient discharged, 3 close contacts +ve||Nagpur: The only Omicron patient of Buldhana was discharged on Thursday after he tested Covid negative in his 10th day RT-PCR. The 67-year-old person, who had returned from Dubai, was the second from Vidarbha to test positive for Omicron. Like in case of two Omicron patients detected in Nagpur, the elderly Buldhana patient was asymptomatic and vaccinated, officials said. Buldhana Covid hospital officials said that three high risk close contacts of the 67-year-old have tested positive with one of them — a 72-year-old unvaccinated man — catching pneumonia. His sample has been sent for genome sequencing to NIV, Pune, after he developed moderate disease. The district doesn’t have ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) kits which are effective in early Omicron surveillance. Officials said they are expecting the kits in a few days. All the three close contacts are from the same building where the Omicron patient resided. They have been admitted to the Covid hospital on premises of District Women’s Hospital. The administration has been advised to periodically monitor close contacts of Omicron patients even if they test negative the first time. In Nagpur, the 21-year-old Dubai returned youth, who tested positive for SGTF, is doing well and remains asymptomatic. Two more international flyers have tested positive for SGTF. This means Nagpur’s Omicron count is likely to increase by three following confirmation in whole genome sequencing. Results are expected anytime this week. The samples will be processed by Neeri’s environmental virology cell and NIV Pune. On Friday, TOI had reported that the Dubai returned youth has been shifted to AIIMS where other Covid patients too are admitted in different wards. The SGTF positive youth had travelled to Bengaluru from Mumbai in a train and reached Nagpur in train after his Covid sample tested positive. The administration is also running SGTF tests for new Covid patients in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/buldhana-omicron-patient-discharged-3-close-contacts-ve/articleshow/88497190.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nagpur||Govt scholarship students can work abroad post study||Nagpur: In a good news for students pursuing higher education under Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj Foreign Education Scholarship Scheme, the state government has permitted them to work abroad after completing education. Earlier, these students were required to return to India and work here. The condition to return to India was dubbed as unfair by the students saying many of them would not get the right job or salary matching their qualification on their return. Therefore, the education they got through hard work was not getting utilized well to brighten their lives. As per the government resolution (GR) dated December 16, many students had written to the government seeking post study visa following completion of their higher education abroad. NGO The Platform too had sought repealing the condition to return. Many students from across the state had also submitted representations to the social justice ministry in this regard. “This decision has now given an opportunity to the youths of Maharashtra under this scheme to work at the international level, represent the country and strengthen their economic condition, and indirectly strengthen the community, state, and the country,” the NGO stated. However, the students would not be entitled to any increase in allowances or return fare in case they stay back to work after study. “This decision will give many students international job and business exposure. We hope that minister of social justice and special assistance will continue to take such decisions in public interest. Thus the funds spent by the department on the education of the scheduled castes will be utilized in a proper and efficient manner for the purpose meant for. We also expect that the minister would give some relaxation on the condition of returning home after 2 years of service. At the same time, it is expected from the students that after elevating their careers, they will pay back to the society and country,” said Rajiv Khobragade, member of the NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-scholarship-students-can-work-abroad-post-study/articleshow/88497204.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Jaipur||JDA to fix use of greenfield airport land||Jaipur: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) will soon decide the land use of the 2,100 hectare after de-reserving the area where greenfield airport in Shivdaspura was proposed to be built. After the decision was taken that airport will not be constructed on the reserved land, the town planning wing has started the exercise to earmark the area as ‘special area’ in the Master Plan 2025. The notification for the same will be released soon. Farmers living near Shivdaspura heaved a sigh of relief last year as their land reserved for the airport was freed after 16 years. However, in absence of land use change, the owners were not able to reap the benefit. An official said, “Once the land use is decided, it will provide a major relief to farmers of 20 villages who were unable to utilise their valuable land. In May 2020, the state government decided to free the reserve land as airport cannot be constructed in the area.” Local land owners have expressed disappointment as work is moving at a snail’s pace. Ashok Singh, a land owner, said, “We have submitted several memorandum to state government but nothing has been done till date. For the past many years, the district lease committee (DLC) rates of the area have not increased. Earlier in Lok Sabha, civil aviation minister had replied that no airport was proposed in Shivdaspura. Still, the land was kept reserved.” The ministry of civil aviation turned down the proposal to construct the airport. This was the reason the state government cancelled the scheme for the benefit of people. “In 2004, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) proposed to acquire land for the airport. A year later, the draft proposal was forwarded to the Urban Development and Housing. Following the announcement, JDA had imposed a ban on land conversion and issuing of lease deeds in Shivdaspura. In 2017, the state government gave a nod to the JDA to acquire 2,094 hectares in 20 villages for the airport.

On the lines of big cities, including Delhi, Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) also gave branding and ‘semi-naming in rights’ to companies whose name may appear as a prefix to a station’s name. JMRC had earlier floated a tender to give the rights for stations on corridor Phase I. A JMRC official said, “Auctioning of semi-naming and branding rights at station would generate non-fare revenue for corporation. From three stations, the JMRC is likely to earn Rs 10 lakh per month.” The rights have been provided for seven years, which can be later extended for next three years as per the contract. “Three station includes Mansarovar, Sindhi Camp and Railway station. They will be renamed after a real estate company, a coaching institute and a vernacular newspaper.” An official said, in other cities such as Delhi, Chennai apart from generating direct revenue through auctioning of naming rights, the corporation has received added benefits. Explaining the concept, an official said, at stations, the undertakings that have bought the naming right, also do the branding of the stations with colours associated with the respective companies. This adds to the aesthetic value of the station. Also, with the company maintaining the exterior of the stations, JMRC will not have to worry about maintaining it, he said. To make the project viable, the JMRC is making desperate attempts to increase the non-fare revenue. As per the (JMRC) assessment, the project is staring at an annual operational loss of Rs 41 crore for the next five years. The loss is calculated at 60% of the ridership. The amount will rise up to Rs 71 crore a year if the loss is calculated at 20% ridership. As JMRC continues to achieve expected ridership even after phase IB corridor during the pandemic, it remains a challenge to repay the Rs 969-crore loan taken from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Unlike other Metros, the maximum share of operational losses of Jaipur Metro is borne by residents since the state government is raising money for the Rajasthan Transport Infrastructure Development Fund (RTIDF) RTIDF by levying cess on several services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/three-metro-stations-to-be-renamed/articleshow/88497207.cms||---

Despite being asked to leave, the youths allegedly continued creating trouble in an inebriated condition before assaulting police. Cops have arrested five persons so far and slapped stringent IPC sections against them. CCTV footage from the night club and the road outside has been seized to further investigate the case. Overall, the city witnessed 94 arrests on Friday and Saturday. According to police, they received a call around 3.15am informing them of a disturbance at the club. “Immediately, officers from Shakespeare Sarani police station rushed to the spot and found a mob in an intoxicated condition. Even as our officers asked them to leave, they began pushing others. Within minutes, the accused began to deliberately create disturbances. It was also learnt that it was the same mob that was creating nuisance by shouting and getting abusive within the premises of the night club,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. When the police intervened, the accused physically assaulted an on-duty police personnel. “Accordingly, we proceeded to try and arrest the five persons. We had to use some force as they were preventing their arrest. Later on the basis of a complaint letter of sub-inspector Souvik Sen, a case was registered against them at the Shakespeare Sarani PS,” said Jt CP Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drunk-revellers-assault-cop-outside-nightclub-5-held/articleshow/88496626.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Govt spends just Rs 70 crore on ads, says AAP||NEW DELHI: Reacting to Union home minister Amit Shah's comments on Saturday about money spent by the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said in a statement that he should “go around the capital once and see how every nook and corner of Delhi has been hijacked by Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath.” “If he opens the newspaper for once, he'll see how every paper is punctuated by advertisements of Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath. There are 850 hoardings of Modi and Yogi in Delhi. In stark contrast, Delhi government has only put up 108 hoardings. The AAP government spends barely 70 crore rupees on advertisements compared to Yogi Adityanath's splurge of 2,000 crore rupees annually,” a statement said. “Just look at Modi's hoardings in Delhi and see how he blows his own trumpet for even the smallest of the jobs,” the party said. “BJP-ruled corporations are the world's most corrupt civic bodies. BJP leaders eat up all the money of the three bodies and loot public funds. If Amit Shah tries to run them honestly instead of supporting their corruption, then there will be a huge corpus of funds left for welfare,” the statement said. On Monday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said that Delhi government has already given Rs 2,588 crore to the municipal corporations out of the total Rs 3,488 crore it is supposed to provide in the financial year 2021-22 and the BJP-ruled corporations are “misguiding” the public by claiming that the state government owes dues to them. He had said that not just their share of the budget, Delhi government had given a loan of Rs 6,889 crore to the corporations as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-govt-spends-just-rs-70cr-on-ads/articleshow/88497686.cms||---

Chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty told TOI that the next two to three weeks will be crucial for the state. “We shall keep a close watch on the patterns of cluster outbreaks for the next two weeks or even more. More samples will be sent for genome sequencing to keep tabs on the situation.” He said, “We have readied our hospital infrastructure, but since Omicron cases are mild, local authorities have to strengthen the home isolation monitoring system in case of any possible cluster outbreaks or community spread,” he said. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said that the state had directed both Mumbai and Pune to send more samples for genome sequencing as a part of community surveillance. The government has also introduced curbs on gatherings to check the spread of Omicron. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said as of now Omicron cases in the state and the country were sporadic and travel-related only. “But there has been a rapid rise in daily Covid cases in the state from three digits to four digits. We need to keep a close watch on any cluster outbreaks,” he said. The expert said, “It is imperative that people follow Covid protocol irrespective of their vaccination status or contracting the infection earlier. Everyone has to follow masking and other Covid protocols.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/next-2-wks-crucial-in-fight-against-omicron-cs/articleshow/88497210.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||NMC finds 2 more staffers involved in bogus contracts scam||Nagpur: Further investigation by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has revealed that two more staffers were allegedly involved in the bogus contracts scam. In another development, special investigation team (SIT) of Economic Offence Wing (EoW) has started investigation into the case. As per documents available with TOI from the civic body , departmental enquiry (DE) has been started against a retired woman employee of accounts and finance department. She worked as an auditor in the department and allegedly cleared few bogus bills of contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode. She had superannuated on June 30. Another employee is a woman working as clerk with the solid waste management (SWM) department. “Clerk generated bills online on payment module of NMC and approved it with user ID and password of head of the department of SWM department,” an NMC official said. No action has been taken against the clerk. Also, no further course of action has been decided against clerk Sanis Gokhe who was served show cause notice a few days ago. Executive engineer Naresh Borkar and junior engineer Sanjay Ingale too faced show cause notice for sharing user ID and password with Gokhe but further action is pending. Gokhe had generated bills and approved using user IDs and passwords of Borkar and Ingale. Now, the number of NMC staffers involved in the case has increased to eight. Also, one official and two engineers faced show cause notice for sharing user IDs and passwords with subordinates. NMC official said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B decided to take action against all after a seven-member committee headed by additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena submits its report. The committee formed on December 17 was told to submit report in seven days. Despite passing of deadline, report is yet to be submitted. DCP of EoW Akshay Shinde told TOI, “Seven-member SIT took all documents from Sadar police, went through them and inspected NMC’s head office,” he said. TOI was the first to report about the scam on December 14 and about decision of CP Amitesh Kumar to hand over the case from Sadar police to EoW and formation of SIT on Saturday. SIT is headed by PI Pravin Kamble and comprises of a PSI and five constables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-finds-2-more-staffers-involved-in-bogus-contracts-scam/articleshow/88497217.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

According to police, most of the cases were reported in the Park Street-Park Circus, Girish Park-Jorabagan and EM Bypass-Kasba zones. Police said they have sent all the accused for blood tests and those found with alcohol content above prescribed limits were asked to submit their licenses, which will now be recommended for temporary suspensions by the respective ACPs. Spotting the strong police presence on main roads, many tried to use bylanes. Several of them were caught by flying squads that were deployed. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said the crackdown would continue into the New Year. In the east traffic guard, cops dressed as Santa Claus urged revellers and patrons coming to restaurants in the Park Street-Camac Street area for lunch to refrain from driving after alcohol intake. The city witnessed over 6,300 traffic violations in the past 72 hours. Of these, 416 cases were for dangerous driving. However, given the sheer number of people who had hit the roads and moved about without mask, police gave up after initially trying to prosecute some. In all, 103 were prosecuted on Christmas morning for not wearing masks properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-50-charged-for-drink-driving/articleshow/88496659.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||RTI: Better pass count in Class IX in Delhi govt schools||NEW DELHI: Students failing in large numbers in Class IX had for long been an issue in Delhi government schools. However, over the past few years, the failure rate in the class has been steadily decreasing. In the academic year of 2020-21, a total of 31,517 Class IX students of Delhi government schools could not pass. This constituted around 13% of the total students enrolled, a reply to an RTI query filed by TOI has revealed. In the 2018-19 academic session, 76,523 students had failed the exam out of the total strength of 2,67,617 students. In 2019-20, the number stood at 42,475 out of 2,79,377 candidates. This constituted about 15% of the total enrolled students. Government officials attribute this improvement to the focus that was given to building the foundational literacy and numeracy of the children in the lower classes. Shailendra Sharma, advisor to director, Directorate of Education, said, “One of the reasons why historically there was poor pass percentage in Class IX has been because many children moving to that class could not even read, write or do basic maths. Chunauti and Mission Buniyaad programmes helped to address that problem. We were able to improve the basics of the students, which naturally led to better Class IX results.” Chunauti and Mission Buniyaad programmes were launched by the Delhi government to help children in strengthening their basic reading, writing and numeracy skills. In 2020, schools were closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and exams had to be cancelled. The government had then said that the students could be assessed and qualified for the next class based on their mid-term results. Sunil Kumar Joon, English teacher at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Ghitorni, said, “Exams could not be held due to school closure, but in the school, assessment of children was done through various ways. Even those who did not have devices were called and given assignments.” DoE officials said that due to the pandemic, liberal marking was adopted. In between 2019-20 and 2020-21, the number of total students enrolled in Class IX, however, had seen a drop of about 34,000. In 2019-20, there were 2,79,377 students enrolled in Class IX, while the number in 2020-21 stood at 2,45,076. Over whether the drop was due to the pandemic, a senior government official said, “It could be that there were a lesser number of students from corporation schools in that batch admitted from Class VI. However, we will look into the data to figure out the reason.” For Delhi government schools, the academic year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. There are about 1,000 government schools in the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rti-better-pass-count-in-class-ix-in-govt-schools/articleshow/88497698.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Anti-crime special drives have little effect, violent activities still high||Thiruvananthapuram: The violent crimes reported in the district during the past 48 hours indicate that the special measures launched by the police to curb criminal activities seem to have failed to create any deterrent effect on criminals. Two anti-crime special drives are going on in the district – ‘Operation Kaval’ under city police limits and ‘Operation Trojan’ under rural police district limits. However, crimes continue to get reported. Food and civil supplies minister G R Anil, who represents Nedumangad constituency in the district, on Friday, , minister G R Anil said that the police force needs to be more vigilant to prevent crimes that are happening in a back-to-back fashion. Pothencode police are yet to arrest the culprits involved in the attack of a father-daughter duo on the road on Wednesday night. It has come to light that the earlier the gang, led by a known criminal Faisal, were involved in another ruckus at a bar in the locality during which one of them bludgeoned another man using a beer bottle. The police were unaware of the incident till the second attack happened. The local police are yet to make any arrests in this regard. On Thursday night, another gang of wanted criminals created a ruckus at PMG junction in the city after they rammed into many vehicles before ramming into an electric pole. They even attacked the motorists who questioned their reckless way of driving. After the police took them into custody, it was revealed that some of them were notorious criminals. They were all reportedly in an inebriated condition. Similar atrocities were reported at Balaramapuram and Parassala rural districts early this week. The latest crime to be reported this week is a fight between two young men in which one of them, Amal of Maruthur, sustained injuries after being hacked using a machete at Maruthur near Mannanthala on Friday evening. The police are probing whether the attack was related to gangland activities. The suspect in the case, Jibin of Vattappara, is someone with a criminal antecedence, having been arrested in the past by Kayamkulam police in connection with a POCSO case. Meanwhile, senior police authorities maintained that there is no lack of vigil from their part and anti-crime actions are discharged with increased vigour. Deputy Inspector General Sanjay Kumar Gurudin of Thiruvananthapuram Range said that these crimes were being reported even as the police were carrying out a massive crackdown in recent times on anti-socials and goons. Since Operation Trojan was launched, the police in the rural district have conducted 593 raids and recorded 58 arrests of wanted criminals and executed 57 long pending arrest warrants. The cops have also been paying visits to those featured in goonda lists on a daily basis. Action under KAAPA has also been initiated against as many as 11 persons. City Police Commissioner IG Balramkumar Upadhyay said that compared to the rural district, goonda activities in the city limits are very less. Yet, the city police had never let their guard down. ‘’In the last six days, we have conducted more than 300 searches . We had prepared a list of 400 individuals with criminal records and their current activities are being checked,” the IG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/anti-crime-special-drives-have-little-effect-violent-activities-still-high/articleshow/88481543.cms||---

The deceased could not be identified as police did not find any mobile or wallet from him, except his bike keys. He fell on a girl sitting on the ground floor. She has sustained minor injuries but didn’t need hospitalisation. DCP (West) Richa Tomar said efforts were on to ascertain how the youth fell to his death. “We are examining CCTV cameras inside the mall to determine how he fell,” she said. The incident took place shortly after 2.30pm when the mall was teeming with customers on Christmas. Monty Tanwar, who works at a store inside the mall, said the youth crushed through lights protruding from the second floor of the mall and then fell right on the feet of a girl sitting on a round chair by a pillar. “I was busy making bills for the customers when I heard a loud thud. When I stepped out of the shop, I saw a huge crowd clustered around his body. He first fell on a shed cover lights and from there he plunged right into the ground floor,” said Ranveer Singh, a storekeeper. The visitors and security staff clustered around the deceased before one of the guards ferried him to the Kanwatia hospital. A medical staff posted in the emergency ward of the hospital informed TOI the youth was already dead by the time he came to the hospital. His left arm was twisted and lay behind his back. SHO Jhotwara, Ghanshyam Singh, said that police are making efforts to identify the deceased. Police also sift through multiple CCTVs but did not find anything substantial that could point them to corroborate how he plunged off. “The entire mall was packed with the visitors due to Christmas. We have recovered a key from him, but the parking spaces are also completely filled to capacity. Therefore, locating his bike is also an arduous task,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/youth-falls-to-death-in-jhotwara-mall/articleshow/88497225.cms||---

Authorities are attributing the steep jump in footfall to the return of the token system and are also bracing for the heavy rush in the festive season along the North-South line. Metro on Christmas Eve clocked 4,52,835 passengers, attaining the 4.5-lakh milestone on the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar corridor. On Monday, 4,05,596 rode, and the utility crossed the 4-lakh mark. On November 28, two days after tokens were reintroduced, Metro registered 3,57,764 footfall. And now, with revellers turning to the transport lifeline during the festivities, Metro Railway has already decided to add four trips on weekdays from Monday, and 10 on Saturdays from Christmas Day. But officials said daily services may yet be increased to maintain distancing. From Monday, the utility will have 276 daily services, only 12 short of its pre-pandemic trips when around 6 lakh to 6.2 lakh people took the North-South Metro every day. Officials said the North-South corridor may reach its prepandemic ridership sooner than expected. “Even since the corridor’s extension to Dakshineswar in February, the North-South Metro has been catering to a large number of commuters from the areas around Kolkata,” said an official. The 4-lakh mark was achieved 20 days after tokens returned. It took nearly two months to reach 3 lakh from 2.5 lakh daily ridership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-metro-crosses-4-5-lakh-passenger-count/articleshow/88496653.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Goa||PM praising my work is like Nat’l Award win: Goan artist||Panaji: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Mann Ki Baat address on Sunday, introduced the nation to 31-year-old Goan artist Sagar Naik Mule, praising his efforts to revive the centuries-old Kaavi art form. Ponda-based Mule said that the Prime Minister appreciating his work on Mann Ki Baat platform was as good as receiving a National Award, not only for himself but for Goa too. “I got to know about the efforts of Sagar Mule ji of Goa, who is involved in saving centuries old ‘Kaavi’ painting from extinction. The Kaavi form of painting covers the ancient history of India in itself. Actually, ‘Kaava’ means red soil. In ancient times, red clay was used in this art. During the Portuguese rule in Goa, people who migrated from there introduced the people of other states to this wonderful painting form,” Modi said. “With the passage of time this painting was on the verge of extinction. But Sagar Mule ji has infused a new lease of life to this art. His efforts are also getting a lot of appreciation. Friends, a small effort, even a small step, can make a huge contribution in the preservation of our rich arts,” the Prime Minister said in his address. Mule said he woke up on Sunday, after Modi’s address, to a flood of calls from family, friends and the media. “Doordarshan had taken comments from me beforehand, but I was not sure I would be mentioned in Mann Ki Baat. I was still in bed on Sunday morning when I received a call from Akashvani, Pune, for my interview. At first I thought it was a fraudulent call. I received a pleasant surprise when I learnt I was mentioned by the Prime Minister. It is as though Goa and I won a National Award,” Mule said. After graduating from Goa College of Art, Mule completed his masters from Sarojini School of Fine Arts, Hyderabad. “I do not just copy and repeat the Kaavi motifs that were done by artists centuries ago. I felt that would serve no purpose. So I use the motifs of Kaavi and fit them into my contemporary works. We need to adapt the style into contemporary art for it to be revived,” Mule said. He added that he began researching Kaavi patterns and was determined to revive them after he was reprimanded in 2020 by an architect for not being well-versed with the Goan art form. The name Kaavi is derived from the local name for the maroon red pigment from laterite. “If the people of our country are determined, the passion to adorn, beautify and save our ancient arts across the country can take the form of a mass movement,” the Prime Minister said on Mann Ki Baat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pm-praising-my-work-is-like-natl-award-win-goan-artist/articleshow/88511891.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Min: May go for lockdown if O2 need rises to 500MT||Mumbai: A day after the state government imposed additional Covid-19 curbs, health minister Rajesh Tope said that if a third wave has to hit the state, it will be driven by the Omicron variant. Tope said that the rate of transmission of the new variant is very high and even though there is already a lockdown trigger pre-decided by the state, which is when the oxygen requirement in the state reaches 700MT, the state may have to bring it down to 500 MT. “We have linked the imposition of a lockdown to the use of oxygen. At the moment the trigger is set at 700MT but we have to bring it down to 500MT in case the rate of spread is very high,” said the health minister. Drawing examples from other countries, he said that while it appeared that the rate of infection was higher, the rate of hopitalisation and the death rate had not gone up the same way. The state government on Friday announced new restrictions ahead of the Christmas and New Year festivities and banned assembly of more than five persons in public places between 9pm and 6am and restricted the number of people allowed at weddings and other functions in view of a spurt in coronavirus cases. He said that the restrictions imposed by the state were preventive in nature and the main idea was to reduce crowding. “We are not preventing anyone from not participating in New Year festivities. All we are asking people is to follow rules,” said Tope. The state government will be raising the demand for a booster dose for health workers and frontline workers with the Centre. Officials said that nearly 87% of the population in the state has been covered with at least one dose. “The rate of vaccination is stagnant with 4-5 lakh people being vaccinated everyday.

Cops said accused Rabi Saha, a resident of Santoshpur in Maheshtala, had stolen items worth Rs 10,000, including garments and cosmetics, from delivery boy Raja Saha (39) at Sultan Alam Road on Thursday. He might have robbed other delivery persons, as well, cops said. “The accused usually waited for delivery boys to park their vehicles and enter a house to hand over items,” said an officer.  “The complaint was filed by Raja, who said several goods were stolen while he delivered items and kept the bag on his bike.

---||Goa||I-League: RUFC take the field with just nine players||Panaji: Twenty-five years after Indian football took its first step towards professionalism with the start of the National Football League (NFL), amateurism continues to knock on the doors of the rebranded I-League. Rajasthan United FC made their debut in the I-League against Punjab FC with just nine players at the Kalyani Stadium in West Bengal on Sunday. The first team from Rajasthan to qualify for the I-League had only nine eligible players and could not register more due to the All India Football Federation’s rule regarding registration of amateur players outside the transfer window. “It’s unfortunate that Rajasthan have just nine players,” Sunando Dhar, CEO Leagues and Development, told TOI. “We tried to help them to try and get the amateur players playing, but there is a Fifa rule and the world body cannot make an exception for India.” Rajasthan qualified for the I-League in October much after the summer transfer window had closed on August 31. The winter window opens on January 1, leaving the club to rely on free or non-contracted players and amateurs. “We retained minimal players from the qualifiers and sought to get better players for the higher league,” the club said in a statement. According to RUFC, the AIFF told all clubs on December 14 that teams facing problems with registration could field amateur players, who would be allowed to play till December 31, 2021, with an assurance that they would turn professionals once the window opens. “RUFC registered a significant number of their players as amateurs for the time period AIFF gave. A second statement released on December 21, though, put our plans in jeopardy. “The statement said that amateur players signed (only) before/on August 31, 2021 would be allowed to play in the league. This put the club in a major predicament, as we had already registered a majority of our players as amateurs following the initial statement by the federation,” said the club. Rajasthan have signed five foreign players, but four of them have to wait till January to complete the transfer formalities and will be eligible for the next clash against Aizawl FC on January 5. The AIFF said they were not in a position to allow any amateur players registered outside the professional registration window to take the field till they sign professional contracts and register themselves as professionals in the second transfer window which opens on January 1, 2022. “Fifa has approved the AIFF RSTP (Regulations on the on the Status and Transfer of Players). In this regard, the AIFF is bound to respect its own rules which are in consonance with the FIFA RSTP,” said AIFF. Rajasthan took the field with just nine players and listed hardwork, courage, motivation, dedication, determined, god, fearless, ambitious and supporter as the substitutes, on their social media pages. “It is a deep humiliation and learning experience for club as new as us, entering this prestigious league,” said Rajasthan. The club had asked for a postponement but AIFF said, they consulted all parties, and it “wasn’t possible” to reschedule the match. A forfeit would have led to a defeat by three goals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-rufc-take-the-field-with-just-nine-players/articleshow/88511402.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Dists slow on vax drive will be pulled up, says Tope||Pune: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said the district administrations would be held responsible for slow vaccination after the ongoing assembly session ended, and stressed on the need to achieve the target of 7-8 lakh vaccination per day in the state to cover the remaining one crore beneficiaries. Six days before the deadline for 100% first dose vaccination in Maharashtra, he said the local administrations should scale up the inoculation programme to meet the targets. “After the ongoing assembly session, there would be an assessment on the way forward to scale up vaccination,” Tope told TOI. “If people cooperate and the vaccination is scaled up every day, the target of 100% first dose vaccination should be achieved in the next 15-20 days. The local administration cannot be laggard, especially in the wake of increasing threat of Omicron,” he said. Currently, the first dose vaccination coverage in the state is 87%. It is 56% for the second shot. The first dose coverage in 22 districts is below the state average. Chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty told TOI that the underperforming districts would come under the radar for sure. “Ahead of December 31, a detailed review meeting would be conducted with the health department and the local authorities of the districts registering poor vaccination,” he said. Against the backdrop of fresh curbs in the state, Tope said it was important to ensure that the vaccination did not suffer. He said migration was a key hurdle for immunisation. “Many such people took their vaccine shots in the cities outside the districts where they are included in the beneficiaries’ list. It is being checked by the local authorities. Thereafter, the names of those not staying in their ‘home districts’ would be deleted from the list,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-dists-slow-on-vax-drive-will-be-pulled-up-says-tope/articleshow/88497261.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Extra manpower For Covid fight, graded plan may be activated||NEW DELHI: With the city witnessing a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases being reported daily, district authorities have stepped up enforcement drives by the day and raids by night. Additional manpower has been requisitioned from education and other departments to ensure strict enforcement of Covid safety norms and the need to track contacts of the increasing number of patients. “We are keeping a hawk-eye at hotspots that see crowding like markets, malls and other public places. There is heavy deployment at these places during the day and raids are being carried out at night,” said a senior official. “Contact tracing in Delhi has always been on the higher side and at least 15 contacts of those testing positive for Covid-19 are being tracked,” the official said. He further stated that enforcement, testing and tracing activities require immense human resources, and that is why different district authorities have submitted a requisition for deputing officials, primarily from the education department. Delhi reported 249 new cases with a test positivity rate of 0.43% in the last 24 hours and if the positivity rate continues to rise, as it has over the week, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for the imposition of Covid restrictions will come into effect. The GRAP was approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in July this year to remove confusion regarding imposing a lockdown, its duration and when it would be lifted. The first level of the GRAP — yellow — comes into effect if the test positivity rate is more than 0.5% for two consecutive days or 1,500 or more new Covid-19 cases are reported in seven days, or 500 oxygenated beds are reported occupied on average for seven days. While the current positivity rate is close to 0.5%, the total number of cases in the last seven days is less than 1,000 and the number of Covid hospital beds occupied by patients is 221. If the level 1 of GRAP is imposed, schools, colleges and all educational and coaching institutions would be closed, apart from cinema halls, banquet halls, auditoriums, spas, gymnasiums, etc.  If the yellow alert goes off, a night curfew would also be implemented between 10pm and 5am. Delhi Metro and buses, which now function with 100% seating and restricted standing passengers, would operate with only 50% seating and no standing passengers. Private offices would be allowed to function with up to 50% staff. Shops and malls would open in odd-even fashion between 10am and 8pm, and bars and restaurants would operate with 50% capacity. Only 20 persons would be allowed at marriages and funerals and no other social, religious, political related gatherings would be allowed. Religious places would remain open, but no visitors would be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/extra-manpower-for-covid-fight-graded-plan-may-be-activated/articleshow/88497722.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to conduct 1 lakh RT-PCR tests daily||JAIPUR: To intensify Covid testing in the state, random sampling will be done at railway stations, bus stands, schools, colleges and crowded places. The health department has directed its officials to increase the RT-PCR tests to 1 lakh per day. Currently, the average daily testing is just 28,000 compared to its capacity of testing 1 lakh 45 thousand samples daily. Directions have been issued to conduct door-to-door surveys and Covid-19 tests of patients visiting hospitals with influenza-like illness. Meanwhile officials in Bharatpur district were pulled up for not conducting Covid-19 testing effectively. “While reviewing Covid-19 testing and sampling, it was found that per 10 lakh population, only 57 samples were drawn in Bharatpur. Officials have been directed to increase sampling for Covid-19 testing,” said a health department official. While the state has been witnessing a sudden jump in Omicron cases, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot expressed the need for booster doses for 60+, healthcare workers and frontline workers. He also expressed the need for vaccination of children and the population below 18. In a letter written to the PM, Gehlot mentioned that as suspected by the health experts, the threat of a third wave is looming large on the basis of increasing Covid-19 Omicron cases. In such a situation, it is necessary to vaccinate healthcare workers, frontline workers, and 60+ population with booster doses. Such people can be given booster shots as most of them have taken the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine six months back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-to-conduct-1l-rt-pcr-tests-daily/articleshow/88497255.cms||---

He urged the Supreme Court to take cognisance of the hate speech and take action against those responsible for the same. The hate speeches against minorities were made in the two-day Dharam Sansad held in Haridwar from December 17-19. The matter sparked wide outrage after videos of the hate speech went viral. “It is a matter of shock that nobody has been arrested in the case till date,” said Gehlot, who questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 5 inmates die in 2 weeks, Tihar says no violence||NEW DELHI: In the past two weeks, at least five inmates have died at the Tihar Jail, triggering a probe into the cause of the deaths. The jail administration said that a magisterial inquiry was underway. The prison officials said that these deaths were reported from different jails and none was related to violence. They claimed that the circumstances indicate a natural cause like old diseases and drug-related ailments in all these cases. “The metropolitan magistrate is conducting inquest proceedings in each case,” said a senior jail official. The most recent death was reported in jail number 3 on Friday. Before that, a death took place on December 17. Both were undertrials. Autopsies have been conducted in all cases, and the final medical report is awaited. Meanwhile, the Tihar administration informed on Saturday that it had withheld the salaries of around 47 staffers after a software mismatch was reported in their current biometrics compared with the ones preserved during their recruitment. The anomaly was detected during a bometric vrification drive conducted by the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) in the prisons department in the last week of November, said a senior official. During the drive, all the newly joined candidates of Delhi Prisons from 2019 onwards — in the rank of warder and assistant superintendent — recruited through the exams conducted by DSSSB were screened by matching their biometrics with the data preserved at the time of recruitment. “As a result of the exercise, 47 cases of preliminary mismatch have been detected. Further action will be taken after the final report is received from DSSSB. However, as an immediate and interim measure, the salaries of all these officials have been stopped, and show-cause notices have been issued to them,” the senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-inmates-die-in-2-weeks-tihar-says-no-violence/articleshow/88497727.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC ups genome sequencing to see if Omicron behind surge||MUMBAI: In order to check if the Omicron variant is responsible for the sudden surge in cases in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will send all Covid-positive samples till December 31 for gene sequencing. The only caveat is that the Covid-positive samples should have viral load of less than 25. “We also have a limit of little over 300 samples as that is the capacity of the gene sequencer,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. In the week between December 19 and 25, Mumbai’s daily caseload increased from 190 to 731 cases, triggering suspicion of community transmission of Omicron. The BMC hence plans to conduct genome sequencing for samples collected between December 21 and 31 to establish if Omicron is present in the community, as against the belief that it is only connected to international travel. At present, gene sequencing is the best method to check for the variant in circulation. “We have done gene sequencing continuously since August and have lately found Omicron variant in the samples. But it is still not so huge in number that it should trigger a surge in cases,” said Kakani. The last two gene sequencing exercises in BMC’s laboratory in Kasturba Hospital complex showed 2% of Omicron, while the majority were Delta derivatives and Delta. Gene sequencing is not an instant test and results could take between three and five days. BMC officials said there wouldn’t be a backlog as multiple steps are required before samples are put in the gene sequencer. “Work on the pre-sequencing will begin for some samples while others are put in the sequencer,’’ said an official. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said there is a need to step up genomic testing to combat the recent surge in daily caseload. “We should open up the private sector as well to do genome sequencing, so that we can carry out appropriate public health measures,’’ added Dr Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-ups-genome-sequencing-to-see-if-omicron-behind-surge/articleshow/88497271.cms||---

PUTA president Dr Mritunjay Kumar denounced the casual approach of the Punjab government about the genuine demands of teachers. He asked the government to notify revised UGC pay scales at the earliest, particularly when it had been implemented in all other states except Punjab. Due to non-implementation of revised UGC pay scales by the Punjab government, the same could not be implemented in Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. Dr Mritunjay Kumar said the revised pay scales needed to be implemented to save the higher education system from further deterioration.

---||Delhi||Vigil better, but crowds still a concern at Delhi markets||NEW DELHI: A day after Delhi high court took exception to the crowd management at Sarojini Nagar market and ordered officials to take measures to control the “scary situation”, the market remained crowded as usual on Saturday. Visitors were seen jostling against each other during peak hours on the weekend. Though an anti-encroachment drive was launched to decongest pathways and provide more space to the visitors to walk, people were still “flowing like river” in some parts of the market. Local traders believed the footfall to be the same as on other weekends. The market sees about 30,000 to 35,000 visitors during weekends, which is almost double of the footfall at Lajpat Nagar. The odd-even scheme for shops and restricted entry and exit from certain gates seemed to have only worsened the situation as the weekend shoppers had only half the shops to buy from and fewer gates to enter. On Saturday, entry inside the market was restricted after 5pm by police, which also made frequent announcements for the visitors to speed up their shopping. The enforcement teams of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) along with Delhi Police, in pursuance of the Delhi High Court's order, took out a massive anti-encroachment drive in Sarojini Nagar Market. Removal of illegal hoarders and encroachments on pathways decongested the market to some extent. The high court had on Friday called upon the officials of NDMC and police to take preventive measures to control the crowd at Sarojini Nagar Market, calling it a “scary situation”. The court said that it would hold the officials responsible for any loss of life due to “Covid, stampede or blast”. Even with a little more space to walk in the market area, a need for better crowd management was felt, which the market association believes will happen eventually. Expressing reservations against the odd-even scheme, they pointed out that a number of illegal body hawkers are still crowding the market. “We welcome the anti-encroachment drive but the footfall is the same. The odd-even thing only worsened the situation as almost an equal number of customers now have fewer shops to stroll. Also, the entry from some gates had been restricted, which led to confusion,” said Ashok Randhawa, president, Sarojini Nagar Mini-Market Association. Shopkeepers call for a better management plan for the market. “The market is crowded round the year. All we need to do is to manage it in a better way. There are over 2,500 illegal hawkers in the market who often obstruct the movement of visitors and lead to crowding. There are also over 800 hoarders with fake licences,” said Ashok Kalia, general secretary, Sarojini Nagar Shopkeepers’ Association. “There are other ways to control the crowd, like providing time slots to a set of customers, etc,” said Om Dutt Sharma, another market association member who was seen consistently urging the visitors to keep their masks up to avoid being fined.  A number of volunteers from civil defence and Delhi Police were also found trying to enforce Covid norms in the market. Meanwhile, the situation at Lajpat Nagar was comparatively well-managed. Though the footfall at the market was impressive, the crowd density appeared way lesser than at Sarojini Nagar. “We had been working for the past few days to decongest the market by removing illegal encroachers and hoarders with the help of police. The footfall of the market was the same as on any other weekend, which is about 15,000 to 20,000 people, a rough estimate based on the number of cars parked. The main issue of the congestion in Delhi’s markets is encroachment, which can be checked with proper mechanisms in place,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, Trade Association, Lajpat Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vigil-better-but-crowds-still-a-concern-at-city-markets/articleshow/88497289.cms||Kushagra Dixit

On examination of his checked-in baggage in the x-ray machine, dark images of some objects inside the trimmer was noticed which indicated concealment of some heavy metal like gold. On being inquired, the passenger denied carrying any such items and could not provide any satisfactory explanation. On dismantling the trimmer, four solid biscuits of fine gold (of 99.99% purity) duly packed by black carbon plastic sheet of multi layers were found. One small gold biscuit of 99.99% purity was found separately packed in black carbon plastic sheet,” said a customs official. The smuggled gold collectively weighing 491grams valued at Rs 24,32,905 was recovered which has been seized under the provisions of Customs Act, 1962. Further investigation is going on. Less than a week ago, customs officials intercepted a passenger who arrived by an Air Arabia flight from Sharjah and seized nearly 350 gram of gold. Customs department has seized more than 10kg of smuggled gold at the city airport and registered more than a dozen cases between April and December. Officials claimed that most of the carriers are working-class persons hailing from the Shekhawati belt in Rajasthan.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur police file chargesheet in Bani Park murder case||JAIPUR: Turf wars, property feuds and shifting loyalties between gangs were listed by Bani Park police as reasons behind the murder of historysheeter Ajay Yadav (42). Police on Friday submitted chargesheet in the murder case which had shaken the city when multiple gunmen on different scooters waylaid Ajay Yadav near Soot Mill area and fired several shots at him before finishing the job with a heavy stone when their guns jammed halfway. Yadav was killed on September 21 amidst several tea shacks humming with morning activities. Police arrested nine persons in the case and found that Ajay Yadav’s rivalry with his friend-turnedfoe Pradeep Yadav, also a history-sheeter, led to his murder. The chargesheet states that both Ajay and Pradeep were friends between 2008 and 2016. But a series of disputes over properties had soured their partnership. Then in 2015, police booked Ajay for organising a hit on another gangster in Jawahar Nagar and their friendship turned into a bitter rivalry. In March last year, Pradeep and his gang members attended the wedding of a gangster and uploaded their photos on social media as a show of strength and also to send a message to Ajay. Three days after the wedding event, Ajay’s two acolytes, Himanshu Jangid and Bunty Sharma, attacked Pradeep. Pradeep was left paralysed. Pradeep held a meeting with members of his gang and decided to eliminate Ajay. The gang procured a GPS device that was fitted into Ajay’s SUV in order to track his every movement in the city. After killing Ajay, the accused fled in different directions. But when police began to raid their hideouts and shelter grounds, one of the accused, Mukesh, committed suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-file-chargesheet-in-bani-park-murder-case/articleshow/88497282.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: IIT, IIIT tie up for next-generation research||NEW DELHI: In a bid to boost cross-functional research that will lead to outcomes of national interest, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Delhi had invited joint research projects from faculty members of both the institutions. An external experts committee has now selected five of those projects for a seed grant. The projects range from studies on the human brain structure and anxiety to development of nanodevices. Mathematics theories propounded by Ramanujam, Femtech and its future in India and model agnostic evaluation of deep-model transfer are some of the other projects that have been selected by the committee. Earlier in the year, the two institutes had signed an MoU to establish a collaborative platform for mutual benefit and intended to initiate wide-ranging partnerships in academics, research and human resource development with profound socio-economic impact. Professor V Ramgopal Rao, director of IIT Delhi, said, “At IIT Delhi, we lay great emphasis on interdisciplinary research as future advancements in science and technology are expected to happen at the intersection of different disciplines. IIT Delhi through its MFIRP initiative launched in 2017, connected with many leading institutions in Delhi and enabled funded collaboration between our researchers. The results are quite outstanding.” Stating that research was increasingly becoming trans-disciplinary, professor Ranjan Bose, director of IIIT Delhi, said, “This unique collaborative initiative by IIT Delhi and IIIT Delhi has already brought together faculty members from both the institutes, inspired them to define problems of mutual interest, exchange expertise and also build personal relations. We hope that this cooperation will help improve the posture of technological innovation and next-generation research.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-iiit-tie-up-for-next-generation-research/articleshow/88497732.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Leak FIR: Maharashtra’s former intelligence chief Rashmi Shukla goes to SC with special leave petition||MUMBAI: The state’s former intelligence chief Rashmi Shukla has filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court against the recent Bombay high court rejection of her quashing petition. The HC had on December 15 dismissed her plea to set aside an FIR by the Mumbai cyber cell against unknown persons over the “leak” of her confidential phone tap report into allegations of corruption in police transfers. The HC had also rejected her plea to transfer the probe to the CBI. The HC bench of Justice Nitin Jamdar and Justice Sarang Kotwal had after hearing Shukla’s senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani and senior counsel Darious Khambata for the state said: “FIR prima facie discloses cognisable offences’ and hence police is duty bound to investigate.” Her SLP says the state filed a case under the IT Act and invoked the Official Secrets Act, 1923, “with an ulterior motive to ensure that the petitioner (Shukla) does not cooperate with the (CBI )and abandoned her own report”. In her petition now before the SC, Shukla said the present case was yet another attempt by the state government to “derail and thwart the investigation” in the FIR pending before the CBI where “certain unscrupulous elements of state have indulged in high-ended corruption in relation to transfer of police officers”. The SLP said: “Such was the tearing hurry to remove the petitioner and make her irrelevant within the state of Maharashtra, that she was transferred to the post which did not even exist at that point of time. When she raised the issue with the then home minister of state of Maharashtra, Anil Deshmukh, it was clearly stated to her by … Deshmukh that it is a case of political vendetta.” The SLP seeking permission to appeal the HC dismissal says that “despite punishment posting and the arbitrary treatment meted out to her, made several requests for cabinet approval and issuance of GR for creation of the post of DG – civil defence”. She said then Singh wrote to the CM “flagging the issue of corruption”. Shukla’s SLP says she was “only discharging her duty in preparing a report based on interceptions of phone calls following due procedure after obtaining necessary permission from competent authority, between various unscrupulous elements in the state”. She says it was done under the instructions of the then director general of police Subodh Jaiswal, which was also in the knowledge of then additional chief secretary, home, Sitaram Kunte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/leak-fir-shukla-goes-to-sc-with-spl-leave-petition/articleshow/88497292.cms||Swati Deshpande

One fresh fatality was also recorded, taking the death toll in the city to 25,104, while the positivity rate mounted to 0.43%, which is the highest since June 9 when it had stood at 0.46%. On Friday, 180 new cases were recorded with an increased positivity rate of 0.29%, as per officials figures. The number of cumulative cases on Saturday stood at 14,43,062. Six deaths have been reported in December so far. According to official data, seven Covid-19 deaths were reported in November this year, the highest number of fatalities due to coronavirus infection in the last three months in the national capital. Delhi had recorded four Covid deaths in October and five in September. The spike in new cases in the span of the last few days here is being recorded amid a jump in cases of the new Omicron variant of Covid in Delhi. On Saturday, the city recorded 12 new cases of Covid-19 caused by the latest variant, taking the total number of such cases to 79. After Maharashtra, Delhi has recorded the maximum number of cases caused by the new variant, which is highly transmissible. It is suspected to be the cause of increased incidence of the viral infection over the past two weeks. The number of active cases has gone up significantly. At present, data shared by Delhi government shows there are 934 active cases of Covid-19 in the city. Of them, 221 are admitted in hospitals and 464 are in home isolation. Public health experts say cases of Covid-19 are likely to go up in the coming days due to the spread of the new variant of coronavirus, which is known to infect even fully-vaccinated people who have been infected by the virus before. Calling on people to support measures put in place by countries in view of the new Covid-19 variant and holiday season, the World Health Organization said Omicron’s overall threat would also depend on how people perceive risk and follow measures to prevent and control its further spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/249-new-covid-cases-highest-since-june-13/articleshow/88497733.cms||---

Tejas Nagvenkar, adjudged best referee by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) last season, has been missing in action in the Indian Super League (ISL) and he could miss the rest of the games too, if he does not manage leave from his employers. The 35-year-old Goan official joined Sridora Caculo College in Mapusa as the physical education teacher in June and now needs leave to enter the bio-secure bubble and then be eligible to officiate ISL matches. “We have not rejected his leave as yet,” principal of Caculo College Santosh Patkar told TOI on Sunday. “The final decision will be taken by the management. We have to see how best we can give him leave because he is on a probation period and not completed a year as yet”. Tejas became the first Indian referee to officiate the ISL final when he took charge of the clash between ATK Mohun Bagan and eventual champions Mumbai City FC last season. Tejas completed his bachelor’s degree in physical education in 2012 and followed it with a masters two years later. However, Tejas kept his focus on officiating and let go of many job opportunities. It was only in June that he took up a job at the Sridora Caculo College. According to sources, Tejas skipped the first phase of ISL which is being played inside a bio-secure bubble in Goa for the second consecutive season due to the Coronavirus pandemic. He planned to take leave from January 10 to March 10. “Tejas’ supervision in the ISL, besides being a great honour to him as well as your esteemed institution where he is serving as instructor in physical education, will be a big incentive to the upcoming football referees in Goa,” Goa Football Association (GFA) general secretary Jovito Lopes said in his letter to the college. Tejas was inducted in the AFC referees’ panel in 2016 and is the only Goan in the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/indias-best-referee-tejas-waits-for-leave-from-employers-to-officiate-in-isl/articleshow/88511449.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The CJI was addressing the Ramineni Foundation awards function held in Hyderabad. “Several multi-national companies, like Pfizer, on one hand, and scores of people from within India, on the other hand, had made unfair attempts to defame Covaxin. They had even complained to WHO and tried to stall recognition to this made-in-India vaccine,” the CJI said. “Krishna (Ella) and (wife) Suchitra struggled a lot to come to this stage. Today they brought fame to the country,” he said. “All Telugu people must come forward to tell the world about the greatness of our Telugu company that made this vaccine. It has now brought name and fame to our country,” Justice Ramana said while handing the awards given by the foundation to Krishna Ella and Suchitra Ella, the founder couple of Bharat Biotech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mncs-tried-to-scuttle-who-nod-for-covaxin-cji-ramana/articleshow/88498417.cms||---

Joshi told TOI on Friday that chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and Kannada and culture minister Sunil Kumar had made a proposal to the central government at his behest. Joshi handed over the proposal to Union minister for culture, Kishan Reddy, and MoS Arjunram Meghawal with a request to consider the same favourably. “The ministers have responded positively,” Joshi said. Dharwad, which has the potential to be developed as special cultural zone, offers an ideal location to house the zonal cultural centre.  The city of seven hills has all the qualifications for being developed as special cultural zone. Apart from artistes and writers of all hues, the city has audience with taste for cultural activities and salubrious climate to keep the activities alive throughout the year.  There are several cultural centres in the city in a radius of just 5-7km that make the case for developing the city into a cultural zone strong. Mallikarjun Mansur Kala Bhavan and Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha in the heart of the city, Rangayana unit and Suvarna Cultural Complex, Government Art Gallery, Dr Veerendra Heggade Kalakshetra, Alur Venkatrao Auditorium, state-of-the-art Srujana auditorium, Bendre Bhavan and auditoriums at Karnatak University and University of Agricultural Sciences, Dr Gangubai Hanagal Gurukul andYashwant Sardeshpande’s Adiranga theatre are all in close proximity. Dharwad has no dearth of musicians, dancers, actors, playwrights, poets and novelists. There are several groups which have kept the cultural activities going on continuously all through the year. Realising the potential of Dharwad, then deputy commissioner Darpan Jain had sent a proposal to the government to empower all these venues with suitable logistics and other facilities to carry on cultural activities. Getting the zonal culture centre to Dharwad is expected to help realise the dream. This will also help promotion of tourism in the region. “Bengaluru is already saturated with several establishments. It is time to spread organisations promoting literature, art and culture to other parts of Karnataka,” said actor-director Yashwant Sardeshpande. BOX Seven such centres across India The central government has set up seven zonal cultural centres (ZCCs) with headquarters at Patiala, Nagpur, Udaipur, Prayagraj, Kolkata, Dimapur, and Thanjavur. The criterion for selection of the place for ZCC is the traditional cultural moorings of the place and its accessibility to people. Institutionally, each centre has a complex which includes galleries for exhibitions, facilities for performing arts, auditorium, archives, and library etc. The main objective of ZCC is creative development of Indian culture in the different regions and for building up a sense of cultural cohesiveness in the country. The mandate of the centres requires it to take culture, hitherto, the preserve of the elite and affluent, to the doorsteps of the common man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dharwad-provides-ideal-location-for-zonal-cultural-centre/articleshow/88495941.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

They said on Saturday they felt mild tremors at 9am and 1pm. There is no major damage caused, but the walls of a dozen of houses constructed using mud have cracks. There are no quarries nearby and hence tremors caused by any blast at quarries are ruled out," said Ramamoorthy.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai court upholds fine, jail over late deposit of TDS||MUMBAI: A city sessions court has dismissed appeals and confirmed four convictions for non-deposit of TDS amount within the stipulated time; a ruling that the income-tax department prosecutor says is uncommon in Mumbai’s legal circles for such an offence. Ichibaan Automobiles Pvt Ltd and GMS Motors Pvt Ltd, along with GMS directors G M Singh and Parveen Nindrajog, had filed criminal appeals in July 2019 against an order of a metropolitan magistrate convicting them for defaulting on payment of tax deducted at source on time. A Rs 5,000 fine each was imposed on both the companies and Nindrajog, while 3 months’ RI was awarded to Singh, a director in both companies. TDS: Cos, directors cite financial issues for late paymentThe companies and directors, through their lawyers Sujay Kantawalla and Ashish Chavan, argued that they had deducted tax of Rs 7.5 lakh in March 2010 in the case of Ichibaan and Rs 42 lakh in the case of GMS, but were prosecuted for not having deposited it within the legal deadline. They contended that the charge against them was “vague” and no admissible evidence was produced. They said the sanction to prosecute was granted without any application of mind by the I-T commissioner when their plea to settle the dues was pending. They had paid the TDS later with interest voluntarily and the default was unintentional and due to financial difficulties, they contended, adding that it was a “reasonable cause” with no loss to the government. The sessions court, however, held that even if a financial crisis is presumed, it makes no difference for payment of deducted taxes and hence the reason is not sufficient. “The entire TDS with interest was paid before showcause notice was issued. The sanction order did not even record our CA’s explanation,” they argued. Both the directors are senior citizens in their 70s and in “precarious health”, Kantawalla informed the court. But special public prosecutor Amit Munde, for the I-T department, said the I-T Act clearly requires TDS to be deposited in government treasury by the 7th of the next month and the accused cannot plead ignorance of law. Munde also said mere filing of an application to settle the dispute or dues does not absolve anyone of liability nor does it bar the department from initiating legal proceedings. On December 16, sessions judge Chitra Hankare held that the magistrate was right in convicting them. She said the I-T department had issued a showcause to the company and its director separately, and also held that the charge had no misleading errors. The court also found that the prosecution sanction was valid and said “it is not necessary that each and every fact in detail should be mentioned in sanction.” The court held, “In the sanction order, it is clearly mentioned that the accused failed to deposit the amount without reasonable cause, and that the sanctioning authority has applied its mind to the excuse given by the accused for not depositing it.” The sessions court said, “Even if it is presumed that the TDS was credited to the government at a belated stage, it is necessary to see whether it will absolve penal liability of accused.” In its order against Singh, the court noted that the I-T department prosecutor had submitted that the accused is “a habitual offender and that there are 70 to 72 defaults and other cases pending against him.” “Confirmation of conviction for default in TDS payment is rare and landmark in Mumbai,” said Munde. The court also rejected the plea for a stay on the judgment and directed issuance of non-bailable warrant against the two accused as they were not present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-upholds-fine-jail-over-late-deposit-of-tds/articleshow/88498542.cms||Swati Deshpande

The operations were suspended last week owing to workers protesting their working and living conditions. The solution follows a meeting between government officials and company management on Thursday. As per a statement issued by the government on Saturday, senior officials including S Krishnan, additional chief secretary of industries department, and P Thamaraikannan, additional director general of police, met Foxconn senior management on Thursday and "advised" them to improve the living conditions and accommodation of the employees. The government also asked the company to improve hostel infrastructure, further adding that these facilities would be subjected to certification by the district collector. The officials asked the company to cook and provide food at the place of stay of the employees. Foxconn has reportedly assured the government that it will provide standard food and other quality facilities to the 15,000 employees through contractors, and will also offer new employment opportunities to support expansion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/foxconn-to-resume-operations-after-tamil-nadu-govt-intervention/articleshow/88498567.cms||---

Vinod Scaria, principal scientist at Delhi-based CSIRIGIB, which is part of INSACOG, said in a recent tweet that a “right-fitting” mask was of utmost importance. “The unequivocal winner is without surprise a right-fitting FFP2 mask. Mean infection risk is one in 1,000 when the infected and susceptible wear a proper fitting FFP2 mask. Surgical masks fare much poorly (risk is one in 10). It might actually be a great idea to upgrade masks, in high-risk groups like immunocompromised and people with comorbodities." State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said, “Covid is an airborne droplet virus. One has to use well-fitting masks to prevent catching the virus in the air... If an individual is wearing a cloth mask, s/he must additionally wear a surgical 3-ply mask so the cover against virus droplets is adequate.” He said the transmissibility of the ancestral strain from Wuhan was 3.5, which moved up to six for the Delta variant and over nine for Omicron. “Rapidity of transmission is very high for Delta and Omicron, which is why in healthcare and crowded settings, it’s very important to wear an N95 or FFP2 mask. The mask also should be well-fitted. Leaving gaps in mask even if it’s covering the mouth and the nose can pose risk of transmission.” Vasant Nagvekar, consultant, infectious diseases, and state task force member, said: “With Omicron in the picture, old concepts may need tweaking. For instance, many of those with a prior infection plus both vaccine doses are also contracting the infection. But the infection has been mild,” he said. Dr Maria Nigam, physician and principal founder PRANA, said, “N95 or FFP2 masks prevent around 95% of airborne virus particles from entering the nasal airway. But the surgical mask that most people wear is not good enough to block transmission effectively.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-experts-back-mask-upgrade-proper-fitting-holds-the-key/articleshow/88498544.cms||Neha Madaan

The latest disruption follows protests organised by right-wing activists almost every week in the NCR district since October against the Muslim community's namaz congregations. At the Pataudi school, House of Hope had organised a "Christmas Milan", whose theme was to make people aware about the "real meaning of Christmas" through songs, dance and teachings of the Bible. A number of children and women from areas in the vicinity had gathered for the event. A few minutes into the programme, the group of men, who identified themselves as members of the Dharam Jagriti Mission, barged into the hall and alleged that the programme had been organised to "brainwash children" and "prepare them for conversion". RP Pandey, the president of the outfit, said though Christmas carols were being practised at the school for the past few days, they had no idea about the programme. But two days ago, invites were sent out to people from the neighbourhood to attend the Christmas programme. "It is through song and dance that they promote their religion and influence the minds of children," Pandey said.  He claimed that most of those who attended the event were from humble backgrounds.A pastor said a member of House of Hope had organised the event in his personal capacity. "We were also present when the unfortunate incident took place. They started shouting slogans and disrupted the programme," he said. The pastor termed "unfortunate" the series of disruptions of Friday prayers since October and requested this correspondent not to reveal his identity or the name of the school where the event was organised for fear of a backlash. He, however, said they did not want to lodge a police complaint. "We believe in love. We are not going to file any complaint," he added. A video being circulated on social media shows a man snatching the mike from the speaker and shouting slogans of "Jai Shri Ram" as others join in. Shailender Kumader, the SHO of Pataudi police station, said they had not received any complaint. This was not the first time that right-wing outfits in Pataudi raised the pitch against what they alleged was religious conversion. At a mahapanchayat on July 4, the gunman who had fired at a group of Citizenship Amendment Act protesters near Jamia Millia Islamia, had allegedly made a provocative speech against a particular community. In Kurukshetra, Bajrang Dal disrupted an Christian event and played 'Hanuman Chalisa'.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurugram-after-namaz-christmas-event-stopped-in-school-in-pataudi/articleshow/88498532.cms||Bagish Jha

The source of infection, according to doctors, was one of the patients, a diabetic, admitted to the hospital for a skin graft procedure on December 17. While there was no travel history reported in any of the patients, at least 39 of them had the S-gene drop - an indicator that they could be carrying the Omicron variant. All patients have a mild form of infection and are stable, the hospital said. On Saturday, health minister Ma Subramanian said the state has tested 3,038 close contacts of the patients, including hospital staff, students and family members, between December 18 and 24. So far, 54 contacts have tested positive, he told reporters. Those infected include 18 healthcare providers - seven undergraduate medical residents, seven nursing students, two staff nurses, a post-graduate student and an outsourced worker. At least 21 other contacts, including family members, have also tested positive. 'Spread among close contacts extremely high' "We are continuing to trace and test contacts. The samples of all patients have been sent for whole genome sequencing," Subramanian said. The health condition of all patients is stable, according to hospital dean Dr E Theranirajan. "Our teams tracked and tested all contacts of healthcare workers, including hostel and classmates, and those who sat with them for lunch or tea. Close contacts who tested negative have been told to report if they have symptoms of cold, sore throat or fever. Patients who tested positive have a mild form of infection and are doing well," he said. According to data from the public health department most patients - confirmed and suspected to be carrying the Omicron variant - have mild symptoms. "That is our biggest challenge. They may not know that they are sick. So, they will not isolate themselves and end up spreading it to many close contacts," said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Scientists have warned that Omicron is immune evasive and spreads faster than any other Covid variant. "Preliminary data on contact tracing in the state has shown that the spread among close contacts and in closed unventilated rooms is significantly and extremely high," Radhakrishnan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/54-test-positive-at-hospital-in-chennai-39-may-have-omicron/articleshow/88498594.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||Nagpur||NMC paid Rs73cr to OCW 2 years ago, proposal for amended deal now||Nagpur: The cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) administration was supposed to release penalty imposed on private water operator Orange City Water Private Limited (OCW) and pay for escalated cost of 24X7 water supply project only after an amended agreement. TOI on January 31, 2020, had reported that NMC has started paying for the escalated cost and returning penalty even before signing the amended agreement. The NMC paid Rs73 crore out of Rs93 crore taken from OCW as penalty and towards escalated cost between November 2019 and June 2020. Now, NMC’s public health engineering department has tabled a proposal before the general body (GB) seeking approval to draft amended agreement to be executed between NMC, special purpose vehicle Nagpur Environmental Services Limited (NESL) and OCW. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari has convened the GB on December 31, the first physical meeting after a long span. The GB meeting is likely to be stormy due to the irregularities. NMC, NESL and OCW had signed an agreement to execute 24x7 Water Supply project, operate and maintain water works in 2011. As per the agreement, the NMC was supposed to levy penalty on OCW for breach of conditions and ensure completion of project at the cost of Rs387.86 crore in five years, beginning from March 1, 2011. NMC had levied penalty of Rs41 crore on OCW between March 1, 2012, and March 31, 2018, for poor services, inordinate delay in completion of 24x7 water supply project, failure to appoint expats (experts in water from foreign countries) etc. OCW failed to complete project by March 1, 2017. Thus, the cost of works executed till March 31, 2018, escalated by Rs52 crore. Despite strong opposition and loss of over Rs374 crore, the GB in March 2019 approved one time settlement (OTS) scheme for OCW in which civic body accepted to release penalty and pay escalated cost, extension of project by 18 months and extension of achievement of performance parameters from March 1, 2017, to March 1, 2022. For execution of OTS, NMC and NESL were supposed to execute amended agreement with OCW. Another major proposal before the general body is to change reservation on sprawling 217.66 hectare located in mouza Bhamti, Jaitala and Shivangaon from Mihan to residential. Corporator Praful Gudadhe said, “MADC had exempted 217.66 hectare land from acquisition for Mihan in 2017. But the process to change reservation has started now. Over 1,500 residential buildings and large number of open plots will be regularized with this decision,” he said. After approval from GB, NMC will issue a public notice inviting suggestions and objections, followed by hearing and sending it for approval of state government.

The issue pertains to a plea moved by a Chennai-based scrap merchant challenging a demolition notice issued by the Greater Chennai Corporation. The court made the observations in view of delay by the authorities in deciding applications and appeals moved under the TN Town and Country Planning Act. "Officers who are least bothered about the orders of this court and are not doing their duty, must be shown the door as it amounts to dishonesty in their duty," said a division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and R Vijayakumar. Plea moved to challenge Corpn notice In case of non-compliance with the orders of this court, it is time and again made clear that fine will be secondary and imprisonment will be primary, the court added. According to the petitioner, though he had moved an appeal against the notice before the competent authority under the Act, he had approached the court as he feared his building would be demolished anytime. Counsel for the civic body Raja Srinivas contended that the petitioner had encroached on government land. Whether was a temporary shed or full-fledged structure would be decided after verification of plan and other documents. Dismissing the plea, the judges said, "Of late, it is reported that several IAS officers, dealing with applications under the Act, are not complying with the orders of this court, in spite of specific orders issued every now and then, fixing the outer time limit for disposal of the matters."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/strip-them-of-cadre-madras-hc-raps-defiant-ias-officers/articleshow/88498621.cms||---

Nanded, Beed, Jalna, Aurangabad, Nashik and Sangli districts were the most impacted by extreme weather events including floods and cyclones. This data on the financial impact of climate change was presented to the state legislature on Friday, along with state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray recommending what each elected representative should do in their constituency. The data, which has not incorporated compensation paid due to droughts, revealed that over Rs1,000 crore in compensation was given for Nanded, Beed, Jalna, Aurangabad, Nashik, and Sangli districts which were the most hit by harsh weather events. “Due to the cumulative impacts of climate change, north-central Maharashtra and Marathwada were the worst-affected areas in the state,” stated a press release by the state. During presentation of the data, it also came to the fore that between 2016 and 2021, the state paid Rs8,126.96 crore towards damages caused by untimely rains, hailstorms and stormy winds, and Rs4,126.04 crore to compensate for excessive rains and floods. “In addition, Rs3,992.7 crore was spent due to heavy rains alone, while Rs769.85 crore was spent on flood damage mitigation. Finally, during the course of six years, Rs2,666.47 crores were paid specifically for damages caused by cyclonic storms in Maharashtra,” the release stated, adding that natural catastrophes including cyclones, intense and unexpected rains, floods and hailstorms caused massive environmental, social and economical damage in Maharashtra. Analysis further revealed that Sangli, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Solapur and Raigad districts have been the worst hit by climate change in the last six years. “Despite the fact that cyclone Nisarga passed through the city in 2020 and hurricane Tauktae caused wind gusts of more than 120 km/h in the city earlier this year, the state capital Mumbai received the smallest amount of compensation, totalling Rs10.37 crore over six years,” it added. Nagpur received a compensation of about Rs390 crore between 2016-2021 due of untimely rains, hailstorms and stormy winds while Pune received Rs254 crore for similar weather events. The state government has announced that 43 AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) cities and urban clusters from the state will join in the global ‘Race to Zero’ campaign, which aims to prevent future climate threats, create jobs and unlock equitable, sustainable growth. “Today marks the beginning of elected representatives of the Maharashtra legislature taking the lead on climate action. It was our honour to present to the elected members of the Assembly and Council the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, impacts of climate change on Maharashtra, and climate action by the Government,” said Thackeray.

---||Nagpur||Disconnected online meetings of NMC, ‘suppressed’ voices||Nagpur: Having covered the happenings in Nagpur Municipal Corporation for the last many years, it was a dull experience writing abou the civic body this year, especially the general body (GB) meetings, due to the Covid restrictions that stretched well into the second half of 2021. The diarist missed the uproars and walkouts, heated debates, discussions on civic issues etc which generally happen in the physical general body meetings held at Town Hall. In 2021, all the monthly general body meetings were held virtually apparently giving the ruling BJP corporators an upper hand over the opposition comprising Congress, BSP, Shiv Sena and NCP. Unlike last year, when the Suresh Bhat auditorium, which was the venue for the five-day marathon GB meeting, had witnessed full drama in which boisterous senior corporators like Dayashankar Tiwari (now mayor) not only recited couplets but also told short stories to prove his point. Even the then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, who had left the House midway on day one of the meeting on June 20, had thumped his chest in front of the corporators to prove his claim of containing Covid-19 cases. During the pre-Covid period, even Congress and BSP corporators used to stage walkouts and create uproar over various issues. Every time, after such walkouts, corporators from opposition camps used to hold press briefings accusing the ruling party and administration of not allowing them to speak or have their say. This year, whenever any corporator from the opposition would start accusing or levelling charges against the ruling party, his or her voice started trailing in the virtual meetings. Citing disturbance in audio, the mayor would ask the corporators from the opposition camp to sit quietly as their voice was not clear. “You will be given a chance again after the technical snag gets corrected,” the mayor would say. But the issue remained unresolved and opposition corporators hardly got any chance throughout the year. However, the voice of any BJP corporator including ruling party leader Avinash Thakre was heard clearly without any disturbance. No doubt the mayor, who is a seasoned politician, was very punctual and conducted the GB meetings well. And many times, Tiwari convened the meeting for more than nine hours without a break. But for scribe like this diarist, covering the online GB meeting was like attending online classes of an educational institution. There was neither any strong opposition to any of the proposals discussed in the meeting nor any uproar and walkouts. Not only scribes, even senior corporators from opposition like leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve, Jitendra Ghodeswar among others feel that due to virtual GB meetings they got little coverage in local media throughout 2021. Though most of the corporators are not tech-savvy, they still attended the online meetings. Wanve had also claimed that a deliberate attempt was there to disrupt the voice of opposition corporators.

The bank’s board also accepted the request of the MD & CEO Vishwavir Ahuja to proceed on leave with immediate effect. Separately, the board approved the appointment of Rajeev Ahuja, executive director, as interim managing director & CEO with immediate effect. Although neither the regulator nor the private lender have given any indication of the reasons for the changes, this is seen as a major event by banks as RBI had accepted only a one-year term for the bank’s CEO Ahuja in June 2021. Ahuja is 62 and in terms of age has headroom to continue until he is 70. Veteran banker Ahuja, who was CEO of Bank of America in India for eight years until 2008, led the transformation of the 100-year old Ratnakar Bank by bringing in new investors and new management. The private lender was renamed and repositioned as a new generation bank which was listed following an IPO in 2016. Ahuja had a 3% stake before the IPO which has come down to 1% after equity dilution and sale of shares. More recently the bank has been partnering fintechs and offering Banking as a Service (BaaS). Dayal, who has been appointed director for a term of two years, is a chief general manager at the Reserve Bank of India in charge of the Department of Communication. He was earlier with Monetary Policy Department and the Department of Banking Supervision. This is not the first time RBI is exercising its right to appoint an additional director on the board of the private bank. In the past RBI had appointed a director on boards of Yes Bank, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank and Dhanlaxmi Bank. Shares of RBL Bank had fallen 3% on Friday. In December 2020, RBL completed a Rs 1,556 crore fund raising through a preferential allotment. However, the quarter ended September saw the bank’s net profit decline 93% to Rs 9.7 crore. Profits of the bank fell after a 33% rise in provisions. This was after a Rs 459 crore loss in the first quarter of FY22. Assuaging investors of the soundness of the bank, RBL said that the bank’s business and financial trajectory continues to be on an improving trend, post absorbing the challenges due to Covid 2 pandemic. “The financials of the Bank remain robust with a healthy capital adequacy of 16.3%, high levels of liquidity as reflected through Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 155 %, stable Net NPA of 2.14%, Credit Deposit Ratio of 7 4.1 % and a leverage ratio of 10.0%, for the quarter ended September 30, 202” the bank said in a statement to the exchanges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-checks-into-rbl-bank-board-ceo-goes-on-leave/articleshow/88498623.cms||---

---||Nagpur||SECR deploys GPS-enabled night surveillance to check rail fracture||Nagpur: The cold wave rail fracture phenomenon has prompted the South East Central Railway (SECR) Nagpur division authorities to deploy around 200 GPS-enabled men for manual surveillance of tracks and plates in the night. Tracks and plates tend to develop flaws and fractures with dipping mercury level and it can lead to serious situations. In the cold, the tracks contracts as per its metallic characteristics. This mostly happens in the night warranting a close surveillance between 11pm and 7am. An official said first a flaw is developed, followed by a widening fracture or cracks of various dimensions on the railway track. The fault aggravates with each passage of trains. The centralized monitored manual GPS surveillance system was put in place following an emergency video conference of senior officials when temperature started dropping in mid-December. The standard practice of using ultrasonic flaw detection device (USFD) for periodic review of tracks was supplemented with a more micro-level inspection by patrol team equipped with GPS trackers. The addition of GPS trackers made monitoring more effective. According to an official, the patrol team’s movement can be minutely tracked, traced and controlled effectively. “We have 200 GPS tracker devices now and a same number will be brought soon,” said SECR’s divisional railway manager (DRM) Maninder Uppal. Uppal said that three such fractures have been detected and rectified on time. The DRM said the USFD monitoring is only a periodic schedule-based phenomenon which had to be supplemented with more frequent daily manual checks. According to an official, with GPS system they can now even check the pace of the patrol team, and direct it to either slow down or gather speed. “The patrol team can even be asked to remain on hold or resume post break as per norms and need,” said the official. The official said that once the flaw or fault is detected, the officials concerned are immediately alerted and speed of the train is regulated. “Other measures are also undertaken on the affected stretch,” he said. Authorities can now track movement of the patrol team even on the ghat section and forested patch. “The patrol teams can also send message and make voice calls to their superiors using the GPS devices,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/secr-deploys-gps-enabled-night-surveillance-to-check-rail-fracture/articleshow/88497219.cms||Soumitra Bose

After investigations, he was diagnosed with having slipped disc, which is very common these days. Doctors at Wockhardt Hospital suggested minimally invasive tubular spine surgery for removal of disc. Dr Rahul Zamad, consultant spine and neurosurgery, said the surgery worked very well as it was performed the same day with an incision of 2.5 cm only. Dr Zamad said that the patient was absolutely pain-free after a few hours and discharged in less than 24 hours of admission, approximately after 12 hours of surgery “with a very small scar on his back”. “This mode of surgery is faster, safer and takes very less recovery time compared to open surgery,” he said. It is estimated that 1 to 5% of all people will have back pain caused by a slipped disc at some point of time in their lives. Slipped discs are more common in people over the age of 30, and about twice as common in men as compared to women. He said in general, the aim of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is to relieve the pressure being applied to the spinal cord and nerves and to stabilize the back bones. “This can be caused by herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, spinal infections and instability, spinal tumours or bony deformities in back,” said Dr Zamad. MIS uses tubular retractors, an instrument that moves or holds tissue so a surgeon can reach a particular area. Once the surgery is done the tubular retractors are removed. “Risk factors like localized infection are also less in MIS than open procedure. However, it’s not for everyone,” said doctors. “Patient selection is very important in this procedure. MIS may not be as safe or effective as traditional procedure in some situations,” said surgeon Dr Nilesh Gaur. Dr Gaur made it clear that certain surgeries may not be possible to be performed in some patients with high risk. “So, it’s always good to ask the doctor regarding the relative risks and benefits of the same,” he said. Small incision, big benefit - Better cosmetic results with smaller incision - Reduced post operative pain - Less blood loss - Reduced muscle damage and faster recovery - Reduced risk of infection - Early return to work - Some surgeries can even be performed as a day care procedure||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/minimally-invasive-spine-surgery-working-well-in-slipped-disc-mgmt/articleshow/88497234.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The training is being imparted to medical officers and nursing staff with the aim of reducing maternal mortalities. They are also taught how to handle emergencies, respectful maternity care and taught protocols twice a week. Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI) is working with the Maharashtra government is implementing Manyata (national programme) and LaQshya (state level) to 14 maternity facilities in Nagpur. These facilities are among the 34 where healthcare workers have been trained and are undergoing training and assessment. Dr Chaitanya Shembekar, whose hospital is Centre for Skill Enhancement (CSE) for Manyata in Nagpur, said the mission was launched about three months ago here. “We have recruited 16 centres all over Vidarbha. These include those from remotes places like Hemalkasa and Chandrapur. We will recruit more centres,” he said. Dr Shembekar said at maternity homes where turnout is huge, labouring women are often not treated well when they are in pain. “Nursing staff and doctors are explained the importance of patient’s well-being,” he said. Manyata certification is only for obstetrics, Dr Shembekar added. Some of the hospitals in Nagpur that have been certified by Manyata are Matru Sewa Sangh, Mahal Maternity Home, Harsha hospital, Shrikhande Hospital, and Deshmukh Hospital among others. The state public health department and FOGSI joined hands in 2019 to launch the LaQshya-Manyata initiative. It was launched to enable and further build capacity of private maternity care providers in delivering quality maternity and new-born care. LaQshya-Manyata adopts an innovative approach to cater to the diverse needs of private maternity facilities. Using skill drills and digital case-based learning, the programme trains private maternity facilities on essential patient care, safety, and facility improvement components. The training modules are based on a set of 26 quality standards. By addressing quality care in the private sector, the programme complements other public sector efforts towards building a holistic health system so that no mother dies during childbirth. Dr Shembekar said, “FOGSI and the GoM have launched this initiative to bring about standardization in private maternity hospitals and raise the bar for quality maternal care in the state.” Dr Alka Mukherjee, whose hospital has received Manyata certification, said, “The training, assessment and certification changed the way we offer treatment and service in our facility. The staff and doctors really need to strive hard to adhere to the quality standards under the curriculum.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-backed-training-helps-pvt-hosps-perform-over-3-1k-safe-deliveries/articleshow/88497252.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

A total of 436 cases of Omicron variant of coronavirus have been detected in India so far, out of which 115 have recovered or migrated, according to the Union Health Ministry's data updated on Saturday. Maharashtra has recorded a maximum of 108 Omicron cases, followed by Delhi at 79, Gujarat 43, Rajasthan 43, Telangana 38, Kerala 37, Tamil Nadu 34 and Karnataka 31. Of these,11 are from Jaipur, six from Ajmer and three from Udaipur. One of the patients is from Maharashtra. Results from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune showed all of them positive for Omicron, a spokesperson of the health department said. Among the 21 new cases, five have a history of travelling from other countries, three came in contact with foreign travelers, three were in contact of Omicron cases diagnosed earlier. “More Omicron cases have been reported. We are appealing to people to get vaccinated with both the doses. If people get vaccinated with both doses, the risk of complication reduces significantly. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has directed to make vaccine compulsory and people should take both doses before January 31,” Parsadi Lal Meena, health minister, told TOI. The health department has collected details of all the 21 cases of Omicron. “Eight of the 21 have recovered from Covid. All the cases are fully vaccinated, except a girl, who is not eligible for vaccination as she has not attained 18 years yet,” said a senior health department official. After the health department received the genome sequencing report from NIV Pune, they started the exercise of ensuring that the 13 cases, who are yet to recover, should be admitted to hospital. According to the Centre’s guidelines, those infected with the new variant must be admitted to Omicron wards. Of the 11 new Omicron cases in Jaipur, one each had arrived from London and Dubai and one each has a travel history to Mumbai and Chandigarh. In addition, a husbandwife duo of Jawahar Nagar, another couple from Vidhyadhar Nagar, and three cases from a family in Jhalana areas have tested positive for Omicron. “An 18-year-old boy from Gopalpura, who had arrived from London on December 10, was tested positive for Covid on December18. Another a person who arrived from Dubai also tested positive. In Vidhyadhar Nagar, a person who developed Covid symptoms and got checked on December 15, also tested positive for the virus. On December 18, his wife also tested positive. Now, they have tested negative for the virus,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer, Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/21-new-omicron-cases-in-rajasthan-tally-reaches-43/articleshow/88498689.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Bake With A Bang||Kolkata: Black Forest cake, chocolate croissants, cream rolls, truffle boats, choco cubes and brownies … the list grew sweeter and longer as people stress-baked to beat pandemic blues since the beginning of the Covid-induced lockdowns last year. The new “home-bakers” kept going, but it was no cakewalk for the industry. To keep business afloat amid strict contact and hygiene norms, companies pulled out all the stops — from blister packs to temperature-controlled vans for doorstep delivery and new strategies — to keep the “bread rolling”. The results showed; there was a gradual improvement in sales since December 2020 and currently business has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels. Madhumita MohantaThe Bakery, at The Lalit Great Eastern, adopted new business strategies to serve its patrons and keep the business going during the pandemic. “We started home-delivery of goodies and regular necessary supplies like bread varieties and morning bakeries. We have also introduced a range of organic and immunity-booster food items such as turmeric and basil bread, black pepper bread and whole-grain cake with fruit mixes like carrot cake and banana cake,” said Madhumita Mohanta, chef, The Bakery. “The business continued to experience sustained growth during the Christmas-New Year season last year and we are look forward to providing more delightful sweet experiences to our patrons this year,” she added. The Bakery, that traces its history back to the 1830s, is upbeat on some of its highest grossers like the fruit cake, plum cake, plum pudding and stollen bread, Mohanta said. Ankit Rai, the marketing head of Mio Amore (Switz Foods Pvt. Ltd), feels recovery is on the cards as most people are now double-vaccinated and feel confident in stepping outside. “Although there has been an unprecedented uptick in sales since the second wave, business reached its peak during the festive season as food-lovers finally got an opportunity to return to their favourite eateries after eighteen months of lockdowns and Covid curbs,” Rai said. Ankit RaiKathleen Confectioners has seen sales returning to almost pre-pandemic levels. “In 2020, the business was only around 60%. But given the circumstances, it was better than expected. In 2021, we expect it to be like in 2019, if not better. Even though we are optimistic, we are being equally cautious with our production,” said Tony Pradhan, a partner. “Post-reopening, the demand for small (500gm) cakes has increased, while it has fallen for bigger cakes,” he added. The all-time favourites from this 1978-established chain include the rum-balls, cream rolls, black forest and brownies. “During Christmas, our highest-selling category is the fruit cake, followed by other variants like rich plum cake, dundee cake, premium fruit cake and plain cake. This year, we are expecting a surge in demand for our 800gm fruit cake variants as they have been priced very reasonably,” Pradhan said. Mio Amore’s Rai said they deployed a considerable fleet of air-conditioned temperature-controlled delivery vans to provide doorstep deliveries to different residential complexes during the imposition of restrictions. “Even when we were selling from our stores, we cautiously followed hygiene and safety measures like using blister packs to avoid direct physical contact with products and Modified Atmospheric Packaging for packaging of bread-based items to keep the filling fresh,” he added. With 290+ stores in Bengal, Mio Amore celebrated the 29th foundation day of Switz Foods Pvt. Ltd on 9th December. “We offered a combination of 6 pastries and 5 savouries at Rs 29 each, that is, at a value less than 50-60% of the actual MRP. The campaign was a hit,” he added. Biswajit GoswamiCake Mania, the bakery and confectionery segment of Dream Oven, is also upbeat about sales during Christmas-New Year. “Last year, the Christmas sales recorded an unexpected high. So, we are optimistic this year as well,” said Biswajit Goswami, chef and owner. “During Christmas, our highest selling varieties of cakes include the exotic fruit cake and plum cake. We are also one of the first manufacturers to produce ‘nolen gurer’ cake during this season.” Though many have witnessed an uptick in business, The Sugarr & Spice has not recorded any significant improvement in sales till now. “The market was extremely slow last year. Even this year, uncertainty continues to rule,” said managing director Supriya Roy. “Nevertheless, we keep making new additions to our menu by way of research, development, innovation and improvisation to suit the changing needs and lifestyle of our customers. Following the Covid-19 outbreak, we have also reduced prices of some of our items,” she added. Supriya RoyFor Binge Baefikar — a premium wellness brand that offers healthy alternatives of popular food items across different cuisines — sales have improved following the Covid-19 outbreak. “As people have become increasingly health conscious, there has been a growing demand for brands which serve healthy yet tasty food at an affordable price. We have developed curated recipes for those following Keto, vegan, gluten-free and sugar-free diets,” said its founder Anisha Mohta. Levanilla.in, an online bakery based out of Kolkata, experienced a substantial surge in demand despite the lockdown and imposition of Covid-19 restrictions. “As we are an online store, we were not affected by restrictions limiting the operational hours of physical stores,” said co-founder Abhishek Banerjee. “During Christmas last year, our business recorded a 150 per cent surge. As a result, we are expecting a minimum 100 per cent growth this year,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bake-with-a-bang/articleshow/88497360.cms||---

In a tweet, Dhankhar said: “Media reports that Governor Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar has given his assent for excluding areas of Bally Municipality from the Howrah Municipal Corporation are incorrect…” In an earlier tweet, he said: “It is under consideration under Article 200 of the Constitution as inputs from the state government are awaited.” The posts didn’t match with the submission of the Bengal advocate general before a bench of CJ Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj. The bench, in an interim order uploaded on Friday, noted the advocate general’s submission that the Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 has received the governor’s assent. “Clarifying the position in respect of Howrah Municipal Corporation, leaned advocate general had initially stated that a Bill has already been passed by the State Legislative Assembly bifurcating the Howrah Municipal Corporation into Howrah Municipal Corporation and the Bally Municipality and that Bill is pending for assent before the Hon’ble Governor, but later on he has informed that Bill has received the assent of the Governor,” the bench noted. This is the first time that the head of the state has contradicted his government in a court of law. Trinamool Congress senior and MP Saugata Roy didn’t go into the mismatch, but held that the governor shouldn’t have delayed considering the bill. “What the governor is doing is not correct. The governor should not have delayed it for so long… He had raised some objections and wanted some clarifications and that was replied to by the state government,” Roy said. CPM Rajya Sabha member and HC lawyer Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said: “The governor is not always right. The way the state government is acting is also unwanted.” Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar pointed to a lack of coordination between Raj Bhavan and Nabanna, but placed trust in the Raj Bhavan secretariat. “There must be some documentation with the governor’s secretariat,” he said. Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury held that the difference between Raj Bhavan and the state government over facts was “unwanted”. The war of nerves began in November when the Howrah Municipal Corporation(Amendment) Bill, 2021 passed in the winter session of the assembly was sent for the governor’s assent. The governor sought clarifications, calling the legislation “arbitrary, unfair and non-judicious”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/governor-contradicts-ags-statement-on-bally-bill/articleshow/88497186.cms||---

A private lab in Indore believes eight foreign travelers have tested positive for the variant, while the state government says it hasn't received confirmation from National Centre for Disease control (NCDC) of any Omicron case in MP. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, "Till now, we haven't received any official communication regarding Omicron from NCDC." Private labs are not authorised to do this, and only NCDC will release the report, he added. Divisional commissioner Dr Pawan Sharma said he would have to check with the dean's (MGM Medical College) office regarding Omicron. Sources at Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences (SAIMS), which has a genome laboratory, said their test results have been corroborated by CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB). The eight alleged Omicron patients were admitted to SAIMS hospital. senior SAIMS functionary has shared with TOI their communication with CSIR-IGIB, wherein a scientist of the central agency says: "Both the sample sequences from MP showed Omicron case with clade 21K and lineage B.1.1.529 (BA.1) having coverage of 99%". A senior SAIMS official, requesting anonymity, said eight samples from Covid-infected foreign travellers were tested and forwarded by the local administration to NCDC for genome sequencing. The institute provides details of the patients, with SRF codes matching the patients on the official list of Covid cases in Indore. The eight alleged Omicron patients had returned to Indore around two weeks back, according to health department records.A comparison of SAIMS records and the health department's line-listing shows that among the eight are a 26-year-old woman who returned from Tanzania, two men, aged 20 and 31, who came from USA, two men, aged 26 and 31, who flew in from the UAE, a 23-year-old man from Ghana and a 23-year-old woman from UK.Government records say that 1,103 Covid samples have been sent from Indore division to NCDC for genome sequencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/8-omicron-cases-in-indore-no-word-yet-from-ncdc-says-madhya-pradesh-government/articleshow/88498747.cms||Antriksh Singh

The MLAs — Ashok Kirtania (Bongaon Uttar), Subrata Thakur (Gaighata), who is also junior Union minister Santanu Thakur’s brother, Asim Sarkar (Haringhata) and Mukutmani Adhikari (Ranaghat Dakshin) — didn’t mince words to voice their resentment on Saturday. “Matuas across Bengal helped BJP win as many as 45 assembly seats, making it the main opposition party. It is unfortunate that they now have no representation in the party’s state committee. We are answerable to the community,” Kirtania said. Sarkar echoed him and said: “This is like a feud in the family. We expected something and now feel let down. It happens in every family.” The MLAs, however, stressed that defection wasn’t on their mind at all. “We have recorded our grievances, but that doesn’t mean we are leaving BJP,” Kirtania said. The Matua belt MLAs have been under pressure over the delay in implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Bengal. Junior minister Thakur had raised the issue in the party forum a few times and was assured by Union home minister Amit Shah that things were underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/party-mlas-miffed-over-no-matua-rep-in-bjp-state-committee/articleshow/88497208.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Bengaluru||Shot story: Over 48 lakh due for second Covid vaccine dose in Karnataka||BENGALURU: More than 48 lakh people are due for the second dose of Covid vaccination in the state. These are those who have completed 84 days from the time they had taken the first dose of Covishield and 28 days of getting jabbed with the first dose of Covaxin. The data, available for up to December 23, is for both Covaxin (5 lakh) and Covishield (43 lakh). The highest number of such people is from Bengaluru (BBMP) with more than 12 lakh of them yet to take their second dose. The district health authorities across Karnataka are trying to reach out to people who have not yet turned up for their second shot. This includes healthcare workers calling and checking on reasons for delay, persuading them to visit the nearest vaccination centre and sending reminder messages. The pan-India Har Ghar Dastak (knock at every door) campaign, which began on November 3, targets unvaccinated people or those who are due for the second dose. According to health department officials, taking doses to people’s doorsteps through mobile units has enhanced vaccination rates, especially in rural and semi-urban areas. Besides, for the last one month, Omicron fear is also raising awareness on vaccination. “Many were not bothered about accessing the second dose. With Omicron fear, there’s a gradual increase in vaccination,” an official said. However, there are also issues like names of people who’ve already taken the second dose still reflecting on the list. “In some cases, we’ve had people say they’ve taken the second dose when we call them. Most of these could be cases of those who have taken the dose of Covishield early, without waiting for the completion of 84 days,” another official said. Those who have taken two doses must self-declare their recent Covid vaccination certificate as the final one, officers added. According to officials, none would admit if they have taken the Covishield second dose with shorter inter-dose duration violating the government protocols. As per the government data, of 48 lakh people on the list, 47,353 are healthcare workers. Arundhathi Chandrasekhar, mission director, National Health Mission, said a majority of them had taken the second dose under the general category. “We have verified the same. About 1% are yet to take it,” she said. The due list is dynamic and it is reducing, Arundhathi said. In a meeting, BBMP has pointed out the issue of people not taking second doses to the members of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA). “We were told that more than 14,000 people in Bengaluru city limits had taken their first dose in private hospitals, but have not come forward to take their second dose yet. We’ll have to track them and check if they have already got the second shot elsewhere,” Dr HM Prasanna, president, PHANA, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shot-story-over-48-lakh-due-for-second-covid-vaccine-dose-in-karnataka/articleshow/88498797.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Ghaziabad||CM takes ‘good governance’ credit, says it was land mafia rule earlier||Ghaziabad: Leading BJP’s ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ here on Saturday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said his government in the last four and a half years had provided welfare schemes to all sections of the society. Flanked by Union minister and Ghaziabad MP Gen VK Singh (retd) and other prominent leaders of the party in a ‘rath’ fashioned from a minibus, the CM began his roadshow shortly after 6pm by addressing a gathering at Kalka Garhi chowk during which he paid tribute to former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “We observe December 25 as ‘Sushasan Divas’ in memory of over beloved leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee whose birthday is on this day. On such a momentous day, I want to say that we have succeeded in providing good governance to the state,” said Adityanath. Lashing out at previous regimes in the state, the CM said “land mafia ruled the roost and encroached government land.” “But my government acted against land mafia and reclaimed the land. Whenever need arose, we didn’t hesitate to run bulldozers on properties of criminals and the land mafia,” he added. Referring to BJP’s poll promises, Adityanath said, “Whether it was abrogation of Article 370 or Ram Mandir, BJP has fulfilled promises made and if voters bless us one more time, we will make UP the No.1 state in the country.” Yogi’s roadshow moved on to Thakurdwara and the 2.5km stretch was lined with supporters who had come in large numbers and showered rose petals. It took almost two hours for Yogi’s roadshow to reach Thakurdwara flyover from Kalka Garhi chowk. A BJP supporter, while speaking about the roadshow amid signs of another wave of infections fuelled by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid, said, “There is no reason to fear the pandemic and the government is better prepared to deal with it this time.” Medical experts aren’t as confident because the Omicron variant is four times more transmissible than the Delta variant, which caused the catastrophic second wave in April and May this year. UP has announced a night curfew from December 25 from 11pm-5am after cases showed an increase. The BJP’s roadshow started from Muradnagar, and before reaching Ghaziabad city, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma addressed gatherings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/cm-takes-good-governance-credit-says-it-was-land-mafia-rule-earlier/articleshow/88497519.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||World||Why an Omicron wave may not be as severe as Delta||Though the Omicron coronavirus variant has spread rapidly around the world since it was first detected in South Africa, findings from several new studies suggest it may not be as deadly as the Delta variant, which drove the catastrophic second wave in India. However, vaccination, booster shots and wearing masks remain the key weapons in our arsenal against the new variant. A look at some new developments in research on Omicron Omicron more contagious but infection likely milderThree new studies in South Africa, Scotland and England have found that Omicron is causing milder infections than previous variants and is less likely to cause hospitalisation. That’s good news given that the highly contagious nature of the variant is likely to lead to a surge in cases around the world. Until now, the severity of illness from Omicron was unclear. But these new studies indicate that some biological features specific to the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 make it less dangerous than Delta. Coupled with immunity in the general population because of previous infections and vaccination, experts believe fewer patients will require hospitalisation in the next wave of cases. Though Omicron has been observed to evade antibodies from a previous infection, it may not be able to escape the powerful but slower immune responses that prevent serious disease. The South African study reported a 70% lower chance of hospitalisation from Omicron compared with other variants, while the Scotland study found a two-thirds reduction in hospitalisation risk compared with Delta. The English study, however, only reported a 15%-20% reduction in hospitalisation and a 40%-45% reduction in the risk of hospitalisation for more than a day. But the researchers cautioned that results of their studies were still preliminary and Omicron is still likely to cause a large number of hospitalisations, particularly among vulnerable groups and unvaccinated people, given how quickly it is spreading. The best defence against Omicron is vaccination. Two doses plus a booster shot are likely to provide strong protection against infection and severe illness. But most countries are yet to fully vaccinate a majority of their populations and only a handful, including the US, UK and Australia, are administering booster shots to the general public. India is far better prepared to face an Omicron wave than it was against the Delta wave earlier this year. In April, during the peak of the Delta surge, just 1.9% of Indians were fully vaccinated and 7.1% partially vaccinated. As of December 23, 41% of Indians are fully vaccinated and another 19% has received at least one dose for a total 60% vaccination coverage. Loss of taste, smell unlikely but symptoms show up earlyEarly data shows that Omicron is causing largely the same symptoms as previous variants. Though there are some differences, researchers are still unsure of their impact on the course of the illness. In South Africa, for instance, those infected with Omicron tended to develop a scratchy or sore throat along with nasal congestion, a dry cough and muscle pain, especially low back pain. But these symptoms have also been reported in infections from Delta and the original coronavirus. One subtle difference is that Omicron is less likely to cause a loss of taste and smell. Data from Norway found that just 23% of Omicron patients reported a loss of taste and 12% a loss of smell. A researcher in the US found that vaccinated people with Delta or the original coronavirus generally reported headaches, congestion, sinus pressure and pain, while unvaccinated people were more likely to report shortness of breath, coughing and other flu-like symptoms. It’s likely to be the same with Omicron among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Omicron also appears to have a shorter incubation time. It can take as little as three days before an infected person develops symptoms, becomes contagious and tests positive compared with four to six days for Delta. Omicron likely has specific mutations that allow it to quickly invade cells. Omicron wave shorter in South AfricaThe discovery of Omicron in South Africa last month sent alarm bells ringing around the world, but officials and experts say its wave has already peaked, suggesting Omicron waves may not be long-lasting ones. Earlier in December, the country saw a sharp spike in cases and positivity rate but despite opting against severe lockdowns and other restrictions, the wave has begun to subside Though several countries imposed restrictions on travellers from southern Africa, many still reported Omicron cases within the community, suggesting the variant was already active, if undetected, in other parts of the world. But South Africa’s subsiding Omicron wave, in addition to a possible lower risk of severe illness and hospitalisation despite a lagging vaccination programme, holds promise for other countries experiencing Omicron outbreaks. The US and parts of Europe, where Omicron is making up a vast majority of new cases, have far greater vaccination coverage. Data from South Africa suggests its Omicron wave is about two to three weeks ahead of the US, two weeks ahead of Norway and Denmark, and up to four weeks ahead of the UK.

The meeting in Bengaluru will decide the next course of action,” Bommai said. Whether the government was contemplating reimposing night curfew, the CM said the meeting will decide on the measure. “As of now, the guidelines issued earlier are still in force in the state. We are reviewing the situation to see if stricter measures are needed,” he added. Most infected persons are asymptomaticThe state health department is worried over the rise in Omicron variant cases with the Karnataka tally touching 31. A majority of the infected persons are asymptomatic. Barring the minors, all of them have been vaccinated. On deferring the introduction of anti-conversion bill in the legislative council, Bommai refused to see it as a setback for the government. “If we had two more members (on our side in the house), we would have passed it,” he said, adding the bill would be tabled in the next session when the party’s strength in the upper house will be one short of a simple majority. The state assembly passed the bill by voice vote on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai-to-chair-meet-today-night-curfew-curbs-likely/articleshow/88498834.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Panchkula shuts for night, but Chandigarh in no mood||CHANDIGARH: There are no immediate plans to impose night curfew — like the one Haryana on Saturday announced from 11 pm to 5 am on Saturday (Panchkula will follow the rule) — to tackle the threat of Omicron variant of Covid-19, according to UT adviser Dharam Pal. “Covid cases are under control at the moment in the city. There is no immediate need to put restrictions like night curfew and limit on gatherings. The administration is closely monitoring the situation,” Pal told TOI. He said the administration’s focus was on second dose of Covid vaccination and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour at public places. In Panchkula, gatherings in public functions are allowed at a maximum of 50% in both outdoors (300) and indoors (200). Deputy commissioner Mahavir Kaushik ordered not to allow anyone to public places and offices (government and private both) without proof of both the doses of Covid vaccination. Both private and public banks make it mandatory to allow only those staff members who were fully vaccinated. Kaushik said, “People must follow the guidelines issued to them from time to time, as Covid is still out there and can be a threat to anyone’s life.” Chandigarh on its part has already decided to restrict entry of unvaccinated people to public spaces, hotels, banks and government offices from January 1. Over 1.85 lakh beneficiaries are yet to take their second dose. Pal said the decision had been taken to ensure safety of nonvaccinated adults as they should not visit public spaces and stay at their homes as the threat of Omicron looms large. Times View Generally, consistent efforts prove more effective than stringent restrictions. The authorities' Covid response is also governed by the number of cases. So, paying more attention to getting a large section of the population to adhere to norms like effective masking, social distancing and vaccination is a better strategy. Of course, if people do not take precautions, stricter steps like night curfew and lockdown may need to be brought in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panchkula-shuts-for-night-but-chandigarh-in-no-mood/articleshow/88498903.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||India||Must ensure nobody hurts India’s dreams, unity: Modi||NEW DELHI: Asserting that the dangers against which the Sikh gurus had alerted during their lifetime continue to exist even today, PM Narendra Modi on Saturday emphasised the need to stay united and urged people to ensure that nobody is able to harm the country’s unity. In his address on the occasion of Gurpurab celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev at Gurudwara Lakhpat Sahib, Modi made this appeal just two days after a blast took place in Punjab’s Ludhiana district court complex that killed one person and left six injured. He made a reference to the 9th Guru — Guru Tegh Bahadur — who was killed on orders of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after the former had opposed persecution of Kashmiri brahmins. “The way the country gave him the title of ‘Hind ki Chadar’, shows the attachment of every Indian towards the Sikh tradition,” Modi said and added that Guru Tegh Bahadur’s valor and his sacrifice against Aurangzeb teaches us how the country fights against terror and religious fanaticism. “It is our responsibility to ensure that in such an important period, nobody hurts our dreams and unity of the country. To achieve the dreams for which our gurus lived and sacrificed their lives, we should all remain united. Unity is essential for us all,” Modi said. “The dangers against which the gurus alerted us remain the same even today, so we have to be cautious and ensure the security of the country,” he said. Modi said the Sikh Gurus not only kept the consciousness of India ignited but also played a role against invasions on the country, including Babur’s invasion which had been foreseen by Guru Nanak Dev ji. “The contribution of our Gurus is not limited to society and spirituality only. Rather, if our nation, the contemplation of the nation, the faith and integrity of the nation is safe today, then at its core is the great ‘tapasya’ of the Sikh Gurus,” the PM said. Emphasising that Guru Teg Bahadur’s entire life is an example of ‘Nation First’, Modi said just as the Guru always stood firm for his concern for humanity, he gave the vision of the soul of India. The PM lauded that the valour with which our Sikh brothers and sisters fought for the country’s independence even under British rule, our freedom struggle and land of Jallianwala Bagh bear witness to those sacrifices. This tradition, the PM said, is still alive and becomes all the more important in these times of ‘Amrit Mahotsav’ when we are remembering and taking inspiration from our past. The PM said from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kutch to Kohima, the whole country is dreaming together with the mantra of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’. “The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, which was awaited for decades, was completed in 2019. Currently, 400 years of Prakash Utsav of Guru Teg Bahadur ji is being celebrated,” Modi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/must-ensure-nobody-hurts-indias-dreams-unity-modi/articleshow/88498937.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Four Kolkata traffic guards to launch e-challan next year||KOLKATA: Four of the 25 traffic guards in the city — Howrah Bridge, Headquarter, South and Jorabagan — are set to usher in the new e-challan regime early next year. Once introduced, it will make challans paperless and allow payments of traffic fines and even conduct court arbitrations completely online. The transport department’s recent notification to allow the use of mParivahan and DigiLocker documents along with setting up an e-court in the Bankshall court jurisdiction has helped in the rollout of e-challan. Those guards over whom the Bankshall court has direct jurisdiction will launch the system initially. Sources said Calcutta High Court had already begun the process of identifying this e-court and would issue a notification soon. However, police sources said there was a technical glitch that needs to be sorted out. While the e-challan system in its present form can read mParivahan app details, it needs to also be compatible with DigiLocker. The police had earlier carried out trial run at headquarter and east traffic guards. The challenge was to set up an e-challan special traffic court to handle these cases. With an e-challan court now likely to be declared, the software will enable one to use the android phone to furnish the documents and pay the fines. “The project will be extended to the whole of Kolkata and integrated with the e-court where cases can be settled without the requirement of physical attendance. The software will be fully integrated with Vahan and Sarathi databases and the cases registered through it will be shown in the database throughout the country,” said an officer. Driving licence, registration certificate, pollution certificate, insurance and other tax related papers can be locked digitally during prosecution for violating traffic rules. Motorist will get the exact GPS based location where he committed the traffic violation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/four-kol-traffic-guards-to-launch-e-challan-next-yr/articleshow/88496549.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Nagpur||‘Can’t afford another lockdown in New Year, taking vaccine only way out’||When it comes to events like restrictions on movements, travelling, meetings and mix-ups, general physician Dr Jay Deshmukh knows the mass mentality of patients very well. According to the veteran medico, the way people are going about revenge shopping and revenge tourism after getting relaxations from restrictions is more dangerous than the very idea of restrictions. For the New Year, Dr Deshmukh shared some important tips for all age-groups with Covid-19 vaccination being a priority amongst them. He feels that another phase of restrictions will create resentment among people and that policy makers should bring about some innovative solutions instead of the typical ‘lockdown’ formula to deal with the pandemic situation. Excerpts...Q. Are we entering New Year 2022 with further restrictions? A. Restrictions have been introduced and it’s a reality. Our government had to announce them ahead of Christmas and New Year parties. Many plans have already been cancelled and this is going to affect people’s mindset in a negative manner. More restrictions will invite public resentment. Few may defy restrictions and break rules in our set-up. But, people react in different ways here. Once the government lifts the restrictions, people indulge in revenge tourism, revenge shopping the way we have been witnessing this winter. Such behavior is more dangerous and risky. Imposing lockdowns and restrictions is not the way to deal with the crisis. Q. What should be the right way to deal with the issue?  A. Firstly, vaccination. We must ensure complete vaccination of the entire eligible population. Door-to-door campaigns should be taken more seriously. Secondly, the local administration can provide ‘self-testing kits’ for Covid at subsidized rates to people. Self-testing will make people confident. Those who are positive after self-testing will start taking care. Nagpur can take the lead with self-testing kits and make it a pilot project for all the big cities in India. Thirdly, it’s not a local body’s prerogative, but we must start vaccination of children at the earliest. Kids above 5 years of age should get the jab. There is no harm in doing so. We had several rounds of trials in Nagpur itself. The results are really promising. Still, authorities are waiting for the launch of children’s vaccines which is unnecessary. Vaccine to kids will ensure that schools will re-open and continue to function. Regular school is the most import thing to bring life back to normalcy. Q. Will the booster dose become a reality in the New Year?  A. I think we will get a booster dose policy in January. Many have already taken boosters and the results are really good. There is no harm in taking a booster dose. In fact, it will only benefit people. This is a complete new vaccine and booster will definitely help. Q. A variant like Omicron is escaping vaccine protection. So, what’s the point in taking boosters?  A. A new variant like Omicron may infect even a vaccinated person, but the disease will not turn serious. Secondly, the existing vaccines greatly help to reduce the spread of the virus. If a vaccinated person gets infected, he will not spread the virus to many others. If there is no 100% spread of virus, the surge will be negligible and we will move ahead without much loss. If the spread is restricted, further mutation of the Omicron variant will also get restricted. Ultimately, infection is not the problem. In fact, no Covid-19 vaccine can guarantee you 100% protection from the infection. The vaccine only ensures that the infection does not turn deadly. In the same way, vaccinated people may get infected by Omicron, but a majority of them will recover without much hardships. So, vaccines are a must. Q. What are your suggestions for people ahead of the New Year? A. We all had a tough 2021 and suffered a lot in every way. We must start the New Year with new hope. Firstly, all of us should complete the Covid vaccination at the earliest. Unfortunately, more than 25% of Nagpur’s population is yet to get both the doses, with many yet to get even one. We have realized the importance of annual health check-ups. My second suggestion is to get yourself tested for lifestyle-related diseases like hypertension and diabetes annually. Mental health is also important. For this, start the New Year on a positive note. Try to spend more time with family. You can resolve to have a good laugh every day. Be positive and try to be with positive people. Do not hesitate to take periodic holidays. Reduce your screen time and try to live a stress-free life. Finally, it is physical fitness. You can resolve to devote at least 45 minutes of your day for any kind of exercise like running, walking, cycling or yoga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cant-afford-another-lockdown-in-new-year-taking-vaccine-only-way-out/articleshow/88497672.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Chandigarh||Ludhiana blast: ‘Dead ex-cop got radicalised in jail’||CHANDIGARH: Preliminary investigation in the Ludhiana court complex blast indicates involvement of pro-Khalistani elements in Pakistan, gangsters, and drug smugglers, Punjab director-general of police Siddharth Chattopadhyaya said on Saturday. The police suspect dismissed Punjab police head constable Gagandeep Singh, who is now being considered the main accused in the case, was radicalised in prison after his arrest in August 2019 for possession of heroin by the Ludhiana unit of Special Task Force. After having spent two years in Ludhiana Jail, Gagandeep got out on bail in September and was to appear in the court again on December 24. “Preliminary investigations suggest that accused Gagandeep Singh could have developed links with pro-Khalistan elements in the jail, who have used him to target the court premises with the intention to disturb the peace of the state,” said DGP Chattopadhyaya, who added that the police are investigating the case from all angles. ‘Accused wanted to create fear before his hearing’Accused wanted to create fear at court before his case hearing' Two prisoners linked with a Pakistani narco-terror cell, Ranjeet Singh Cheeta and Sukhwinder Singh ‘Boxer Baba’, were brought out on production warrant on Saturday in Ludhiana and remanded to seven-day police custody. A woman cop who used to be a naib reader at the office of the Khanna superintendent of police and is suspected to be Gagandeep’s friend has also been detained. Gagandeep was a reader in the same office as her from 2015 to 2017. The high-intensity explosion on Thursday afternoon in a public toilet at the district court complex in Ludhiana had killed Gagandeep and injured six other persons. The investigation has identified the deceased cop as the accused who planted the explosive material. Gagandeep has his court hearing on Friday in the court of additional sessions judge on the first floor of the district court complex. Witnesses were supposed to be presented for their statements in court. The next hearing of this case is now February 3, 2022. The DGP said that the accused wanted to create fear and panic at the court premises before the scheduled hearing of his ongoing case. The district court was functioning as usual, when the blast took place and it was so powerful, that the public toilet was damaged and several windowpanes of the building were shattered. The DGP said the material used for the explosion is yet to be ascertained as the samples have been sent to the forensic lab. “A team of NSG and that of the state forensic experts were called for a post-blast investigation,” he said. During the course of systematic clearing of debris at the blast site, the forensic team collected some vital clues like damaged mobile set and burnt clothes on the body of the deceased besides other material evidence, the DGP added. Chattopadhyaya lauded his police force for cracking the cases within 24 hours after zeroing in on the identity of the deceased as Gagandeep Singh of Khanna, who was recruited in Punjab Police as a constable and dismissed in August 2019 after 385 g of heroin was recovered from his possession. “I am proud of the Punjab Police for successfully cracking the case in less than 24 hours,” said Chattopadhyaya while addressing a press conference here at Punjab Police headquarters on Saturday. During the course of the post-mortem, the police were able to identify the deceased from his tattoo mark on the right arm. Separately, the DNA samples of the body were also collected, he added. The DGP said that accused Gagandeep Singh was working as a munshi at Khanna’s Sadar police station when he was arrested with heroin and an NDPS case was registered at SAS Nagar STF police station, Mohali. The case is under trial at the prosecution evidence stage, said the DGP.

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana blast: ‘Dead ex-cop got radicalised in jail’||CHANDIGARH: Preliminary investigation in the Ludhiana court complex blast indicates involvement of pro-Khalistani elements in Pakistan, gangsters, and drug smugglers, Punjab director-general of police Siddharth Chattopadhyaya said on Saturday. The police suspect dismissed Punjab police head constable Gagandeep Singh, who is now being considered the main accused in the case, was radicalised in prison after his arrest in August 2019 for possession of heroin by the Ludhiana unit of Special Task Force. After having spent two years in Ludhiana Jail, Gagandeep got out on bail in September and was to appear in the court again on December 24. “Preliminary investigations suggest that accused Gagandeep Singh could have developed links with pro-Khalistan elements in the jail, who have used him to target the court premises with the intention to disturb the peace of the state,” said DGP Chattopadhyaya, who added that the police are investigating the case from all angles. ‘Accused wanted to create fear before his hearing’Accused wanted to create fear at court before his case hearing' Two prisoners linked with a Pakistani narco-terror cell, Ranjeet Singh Cheeta and Sukhwinder Singh ‘Boxer Baba’, were brought out on production warrant on Saturday in Ludhiana and remanded to seven-day police custody. A woman cop who used to be a naib reader at the office of the Khanna superintendent of police and is suspected to be Gagandeep’s friend has also been detained. Gagandeep was a reader in the same office as her from 2015 to 2017. The high-intensity explosion on Thursday afternoon in a public toilet at the district court complex in Ludhiana had killed Gagandeep and injured six other persons. The investigation has identified the deceased cop as the accused who planted the explosive material. Gagandeep has his court hearing on Friday in the court of additional sessions judge on the first floor of the district court complex. Witnesses were supposed to be presented for their statements in court. The next hearing of this case is now February 3, 2022. The DGP said that the accused wanted to create fear and panic at the court premises before the scheduled hearing of his ongoing case. The district court was functioning as usual, when the blast took place and it was so powerful, that the public toilet was damaged and several windowpanes of the building were shattered. The DGP said the material used for the explosion is yet to be ascertained as the samples have been sent to the forensic lab. “A team of NSG and that of the state forensic experts were called for a post-blast investigation,” he said. During the course of systematic clearing of debris at the blast site, the forensic team collected some vital clues like damaged mobile set and burnt clothes on the body of the deceased besides other material evidence, the DGP added. Chattopadhyaya lauded his police force for cracking the cases within 24 hours after zeroing in on the identity of the deceased as Gagandeep Singh of Khanna, who was recruited in Punjab Police as a constable and dismissed in August 2019 after 385 g of heroin was recovered from his possession. “I am proud of the Punjab Police for successfully cracking the case in less than 24 hours,” said Chattopadhyaya while addressing a press conference here at Punjab Police headquarters on Saturday. During the course of the post-mortem, the police were able to identify the deceased from his tattoo mark on the right arm. Separately, the DNA samples of the body were also collected, he added. The DGP said that accused Gagandeep Singh was working as a munshi at Khanna’s Sadar police station when he was arrested with heroin and an NDPS case was registered at SAS Nagar STF police station, Mohali. The case is under trial at the prosecution evidence stage, said the DGP. The Punjab police chief has also visited the court complex where the blast took place on Thursday and had a meeting with district and sessions judge, Ludhiana and reviewed the security arrangements. The DGP also held the meeting with field officers on Friday and directed them to keep utmost vigil to prevent any further terror attacks in the state. No politics in the case against Majithia The DGP ruled out any politics in the case against Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, whose bail was rejected by the Mohali court on Friday. Chattopadhyaya said that the investigation is going on even while he is yet to be arrested. “Law is taking its own course and there is no politics behind registration of the cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ludhiana-blast-probe-points-at-pro-khalistani-links-punjab-dgp/articleshow/88499055.cms||---

It’s learnt that the AICC has sent a terse letter to Karnataka Congress chief D K Shivakumar, noting that the 15-day ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyaan’, which was carried out by state units from November 14, was conducted in only four of the 37 organisational districts in Karnataka. The campaign was designed to highlight the issue of price rise, under which all the state leaders led marches, rallies and made night halts in villages to sensitise people about the “anti-people policies“ of the BJP regime. The price rise issue was also used to focus on women voters by talking about the massive hike in cooking gas prices during the present BJP rule. The campaign covered the states right up to the village level starting from districts. However, the AICC has noted that Karnataka only carried out the campaign in four districts while 33 districts remained untouched, which is seen as serious apathy on part of the organisation to the issue and to the directions of the central leadership. Sources said Shivakumar has been asked to immediately take up the campaign in 33 districts by involving all the wings, including frontal organisations, of the PCC. “You may kindly take this communication seriously and see to it that the programme is conducted in all the districts, down to the village level,” says the letter sent to Shivakumar, while he has also been asked to submit reports about the campaign to the AICC. According to Congress, the Jan Jagran Abhiyaan has managed to strike a chord with people and highlighted the price rise issue , which was put on the centrestage with the rally held in Jaipur on December 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-ticks-off-karnataka-unit-for-slipping-on-party-campaign/articleshow/88499059.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Jagan hosted a high tea in honour of Justice Ramana, who visited the state's capital region for the first time after taking charge as CJI. Jagan heaped praises on the CJI and said a Telugu person had got the opportunity to become the chief justice of India after a long gap of 65 years. Justice Ramana on his part thanked Jagan for the rousing reception. Jagan, who had last year complained against Justice Ramana to then CJI, Justice SA Bobde, gave a grand reception to Justice Ramana and introduced his Cabinet colleagues to him. Judges of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana high courts were also present at the event. CM introduces members of cabinet, govt officials to CJIEarlier, Jagan and his wife Bharati made a courtesy call on Justice Ramana at a star hotel before high tea at Indira Gandhi Municipal Corporation Stadium, which was decorated to suit the occasion. Jagan's letter to Bobde had sparked an intense debate in judicial and political circles. However, the Supreme Court after an in-house procedure dismissed the complaint and Justice Ramana went on to become the 48th CJI. Jagan walked along with Justice Ramana as the two entered the stadium after which Jagan introduced his cabinet colleagues, senior officials in the government and public representatives.

---||Chennai||The misty magic of a Margazhi morning||As the city stirs from slumber, there’s a nostalgic chill in the air. On misty mornings during Margazhi, early birds are enveloped in a shallow fog, but it barely dampens their spirits and they make the most of that magical hour. For Mylapore’s gurukkals (temple priests) and ardent devotees, it’s that time of the year when the days must begin with the mesmerising harmony of bhajans and mantras. Their voices rise in bhakti and blend with the smell of camphor, incense and fresh flowers as they make their way to the Kapaleeswarar temple. Newspaper vendors pedal past pavement dwellers huddled around makeshift bonfires; morning walkers are outpaced by runners, and the shores of the Marina draw fitness enthusiasts determined to get their daily dose of dopamine. As dawn breaks over the city, the local tea shop hosts everyone from office goers to college students and idle conversationalists, who stop by for a steaming cuppa. The northeast monsoon is on its last legs, and weathermen say the drop in moisture, high wind pressure and dry northerly winds — which are at a lower level — are responsible for the shallow fog and cold winds the city is experiencing this year. Largely though, this is a season the city most looks forward to; there’s festivity in the air, the musty woollens have come out and rich plum cakes and freshly fried vadas are best enjoyed with a cup of steaming hot filter coffee, music and merrymaking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/the-misty-magic-of-a-margazhi-morning/articleshow/88499088.cms||---

But it is her grandmother, who sparked her interest further with her bedtime stories. An aspiring astronaut, Jahnavi, created history by being the only Indian to undergo International Air and Space Program (IASP) at Nasa Launch Operations' Kennedy Space Centre in Alabama, US. 'I dream of being one of the first Indians to set foot on Mars'IASP selects only a handful of 20 young people from all over the world for this programme. Jahanvi recently completed the entire astronaut program at Kennedy Space Centre. According to Jahnavi, it involved activities including zero gravity, multi-access training, and underwater rocket launch. She also piloted an aircraft for the first time. During the training programme, she was appointed as the mission director for 'Team Kennedy', where she led a group of 16 people from several countries. Her team successfully launched and landed a miniature rocket into the sky. Jahnavi is vice-president of Space Magica, a startup astronaut training centre for students and the general public. She has been a campus ambassador for numerous of organisations, including Star (Space Technology and Aeronautical Rocketry), an Indian private aerospace company. Jahnavi is a member of International Organization of Aspiring Astronauts (IOAA). Speaking to TOI, Jahnavi, a record holder of Indian Book of Records for being a multi-talented girl, said that her dream is to be one of the first Indians who will set foot on Mars. "I even got a scholarship from a Mexican company for the IASP programme. As a step towards my astronaut journey, I have trained in open water scuba diving in various places, including in Visakhapatnam. Now, I am a Scuba Schools International-certified open water scuba diver," said Jahnavi. "I am taking every opportunity to reach my dream by participating in various projects, workshops and hackathons. I have worked diligently analysing images caught by the Pan-STARRS satellite in pursuit of unexposed asteroids. Our team made 16 preliminary discoveries and spotted one provisional discovery," said Jahnavi. Jahnavi is currently pursuing her engineering second year from a private university in Punjab. She participated in many events and workshops of Nasa, Isro and other space agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-girl-becomes-first-indian-to-complete-nasa-programme/articleshow/88499026.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Chennai||To a year of new choices||The main course was the great outdoors | If there’s one thing the pandemic did, it turned everyone into a chef. According to Dineout, the number of home chefs could have risen by four times in 2021 alone. Restaurants, on the other hand, adopted digital menus and set up alfresco dining spaces for the safety of their patrons. Start-ups emerged with curated picnic experiences for families to get quick, safe, breaks. Health-focused restaurants witnessed a 200% increase in orders, while locally available greens like the hibiscus saw new-found love. What’s in store | The transition to healthy, home cooked diets which began last year is set to evolve into a growing market of its own. Predictions say selenium-rich foods, plant-based meats and moringa are likely to hit big. In cities, urban foraging has become a discovery. “The number of enquiries we get for our kitchen garden and organic farming workshops has doubled, and so have homemakers and young professionals interested in growing their own food,” says Rohit Jain, secretary, Organic Farming Association of India. NFT ARTInto the metaverse | In May, Chennai musician Kaber Vasuki sold an early demo recording of his song ‘Vasanam’ as a non-fungible token (NFT) for 50 ether (equivalent to ₹1.5 crore as of then), to popular NFT investor Metakovan. In November, at the world’s first NFT-focused music, art, and technology festival titled ‘Dreamverse’ that was held at Manhattan’s Terminal 5, 41 visual and musical artists from Chennai, presented ‘Pann’, a programmable NFT that went on to be minted on Async Art. In brief, 2021 saw artists and innovators flock the NFT market, not just for its monetary possibilities, but for its scope as a fairer ecosystem. What’s in store | Deloitte Global predicts that NFTs for sports media will generate more than US$2 billion in transactions in 2022. Industry experts say tech majors like Microsoft and Nvidia could back this growth. MG Motor India has already announced the debut of its MG NFT. FITNESSVirtual is the way | If every plank you did earned you a score over another gym rat, would you be better motivated to work out? Popular brands like StepSetGo think so, as they gear up to explore gamified fitness experiences in 2022. What’s in store | So, if you have a fitness goal this new year, wear it with pride, literally. Because the sale of wearable tracking devices, which grew by almost 170% in the first quarter of 2021 (according to International Data Corporation’s Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker), is only set to get bigger. According to Deloitte, 320 million consumer health a n d wearable wellness devices will be shipped worldwide in 2022. Also upping the game is virtual training as fitness centres rise up to a hybrid market in the coming year. “Most of our clients are exploring equipment-less, body weight routines like calisthenics and animal flow movement, which can be done at home,” says M Sudeesh, head coach at The Quad, Chennai. TRAVELNo workations please, just vacations | In 2020, workations were in, but they were on the decline in 2021, and maybe on their way out in 2022, say experts. The Travel Predictions 2022 Research by Booking.com says 73% of their travellers want to reclaim vacations, making them strictly for leisure. Caravans and RVs have become popular after the pandemic. After trying for decades, Steve Borgia, managing director of Indeco Leisure Hotels, launched his motor homes in April.“People choose caravans as they are safe and keep the family together,” he says. What’s in store | 2022, say experts, will be marked by more frequent, instant getaways. Make My Trip says bookings at off-beat destinations like Bir, Hampi and Araku Valley will go up. Flexible travel solutions like the air fare lock option will also be sought after. THEATREBack to the stage, with precautions | As a year of cancelled shows and financial crisis delivered a blow on smalltime artists, some of them rose to the challenge by upgrading themselves digitally. In the beginning, most theatre artists, musicians and dancers explored the virtual medium, experimenting with pre-recorded shows. In June, Chennai’s Sumanasa Foundation organized an Online Performing Arts Festival for folk traditions falling outside the digital economy. What’s in store | Live artists are looking at the coming year with the hope to engage with audiences directly. “It may be a slow process but is a necessary one,” says Karthik Kumar of Evam. Expect the tours to restart and Covid-19 protocol — including vaccination certificates and masks — to become mandatory prerequisites. “We cannot wait to get back on stage,” says Karthik. “Studio spaces and intimate settings are emerging as great spaces to host shows for smaller audiences.” CINEMAWomen take the lead online | Yes, OTTs ruled in 2021, but look closer, and you will realise that the women ruled the OTTs. ‘Lady Superstar’ Nayanthara was seen in Miland Rau’s thriller film ‘Netrikann’ (on Disney+Hotstar); Jyothika in the family drama ‘Udanpirappe’ (on Amazon Prime Video), and Trisha in ‘Paramapadham Vilayattu’ (on Disney+Hotstar), which was also her 60th film. Kangana Ranaut created waves in the south, playing late chief minister J Jayalalitha in ‘Thalaivii’, which came on Netflix. ‘Master’, ‘Jai Bhim’ and ‘Sarpatta Parambarai’ were among the most talked about films. What’s in store | The scope of OTT releases will grow, say industry experts. News is that Dhanush starrer ‘Maaran’, may see an OTT release, even as other mega productions, Ajith’s ‘Valimai’ (set for a Pongal release) and Vijay’s ‘Beast’ (to be released next summer) get set to open in theatres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/to-a-year-of-new-choices/articleshow/88499097.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Medical intern West Bengal’s 1st Omicron case without international travel history||KOLKATA: A 23-year-old intern of Medical College Hospital Kolkata, who has no recent history of international travel, has tested positive for Omicron. The young doctor was detected with Covid a week ago and was in home isolation. He was admitted to the Beliaghata ID Hospital late on Friday after his genomesequencing report confirmed Omicron. Another Omicron case was confirmed on Saturday, that of a 45-year-old-man who flew into the city from Tanzania on Tuesday and was sent for institutional isolation at CNCI Covid Hospital in Rajarhat on testing Covid-positive. This takes the Omicron tally in the state to seven. Five of the Omicron patients are under treatment at different hospitals in the city while two — a seven-year-old boy and a 49-year-old man who had tested positive on arrival at Telangna and New Delhi respectively — have recovered. All the five patients are stable. The case of the Medical College intern with no travel history has sent alarm bells ringing in the medical fraternity since it may indicate local transmission of the new variant in the state. “He is a medical professional and might have come in contact with some patients. But without confirmation we can’t say if he had actually come in contact with someone with Omicron. It is too early to conclude about community transmission at this point. Three of his close contacts have been traced,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director of health services. ‘Close contacts of jr doc identified’According to sources, the intern is an inmate of Dr BC Roy Hostel that houses MBBS students of Medical College. About a week ago, he developed fever, sore throat and cough for which he underwent an RT-PCR test on December 20. When the test threw up a positive result, he left the hostel for his home in Krishnagore and was under home isolation. After health department officials got his Omicron positive report late on Friday night, he was picked up and brought to Beliaghata ID Hospital. The intern’s sample had been sent to NIBMG Kalyani as part of the protocol to sequence all Covid-positive samples from Kolkata that have a CT value of less than 30 to determine if Omicron transmission is happening in the community. TOI on Thursday had reported that all Covid-positive samples with lower-than-30 CT values are being sent for genome-sequencing. “This is the first sample with no travel history to test positive for Omicron. We are not pressing the panic button but we will step up surveillance,” said a senior health official. According to the health officials, exposure to an Omicron-positive patient could be one source of infection for the medical intern who had attended OPD and indoor patient wards on a regular basis before testing Covid-positive. What concerns the officials is that he lived in the hostel and had been in close contact with several MBBS students and interns. Sources at Medical College said some close contacts have been identified and they are not being allowed to move outside their hostel rooms. All of them will undergo Covid tests. “The condition of the 23-year-old is very stable. Apart from mild symptom like sore throat and issues of anxiety and hypertension he does not have any serious issues as of now. He is under conservative treatment for Covid infection,” said pulmonologist Kausik Chaudhuri, nodal officer for Covid at ID Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/med-intern-west-bengals-1st-omicron-case-without-international-travel-history/articleshow/88499101.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||India||Muslim girl free to marry on attaining puberty: HC||CHANDIGARH: Accepting the plea of a 17-year-old Muslim girl who got married to a Hindu boy against the wishes of her family and relatives, the Punjab and Haryana HC ordered the police to protect the couple. The court also made it clear that a Muslim girl on attaining puberty is at liberty to marry anyone she likes and the guardian has no right to interfere if the match is equal. “The law is clear that the marriage of a Muslim girl is governed by the Muslim Personal Law. As per Article 195 from the book, ‘Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla’, Petitioner No.1 (girl) being 17 years of age, is competent to enter into a contract of marriage with a person of her choice. Petitioner No. 2 (her partner) is stated to be about 33 years old. Thus, Petitioner No. 1 is of marriageable age as envisaged by Muslim Personal Law,” observed Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill. Justice Gill observed, “The court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the apprehension of the petitioners needs to be addressed. Merely because the petitioners have got married against the wishes of their family members, they cannot possibly be deprived of the fundamental rights as envisaged in the Constitution.” The counsel for the petitioner contended that under Muslim law puberty and majority are one and the same, and that there is a presumption that a person attains majority at the age of 15 years. The counsel also contended that a Muslim boy or Muslim girl who attains puberty is at liberty to marry anyone he or she likes and their guardian has no right to interfere. He said Article 195 from the book ‘Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla’ defines capacity for marriage — every Mahomedan of sound mind, who has attained puberty, may enter into a contract of marriage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/muslim-girl-free-to-marry-on-attaining-puberty-hc/articleshow/88499122.cms||Ajay Sura

Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Darshan Pal, part of the nine-member coordination committee of the morcha, clarified after 22 farm bodies on Saturday formed a political front to contest the polls. The SKM leaders said the farmers body, which they claimed was a platform of more than 400 different ideologically connected organisations across the country, was formed only on the issues of farmers. “There is no call for the boycott of the elections and even no understanding of contesting elections.” They said it was made by the people to get their rights from the government and after the repeal of three agricultural laws, the struggle had been postponed and the remaining demands would be decided in the meeting to be held on January 15, 2022. Regarding 32 organisations in Punjab, they said there was no consensus on jointly jumping in the assembly elections. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha further clarified that it has nothing to do with declaration by some farmer organisations of Punjab to form a “Sanyukt Samaj Morcha” for contesting assembly elections. “The SKM stands by its policy of not allowing any political party to use its banner or stage. Any attempt to use the name of SKM for elections will constitute a grave violation of the morcha discipline, it said. In a statement issued by SKM coordination committee members Darshan Pal, Hannan Mollah, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, Yogendra Yadav, Yudhveer Singh, Shiv Kumar Sharma Kakka stated the forthcoming national meeting of SKM schedule for January 15 shall take a final decision on whether farmer organisations and leaders who take part in elections can remain within SKM. The farm organisations Krantikari Kisan Union (Darshanpal), BKU Krantikari (Surjit Phool), BKU Sidhupur (Jagjit Dallewal), Azad Kisan Committee Doaba (Harpal Sangha), Jai Kisan Andolan (Gurbakhsh Barnala), Dasuha Ganna Sangharsh Committee (Sukhpal Daffar), Kisan Sangharsh Committee Punjab (Inderjit Kotbudha), Lok Bhalai Insaaf Welfare Society (Baldev Sirsa) and Kirti Kisan Union Punjab (Hardev Sandhu) have taken a clear stand against contesting elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/skm-will-not-contest-punjab-polls/articleshow/88497417.cms||---
---||---||Punjab at crossroads in run-up to assembly polls||CHANDIGARH: Dark ominous clouds are once again looming over impending Punjab assembly elections. Bomb blast at Ludhiana, coupled with sacrilege incident at Harmandar Sahib brought back painful memories of the Maur blast and Baragari incident in the run-up to the 2017 elections. Adding to complexity are other lynching incidents, sought to be passed off as beadbi (sacrilege), which has emerged as the new tool in cognitive electoral manipulation. The major difference this time is that blame game has shifted from Dera to Khalistanis and elements across the border. However, spurt in incidents and timing of these have sprouted conspiracy theories. K2 (Kashmir and Khalistan) are perennial terror instruments of Pakistan’s ISI. Militancy in Punjab originated in 80s and pre-dates the ongoing proxy war in the valley. It accounted for approximately 20,000 senseless deaths, including then Prime Minister, sitting and former CMs. Unfortunately, fault lines were shaped by scheming and wily politicians. They unleashed Frankenstein masquerading as a saint, who like proverbial genie, refused to heed to facilitators. Punjab with strategic significance will always remain on Pakistan’s radar as unrest here has the potential to wreck agricultural economy and vital national food security. By nature, Punjabis remain fiercely independent, resulting in opposition being at the helm for prolonged period. Compulsive contrarianism (euphemistically termed as Panga-taking) is natural instinct and is sought to be exploited by ISI to shape centrifugal forces. Emotion rules and trick is in reaching out and addressing sensitivities, bullying simply doesn’t work. Religion and politics are dangerously mixed up, peppered with large number of deras, engaged in divisive self-serving activities. Most have even acquired their own militias. Riverine terrain, drugs and gun- running form complex template for crime in border areas. Drones and tunnels have added third dimension, making-up for, albeit to limited extent, currently suspended overland rail and road transit. Punjab and Mizoram are two isolated examples of success in our rather gloomy conflict resolution matrix. It is also relevant that state police supported by populace defeated nefarious proxy war design. The unfortunate part is that very few recount this success story. Every time, I complimented Punjabis on this account, hate mail followed. Many mainstream regional parties have countenanced glorification of terrorists. Pakistan has been striving to extend arc of terrorism from Jammu-Katha-Samba to adjoining areas of Punjab. This is part of obstinate ploy to keep alive the concept of working boundary. Multiple attacks have occurred in Samba, followed by incidents at Dinanagar (Gurdaspur) and Pathankot. In Dinanagar, the Army consciously allowed the state police to take the credit, despite a machine gunner from the Army being the main enabler in successful elimination of three terrorists. Notwithstanding recovery of GPS, which was unprofessionally handled (as per media reports), there can be no real closure on route of ingress and number of terrorists. Pathankot incident highlighted complicity of Salwinder, sacked SP and possibility of ‘diamonds for drug’ racket. Mansion of taxi driver in his village and involvement of jeweller raised serious doubts about well-organised nexus, complete with logistics chain. Unfortunately, cops like Salwinder and Devinder (of Srinagar airport notoriety) are nurtured and given responsibilities well beyond their competence, overlooking documented red flags and shady dealings. A rough check of manning profile of border districts from Jammu to Ferozpur in 2014-16 revealed few worrying facts. First, the IAS and IPS officers are conspicuous by their absence. Second, state services officers linked to politicians are posted in border range, on multiple tenures. Third, most are linked with local crime syndicates. Fourth, passing the buck follows after every incident. Intelligence agencies flag generalised warnings, blaming police for ignoring them. BSF and police trade accusations. Finally, NIA and SIT step in but never achieving closure. Almost all sacrilege and blast cases remain unresolved, eroding trust and fuelling unwanted speculation. Two confidence builders in citizenry, central agencies and apex police hierarchy have got completely politicised. Most placements are based on suitability (read pliability) and affiliations, ignoring domain competence. Having served with outstanding officers in Khaki, including central agencies, yearning for reforms is natural. When Ludhiana blast happened, I was in Hoshiarpur, addressing a large youth fest. Almost every one blamed interested parties and agencies. It will require concerted serious work by parties and agencies to dispel prevailing notion and regain their credibility. It threw up another disturbing realisation that unfortunately, youth now believe that all is fair in polls. Amity and tolerance seem to be yielding turf to hate and binaries. Ignoring norms, polls and campaigns are plummeting into sort of unrestricted warfare. In sum, nuanced federalism, as enshrined in the Indian Constitution is critical in border states. Festering disputes like farmer agitation are ticking fault lines. Police and administration in border areas need to be revamped, modelled on erstwhile Indian Frontier Administrative Service (IFAS). Investigations need to be time bound and findings shared. All parties should reduce electoral temperature. As an eternal optimist, I have faith that ‘Punjabiyat’ and ‘Nanak Naam Lewa’ traditions will defeat diabolic plots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/punjab-at-crossroads-in-run-up-to-assembly-polls/articleshow/88752824.cms||---

Religion and politics are dangerously mixed up, peppered with large number of deras, engaged in divisive self-serving activities. Most have even acquired their own militias. Riverine terrain, drugs and gun- running form complex template for crime in border areas. Drones and tunnels have added third dimension, making-up for, albeit to limited extent, currently suspended overland rail and road transit. Punjab and Mizoram are two isolated examples of success in our rather gloomy conflict resolution matrix. It is also relevant that state police supported by populace defeated nefarious proxy war design. The unfortunate part is that very few recount this success story. Every time, I complimented Punjabis on this account, hate mail followed. Many mainstream regional parties have countenanced glorification of terrorists. Pakistan has been striving to extend arc of terrorism from Jammu-Katha-Samba to adjoining areas of Punjab. This is part of obstinate ploy to keep alive the concept of working boundary. Multiple attacks have occurred in Samba, followed by incidents at Dinanagar (Gurdaspur) and Pathankot. In Dinanagar, the Army consciously allowed the state police to take the credit, despite a machine gunner from the Army being the main enabler in successful elimination of three terrorists. Notwithstanding recovery of GPS, which was unprofessionally handled (as per media reports), there can be no real closure on route of ingress and number of terrorists. Pathankot incident highlighted complicity of Salwinder, sacked SP and possibility of ‘diamonds for drug’ racket. Mansion of taxi driver in his village and involvement of jeweller raised serious doubts about well-organised nexus, complete with logistics chain. Unfortunately, cops like Salwinder and Devinder (of Srinagar airport notoriety) are nurtured and given responsibilities well beyond their competence, overlooking documented red flags and shady dealings. A rough check of manning profile of border districts from Jammu to Ferozpur in 2014-16 revealed few worrying facts. First, the IAS and IPS officers are conspicuous by their absence. Second, state services officers linked to politicians are posted in border range, on multiple tenures. Third, most are linked with local crime syndicates. Fourth, passing the buck follows after every incident. Intelligence agencies flag generalised warnings, blaming police for ignoring them. BSF and police trade accusations. Finally, NIA and SIT step in but never achieving closure. Almost all sacrilege and blast cases remain unresolved, eroding trust and fuelling unwanted speculation. Two confidence builders in citizenry, central agencies and apex police hierarchy have got completely politicised. Most placements are based on suitability (read pliability) and affiliations, ignoring domain competence. Having served with outstanding officers in Khaki, including central agencies, yearning for reforms is natural. When Ludhiana blast happened, I was in Hoshiarpur, addressing a large youth fest. Almost every one blamed interested parties and agencies. It will require concerted serious work by parties and agencies to dispel prevailing notion and regain their credibility. It threw up another disturbing realisation that unfortunately, youth now believe that all is fair in polls. Amity and tolerance seem to be yielding turf to hate and binaries. Ignoring norms, polls and campaigns are plummeting into sort of unrestricted warfare. In sum, nuanced federalism, as enshrined in the Indian Constitution is critical in border states. Festering disputes like farmer agitation are ticking fault lines. Police and administration in border areas need to be revamped, modelled on erstwhile Indian Frontier Administrative Service (IFAS). Investigations need to be time bound and findings shared. All parties should reduce electoral temperature. As an eternal optimist, I have faith that ‘Punjabiyat’ and ‘Nanak Naam Lewa’ traditions will defeat diabolic plots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-at-crossroads-in-run-up-to-assembly-polls/articleshow/88497435.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Daduwal thanks PM for ‘resolving Sikh issues’, wants Hawara set free||Chandigarh: Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc) president Baljit Singh Daduwal appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi here on Saturday on behalf of Sikhs for reopening the Kartarpur Corridor, repealing three farm laws on Gurpurab, and abolishing the Sikh blacklist. The HSGMC has now written to the PM for appointment to negotiate the release of “Sikh political prisoners who have completed their sentence” and seek justice for Bargari sacrilege, Behbal Kalan police firing, and Kotkapura lathi-charge." Daduwal also claimed that the Sikhs wanted special courts to sentence the drug mafia, redevelopment of Gurdwara Gian Godri Sahib at Har Ki Paurhi in Haridwar (its original site), renaming of Delhi international airport after Guru Tegh Bahadur, and easier conditions for the pilgrimage to Kartarpur Sahib and other gurdwaras in Pakistan. Daduwal claimed to have list of 22 Sikh prisoners who have completed their sentence and "should be set free". He said: "They include Sarbat-Khalsa-appointed jathedar Jagtar Singh Hawara and Balwant Singh Rajoana (the former a conspirator and the latter a backup human bomb in the 1995 assassination of 12th Punjab chief minister, Beant Singh)." Daduwal demanded that the martyrdom day of Sahibzadas (four sons of Guru Gobind Singh) be observed as Children’s Day. "Many other pending Sikh issues related to Punjab, Haryana, country, and the world are to be discussed with the PM," he said. HSGMC senior vice-president Karnail Singh Nimnabad, vice-president Swaran Singh Ratia, assistant secretary Chandeep Singh Rohtak, executive committee member Satpal Singh Ramgarhia, and secretary Sarabjit Singh Jammu were present. Speaking about the recent sacrilege incidents at Harmandar Sahib in Amritsar and Kapurthala, Daduwal said, "The sacrilege accused were killed on the spot but they should have been interrogated. The sangat’s reaction in Kapurthala was the fallout of Amritsar. The sangat should act with intelligence, courage, and patience, and avoid haste. We must expose the conspiracy. For the lynching, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committtee (SGPC) is also responsible, since its president claimed that its task force had released the accused after apprehending him even though he had no identity on him." About the sangat’s reaction, Daduwal said: "Sluggish trials and investigations eroded the sangat’s faith in courts, governments, and administrations. Police let go of many previous accused as mentally ill, so the sangat didn’t want to turn over the next accused to them. But I appeal to the sangat to follow the law of the land and not punish the innocent." Backs Bargari morcha Asked about the second Bargari Insaf Morcha of the families of the two Sikhs killed in the police firing at Behbal Kalan, Daduwal said: "We support the morcha. The sangat never wanted to end the first morcha, and we separated from those who dictated that it be lifted. I visited the protesting families and feel disappointed that the successive governments failed to delivered them justice even when Sirsa dera’s role had come to light." ‘Maur blast probe slow’ Daduwal asked the Punjab government why investigation into the Maur car bombing case had not progressed "even when the Punjab special investigation team proved that the car had been modified at the dera of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh". ‘Not helping BJP’ Replying to a query, Daduwal denied that he was preparing the ground for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Captain Amarinder Singh in the Punjab elections. He said: "I appreciated even the Charanjit Singh Channi government for initiating action against the drug mafia. Whoever does good work, we’ll appreciate, and whoever does wrong, we’ll condemn." ‘Majithia should join probe’ Replying to a query about drugs case against Shiromani Akali Dal former minister Bikram Singh Majithia, Daduwal said: "Charanjit Singh Channi has proved to be a hundred times more effective CM than Captain Amarinder Singh for his courage to book Majithia, while Captain sat on the SIT report for four years and six months. I appreciate director general of police Chattopadhaya also for acting against Majithia, and the ex-minister should join the investigation if he is not wrong. I suggest the government to look for him at the Sirsa dera or Captain’s house."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/daduwal-thanks-pm-for-resolving-sikh-issues-wants-hawara-set-free/articleshow/88497450.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||PSPCL plans for 2022 paddy season six months in advance||PATIALA: Punjab’s power utility has started planning for the paddy season six months in advance, because it failed to meet this year’s requirement for 15,000 megawatts and 2022’s estimate is 16,000 MW. Its failure to meet the requirement this year forced power cuts on all categories of consumers, inviting mob attacks on the power grids and the gherao of officials for the promised eight hours of supply to the agriculture sector for irrigating the paddy fields. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is having trouble tapping into the power exchange and other outside sources as well as maintaining sufficient coal stock in the thermal power plants. A senior official in the PSPCL said: "The two state-run power plants at Ropar and Lehra have 10 days of coal stock and the central government is not sending more coal to the plants of that status. The IPPs (independent power producers) in Punjab also have limited coal stock. The Pachwara coal mines linkage allocated to the PSPCL is yet to be operational and it is also below the capacity of the government’s thermal power plants." The state government has terminated its PPA (power purchase agreement) with GVK Goindwal Sahib, one of three IPPs. The 90 days of termination notice period will end by January 26 and the state then run short of 500 MW of electricity during the paddy season next year. The notice for tariff cancellation and renegotiation with the other two IPPs is also out. Enhancing transmission capacity is also a challenge for the PSPCL, since it can import a maximum of 7,300 MW from the northern grid, while its in-house operation capacity is 6,840 MW, of which it might lose GVK’s 500 MW in the coming season. This April, before the paddy season, the PSPCL had sought enhancement in total transfer capacity/available transfer capacity (TTC/ATC) from Northern Regional Load Despatch Centre (NRLDC) for importing power through the northern grid. The ATC/ TTC limits were 6,600 MW and 7,200 MW, respectively. The centre enhanced the limit but also requested the corporation to maximize the generation at 220-kilovolt level during the high-load conditions in Punjab for safe grid operations and meeting higher load. Earlier, the PSPCL had failed to install 1,000 MVA interconnected transformers (ICT) at 400-KV systems in Ropar and Dhanasu and add 500 MVA capacity each at the Makhu, Rajpura, and Amritsar ICTs, besides 185 MVA at Nakodar. It has critical shortage of cables, poles, and transformers, besides regular staff. Confronted, PSPCL chairman and managing director Baldev Singh Sran said: "We have started planning for the paddy season 2022. We will take up the matter of coal shortage with the central coal ministry to build up stock."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pspcl-plans-for-2022-paddy-season-six-months-in-advance/articleshow/88497455.cms||Bharat Khanna

The accused, namely sacked HCS officer Anil Nagar, co accused Navin Kumar and Ashwini Kumar, were produced through video conferencing before the vigilance magistrate, Panchkula. The investigating officer has moved the said application. While the defence counsel appearing on behalf of Ashwani Kumar and Navin Kumar said that his clients had no objection on this. “Neither my clients were part of the HPSC and its recruitment process and they were nowhere linked to the case or had spoken to anybody about it. Hence, we have agreed to give voice samples. My clients have been framed,’’ said the defence counsel. Notably, the case pertains to alleged cash-for-job scam in the recruitment of dental surgeons as well as HPSC preliminary examinations. All three were arrested by the vigilance bureau and are currently lodged in Ambala jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vb-seeks-voice-samples-of-nagar-two-other-accused/articleshow/88497463.cms||---
---||India||Unlike the West, India can’t isolate Myanmar due to geopolitical reasons||NEW DELHI: The Indian outreach to Myanmar this week was overdue, walking a fine balance between engaging the immediate eastern neighbour while pushing it towards restoration of democracy. Maintaining a now established “twin-track” approach, India’s approach is closest to that of Japan but intrinsically different from China. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s visit, according to the government’s own review, checked four key areas of India’s engagement with Myanmar — security, humanitarian issues, politics/democracy and geopolitics. The view here is that India does not have the luxury of isolating Myanmar in the way the western world has done, for its security and geopolitical interests are too important. On the democracy front, India feels it is the only power in the region that can push Myanmar towards a more federal structure based on its Constitution. In their conversations, the Indian side emphasised the importance of going back to elections. The military leadership informed Shringla that while they had announced 2023 as the year for elections, they were considering introducing proportional representation along with direct elections. India has restarted discussions on bringing a more politically acceptable system back in Myanmar, which first started in 2011. Shringla, sources said, pushed for the release of political prisoners, but no one in New Delhi is holding their breath on this. Shringla’s meeting with the opposition NLD, therefore, became important, because it signalled India considers the premier opposition party to be an important stakeholder. He wasn’t allowed to meet Aung San Suu Kyi, but it wasn’t a surprise. In recent weeks, the Myanmar junta refused permission for the same to the Chinese and Japanese special envoys as well as the Asean and UNSG envoys. However, engagement with the military leadership has started across the board. Thailand has maintained steady but quiet ties, particularly in the current situation when Myanmar situation is driving refugees into Thailand like India. Former US governor Bill Richardson maintains links too, though these are billed private initiatives. China’s special envoy has had two long visits to Myanmar. China has resumed work on the Kyaukhphu port in Rakhine, not to speak of helping with security equipment. With the west isolating Myanmar, their foreign policy options too are restricted. It is for this reason that India has maintained contact to keep some more options open. Now that Russia is also taking a close interest in Myanmar, their options have somewhat increased. India has had close contact with the Myanmar military, stretching back to 1999. It’s often forgotten that it was the military leadership in Myanmar that diversified away from the Chinese just over a decade ago, to open up to the world, elections and a decade of democracy, as well as balance out China. New Delhi has long believed Myanmar doesn’t respond well to public censure or sanctions. India’s persuasion will all be through quiet conversations. In 2020, Shringla and the Army chief jointly travelled to Myanmar when they met Suu Kyi and Min Aung Hlaing together. India has started work on all the development and aid projects decided upon then. During Shringla’s visit, India announced it would continue with its development projects in the Rakhine state, border regions of Chin, Sagaing and the Naga self-administered zones, where sources said, India has already completed over 100 projects. Security issues were a big part of the conversation, which included, the influx of Myanmar migrants in Mizoram and Manipur. Sources said this was one of the reasons for persistent Covid infections in Mizoram. Shringla donated 1 million vaccines to Myanmar and much of those will be used to vaccinate the border populations. The security conversation with the Myanmar junta is seen to be very important. The civil war-like conditions inside Myanmar is a security nightmare for India as the fighting spills over the borders. There are reports of illegal arms smuggling which opens the way for China and Pakistan to supply weapons to India’s own insurgent groups in that region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unlike-the-west-india-cant-isolate-myanmar-due-to-geopolitical-reasons/articleshow/88499208.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||Chandigarh||Haryana’s Murrah buffaloes now a ‘brand’, some bulls are worth crores||JIND: Murrah buffaloes have emerged as “black gold” for cattle breeders in Haryana as these bulls are in demand due to high semen quality. Haryana has been a hub of Murrah buffaloes and bulls in the world, with some of these bulls turning into a brand for their owners. Some sources have claimed that a bull was recently sold for Rs 11 crores, however, there has been no confirmed report of such a deal. Rushtam, a buffalo owned by Dalel Singh of Gatauli village in Jind district, has emerged as a champion bull by defeating others on various parameters in a cattle fare organised in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, on December 18. Nine-year old Rushtam, 15 feet long and around six feet tall, was awarded the “Krishak Ratna” award worth Rs 5 lakh, with his oiled body and smooth grey-black hide being the talk of the town. Dalel Singh informed that the bull produces nearly five ML sperm and can be extracted three times. “This exercise is followed every three months for a period of about 15 days. One shot of sperm generates 400 straws, which are sold for Rs 400 per straw. Thus, it produces about 10 thousand shots every three months,” he said. Singh said Rushtam’s feed include 8 litre milk, 300 gram desi ghee, 3 kg chana, half kg methi, 100 gram badam, 3.5 kg carrot, every day besides fodder. The bull is taken for stroll for nearly 2 to 3 km every morning and evening. Dalel Singh said that Rushtam has won 26 national titles in the bull championships across the country, besides six international titles. “Rushtam has fathered 50 thousand calves till now,” he claimed. The bull is famous for its beauty and quality of semen, which ensure a handsome yearly income up to Rs 20 lakh for its owner. Some other bulls in Haryana are also equally famous. Yuvraj of Kurukshetra, Bajrangi of Chandoli village in Kurukshetra , besides Rustam of Jind district, are counted among the best in the state. Karmbir Singh, resident of Sunaria village in Kurukshetra district, is the owner of Yuvraj. He said that he had been emotionally attached to Yuvraj, who is now 18 years old. “Despite high prices, I have rejected many offers to sell Yuvraj and I have decided never to sell my bull”. Yuvraj has been a national champion and had fathered thousands of calves across the country. Dalel Singh said that there are many parameters for selecting best bulls in the championships, which include 60 marks for testicle, besides curves in the horne, stride, height, length and shape of the body. Another famous bull named Chand, owned by Pardeep Turn, a B.Tech student turned farmer from Panipat’s Sodhapur village, has won the Progressive Dairy Farmers Association (PDFA) International competition held in Jagrao, Punjab, on December 11.Chand is son of Sultan, another famous who died of heart attack last September. Sultan too had won numerous national awards, including the ‘National Animal Beauty Competition’ in Jhajjar. Notably, in the Pushkar Fair, an animal lover had offered to buy Sultan for Rs 21 crore, but his owner, Naresh Beniwal, had decided not to sell the buffalo as he treated him like his own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryanas-murrah-buffaloes-now-a-brand-some-bulls-are-worth-crores/articleshow/88497473.cms||Vijender Kumar
---||Gurgaon||The pangs of surgery that gave birth to India’s newest unicorn||Gurgaon: It didn’t take too long for a business idea to brew when two surgeons and an entrepreneur were meeting regularly over tea. Today, that idea is worth over a billion dollars. Healthcare startup Pristyn Care, which took shape in an 8x8 clinic-cum-office in Gurgaon in 2018 as its three founders sought to build a parallel operating system that didn’t have the unnerving ambiguity around medical procedures that patients and their families commonly encounter, appears to have touched a chord. Earlier this month, the company that offers elective surgeries became the newest entrant in India’s unicorn club (private companies valued at $1bn or more) after its Series E round from Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global and other investors raised its valuation to $1.4bn. “There’s a lot of ambiguity around surgeries. The entire journey is broken,” says co-founder Dr Garima Sawhney, a realisation she had over and over in her pre-startup years as a consulting surgeon, watching anxiety consume patients’ families in an ecosystem whose hallmark isn’t transparency. “One has to find the right doctor and surgical centre, go through a tedious admission process and run to the hospital multiple times for insurance claims. If it’s a smaller hospital or town, then advanced surgery processes are unavailable,” she adds. The emergence of a concept like Pristyn Care as a unicorn, which says it now has 1,600 employees, over 400 surgeons and 800 surgical centres, coincides with a global focus on healthcare solutions because of the pandemic. The company, which claims to make medical procedures more affordable by aggregating available hospital space rather than building its own and focusing its resources on equipment instead, has something other than a straightforward approach to surgeries that it believes works for it – an end-to-end service for patients that begins with a home pickup and ends with post-operative care and insurance claim settlement. Sawhney, Harsimarbir Singh and Dr Vaibhav Kapoor began discussing their alternative model in 2015 when Singh headed a startup’s beauty and salon-at-home vertical and the two doctors practised at a leading private hospital. “We would come up with ideas that we could experiment with. It was during one of these discussions that we came up with the idea of providing end-to-end services in elective surgeries like tonsils, piles, hernia and cataract, among others,” Sawhney says. “Vaibhav and I had experience of over 10,000 surgeries. One thing that would bother us was that though the physical infrastructure of healthcare had improved with corporates coming in, the core problems had remained.” The final push came when Singh’s mother had to undergo a gynaecological surgery in 2017. Though Sawhney operated on her, Singh faced challenges at each step — which hospital to choose, filing his insurance claim, post-operative care. In 2018, the three left their jobs and bet their savings on the startup. The initial months were typically startup – turbulent and met with scepticism. The office shapeshifted from boardroom to clinic, depending on the need. “Many office spaces would not entertain us. They only wanted tech startups. Once we thought of setting up an office in South Delhi, but were robbed of Rs 1.5 lakh,” says Singh. But renting an office wasn’t as challenging as convincing hospitals to rent out facilities was. Besides, doctors would be sceptical of joining their team. To source patients, the trio would travel initially to cities like Bhiwani and Panipat, among others, to hold camps and offer free-of-cost OPDs. “Initially, nobody would take us seriously. We would go to hospitals and tell them we’ll need their infrastructure to perform over 20 surgeries a month and we’ll get our own doctors and equipment. They wouldn’t believe us. When we would ask doctors to join us, they would be sceptical too. The first two team members we hired ran away in two days as they were bothered that we work 15-16 hours a day seven days a week,” Singh says. But as the founding trio doggedly stayed the course, Pristyn Care began to grow through word of mouth publicity from patients. The turning point came when a few experienced doctors and hospitals started trusting them and the team strength reached around 30. In 2019, the company bagged its first round of funding from Sequoia Capital. Covid gave the second push when the fear of infection drove up the demand for an end-to-end service. Pristyn Care also set up a Covid centre in the city which, it believes, helped earn more trust. “We started simple. I would bring in patients and Garima and Vaibhav would operate. Together, we would take care of everything in between. Most of the services we offer were included over time as we kept our ears to the ground and learned on the go,” Singh says. Pristyn Care has found a foothold in tier 2 cities by offering the kind of advanced surgeries not easily available there. The company says its business model is asset-light — it has grown by renting excess capacities of over 800 hospitals and surgical centres buying heavily in advanced medical equipment, which helps it conduct, say, a laser operation for piles or cataracts that the centre otherwise wouldn’t be able to. This business model, it says, also brings down the overall cost of a surgery by 25%-30%. “We rent out spaces of hospitals and surgical centres and don’t have to bear the burden of maintaining assets. So, we pass on that benefit to patients by making the surgeries relatively more affordable for them,” Singh says. Mukul (name changed on request), a resident of Cuttack in Odisha, underwent a hernia surgery at a Pristyn Care facility. “I enquired with several hospitals in the city but couldn’t find the right advice and technology for the surgery. Pristyn Care offered that at a hospital in Bhubaneswar. The accessibility made the process of surgery and recovery faster and easier,” he says. Kapoor says commuting challenges faced by a couple of patients prompted the company to include a cab pickup and drop facility in their package. “A patient had to be operated on urgently and his son was in the US. He said he’ll come in a couple of days and get the surgery done. But since the patient was getting critical, we didn’t want to wait. So, we got a cab to pick up the patient and dropped him home later. In another instance, we booked a cab for another patient struggling to commute to the surgery centre,” Kapoor says. Startup watchers feel the asset-light model is attractive but achieving a bigger scale will remain a challenge. Ashutosh Pastor, manager (startup incubation) at IIT Delhi’s Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer, told TOI, “Investors see an idea and its scalability. Given the pandemic push to the startup ecosystem in healthcare, it was quite relevant for a startup like Pristyn Care to scale up and attract investors. The company has a good base and unlike others offering only connect services, it provides comprehensive end-to-end services.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/the-pangs-of-surgery-that-gave-birth-to-indias-newest-unicorn/articleshow/88497506.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||After namaz protests, Christmas event stopped at Pataudi school||Gurgaon: A Christmas celebration at a private school in Pataudi was stopped on Saturday by a group of men who snatched the mic from a priest delivering a lecture and shouted “Jair Shri Ram” slogans. The latest disruption follows protests organised by right-wing activists almost every week in the NCR district since October against the Muslim community’s namaz congregations. At the Pataudi school, House of Hope had organised a “Christmas Milan”, whose theme was to make people aware about the “real meaning of Christmas” through songs, dance and teachings of the Bible. A number of children and women from areas in the vicinity had gathered for the event. A few minutes into the programme, the group of men, who identified themselves as members of the Dharam Jagriti Mission, barged into the hall and alleged that the programme had been organised to “brainwash children” and “prepare them for conversion”. RP Pandey, the president of the outfit, said though Christmas carols were being practised at the school for the past few days, they had no idea about the programme. But two days ago, invites were sent out to people from the neighbourhood to attend the Christmas programme. “It is through song and dance that they promote their religion and influence the minds of children,” Pandey said. He claimed that most of those who attended the event were from humble backgrounds. A pastor said a member of House of Hope had organised the event in his personal capacity. “We were also present when the unfortunate incident took place. They started shouting slogans and disrupted the programme,” he said. The pastor termed “unfortunate” the series of disruptions of Friday prayers since October and requested this correspondent not to reveal his identity or the name of the school where the event was organised for fear of a backlash. “We believe in love. We are not going to file any police complaint,” he added. A video being circulated on social media shows a man snatching the mike from the speaker and shouting slogans of “Jai Shri Ram” as others join in. In another part of the clip, several children can be seen sitting on the floor in front of the stage as a woman in a yellow saree sings and a man in a grey suit plays the guitar. Shailender Kumader, the SHO of Pataudi police station, said they had not received any complaint. This was not the first time that right-wing outfits in Pataudi raised the pitch against what they alleged was religious conversion. At a mahapanchayat on July 4, the gunman who had fired at a group of Citizenship Amendment Act protesters near Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi, had allegedly made a provocative speech against a particular community. A video of the speech was widely circulated on social media, leading to calls for legal action against the gathering and speakers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/after-namaz-protests-christmas-event-stopped-at-pataudi-school/articleshow/88497523.cms||Bagish Jha

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said there is likely to be some improvement in AQI from Monday. Saturday’s AQI was marginally higher than Friday’s 334. Unfavourable meteorological conditions, including slow wind speed and poor ventilation are causing a spike in air pollution levels, IMD said. But with rain forecasted in the week ahead, the pollutants in the air should settle down. “Our teams are keeping a regular vigil across the city to prevent activities which are likely to contribute to air pollution. Other measures such as water sprinkling, mechanised sweeping, anti-smog guns at construction sites are already in place to help in settling the localised dust particles,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer of Haryana State Pollution Control Board. Three of the four monitoring stations – Gwalpahari, Sector 51 and Teri Gram recorded the AQI in the ‘very poor’ category with the reading at 353, 356 and 344, respectively. The AQI at Vikas Sadan was not available due to insufficient data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/air-very-poor-may-improve-tomorrow/articleshow/88497528.cms||---

While the hotels are packed to capacity, special arrangements have been made to create additional parking spaces. Light to moderate snowfall is likely to occur in the districts of Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur and higher reaches of Kullu, Chamba, Kangra, Shimla (including Shimla City), Mandi and Sirmaur during next 48-72 hours that would further attract the crowd to the popular tourist destinations. For the NY celebrations, everyday around 10,000 vehicles are expected to arrive in Shimla alone. For the smooth flow of traffic and to ensure the proper parking of tourist vehicles, beside to maintain law and order, the city has been divided into five sectors. For the Christmas celebrations, four reserve battalions were deployed in Shimla, while for the New Year celebration three more reserve battalions would be deployed. In the state, hotels are witnessing maximum occupancy these days, especially in Shimla, Manali, Dharamshala and Dalhousie. HPTDC has announced special discount for the tourists in its hotels. Tourists are also heading towards Kufri, Chail and Kasauli for celebrations. Policemen are also keeping an eye on people not adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour. On Saturday, 76 persons were challaned, of which 30 challans were from Shimla, only while 28 challans were from Solan. According to police officials, around 164 police jawans have been deployed on strategic locations of Shimla town to help tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/huge-rush-in-hp-tourist-towns-over-10k-vehicles-arriving-in-shimla-daily/articleshow/88497555.cms||---

As per information, the Christian community was celebrating and children were present on stage wearing different dresses when a group of Bajrang Dal members reached there and disrupted the event. They later played ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ on the music system arranged by the organisers of the event. In a viral video related to this incident, a person can be heard saying, “Yeh Bajrang Dal wale apni yahan goondagardi dikha rahe hain, Christmas ka program hai yahan pe inhone Hanuman Chalisa laga di. (Bajrang Dal people are showing their hooliganism here, it was a Christmas event here and they played Hanuman Chalisa).” No one from the Christian community has so far come forward to give their statement on this issue. Bajrang Dal, however, claimed its Kurukshetra unit had received information that ‘Christian missionaries’ were holding a conversion event. “We reached there and talked to the people and asked them to celebrate Shaheedi Diwas and other Hindu traditions and why are they going to other religion. When they did not listen, a light scuffle took place and we played Hanuman Chalisa for ‘shudhikaran (purification)’ of the place and the palace was vacated. This time, we did not say anything to them but next time we will not spare them,” said Rakesh Kumar, vibhag sanyojak, Kurukshetra, in a video message. When contacted, Kurukshetra SP Anshu Singla said, “I am unaware of the incident and so far, we have not received any complaint. Information will be provided if any complaint is registered.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hanuman-chalisa-played-at-xmas-event-in-kshetra/articleshow/88497566.cms||JK Singh

The public health department has decided to tighten surveillance and monitoring of passengers after it was found that those arriving from countries that are not "at-risk" for the Omicron variant are bringing infection into the community. All passengers travelling from "at-risk" countries -- South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Ghana, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Hong Kong, Israel, and all countries in Europe including the United Kingdom - will continue to be tested on arrival. Those tested positive will be isolated in a hospital and that tested negative will be mandated to remain in home quarantine until they test negative on the 8th day of arrival. "We will continue with this as per the Centre's instructions. In addition, we have made home quarantine mandatory for passengers from other countries too. They must do a test on the eighth day to exit quarantine," he said. Until Saturday, only 2% of passengers from countries that were considered not at risk were tested. None of these passengers had to wait for the results, but they were advised to monitor their health condition for two weeks. "They will be called back for hospital isolation only if they test positive as per Centre's guidelines," he said On Thursday, during a virtual meeting, the state health department had insisted on the need for testing on arrival and mandatory home quarantine for all international passengers. Of the 57 patients who had S-gene drop, nearly 37 of them were passengers or contacts of passengers who travelled from countries that were not at risk. While 19 contacts of patients from other countries were tested positive, there were just two among people who came from countries at risk, who were in mandatory isolation. "We did not hear any feedback from the Centre. But we have decided not to wait. We will be stepping up testing and monitoring," said Subramanian. The state will now test at least 10% of passengers from non-risk countries and insist all passengers remain in quarantine until an exit test on the eighth day. "Officials from health, police, local administration and revenue department will monitor the health status of these patients while they are in quarantine," he said. In addition, the state has asked all domestic passengers to declare their travel history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/7-day-quarantine-exit-test-must-for-international-flyers-tn-govt/articleshow/88499287.cms||---
---||World||UK to ease immigration rules for care workers as shortage worsens||Foreign social care workers, care assistants and home care workers, including from India, will soon be eligible for a UK Health and Care Visa for a 12-month period as part of temporary measures to meet shortages in the sector. The UK government said on Friday that thousands of additional care workers could be recruited to boost the adult social care workforce following temporary changes to the scheme, which will make it quicker, cheaper and easier for social care employers to recruit eligible workers to fill vital gaps. These workers cover work in government-backed care homes and also care assistance for the elderly and disabled in their own homes. “The care sector is experiencing unprecedented challenges prompted by the pandemic and the changes we've made to the health and care visa will bolster the workforce and helping alleviate some of the pressures currently being experienced,” home secretary Priti Patel said. “This is our new plan for immigration in action, delivering our commitment to support the NHS and the wider health and care sector by making it easier for health professionals to live and work in the UK,” she said. The change follows recommendation from the UK’s Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to make care workers and home carers eligible for the Health and Care Visa and add the occupation to the Shortage Occupation List (SOL). Inclusion on the SOL stipulates an annual salary minimum of £20,480 for carers to qualify for the Health and Care Visa. The government said the Covid pandemic has highlighted a range of staff shortages within the social care sector, placing pressures on the existing workforce. The temporary measures announced this week are expected to come into effect early next year and will be in place for a minimum of 12 months, providing a staffing boost while the sector deals with the additional pressures of the pandemic and will be reviewed after the minimum period. “It is vital we continue to do all we can to protect the social care sector during the pandemic and beyond,” health secretary Sajid Javid said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-to-ease-immigration-rules-for-care-workers-as-shortage-worsens/articleshow/88499341.cms||---
---||World||China’s Communist Party removes top Xinjiang official sanctioned by US||BEIJING: The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CPC), headed by President Xi Jinping, has abruptly replaced its chief in the volatile Xinjiang province, Chen Quanguo, who was sanctioned by the United States over alleged human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in the region. Chen no longer serves as secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Regional Committee of the CPC, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday. Ma Xingrui, who was the governor of Guangdong province, has been appointed as new party chief for Xinjiang. The CPC Central Committee has decided to give Chen another appointment, Xinhua reported. Chen has been accused by the US, the UK and the European Union of widespread human rights abuses against Uighurs, but he is tipped for a promotion, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. Last year, the US government had slapped sanctions against Chen and several other Chinese officials incharge of Xinjiang, stating they were “believed to be responsible for, or complicit in the unjust detention or abuse of Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang”. The three officials banned by the US were Chen Quanguo, CCP party secretary of Xinjiang, Zhu Hailun, the then party secretary of the Xinjiang Political and Legal Committee and Wang Mingshan, the party secretary of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinas-communist-party-removes-top-xinjiang-official-sanctioned-by-us/articleshow/88499393.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Swachhta Mitras to tackle garbage better||NEW DELHI: With an aim to spread awareness and motivate people to segregate waste at source, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation plans to introduce the concept of "Swachhta Mitras". The pilot project will commence from the Keshavpuram zone, where the resident welfare organisations will be asked to identify a person from within to be chosen as a "Swachhta Mitra". The Swachhta Mitra will work with the authorities to spread the word on proper sanitation and disposal of garbage. "Through this scheme, we plan to involve the masses in segregation of waste at source," said Yogesh Verma, chairman of Keshavpuram zone. The area sanitation inspectors have also been asked to identify localities that may be judiciously segregating waste, so that the corporation could honour their efforts. "Citizen groups leaders and individuals will be covered as part of the scheme. We will select the Swachhta Mitras and, then, honour them by giving a certificate. We will also paint inspirational messages on the walls," Verma said. While the north and east corporations had decided to collect only segregated waste from November 1, only a few areas are actually adhering to the rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-swachhta-mitras-to-tackle-garbage-better/articleshow/88499403.cms||---

---||Amritsar||22 farmer groups float political front in Punjab||BATHINDA: A fortnight after ending the over year-long farm agitation at the Delhi borders, 22 farmer groups which were part of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), that helmed the farm protest, leading to the Narendra Modi government repealing the farm laws, on Saturday formed a political front. It is led by senior farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal and will contest the upcoming Punjab assembly elections. The front has been named Sanyukt Samaj Morcha, quite akin to the name of the farmers’ umbrella body. It is said the historic victory against the central government had whetted the farmer groups’ appetite for a political plunge. A week back Haryana-based farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni floated a party, Sanyukt Sangharsh Party. The credo of the newly formed is Aajo Punjabiyo Punjab bacahiye (Come Punjabis let's save Punjab). The front leaders said they would not go for a tie-up with any political party and were ready to contest all the 117 assembly seats in Punjab. However, sources said that the morcha is expected to forge an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in days to come. Amid the front’s launch, divisions were clearly visible in the SKM, with some constituents opposing a political front, saying it was against the spirit of SKM — a conglomerate of 475 farm groups from across the countryand would cause confusion among people. It was alleged that some leaders were using SKM for narrow political gains. However, the front leaders clarified that they will not use the name of SKM in the political field. SKM to decide fate of groups on Jan 15Sanyukt Kisan Morcha will decide during its national meeting on January 15 whether 22 Punjab farm organisations and their leaders who have joined active politics and will take part in the upcoming assembly elections can remain part of the umbrella organisation that led the protests against the Centre’s three farm laws. “The SKM stands by its policy of not allowing any political party to use its banner or stage. Any attempt to use the name of SKM for elections will constitute a grave violation of Morcha discipline,” the morcha said in a statement issued by SKM coordination committee members Darshan Pal, Hannan Mollah, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, Yogendra Yadav, Yudhveer Singh, Shiv Kumar Sharma Kakka. Rajewal: New front to be alternative to traditional partiesOut of the 32 farmer groups, 22 farm groups joined hands to form the political front and claimed that three more farmer groups had assured support and would come on board soon after addressing certain issues as per their constitution. Rajewal, who is the face of the front, said, "after winning the farmer agitation, the aspirations of people have increased and they are putting pressure on us to contest elections and provide an alternative to traditional parties. Going by it, we have decided to form the political front.” Farmer leaders Harmeet Singh Kadian and Kulwant Singh Sandhu said, "Rajewal got many offers from different parties, but he rejected all these. But one we made an appeal, he could not ignore it." Rajewal said the front would be an alternative to traditional parties to change the face of Punjab and solve issues of the state. He termed reports of the morcha’s tie-up with AAP as premature. SKM leader Darshan Lal, who is against forming any political front said, "SKM was formed to fight against farm laws and did not allow any politician to share stage. The formation of the front will cause big confusion among the people and warned that if the name of SKM was used for political purposes, it will attract disciplinary action." Big groups stay offThe three farmer groups --BKU Ekta Ugrahan, BKU Ekta Sidhupur and BKU Ekta Dakaunda-- the biggest farm organisations in Punjab -- have not supported the front. BKU Ekta Ugrahan and BKU Ekta Sidhupur have clearly stated that they will not support any political activity while BKU Ekta Dakaunda has decided to debate the issue in its state committee meeting at Barnala on December 27. However, they have decided not to oppose the front . BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, “We have nothing to do with any political activity by farmers. We feel farmers have a lot more to fight for and will continue doing so. We will never be part of the front but will not stop activists from voting for anyone.” BKU Ekta Sidhupur president Jagjit Singh Dallewal said “the organisation will not field any candidate neither will it support any political party or any individual”. BKU Ekta Dakaunda general secretary Jagmohan Singh said that we are not part of the formation of the front .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/22-farmer-groups-float-political-front-in-punjab/articleshow/88499420.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram to get its first material recovery & composting facility at Badshapur||GURUGRAM: Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and waste management firm Ecogreen have started converting a dumping ground in Badshapur into a material recovery and composting facility, with the capacity to process 200 tonnes of waste every day. It will be the first such facility in the city, according to MCG, for the recovery, segregation and recycling of plastics, glass bottles, metals, paper, etc., and the municipality expects it to reduce the load on the Bandhwari landfill site. The facility is coming up on three acres of land in Badshapur; one acre is for the material recovery facility (MRF), one acre is for compost and recovered material storage, and half an acre is for the accommodation of the staff. It, according to MCG, would cater to the waste collected from the new sectors and areas such as Maruti Kunj. Initially, it will be a manual facility processing 100 tonnes of waste per day, with waste pickers deployed to extract and segregate waste material and the wet material composted at the site. As many as 35 pits are at the site to process the wet waste. Each can accommodate 20 tonnes of waste, according to MCG. There is space for more pits for later. “We are starting with processing 100 tonnes of waste and will gradually increase the capacity to 200 tonnes per day. A weighing scale will get installed at the site to assess the quantity of the waste. Only 20% of the waste from the MRF, which would be inert, would go to the landfill site," Ecogreen general manager (operations) Suvendu Samantaray said. "The facility will be ready in the first week of January. We have also requested MCG to issue guidelines to the condominiums or bulk waste generators in Zone 4 to deposit their wet waste to this facility if they do not have a composting facility inside their premises. We will compost the wet waste, following all guidelines,” he added. The Badshapur MRF, according to MCG, is the first step towards the goal of zero waste in Gurugram through a decentralised waste management system. “It will have provisions for dry waste segregation into eight categories and the composting of wet waste. More MRFs will become operational in the coming months and further improve the capacity of this decentralised waste management system," said MCG additional commissioner Dr Vaishali Sharma. The municipality claimed to have handed over the land for MRFs at three other sites to Ecogreen, and work will begin there soon. “The idea is to reduce the burden on the (Bandhwari) landfill site and process waste effectively. The MCG staff will monitor the weighing scale at the MRFs to evaluate the quantity of waste coming in and going out after processing,” said an MCG official. Meanwhile, a waste-to-energy plant is currently under construction at the Bandhwari landfill site. The project has a deadline of December 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/city-to-get-its-first-material-recovery-composting-facility-at-badshapur/articleshow/88497687.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: You may soon be able to book parking slot on app||GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is exploring a project for developing a sensor-based parking management and guidance system in Sector 44 by 2023. The area houses multiple universities, hotels, markets, and offices and sees a high footfall. Both underground and surface parking spaces, under the new system, will connect with the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) of the authority, according to GMDA. The same will get reflected on the My Gurugram application so that people can reserve parking slots and make payments through credit cards or FASTag. The authority was earlier exploring the possibility of such a facility at Udyog Vihar, Sadar Bazar, or Rajiv Chowk. However, officials updated the location in September after discovering that Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) were already developing multi-level parking facilities at Udyog Vihar and Sadar Bazar, respectively. Meanwhile, GMDA does not own the land at Rajiv Chowk. “We are now exploring the possibility of developing sensor-based parking in Sector 44 and preparing a detailed plan for the purpose. It will be a specialised sort of parking where you can book a slot in advance on a mobile application, park your vehicle, and make the payment. We will be roping in existing parking spaces and reflecting their details in the application,” said a senior GMDA official who did not want to be named. "This (sensor-based parking) concept is not present in Gurugram and Manesar, as of now. Private people have parking of this kind at some locations, but most are underground parking only. Once this project gets executed at one location, we will be able to understand what the issues are, and then, we can expand to other areas,” added the official. The project got discussed at a meeting of the Core Planning Cell (CPC) earlier this week, where the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of GMDA, Sudhir Rajpal, directed officials to examine the “feasibility" for the parking project on “priority” for the area where it is most needed. “There is a process we have to follow, even after the location gets finalised, which will involve steps such as floating tenders or calling for expressions of interest. Other constraints such as the coronavirus may complicate timelines. However, we expect to ensure that the project gets done properly. It will take at least a year to start this system at any location,” said the GMDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gmda-considers-sensor-based-parking-facility-in-sec-44/articleshow/88497694.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||World||Taliban govt scraps Afghan election commission||KABUL: The Taliban have dissolved Afghanistan's election commission, a panel that supervised polls during the previous Western-backed administration, a spokesman for the Islamist government said on Saturday. "There is no need for these commissions to exist and operate," Taliban government spokesman Bilal Karimi said, referring to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and the Independent Electoral Complaints Commission. "If we ever feel a need, the Islamic Emirate will revive these commissions." The Taliban swept to power in August as a Western-backed government imploded in the final stages of a US military withdrawal. Established in 2006, the IEC was mandated to administer and supervise all types of elections, including presidential, according to the commission's website. "They have taken this decision in a hurry and dissolving the commission would have huge consequences," Aurangzeb, who headed the panel up until the fall of the previous regime, told AFP. "If this structure does not exist, I'm 100 percent sure that Afghanistan's problems will never be solved as there won't be any elections," said Aurangzeb, who like many Afghans goes by only one name. Halim Fidai, a senior politician in the previous regime, said the decision to dissolve the electoral commission shows the Taliban "do not believe in democracy". "They are against all democratic institutions. They get power through bullets and not ballots," said Fidai, who was governor of four provinces over the past two decades. Before the Taliban takeover, several electoral commission officials were killed by extremist groups. Karimi said the authorities had also dissolved two government departments this week -- the ministry of peace, and the ministry of parliamentary affairs. The deeply conservative Taliban had already shut down the former administration's ministry of women's affairs and replaced it with the ministry for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice. That ministry earned notoriety during the Taliban's first stint in power in the 1990s for harshly enforcing religious doctrine. The Islamists are pressing the international community to restore billions of dollars in suspended aid and have pledged a more moderate rule this time around.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-govt-scraps-afghan-election-commission/articleshow/88499454.cms||---

One of the cycles was still under the wheels of the car,” said Singh. Kumar, who died in the accident, was a tenant of Singh. “With the help of other people who had gathered around the accident spot, we took the four to hospital. Shailender was declared dead on arrival,” he added.

---||Gurgaon||Inspired by farmers, Anganwadi workers launch protests across Haryana||GURUGRAM: Anganwadi workers and helpers have launched protests in nearly all of the 22 districts in Haryana, demanding higher wages and recognition as government workers. On Friday, the protesters gheraoed the office of BJP MLA Sudhir Singla, urging the state government to meet their long-pending demands. In Nuh, protests have been ongoing outside the Mini Secretariat for nearly 20 days. Similar scenes have erupted in Rohtak, Rewari, Jind, among other districts. Drawing inspiration from the protesting farmers, the protesters have vowed to continue their agitation. “The farmers have inspired us to fight for our rights. We are not going to leave the protest site till our demands get fulfilled,” said Bhula Devi, the Anganwadi workers and helpers association president from Jind. Speaking about the reasons behind the collective protest, Anganwadi workers said that the promises made by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar are yet to materialise on the ground. Chota Bhalawat, the state chairman of the Anganwadi workers and helpers union, said that in March 2018, the Khattar government had conceded to their demands. “The workers were promised recognition like other workers in the state. But this promise has not been fulfilled,” he said. Then in September 2018, Bhalawat added, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised the Aganwadi workers a hike in wages, but that did not materialise either. "Anganwadi workers got promised a hike of Rs 1,500 and helpers Rs 750, but that did not happen,” he added. Protesting workers stressed the importance of recognition as government workers and getting all the benefits that came with it. “Anganwadi workers put their lives into their work, but during retirement, we do not even get the benefits. All the workers are already poor,” said Sabita, a union member. Those, who have been at the forefront of the Covid crisis, said that they were deeply affected by the apathetic attitude of the state government and would not end their protest any time soon. “We are not working now. We sit on 'dharna' every day and will keep doing that till our demands get heard. We will show what women power is this time,” said Bhula Devi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/inspired-by-farmers-anganwadi-workers-launch-protests-across-state/articleshow/88497710.cms||Sagrika Kissu

The court also made it clear that a Muslim girl on attaining puberty is at liberty to marry anyone she likes and the guardian has no right to interfere if the match is equal. “The law is clear that the marriage of a Muslim girl is governed by the Muslim Personal Law. As per Article 195 from the book, ‘Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla’, Petitioner No.1 (girl) being 17 years of age, is competent to enter into a contract of marriage with a person of her choice. Petitioner No. 2 (her partner) is stated to be about 33 years old. Thus, Petitioner No. 1 is of marriageable age as envisaged by Muslim Personal Law,” observed Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill. Couple apprehends danger at the hands of family Directing the Malerkotla SSP to protect the couple, Justice Gill observed, “The court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the apprehension of the petitioners needs to be addressed. Because the petitioners have got married against the wishes of their family members, they cannot possibly be deprived of the fundamental rights as envisaged in the Constitution.” The HC passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by a couple from Punjab seeking directions to protect their life and liberty. The high court was informed that the girl, though a minor, and the man, who was 33-years old, had got married against the wishes of the girl’s family members. They apprehend danger at the hands of the family and placed photographs, evidencing their marriage, on record. A representation dated December 16, 2021, was submitted to the Malerkotla SSP for redressal of their grievance. The court was informed that it is the first marriage of both the petitioners. The counsel for the petitioner Jaspreet Singh Benipal contended that in Muslim law puberty and majority are one and the same and that there is a presumption that a person attains majority at the age of 15 years. The counsel also contended that a Muslim boy or Muslim girl who attains puberty is at liberty to marry anyone he or she likes and their guardian has no right to interfere. The marriage of a Muslim girl is governed by the personal law of Muslims, he added and said that Article 195 from the book ‘Principles of Mohammedan Law by Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla’ has also been reproduced in the said decision. The article defines capacity for marriage - Every Mahomedan of sound mind, who has attained puberty, may enter into a contract of marriage, the court was informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/protect-minor-muslim-girl-who-married-hindu-punjab-and-haryanahc/articleshow/88499585.cms||Ajay Sura

According to the traffic police, they are continuously conducting enforcement drives against noise pollution. "Our teams have been equipped with two decibel meters. They will patrol various areas, especially where the parties and events are generally conducted. We are conducting enforcement drives as per the directions of the National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court," Ganesh Prasad Saha, GB Nagar deputy commissioner of police (traffic) said. He added that action will be immediately taken against violators. Officers said noise levels of up to 55 decibels are permissible during the day in residential areas, while noise up to 45 decibels is allowed at night. The permitted sound limit in commercial areas is 65 decibels during the day and 55 decibels at night. In sensitive areas like hospitals, the allowed noise level is 50 decibels during the day and 40 decibels at night. "We will be keeping a close watch on people organising parties on New Year's Eve and playing loud music. Although there is no specific penalty for playing loud music, violations of noise pollution norms draw a fine of up to Rs 10,000. The state government has also announced a night curfew from 11pm to 5am from Saturday onwards. People are requested not to party, and if they do, not to disturb the general public," the officer said. The night curfew has been imposed amid concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Meanwhile, the district administration has also decided to extend the imposition of Section 144 of CrPC. The order will remain in force from December 25 to January 31, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-mind-the-music-at-new-year-party-you-might-be-slapped-with-rs-10000-fine/articleshow/88499699.cms||Advitya Bahl
---||Itanagar||Arunachal Pradesh's year of infrastructure push and China face-off||ITANAGAR: The Arunachal Pradesh government threw much of its weight behind reinvigorating infrastructure and envisioning climate-resilient development in 2021, a year in which the frontier state also made headlines for alleged Chinese intrusion into its territory. The state government has taken up a comprehensive project to build infrastructure in villages in borderlands to put a check on migration from the remote ice-clad areas. It has already submitted a Rs 4,000-crore proposal to the Union home ministry as part of the plan. "The proposal has been already cleared by the ministry and it will now be placed before the Union Cabinet. Once cleared, border areas can be developed with all amenities so that migration can be stopped," CM Pema Khandu said in a recent interview to PTI. The project aims at building roads, health centres and educational institutions, besides electrifying villages, improving mobile connectivity and water supply. Arunachal's endeavour to establish all-weather connectivity got a shot in the arm in February, with the Centre approving road construction projects of 598 km at an estimated cost of Rs 1,100 crore. During the year, the ministry, as part of its Indo-China Border Roads (ICBR) project, also awarded six road stretches in Arunachal Pradesh to the National Highways Infrastructure Development Corporation on a nomination basis, entailing an expenditure of around Rs 5,000 crore. The state government signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) with North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO) for setting up a 90-MW project in Tawang and another 120-MW plant in West Kameng. The northeastern state was in the news for the wrong reasons, too, as Indian and Chinese troops engaged in a brief face-off near Yangtse in the Tawang sector in October. The incident had taken place after a Chinese patrol reportedly tried to enter Indian territory but the troops of the People's Liberation Army were forced back. The issue was eventually resolved following a dialogue between local commanders of the two sides in accordance with established protocols. Talk of alleged Chinese encroachment also gained momentum with media reports of China constructing a second village (cluster of at least 60 buildings) in the state, approximately six km within India. The new enclave could be seen in images accessed by a national television channel from two major satellite imagery providers: Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs, and its exact location was indicated on Bharatmaps, a Government of India online map service. However, Khandu denied such reports, and said the constructions were within the Chinese territory. "There is no such development as reported by the Army, paramilitary forces and local residents. Whatever construction has happened is within the Tibet-China territory," the CM added.

Eighty-one per cent of these complaints, according to data, were received during the festive and wedding season with the highest number of calls received in November. According to officials, most of the complaints were tended to by local police or police response vehicles (PRVs) and were related to playing loud music at night. Several complaints were also received from high-rise societies against residents making noise during non-permissible hours. Of the total 3,052 calls, 598 were received in November, followed by February (503), December (458), October (381), March (306), January (232), April (128), September (106), July (101), August (85), June (81) and May (73). "An analysis of the data showed that most of the call made in November against people bursting firecrackers on Diwali (November 4). In December, February and March, most complaints were related to celebrations during festivals and weddings," a police officer said. Between January and November, the district traffic police have issued 2,689 challans for noise pollution. Sunita Bhadana, a housewife and resident of Supertech Ecovillage 1, said, "Students and bachelors living do not understand that there are aged and sick people living in the neighbourhood. Playing loud music late into the night disturb them. So far, police action has been swift." Recently, there have been complaints against disc jockeys playing loud music at wedding and banquet halls located in the vicinity of residential societies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-cops-got-over-3000-noise-complaints-this-year-most-in-november/articleshow/88499862.cms||Advitya Bahl
---||India||Give up PSOs, it’s a Cong culture, Himanta tells Assam BJP functionaries||GUWAHATI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma has asked all state BJP leaders to give up their personal security officers (PSOs), saying that having personal security is a culture of Congress and not BJP’s. Attending a function marking former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birthday here on Saturday, Sarma said, “Why do we need PSOs? Who will assassinate us? I have often been searching for answers to these questions and I find PSO culture is Congress culture.” The PSOs are drawn from Assam Police ranks and attached to key ministers besides key BJP leaders and political appointees in numerous state government corporations and boards. The practice of having PSOs came into prominence in the 90s amid rise of activities by Ulfa and other militant outfits but when militancy started fading, the PSO practice continued, often used by many more as a status symbol than a necessity. Sarma’s security cover is of different types based on threat perceptions assessed by the MHA. He is currently under Z category security cover provided by CRPF unlike his predecessor Sarbananda Sonowal who also had Z category cover but from the NSG. Urging the party leaders to discard this culture of Congress, Sarma said by doing so, it would make BJP members different from others “just the way Vajpayee ji wanted us to be different.” “I can guarantee that there is no life threat to any BJP member. No one will kill us because we have not done anything bad,” Sarma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/give-up-psos-its-a-cong-culture-himanta-tells-assam-bjp-functionaries/articleshow/88499799.cms||Prabin Kalita

At least four patients in Ghaziabad, health officials said, were students. The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday decided to impose a night curfew across the state from December 25 to January 31, 2022, amid rising cases of the Omicron variant of Covid. On December 1, the GB Nagar administration had imposed restrictions under Section 144 over fears of the spread of Covid during the festival season to curb the number of cases. On Saturday, the total number of active cases in the district touched 54, while there were 40 such cases in neighbouring Ghaziabad. "A 14-year-old student from Indirapuram is among new Covid patients. The others include a 29-year-old Vijay Nagar resident and two others from Raj Nagar," said an official from the health department. Besides the 14-year-old student, two others had not taken a single dose of the vaccine, the official said. According to the health officials, symptoms exhibited by all the patients reported on Saturday were of mild nature. "They are all in home isolation while samples have been sent for genomic sequencing," said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/ghaziabad-sees-nine-new-covid-19-cases-four-of-them-are-students/articleshow/88499921.cms||---

In case of non-compliance with the orders of this court, it is time and again made clear that fine will be secondary and imprisonment will be primary, the court added. The bench made the observations in view of delay by the authorities in deciding applications and appeals moved under the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act. The issue pertains to a plea moved by a Chennai-based scrap merchant challenging a demolition notice issued by the Greater Chennai Corporation. Counsel for the civic body Raja Srinivas contended that the petitioner had encroached on government land. The judges said, “Of late, it is reported that several IAS officers are not complying with the orders of this court, in spite of specific orders issued every now and then, fixing the outer time limit for disposal of the matters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/strip-ias-babus-who-dont-follow-court-orders-of-their-cadre-madras-high-court/articleshow/88499927.cms||Suresh Kumar

The Centre will subsequently send those names to different states to include them in the list of PDS beneficiaries. “Currently, this section of people who direly deserve this highly subsidised foodgrain are unable to get them because they don’t have ration cards and their ration cards cannot be made as they don’t have proof of residence. Making ration cards is a very difficult process and it’s impossible for these most vulnerable sections to get them despite the fact that they should be the first ones to get this entitlement,” said Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey. Participating in a discussion held as a part of the Good Governance Week, Pandey said his ministry has asked the NIC to come up with a “national portal” to collect data of such vulnerable and most deserving people. “The NGOs can help them to register on the portal. We will then ask the states concerned to include them in the beneficiaries list,” he added. Pandey told TOI that the work on this has started and this will be a big step to take such benefits to the poorest of the poor. He added that once these people are included in the beneficiaries list, they can get subsidised foodgrain from a place of their choice as is the case with ration cards under the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ scheme. Sources said the identity of such beneficiaries can be verified by using biometric authentication with the help of point of sale (PoS) machines. During the pandemic-induced lockdown, the government had come up with the policy to supply 5kg free foodgrain to each person per month who did not have a ration card. But it was discontinued. Currently, the government provides free five kg additional foodgrain per person per month to nearly 81 crore identified beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act. They also continue to get the same quantity of rice, wheat and coarse grains at Rs 3, Rs 2 and Rs 1 per kg, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/portal-for-homeless-destitute-soon-to-avail-free-highly-subsidised-foodgrain/articleshow/88499920.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||Trickle-down misery: How Afghanistan's asset freeze hurts everyone||KABUL: Afghan businessman Shoaib Barak is struggling to pay his workers and suppliers, unable to access funds from a banking system crippled by the freezing of the nation's overseas assets. They, in turn, can't pay their bills -- and so the country's economic woes trickle down and hurt everyone along an unbroken chain of misery. "I feel very ashamed," said Barak, who until recently employed some 200 people across the country -- mostly in his construction business. "For me, for every Afghan, it's really disgusting. I do not even have the ability to pay salaries for my staff." To avoid giving the Taliban access to Afghanistan's reserves, Washington froze an estimated $10 billion held by the central bank abroad after the hardline Islamists seized power on August 15. Equating to around half what the country's economy produced last year, that move in turn starved banks used by Afghan businesses and citizens of access to dollars. Even if limited funds were released, the bulk could be tied up in the American legal system for years while subject to claims by victims of the September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda attacks on the US. Ordinarily, the reserves could be dipped into to pay overdue government bills and development projects, but the freeze has trickled down to the rest of the economy. "Just release the reserves," Barak pleaded. "If you have a problem with... the Taliban, don't take revenge on the nation, the people." Barak's cash flow crisis illustrates the problems faced by tens of thousands of Afghans who simply can't access most of their money. He says he has around $3 million tied up in Afghan banks -- money earned over the years from lucrative private and government contracts, which were paid in dollars as aid poured into the public purse under the pre-Taliban regime. But with local banks limiting weekly withdrawals to five percent of a business account's balance -- up to a maximum of $5,000 -- Barak is months behind on both invoices and salaries to his staff. Ahmad Zia is one of them. The 55-year-old engineer was earning 60,000 Afghanis per month -- equivalent to $770 before the Taliban took over and the currency plunged 25 percent. Four months later, Zia is struggling to make ends meet and fears his once comfortably-off family of six will only "eat one or two times" per day. It isn't just Barak's employees who are suffering. Ehsanullah Maroof's now-defunct law business relied heavily on a monthly retainer from Barak's construction company. "The kids went to a very good school," he told AFP, noting proudly that his nine-year-old daughter Rana topped her year. But now he can't afford the right medicine for an epileptic son, and Rana has been expelled because the family can't pay school fees. The misery trickles down even further -- to the Maroof family maid, who is now jobless. Gulha, 42, earned 8,000 Afghanis a month and was the main breadwinner in her seven-strong family. Now she is two months behind on rent and running out of food. "I have 14 kilogrammes (30 pounds) of rice, 20-21 kilogrammes of flour and some oil," she told AFP in a one-room apartment where she allows neighbours to share the nightly warmth of a wood-burner as winter descends. "It will last 10 days." Once that is gone she will join millions of her compatriots who are utterly dependent on aid. The United Nations Security Council on Wednesday unanimously adopted a US resolution to help humanitarian aid reach desperate Afghans while seeking to keep funds out of Taliban hands -- a move welcomed by the Islamists as a "good step". But whether enough cash arrives to contain the unfolding humanitarian disaster ultimately still depends on "the viability of the banking system", said Hanna Luchnikava-Schorsch, Principal Asia Pacific economist at IHS Markit. Many Afghan banks are "pretty close to collapse", she told AFP, and overseas institutions will probably be "terrified" of falling foul of sanctions despite the UN resolution. For many ordinary Afghans, any relief will come too late. International organisations warn one million Afghan children could die this winter, Barak notes. "Who do you think will be blamed -- the Taliban, or the US?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/trickle-down-misery-how-afghanistans-asset-freeze-hurts-everyone/articleshow/88500045.cms||---

RTPCR can be your passkey in Bhopal||BHOPAL: District administration has issued blanket orders restricting entry of people who have not been vaccinated with both doses at public places like cinema halls, multiplexes, theatres, gyms, sports facilities etc. Officials, however, have instructed that those who have received the first dose, but could not receive second dose as they are still not eligible for second dose, can show RTPCR received under 48 hours to avail entry in case of urgent needs. The order is likely to impact more than 2 lakh people who have been administered first dose but are yet to receive the second dose. So far, only 20.80 lakh people have been administered with the first dose of vaccine and remaining 18.75 lakh of these have been administered with the first dose. More than 45,000 first doses have been administered in past 30 days, making them ineligible for the second dose. District collector Avinash Lavaniya said, “Those who have received the first dose and could not receive the second dose because they are still not eligible for second dose, can visit multiplexes, markets, cinemas, or gyms with RT-PCR negative report that has been received in past 48 hours”. Sources said that the major problem will occur with those people who have recently turned 18, as they became eligible for the vaccination recently hence only the first dose could be administered to them. Apart from it, others those who have been suffering from severe illnesses could also be affected from the recent orders, apart from those who have casually ignored the vaccination for so long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-second-covid-jab-yet-rtpcr-can-be-your-passkey-in-bhopal/articleshow/88500033.cms||Amarjeet Singh

The city of 13 million, which entered its fourth day of lockdown, detected 155 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms for Saturday, up from 75 a day earlier, official data showed on Sunday. That drove the national daily count to 158, the highest since China managed to contain a nationwide outbreak in early 2020. Xian, with 485 local symptomatic cases reported for the Dec. 9-25 period, has imposed heavy-handed measures to rein in the outbreak, in line with Beijing's policy that any flare-up should be contained as soon as possible. Residents may not leave town without approval from employers or local authorities and multiple rounds of mass testing were conducted to identify cases. The city has announced no infections caused by the Omicron variant, although Chinese authorities have reported a handful of Omicron infections among international travellers and in southern China. Including imported cases, mainland China confirmed 206 new cases on Dec. 25, up from 140 a day earlier. No new deaths were reported, leaving the cumulative death toll at 4,636.

---||World||Hong Kong retailers forge new path without mainland Chinese tourists||HONG KONG: Three years of democracy protests followed by a pandemic have devastated Hong Kong retailers who had grown used to relying on cash from mainland Chinese tourists. In a city that once boasted some of the world's highest retail rents, the market has cratered. But a border town has seized the chance to evolve its local economy. Sheung Shui is the first town from the main overland border crossing and once thrived as a place where tax-free goods could be snapped up for resale back in mainland China -- a process known as parallel trading. "People's impression of Sheung Shui is of parallel traders and mainland China," said Eugene Chan, 22, who has lived in the neighbourhood since childhood. Chan recalled pavements swamped by people filling their luggage with cosmetics, baby formula or household supplies to meet huge demand across the border. But all that vanished in the wake of huge democracy rallies followed by pandemic-related border closures. In January 2019, just before the protests began, arrivals from the mainland reached an all time high of 5.5 million, a remarkable figure given Hong Kong's population is 7.5 million. Two years later that figure fell below 3,000. "That's a huge loss of demand," Simon Smith, senior director of research and consultancy at Savills, told AFP. "That wave of mainland spending, particularly focused on luxury, watches, jewellery, designer goods, it really propelled rents to world-beating levels." Hong Kong's popular shopping districts previously boasted "golden streets" where store rents were more expensive than those in New York City's Fifth Avenue. Now, Smith said, shop rents in prime locations have undergone a "substantial correction" and regressed to 2003 levels, down more than 75 percent from peak levels in 2013. Analysts have noted a rebalancing to more local consumption, with some prime location stores in shopping areas taken over by more budget-friendly businesses. At one large location in Hong Kong's Central district -- which commands some of the highest retail rents in the world -- luxury brand MCM was replaced last year by sporting goods chain Decathlon, which snapped up the storefront for HK$800,000 ($103,000) a month -- a 70 percent discount, according to local media reports. Similar rent falls have been documented in Causeway Bay, another once eye-wateringly expensive shopping district. In Sheung Shui, entrepreneurs like Dream Law have seized the opportunity to start businesses that cater more to locals -- in his case a grocery store. "During the boom of (mainland tourists), 80 to 90 percent of businesses in the Sheung Shui market area catered to parallel traders," Law told AFP. The inflated rents meant that community businesses -- such as hardware stores, bookstores and cinemas -- were priced out, he said. "It felt like this community did not belong to us, and it had been that way for years." The economic situation in border towns like Sheung Shui boiled over into protests starting from 2012 and was a major contributing factor to growing China-Hong Kong tensions over the past decade. When the pandemic struck, Law saw a silver lining in the rock-bottom rents and started BeWater Mart, which focuses on "made in Hong Kong" goods. His store, along with a cafe and a pottery studio nearby, represent a wave of nascent businesses trying to respond to local demand. "I hope Sheung Shui people can come back here to live and spend," Law said. Hong Kong, which has followed China's lead in adopting a strict zero-Covid policy, is now in negotiations to resume normal travel with the mainland in a limited capacity. Polls showed that many Hong Kongers are eager to cross the border for business, tourism and family reunions. The Hong Kong government's proposal of a daily quota, which is reported to be around 1,000, will not have a "significant impact" in boosting tourist spending back to pre-pandemic levels, Savills' Smith said. On the eve of a border reopening, it remains unclear whether Hong Kong's retail economy will return to its mainland-dependent model or chart a fresh path forward. Sheung Shui resident Chan said the border closure was just a "pause" and she was worried about parallel traders returning. But in the meantime, she would focus on enjoying the present. "I finally had one of my friends say they wanted to come visit Sheung Shui to try out a restaurant (...) it's a happy change," Chan said. "The atmosphere is not as stifling or hectic, and instead it feels like a small community. I think everyone is breathing easier."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/hong-kong-retailers-forge-new-path-without-mainland-chinese-tourists/articleshow/88500181.cms||---

It owes Rs 2,190 crore to the central power producing giants. They have not just been threatening to snap power supply, but one among them — the Damodar valley Corporation (DVC) — has already started rationing it in seven districts under its command area pushing them to long hours of blackout. The state has failed to add even a single kilowatt of power generation capacity in the last 21 years, though one of the functional units — the Patratu Thermal Power Station with an installed capacity of 840MW — was written off, and a central PSU, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), was entrusted to come up with a new plant called the Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited under a pact with the state government. According to the Central Electricity Authority’s records of installed capacity of states — Jharkhand has a total installed capacity of 4556.42MW as on November 30, 2021. Of this capacity, the lion’s share of 4250MW comes from thermal sources, while a small fragment of around 300MW comes from non-thermal sources comprising 130MW hydel plant of the state, 80MW hydro power of the Centre and 96.42MW of solar power. Depending largely upon thermal power—Jharkhand produces around 190-200MW of power from its only unit of Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited (TVNL), which has an installed capacity of 420MW. One of the units of TVNL has been lying defunct for years. In terms of installed capacity, the state gets 2000MW from the thermal power plants of the central sector and 1830MW from the private sector. The seven thermal power plants — Bokaro, Chandrapura and Koderma of the central PSUs, Tata, Seraikela and Maithon of the private sector and Lalpania of the state government — collectively are unable to fulfil the daily peak hour requirement of around 2100MW of the state. Officials in the energy department are unwilling to comment on the situation, saying that efforts were under way to increase the power generation in the state. According to the energy department — three big power generation units are coming up and they would largely solve the crisis. According to government records, the North Karanpura Thermal power plant of the NTPC in Tandwa block of Chatra district is all set to fire its first unit by March 31, 2022s. The 3X660MW capacity Ultra Mega Power Project is running behind schedule by around seven years. The joint venture of NTPC and Jharkhand Bidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL), PVUNL, proposed to be a 4000MW super critical thermal power plant was supposed to be functional by 2022. But even the first unit 3X800MWs is not likely to be fired before 2024. The private sector enterprise of Adani Power is setting up a 1600MW thermal power plant in Godda, but the power produced will be sent to Bangladesh, eventually not adding anything to the local requirement. Lawmakers from the state hold the Centre responsible for the crisis. Jharia MLA Purnima Niraj Singh believes that the central PSUs are harassing Jharkhand for political reasons. “During the previous BJP government, the outstanding dues of DVC had gone up to Rs 5,000 crore and still there was were no power cuts. But despite our government having made payment to the tune of Rs 800 crore, the Centre has directly deducted Rs 1428 crore from the state’s RBI account to realise the energy bills, yet DVC is rationing power,” she added. Singh blamed the political instability in the state for its failure to add even a single unit of power-producing capacity in the last 21 years. “We need to be self-reliant in terms of power, otherwise it would be difficult for the state to take up industrialisation,” she added. Activist Mithilesh Dangi, however, believes that coal mining and thermal plants were never for any good of the local people. “For producing one MW of thermal electricity, we burn 12 tonnes of coal and today the situation of Jharkhand is visible to everyone. We have mines in 11 districts and lakhs of displaced people because of mines, dams and the power plants. On the one hand, the state is reeling from power crisis. On the other hand, displaced locals are forced to breathe poisonous gases emanating from the thermal plants,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/despite-144-coal-mines-7-plants-power-crisis-turns-bad-to-worse-in-jharkhand/articleshow/88500208.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Despite 144 coal mines & 7 plants, power crisis turns bad to worse in Jharkhand||RANCHI: Despite the presence of more than 144 operational coal mines producing 130 million tonnes of the mineral, seven functional thermal power plants spewing tonnes of poisonous gases and a loss-making electricity supply licensee company, Jharkhand has been facing power crisis since its inception 21 years ago. It owes Rs 2,190 crore to the central power producing giants. They have not just been threatening to snap power supply, but one among them — the Damodar valley Corporation (DVC) — has already started rationing it in seven districts under its command area pushing them to long hours of blackout. The state has failed to add even a single kilowatt of power generation capacity in the last 21 years, though one of the functional units — the Patratu Thermal Power Station with an installed capacity of 840MW — was written off, and a central PSU, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), was entrusted to come up with a new plant called the Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited under a pact with the state government. According to the Central Electricity Authority’s records of installed capacity of states — Jharkhand has a total installed capacity of 4556.42MW as on November 30, 2021. Of this capacity, the lion’s share of 4250MW comes from thermal sources, while a small fragment of around 300MW comes from non-thermal sources comprising 130MW hydel plant of the state, 80MW hydro power of the Centre and 96.42MW of solar power. Depending largely upon thermal power—Jharkhand produces around 190-200MW of power from its only unit of Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited (TVNL), which has an installed capacity of 420MW. One of the units of TVNL has been lying defunct for years. In terms of installed capacity, the state gets 2000MW from the thermal power plants of the central sector and 1830MW from the private sector. The seven thermal power plants — Bokaro, Chandrapura and Koderma of the central PSUs, Tata, Seraikela and Maithon of the private sector and Lalpania of the state government — collectively are unable to fulfil the daily peak hour requirement of around 2100MW of the state. Officials in the energy department are unwilling to comment on the situation, saying that efforts were under way to increase the power generation in the state. According to the energy department — three big power generation units are coming up and they would largely solve the crisis. According to government records, the North Karanpura Thermal power plant of the NTPC in Tandwa block of Chatra district is all set to fire its first unit by March 31, 2022s. The 3X660MW capacity Ultra Mega Power Project is running behind schedule by around seven years. The joint venture of NTPC and Jharkhand Bidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL), PVUNL, proposed to be a 4000MW super critical thermal power plant was supposed to be functional by 2022. But even the first unit 3X800MWs is not likely to be fired before 2024. The private sector enterprise of Adani Power is setting up a 1600MW thermal power plant in Godda, but the power produced will be sent to Bangladesh, eventually not adding anything to the local requirement. Lawmakers from the state hold the Centre responsible for the crisis. Jharia MLA Purnima Niraj Singh believes that the central PSUs are harassing Jharkhand for political reasons. “During the previous BJP government, the outstanding dues of DVC had gone up to Rs 5,000 crore and still there was were no power cuts. But despite our government having made payment to the tune of Rs 800 crore, the Centre has directly deducted Rs 1428 crore from the state’s RBI account to realise the energy bills, yet DVC is rationing power,” she added.

Also, diamond-bearing kimberlites and lamproites have also been discovered in Mahbubnagar district at the confluence of Bhima river with the Krishna, and in Gadwal district, at the confluence of Tungabhadra river with the Krishna. Incidentally, Krishna river has contributed some of the best diamonds ever mined in the world, including the famed Kohinoor. Lamproite is an ultrapotassic mantle-derived volcanic or sub-volcanic rock. Read AlsoAndhra Pradesh on gem of mission: To launch hunt for diamondsNearly three centuries after some of the world’s most famous diamonds including the Kohinoor were discovered in the Krishna river basin, the AP government is now set to launch a massive search for gemstones. To begin with, the state government has focused on Upparapalle, a nondescript village inThough no diamonds were mined in Golconda, diamonds mined in the south Indian diamond province (SIDP) are historically referred to as ‘Golconda diamonds’, as the kingdom had famous mines. If these hidden diamond treasures are to be mined successfully, the nomenclature ‘Golconda diamonds’ will become a reality, researchers say. Diamond pockets seen in NalgondaResearchers from OU, Geological Survey of India, and other institutions carried out studies in Rangareddy, Nalgonda, Mahbubnagar and other districts. Professor G Ramadass, former head of department of geophysics, OU, said there are no diamonds in Rangareddy. However, they are seen in Nalgonda, particularly where Musi meets Krishna river. Ramadass said he focused on Musi downstream of Hyderabad and up to Vadapalli where confluence with Krishna happens. “The points of confluence of Tungabhadra, Bhima and Musi rivers with Krishna have diamond-bearing pockets. They are deep in the earth,” Ramadass told STOI. SIDP runs through Telugu states. It includes Deccan kimberlite fields, Wajrakarur kimberlite field, Narayanpet kimberlite field in Mahabubnagar district extending to Gulbarga in Karnataka, and Raichur kimberlite field covering Mahbubnagar and Raichur, Karnataka. Ramadass said his team studied Amangal in Rangareddy after a farmer claimed he discovered diamond. “Our research has shown no diamond zones in Amangal,” he said. A recent research paper by Ramadass showed presence of diamonds in Kalwakurthy mandal. “The area has dykes and fault contact environments indicating presence of diamonds,” he said. Earlier, researchers found potential zones at Ramannapeta-Ustapalli lamproite body in Miryalaguda of Krishna basin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-confluence-of-musi-krishna-may-throw-up-diamonds-says-study/articleshow/88500184.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Guwahati||Amid Omicron threat, Assam gets revised curfew timings||GUWAHATI: Assam on Saturday revised the present Covid-19 containment guidelines in view of the emergence of the Omicron variant. Night curfew will continue, but with a revised time and a fine Rs 1,000 has been imposed for not wearing masks or spitting in public. The new curfew time will be 11.30 pm to 6 am instead of the current schedule of 11 pm to 5 am and will come into force from Sunday though it will not be applicable for the night of December 31 to allow people to welcome the New Year. All business establishments, offices and restaurants will get half an hour extra time to keep their shutters up till 10.30 pm instead of the current closure time of 10 pm. The revised guidelines do not impose any fresh restrictions on educational institutions, which re-opened in a graded manner in October. The state executive committee of the state disaster management authority, headed by chief secretary Jishnu Barua, after reviewing the status of Covid-19, has noted that "though the overall number of Covid-19 patients and the positivity rate have declined considerably and the overall situation has improved, strict vigil needs to be maintained so that adequate standards of Covid Appropriate Behaviour continues to be followed with the emergence of the new variant of concern, B.1.1.529, named Omicron". The daily Covid positivity rate in the state was 0.33% on Friday, with 93 new cases detected the same day. There were 859 active cases in the state. Speaking to the media, state health minister, Keshab Mahanta, said hospitals in the state are ready to fight Omicron, though no Covid case with the new variant has been detected yet. "International travellers are being kept in quarantine for seven days even after testing Covid negative at airports on arrival. We have taken the Omicron threat very seriously as it spreads very fast," said Mahanta. He added that they have been directed to levy a fine on those not wearing a mask. Mahanta said all hospitals have been instructed to ready the pending infrastructure development work within a week and lists of doctors are being readied to tackle any emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/amid-omicron-threat-assam-gets-revised-curfew-timings/articleshow/88500249.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Mumbai||High traffic fines will be an effective deterrent, says Maha traffic police chief||The Maharashtra government finally implemented the Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act with hiked compounding fines earlier this month. Will it ultimately translate into safer streets? Additional Director General of Police (State Traffic) Bhushan Kumar Upadhyaya talks to Nitasha Natu on the department’s goal to reduce fatalities through strict enforcement of rules and how pedestrian-friendly infrastructure is equally crucial to saving lives. Q: What has been the response from motorists to hiked fines?A: Nobody likes to pay high fines. We are sure that hiked penalties will have a strong deterrent effect. Initially, there may be some resistance from motorists. Our personnel from units across the state have been interacting with motorists one-on-one to create awareness on how flouting traffic rules will cost them dearly. Q: Maharashtra is among the top five states holding the dubious distinction of high crash-related fatalities. What is being done by the department to prevent deaths?A: If you look at annual data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2018 onwards, you would notice that deaths are reducing every year. Yet, we are reporting about 11,000 to 12,000 fatalities every year in road crashes which is a cause of concern. As part of our initiative 'Mrityunjay Jeevandoot', we have trained first respondents to accidents on basic first-aid and using stretchers to rush accident victims to hospitals. We have formed about a thousand groups of volunteers and our training has helped them save some 200 lives. The initiative has helped us build a bond with the public. Q: Drunk driving resulted in multiple crashes and loss of lives in Mumbai recently. With the festive season and New Year's Eve around the corner, what are the department's plans to tackle such cases?A: The pandemic has made it risky to use breath analysers and our personnel haven't been using them since last year. But this does not mean that there will be no checks this year-end. Nakabandis will be put up and action will be taken under the Amendment Act which gives courts the power to impose fines as high as Rs 10,000. We will send suspects to the hospital for a blood-alcohol test in the absence of breath analysers. Q. What will be your focus for the Road Safety Fortnight which falls in January?A: We have made a checklist of serious traffic offences that have a direct impact on the lives of road users, such as speeding, wrong side driving, signal jumping, or speaking on the phone while driving. Our strategy now is to crack the whip on such offences and not so much on others. The most at-risk road users are motorcyclists and pedestrians. Having wide footpaths with no encroachments will ensure pedestrians don’t have to walk on the carriageway and risk their life. Other stakeholders need to work in coordination for creating pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Q: Recovery of e-challans has been a major issue with pending dues running into several crores. How is the issue being tackled?A: Lok Adalats have helped recover pending dues up to Rs 70 crore in a month. The response has been better than any campaign that we have carried out so far for the recovery of fines. We will continue tying up with them in the future. Q: Is the department getting any new equipment or investing in technology towards road safety?A: We have asked for 86 interceptor vehicles that can be stationed on highways for capturing details of vehicles that violate speed limits. Challans will automatically be generated. Mumbai-Pune Expressway already has such interceptor vehicles. We are also trying to secure funding for getting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones for aerial surveillance of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/high-traffic-fines-will-be-an-effective-deterrent-says-maha-traffic-police-chief/articleshow/88500316.cms||Nitasha Natu

A private agency has been picked to deploy its men, who will crack the whip on violators of Covid safety norms, besides aspects like open defecation, spitting at public places and sale of banned plastic bags. The clean-up marshals will be deployed in the next few days. PCMC ward level officials had failed to crack down on violators, so far. The civic administration is in the process of issuing the work order, to enable deployment of clean-up marshals in the next few days. The agency will get 31% share of the fine amount collected, while PCMC will get 69%. Failure on the part of ward-level vigilance teams to keep a check on violators has prompted the corporation to appoint an agency for crack down. According to officials, the activities of clean up marshals will be monitored by civic nodal officers. The move comes after several complaints of Covid norms violation, spitting, urinating in the open and open defecation. Violators will be fined Rs 150 for throwing trash, Rs 100 for urinating in public places, Rs 500 for open defecation and Rs 100 for spitting. For sale of banned plastic, the fine amount will be Rs 5,000 for first time violators. For not segregating the waste the fine will be Rs 50 for the first time. Not using the face mask will invite a Rs 200 fine. “The work order will have fine details and the number of clean up marshals, area of deployment etc,” said PCMC Deputy Commissioner Vitthal Dake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/clean-up-marshals-to-be-deployed-in-panvel-city/articleshow/88500378.cms||B B Nayak
---||World||Australia's New South Wales sets new daily Covid case record||SYDNEY: Australia's most populous state reported a record number of new Covid-19 cases on Sunday and a sharp jump in hospitalizations while thousands of people were isolating at home after contracting the virus or coming into contact with someone who has. New South Wales reported 6,394 new infections, up from 6,288 a day earlier. Case numbers in the state have surged over the past two weeks but hospitalizations have lagged behind new infections. More than 70 percent of cases in some Australian states are the omicron variant of the coronavirus but New South Wales does not routinely carry out genome testing to identify the variant. State Health Minister Brad Hazzard indicated Sunday that omicron is widespread. “We would expect that pretty well everybody in New South Wales at some point will get omicron,” Hazzard said. “If we're all going to get omicron, the best way to face it is when we have full vaccinations including our booster.” Health officials reported 458 active cases in hospitals across the state, up sharply from 388 the day before. There were 52 people in intensive care in New South Wales. Victoria, the country's second most populous state, reported 1,608 new Covid-19 cases and two deaths on Sunday, with 374 people in hospitals, including 77 in intensive care. More than 30,000 people in Victoria spent Christmas isolating at home, unable to celebrate with family or friends. Of those, about half were reported to be active cases who contracted the virus in the days leading up to Christmas. Doctors and pharmacists in New South Wales have said they are running short of vaccine doses amid a rush for shots spurred by concern over the omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australias-new-south-wales-sets-new-daily-covid-case-record/articleshow/88500427.cms||---

According to Ratnu, she received a call from a woman who identified herself as a representative of a well-known health and wellness brand on Thursday. The caller said that she was a member of the sales and marketing team and she had a good offer for Ratnu. Ratnu said that the caller, who identified herself as Twinkle, handed over the phone to her 'team leader' Abhay Yadav. Yadav then told Ratnu that she has been chosen for the reward for being a regular customer of the company. Yadav told the complainant to choose from AC, refrigerator, mobile phone, television and laptop as gifts. Yadav said that 50% of the amount spent on buying products will be reimbursed by the company immediately. The duo then asked her to provide the details of the purchases the complainant had made on the website. She gave them the details of the purchases after which she received a link and when she opened the link she got another domain name. She then stopped selecting other gifts. Soon, she received a message for a transaction of Rs 54,907 from her bank and the money was deposited in the account of the company. Ratnu then called Twinkle who assured her that the amount deducted will be refunded in three hours. When she didn't receive any refund, she once again tried to contact Twinkle but this time she found the number switched off. Later, she contacted the bank and got to know that Rs 1.97 lakh in several transactions has been paid to the company.

---||Kochi||These Malayalis make Christmas clean and green||nGreen is the way to celebrate festivals in these days of climate emergency, but not everyone takes the effort for it. However, these Malayalis found ways to make Christmas eco-friendly and also help others do the same. Wonder how they make merry without hurting nature? Read on! A star with coir!Muhamma in Alappuzha district is known for coir making and a handful of youngsters there, belonging to St George Church's Yuvadeepthi group, made an eco-friendly star that suits the spirit of their place. Made of 40 kg coir, the star is 22 feet tall and was made in about 10 days. Binu K Joseph, who was part of the group, tells us, "We decided to make an eco-friendly star revering Pope Francis's message to lead an eco-friendly life. The star also houses our church's crib in the middle." The team will be giving away the coir for erosion control efforts, after the Christmas season. Techie-turned-décor makerPriya Ann Varghese has been making Christmas decors for long, but this year, she decided to make her collection as eco-friendly as possible. The former techie’s online profile @annzcreations, filled with the green tree ornaments, berries, pine cones and more is quite popular among Kerala’s young nature lovers too. “Sourcing the raw materials for green decors isn’t easy in Kerala. But, today’s environmentally-aware youngsters are seriously into recycling and eco-friendly decors, so I wanted to cater to them. The products, made of raw materials like bamboo, also last for a long time,” says Priya. Stars and santas, with screw pine!Who knew the humble screw pine could be transformed to Christmas decors! Women artisans of Kottappuram Integrated Development Society (KIDS) in Thrissur have been putting together some eco-friendly, novel decorations ranging from hangings, santas, bells, boots to cake trays and hampers with screw pine, this year. Deepa John, who coordinates it, says, “The response to these green decors have been quite encouraging and we hope more people turn eco-friendly in the future.” Decors from upcycled fabricsThe mulit-coloured tailoring discards often make us wonder whether they can be transformed into something beautiful, isn’t it? Well, a group of women in Thrissur did it, this Christmas season. Under their team named Kadambari Trust, they made different varieties of stars, bells, trees and balls. Rajashree V, who helms the group, says, “We had tried to do it last year too, but due to lockdown it couldn’t be really popularised. This year, we started in October itself and by November, we could make people aware. People from cities responded quite a bit. A handful of schools even asked us to train their students.” A traditional cribUma Lekshmi, who works in a UN project in Thiruvananthapuram, made a traditional, eco-friendly crib at her paying guest facility in the capital. The cute crib, complete with age-old, muddy statues handed down generations, wooden frames, chart paper ceiling, cotton snow and more, which she made with her landlord Mo has been getting widely shared online. Uma says, “I have used hay as the base of the crib and as many natural items as possible to keep the crib, green. I recently understood the magnitude of our plastic footprint and so, wanted to do my bit to reduce it. It was great to see that quite a few people were influenced by my crib’s photo to go green this Christmas.” Trees and decors with newspapersThe staff of the hotel group CGH Earth in Kochi recently came together to create trees, wreaths and other decorations with old newspapers, recycled plastic, coir and packaging materials. Jose Dominic, co-founder, says, "It was our staff who put together these decorations, with their innovative ideas. These decors aim to encourage and inspire others to celebrate responsibly and creatively."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/these-malayalis-make-christmas-clean-and-green/articleshow/88469454.cms||Deepa Soman

Some old friends, who played cricket with him, however, were taken aback after his name cropped up in the blast, and said that he was depressed after losing his job. Gagandeep, 30, who had been dismissed from police force, lived with his family in Professor colony on Lalheri road here. He died in a bomb blast in Ludhiana courts complex and it is believed that he was allegedly trying to plant the bomb when it went off. His family included his wife, an elderly father Amarjit Singh, 7-year-old daughter and younger brother Rinku. A resident of the area, asking not to be named, said that he had played cricket with Gagandeep in his teen years and knew him as a quiet person who would not speak much. He said he was surprised to know about the death of Gagandeep in the blast. “If he has committed such a heinous crime, he deserved to meet such an end as trying to kill innocent persons through bombs is a sin,” he said. Another friend from Lalheri road area, who was his classmate, recalls Gagandeep as a gentle person, who could not harm anyone during his school days. He said after being dismissed from police service in a drugs case, he was very upset and was apprehensive whether he will get any work or not. “That frustration may have driven him to the dark world. But I think that he changed after he went to jail as there he may have come in contact with anti-social persons,” he added. Meanwhile, some residents of street number 13 in Guru Tegh Bahadur Nagar where Gagandeep lived before shifting to a new house in Professor Colony alleged it was an open secret that he was into smuggling of drugs and liquor. Gurdev Singh, a former bank manager, who lived in the same street, alleged that after he raised objections against the sale of liquor and drugs in the street, Gagandeep and his accomplices thrashed him up around one-anda-half years back. Gurdev also alleged that had authorities taken action against him during those days, he wouldn’t have committed such a heinous crime. He said Gagandeep’s family had come to live in their street nine to 10 years back and his mother had died about five years ago. Another area resident, Rita Rani, widow of a retired cop, alleged that Gagandeep had got a fake document of their house made and sold it to a cop in 2017. She further alleged that they had to live on rent before they could prove that the house belonged to them. “He would bring a vehicle carrying liquor and park it outside our house and people would tell me not to let him do it,” she alleged. In the afternoon, police team led by Khanna SSP Balwinder Singh reached the house of deceased and took his wife to complete the legal formalities before cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/neighbours-saw-a-dark-side-in-dismissed-cop-long-before-blast/articleshow/88500720.cms||Shariq Majeed

Abu Dojana, commander of the 201 Khalid Bin Walid Corps, said that despite the Taliban seeking good ties with the neighbouring nations, its forces also have the military equipment to defend Afghanistan in case of any provocation, reports TOLO News. "This is precious soil. We have paid a large sacrifice for it. We want to be good neighbours but if they keep attacking our soil, we will certainly give them a response," he said. The commander's remarks come as residents of Kunar have claimed that Pakistan has been targeting several parts of the province for the past two weeks. At least one civilian was also injured in mortar shelling by the Pakistani military on the Chogam area of Shiltan district in Kunar, said the TOLO News report. Chogam area runs alongside the Durand Line that forms the AfghanistanPakistan border. "I was wounded by the mortar, a fragment hit my head. I was taken to Asadabad during the night. I was in the hospital for two days," TOLO News quoted Anwar Shah, the injured person, as saying. Some residents have also claimed of seeing Pakistani drones operating in the province.

The health department daily analysis report of Covid-19 showed that the district hadn't witnessed forming of any cluster so far this month implying spread of cases all over the area. The district had reported 22 cases on Friday night to rise to the highest daily tally in the last three months. The district with this has reported 297 cases in December witnessing maximum infections in the last six months, showed record of daily health bulletin. These 22 cases were reported from 14 areas of the district with only two reported two or more than two cases, showing an area-wise bifurcation of infections. Sanghi colony and Race course road reported three and two cases respectively. The rest of the areas including Noorani Nagar, Scheme 51, Khatiwali Tank, Scheme 51, Gopal Bagh Manik Bagh roads, Meghdoot Nagar, Sanwer, Scheme 54, Ashish Nagar, Ahilya Mata colony, treasure island, SS Infinitus and Jalaram nagar reported only one case each. District COVID-19 nodal officer Dr Amit Malakar said, "The cases are spread all over the district for now. There is no clustering as such as was reported last year with several areas reporting more cases while rest otherwise." "This cluster based analysis helped in devising a local area based strategy to increase strictness to control, prevent the spread of pandemic virus so this parameter is checked", said Dr Malakar.

"Metro rail will bring more prosperity in Indore. The facility will offer employment to around 2,000 people after it starts operation," Chouhan said. "The design of Metro rail will be kept in a way that it can further incorporate three-layers (a double-decker bridge or three-level crossing as flyover-cum-metro rail viaduct) to meet the future demands," he said. The 31.5 kilometre-long Indore Metro Rail will start from airport and pass through Gandhi Nagar, Super Corridor, MR-10, Vijay Nagar Square, Radisson Square, Bengali Square, High Court, railway station, Bada Ganapati, BSF and back to airport at a cost of Rs 7,500.80 crore. MP Metro Rail Corporation Limited officials said that all stations will have world-class facilities and will be accessible to persons with disabilities. The stations will have LED lighting and solar panels for energy conservation as per green building norms of IGBC platinum rating while central concourses will have ATM kiosks, food outlets and other facilities. The CM said that a survey would be carried out to check feasibility of extending Indore metro rail to Sanwer, Ujjain and Pithampur. "We will see what could be more financially viable -- metro rail, rapid rail or light metro by carrying out a survey and will run it from Indore to Sanwer and Ujjain while Pithampur will also be connected with it," Chouhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/metro-rail-will-bring-more-prosperity-to-indore-says-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/88500817.cms||---

A crowd of 5,000 had in 1933 turned up to watch C K Nayudu’s India take on Douglas Jardine’s England at the famed gymkhana, which overlooks other maidans where Mumbai’s budding cricketers play in inter-school or inter-club tournaments. Amarnath scored 118 in that game the first Test hundred by an IndianIndia lost that historic game by nine wickets, but it was the home team’s Lala Amarnath who stole everyone’s hearts. Legend has it that he was showered with ornaments by women in the crowd after he scored 118 in the second innings, the first Test hundred by an Indian batsman. That it contained 21 fours is an indicator of how entertaining his knock must have been. The gymkhana, which incidentally also hosted the first-ever first-class game on Indian soil in 1892 between Parsees and the Europeans, is now looking to revive this piece of history. CK Nayudu (left) and Lala Amarnath walk out to bat at the Bombay Gymkhana ground“Over the years, we’ve celebrated this occasion a couple of times. However, going forward, we’ll ensure this becomes a marquee event in the city annually. We’re hoping -- this is a thought and we’re discussing it --that for the 90th anniversary of this Test, we’ll really make it a very big event, where we will invite the English and Indian captains for a ‘toss’ at the club, like it was done 90 years ago,” club president Aga Husain told TOI. The grand celebrations are being planned by ace marketing man Shailendra Singh. “I don’t know how they accommodated a crowd of 50,000 at this venue for that historic Test,” said Vengsarkar. In that crowd was a 13-year-old Vasant Raiji, who went on to become a first-class cricketer and a noted cricket historian. Former India allrounder, commentator and coach Ravi Shastri said, “I’m glad this function is being organized, because this will always remain in the history books. It is the venue where the first Test was played, and for an Indian to be scoring a hundred will always remain a lasting memory. Pic: Bombay Gymkhana Collection So, well done Bombay Gymkhana. Hope the glory days come back!” With India being under British rule in 1933, colonialism and racism were at their peak during the Test. “I heard that the whites were in one section, while the Indians were in another. People couldn’t go into the clubhouse to celebrate Lalaji’s hundred, which is why gold coins and jewellery were thrown at him. I believe that the value of what was dished out to him was unbelievable for those times. When you see photographs of the crowd during that match, it must have spread into Azad Maidan deep down, to just get a glimpse of the players. These are hair-raising stories,” Shastri said. Both Vengsarkar and Shastri are advocating that serious cricket be revived at the gymkhana. “Since that Test, there have been no big games there. Let’s start something,” Vengsarkar said. “I just wish cricket would come back (at the club). Carnival cricket is good for starters. Even if it’s not first-class cricket, you want a high level of club cricket being played here. If that comes here again, you’ll see a lot more people coming and watching these games,” Shastri said. Both Vengsarkar and Shastri have fond memories of playing at the gymkhana. “I played here as captain of Bombay Schools. There used to be half-day games in those days. I remember we played against M A K Pataudi, who was the Indian captain then. ‘Tiger’ Pataudi opened the innings. He had a very open-chested stance. We had a pacer called Shyam Sawant, who used to bowl good outswingers. I ran up to him and said, ‘He’s got an open-chested stance. Try and get him bowled around his legs.’ Shyam agreed. Pataudi must’ve thought, ‘These kids are trying to make fun of me.’ Shyam bowled exactly where I wanted him to bowl, just outside his legs. Patuadi didn’t move but just whipped the ball from behind him. We didn’t know where to look! Later, I played an inter-collegiate match here, and there was a crowd of 3,000 for that! It’s a fantastic venue, one of the best in the city,” remembered Vengsarkar. Shastri said, “My memories of playing here are of a pitch which had good bounce. Also, I always enjoyed playing here because this place had the best lunch!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mission-2023-bombay-gym-plans-big-bash-for-90th-anniversary-of-first-test/articleshow/88500777.cms||Gaurav Gupta

They include two prisoners linked with a Pakistani narco-terror cell, who were brought out on production warrant on Saturday, and a woman cop who lived with him. The woman used to be naib reader at the office of the Khanna superintendent of police, where Gagandeep Singh was reader from 2015 to 2017. He had called her a day before dying in the blast. Pakistan-linked drug peddlers Ranjeet Singh Cheeta and Sukhwinder Singh ‘Boxer Baba’, who are now in seven days of police custody, were his mates in the Ludhiana central jail. Prison superintendent Gurpreet Singh Bhullar confirmed that Ranjeet and Sukhwinder’s production warrant was in connection with the blast. A Ludhiana police official confirmed that: “Ranjeet is a big fish of the narco-terror network of Pakistan’s spy agency, the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence). Punjab Police arrested him in May 2010 with 532 kilogram heroin. Former national-level boxer Sukhwinder has links with terror organisation Hizbul Mujahideen. The Khanna police arrested him with 3 kg RDX in 2012 and later with heroin in October 2019.” The official said: “While in jail, Gagandeep developed a bond with Ranjeet and Sukhwinder and it appears that Ranjeet converted him to their anti-national cause.” Another source from the jail told TOI that: “Sukhwinder’s accomplice Jasdeep Singh Koki of Patiala got bail about three months ago and he, too, might have made contact with Gagandeep.” Police are questioning more cop friends of Gagandeep, who was identified by a tattoo on the right arm and data on his mobile phone. A senior police officer said: “Gagandeep was living with the detained woman cop after a marital discord but she has no criminal history. We also questioned his classmates, a few cops who worked with him, and the manager of the bank branch where he had an account.” Gagandeep’s wife had shared with police that he had left home around 10am on Thursday, looking disturbed over a court case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/two-jail-mates-cop-friends-of-ludhiana-blast-suspect-among-7-quizzed/articleshow/88500850.cms||Payal Dhawan

There was tracing of about 10-12 first contacts on an average on every positive case in the last one month in the district when it had reported 297 cases- maximum in six month. CMHO Dr BS Saitya said, "The teams has been tracing around 10-12 first contacts per positive case on an average in the last one month amidst surge." The traced first contact number remained on higher side in some cases with a maximum of 24 recorded this month, said Dr Saitya. On question of less contacts being traced despite the free movement Dr Saitya said, "The first contact traced number goes up as the infection soars. This will go up as well in coming days." "Now, only family members or those who visited the positive case just before he/she tested positive is considered under the first contact of these cases", added Dr Saitya. The exercise of contact tracing is done to know about origin of infection, control its spread by breaking the chain of disease through formulation of strategy. CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan in a meeting held yesterday directed officials to trace at least 30 contacts per positive case in state to curb the peak. District contact tracing in-charge Dr Rahul Srivastava said, "We aim for 30-70 contacts per index case. But, the number varies based on the mobility, family members of the case." "In some cases the number goes as high as sixty, seventy contacts and in several others it remained very low at zero in district in the last one month", said Dr Srivastava. There are around 48 RRTs employed on field for tracing, and sampling along with four reserve teams, added Dr Srivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/contact-tracing-takes-backseat-as-cases-soar-in-indore/articleshow/88500903.cms||Antriksh Singh

The stretch at Myadaneri Cross in Yelburga taluk, Koppal district, where wild animals venture to forage for food, has become a graveyard for many an animal that comes under the wheels of speeding vehicles. Among others, deer and bears step outside the forests that line the highway on either side, looking for food. But crossing the narrow stretch that bisects the forest is proving a perilous adventure for these poor animals. On December 21, a sloth bear was killed at Myadaneri Cross while crossing the road at night. Activists told TOI that it was mostly bears and deer that became victims on the road. "In addition to their being killed, many of them sustain serious injuries, incidents which go unreported. The problem is that signboards erected by the forest department are not visible to motorists during the night. The department must take steps to save the lives of these poor animals," said an activist. Assistant conservator of forests, Koppal, Shivakumar Beelagi said that they had they had erected several boards, urging motorists to reduce their speed while driving along the stretch, but to no avail. "Motorists do not heed our warning. Last years, one or two bears were killed coming under the wheels of vehicles, while the death of the sloth bear on December 21 was the first fatality reported this year. We have approached the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), demanding that speedbreakers be built along the stretch. We also want to erect more signboards on both sides of the road. Meanwhile, we have stepped up patrolling on the roads in the wake of the sloth bear's death," Beelagi said. He attributed the accidents to reckless driving. "People who drive after consuming alcohol too are responsible for such accidents. We will start work on building speedbreakers on the road soon," Beelagi added. Range forest officer KM Nagaraj said that farmers in the villages abutting the forests cultivated watermelon, maize, et al. "As a result, wild animals from Sullikeri, Meragall, Chilakmuki and other areas in the forest stray into these villages looking for food at night," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-stretch-on-hospet-kushtagi-road-a-death-trap-for-animals/articleshow/88500932.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Candidates may face jail for false affidavits in panchayat polls||BHUBANESWAR: Those contesting in the forthcoming panchayat election can face up to six months in prison for filing false affidavits. The state government has come up with an ordinance to amend the panchayat laws wherein candidates will have to file affidavits relating to his/her criminal antecedents, assets, liabilities and educational qualification at the time of filing of nomination. The ordinance - Odisha Panchayat Laws (amendment) Ordinance, 2021- has provisions of imprisonment for a term which may extend up to six months, or fine or both if a candidate gives false information or conceals information in his/her nomination paper. With the promulgation of the ordinance, the state government has amended three panchayat laws. No penal provision for false info earlierThese are the Odisha Gram Panchayat Act, 1964, the Odisha Panchayat Samiti Act, 1959, and the Odisha Zilla Parisad Act, 1991. "The amendment was needed as earlier there was no statutory provision regarding filing of affidavits of candidates contesting for posts like ward members, sarpanches, samiti members and zilla parisad members. Also, there were no penal provision for furnishing false information or concealing information relating to criminal antecedents, assets, liabilities and educational qualification," said panchayati raj minister Pratap Jena. The government has taken ordinance route to amend the panchayat laws as the assembly is not in session. With the amendment, the government has inserted a new clause in the law regarding preparation of disaster management plan at the village, gram panchayat and panchayat samiti (block) level and participation of panchayati raj institution (PRI) members in disaster management activities. As part of the disaster management plan, the gram panchayats and panchayat samitis would integrate disaster management with development plan, initiate capacity building exercise of stakeholders, carry out and facilitate relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities in disaster-affected areas in accordance with the state and district plan. "Since Odisha is hit by natural disasters, especially cyclones and floods almost every year since the past decade, it is necessary to engage the PRI members in effective management of the situation," said a senior panchayati raj department official. Since various districts prepare disaster management plans, the amendment to prepare disaster management plan has been made only in panchayat and panchayat samiti Acts. Without any provision in the panchayat laws, the PRIs are now engaged in disaster management activities by executive instructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-candidates-may-face-jail-for-false-affidavits-in-panchayat-polls/articleshow/88501029.cms||Sujit kumar bisoyi
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: BJD to give 40% tickets to OBCs for rural, civic polls||BHUBANESWAR: The BJD on Saturday passed a resolution to provide 40% tickets to OBC candidates in the forthcoming panchayat and civic body polls since there will be no reservation for other backward classes in local body elections. The BJD executive committee, the apex decision-making body headed by party president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, passed the resolution after it was moved by its organisational secretary Pranab Prakash Das. The decision came a day before the party is set to observe its 25th foundation day. Though the BJD had in August announced to provide 27% tickets to OBC candidates, the executive committee has now increased the share to 40%. The BJD's decision assumes significance politically as the socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) comprise around 50% of the state's population even though there has been no formal enumeration in the recent past. There are around 209 communities identified as SEBC in the state. While caste politics is insignificant in Odisha, political observers said the apprehension to lose support of the backward classes after the no reservation ruling might have prompted the ruling party to take such a decision to field more OBC candidates. Naveen, who is scheduled to address the BJD workers over videoconferencing to mark the foundation day, may throw light on partys support to backward classes in the forthcoming local body polls. The Orissa high court, citing two recent orders of the Supreme Court, observed that there can be no reservation for backward classes. Following the court order, the state panchayati raj department has issued a fresh draft reservation list for various zilla parishad president posts without OBC quota while the state cabinet also amended the municipal laws through an ordinance to drop reservation of backward classes in the urban body polls. Das, during the meeting, said since reservation to backward classes is a national issue, the BJD has been demanding the Centre to take appropriate steps to ensure justice to the communities. He also assured that his party would extend wholehearted support to the Centre on whatever legislative steps it will take in this regard. "The BJD has always stressed on empowering the socially and economically weaker sections of the society. It has also taken several steps for their development and to ensure equal rights to them," said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-bjd-to-give-40-tickets-to-obcs-for-rural-civic-polls/articleshow/88501101.cms||Sujit Kumar Bisoyi

He opened fire at the police and sustained bullet injuries in his legs in retaliatory firing. He was taken to hospital where he is said to be out of danger. Fauji had been absconding since April after giving police a slip following a long chase and firing on police in Bhilwara district. Two police constables Omkar Raika and Pawan Kumar were killed in this firing. Rajasthan police had announced a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh to any information about his whereabouts. IGP (Ajmer Range) S. Sengathir said a special team had been constituted to arrest Fauji and began a search for him at all possible whereabouts in different states of the country based on interrogation of his aides. “During search, we got information that Fauji has been hiding somewhere around village Khokharia under Banar police station of Jodhpur. This information was shared with Jodhpur police and a siege was laid around a house on Friday night where he was believed to be hiding,” said Sengathir. Since he was out of the house then, police decided to keep the siege. When he arrived early Saturday morning on a motorcycle, he began firing at the police and sustained injuries in his legs in cross firing. “He fell down from the motorcycle after being hit. We took him to a hospital where he has been undergoing treatment”, said DCP (East) Bhuvan Bhushan Yadav, who led the operation in Jodhpur. Police have also detained the house owner identified as Lunaram for providing shelter to Fauji and have also been interrogating him to extract the names of other suspects involved in providing safe passage to him.

Who is Rajuram? Rajuram alias Fauji from Doli village of Bikaner was in CRPF but lured into the crime of poppy husk smuggling because of quick money. He had come to his village on a holiday in 2005 but did not return. He earned his name Fauji due to his CRPF stint. First case against him was registered in 2005 which had been disposed of after a compromise. Since then, he had 22 cases in police stations. He started smuggling independently in 2013 and made an gang of his own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/most-wanted-drug-smuggler-held-after-exchange-of-fire-with-police-in-rajasthan/articleshow/88501269.cms||---

The board in a meeting held on Saturday appointed Rajeev Ahuja (currently the Executive Director) as interim Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of the bank with immediate effect, subject to the regulatory and other approvals, the bank said. The other terms and conditions of his appointment, such as remuneration, would remain unchanged. The bank said it received a communication from the Reserve Bank on December 24, and appointed its Chief General Manager Yogesh K Dayal as an additional director on the board of RBL Bank for a period of two years, with effect from December 24, 2021 till December 23, 2023 or till further orders. "We wish to mention that the bank is well placed to execute its business plan and strategy as communicated during our earnings call dated October 28, 2021. The business and financial trajectory continues to be on improving trend, post absorbing the challenges due to Covid 2 pandemic," the bank said. The financials of the bank remain robust with healthy capital adequacy of 16.3 per cent, high levels of liquidity as reflected through Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 155 per cent, stable net NPA of 2.14 per cent, credit deposit ratio of 74.1 per cent and leverage ratio of 10 per cent, for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, it said. In addition, the bank has also improved the granularity of its deposits and advances, RBL Bank said. Bank employee unions' umbrella body AIBEA had written a letter to Finance Minister Nirmla Sitharaman expressing concern that everything was not right at RBL Bank and it was going the Yes Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank way. "We are worried and concerned about the developments that are taking place in the affairs of RBL Bank Ltd, the Kolhapur based private bank. "The sequence of events leading to the sudden exit of Vishwavir Ahuja along with induction of Dayal from RBI on the board as additional member indicates that everything is not ok with the bank," AIBEA said in its letter to the Finance Minister. Vishwavir had been heading the private sector bank for the last one decade. While the board recommended his continuation, it is learnt that RBI has agreed only for a short term up to 2022, AIBEA said further. There are also reports that the bank has been over indulging in retail credit, micro-financing and credit cards and consequently has burnt its finger resulting in weakening the financials of the bank, it said. "In the background of the problems encountered by private banks like Yes Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank last year, we urge upon you to immediately intervene in the matter in the interest of the depositors of this private sector bank and consider necessary steps including merger of this bank with a public sector bank," AIBEA's letter to Sitharaman urged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbl-bank-md-ceo-vishwavir-anuja-steps-down/articleshow/88501282.cms||---

If the government cancels the final examinations for any reason in future, then marks of the summative exams will help assess the students, he added. The schools have been asked to follow guidelines, issued by the Board of Secondary Education (BSE), for the summative exams to be conducted, which will be held as per schedule. "The summative exams are important as their marks would be considered in case the final board exams are cancelled," Das added. Following the cancellation of Class 10 board exams due to Covid-19, the state government revised the exam and evaluation process and introduced summative exams for classes 9 and 10. "The summative examination will be held offline. Students will appear for the exam in another school, just like the board exams. A standard operating procedure has been issued to conduct classes and take all precautionary measures to curb Covid-19 infections. Health officials are also monitoring the schools and regular meetings are being held with nodal officers and district and block education officers to ensure that classes and exams are held smoothly," Das added. There will be multiple choice questions of 50 marks to be answered in OMR answer sheets. Questions will be from the first 50% of the syllabus. Evaluation will be done by the BSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-govt-plans-summative-exams-for-class-10-students-from-jan-5/articleshow/88501294.cms||Minati Singha

---||World||Over 6,000 flights scrapped as Omicron hits Christmas weekend travel||NEW YORK: More than 6,000 flights have been canceled worldwide over the long Christmas weekend and thousands more were delayed, a tracking website reported Sunday, as the highly infectious Omicron variant brings holiday hurt to millions. Compounding the travel chaos in the United States, severe weather in the country's west is due to wreak havoc on roadways and other routes there although it may well bring a white Christmas weekend to northwest cities Seattle and Portland. According to Flightaware.com, more than 2,800 flights were scrubbed around the globe on Saturday, including more than 990 originating from or headed to US airports, with over 8,500 delays as of 0500 GMT. On Friday, there were around 2,400 cancellations and 11,000 delays, while Sunday cancellations were at nearly 1,500 with more than 1,400 delays also reported. Pilots, flight attendants and other employees have been calling in sick or having to quarantine after exposure to Covid, forcing Lufthansa, Delta, United Airlines, JetBlue, Alaska Airlines and many other short-staffed carriers to cancel flights during one of the year's peak travel periods. "Help @united flight cancelled again. I want to get home for Christmas," one exasperated traveler from the US state of Vermont tweeted to the airline early Saturday. Flightaware data showed United cancelled around 200 flights on Friday and nearly 250 Saturday -- about 10 percent of those that were scheduled. A scramble to reroute pilots and planes and reassign employees was underway, but Omicron's surge has upended business. "The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation," United said in a statement Friday. "As a result, we've unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport," the airline said. Similarly, Delta scrapped 310 flights Saturday and was already canceling over 100 more Sunday, saying it has "exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying." "We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans," the company said. The cancellations added to the pandemic frustration for many people eager to reunite with their families over the holidays, after last year's Christmas was severely curtailed. Chinese airlines accounted for the highest number of cancellations, with China Eastern scrapping more than 1,000 flights, over 20 percent of its flight plan, on Friday and Saturday and Air China also grounding about 20 percent of its scheduled departures over the period. According to estimates from the American Automobile Association, more than 109 million Americans were scheduled to travel by plane, train or automobile between December 23 and January 2, a 34 percent increase over the last year. But most of those plans were made before the outbreak of Omicron, which has become the dominant strain in the United States, overwhelming some hospitals and healthcare workers. The state of New York announced Friday that it recorded 44,431 new daily positive Covid tests, a record, while new cases surged nationwide as well. On the weather front, while unseasonably warm temperatures were bathing eastern states, the National Weather Service announced winter storm warnings including a deep freeze for significant parts of the west. "Anomalously cold conditions and a barrage of Pacific moisture results in prolonged periods of mountain snow and coastal/valley rain, some of which may fall heavy at times," the NWS said in an advisory. An eye-popping two to four feet (61 to 122 centimeters) of snow was forecast to fall this weekend, with higher accumulation in some spots, in the northern and central Sierra mountains of California and Oregon. Travel will be "treacherous to at times impossible" from the Sierras to the central Rocky Mountains at the weekend due to whiteout snow conditions, the NWS added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/over-6000-flights-scrapped-as-omicron-hits-christmas-weekend-travel/articleshow/88501406.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: BJP sees red over ink mark on EVM||CHANDIGARH: Spotting a black ink mark on an electronic voting machine (EVM) next to AAP candidate’s photo at a polling booth in ward number 23 on Friday prompted BJP to file a complaint against the election staff that led the election commission to replace the entire staff. BJP alleged the mark had been made deliberately by someone in the polling staff. “It is a rare case of a sign being found on an EVM. After the matter came to the notice of the senior officers of the UT administration, the machine was cleaned properly and the sign was erased and polling was resumed,” a BJP leader said. “At first sight, it looked like a deliberate act by polling staff present there. It was not a simple sign or mark which happened to be there by mistake or ignorance. The way the sign or arrow was marked, it was clear it was done knowingly. We raised a strong objection before poll officers following which the entire election staff from that booth was changed,” said Arun Sood, president, Chandigarh BJP. Sood further said glitches had occurred in some EVMs but resolved in a short time. A senior UT official said, “It was a minor thing, which may have happened in ignorance. But we immediately swung into action and changed the staff of the polling booth. Voting had continued at the polling station smoothly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-bjp-sees-red-over-ink-mark-on-evm/articleshow/88501428.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||India||UP polls: Why Kashi and Mathura are not Ayodhya||LUCKNOW: "Ayodhya hui hamari, ab Kashi-Mathura ki baari' -- this was a tweet put out by Uttar Pradesh deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya on December 1. On the same day, the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha quietly withdrew its call for installing a Krishna idol inside the Shahi Eidgah mosque. The tweet did not create the storm it was expected to and the Mahasabha decision did not even evoke a minor reaction. Clearly, the 'liberation' of Mathura has failed to get people's support and this was one reason why the Mahasabha retracted its steps. "We want to live in harmony and if our temples are not disturbed, we would certainly not want any trouble on such issues. The people of Mathura are certainly not looking forward to any clashes with any community," said Ram Lal Sharma, a local businessman. Mathura, and also Kashi, are not feasible as election issues for the 2022 polls in Uttar Pradesh and the Bharatiya Janata Party seems to have realised this well in time. Disputes related to both the shrines are already in court and the decision on them may take several years. Meanwhile, in Varanasi, the inauguration of the grand Kashi Vishwanath temple corridor on December 13, seems to have pushed the Gyanvapi mosque issue out of focus. "The Kashi Vishwanath temple has already attained a new glory and magnificence. The temple is a grand entity on its own so the presence of the mosque does not affect us," said Pandit Ram Narain Acharya, a 73-year-old priest in Sigra locality. Most residents of Varanasi now believe that raking up the Gyanvapi controversy would serve no purpose since the 'temple has its own place and significance' after the renovation. Both Mathura and Kashi come within the purview of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 which seeks to maintain the religious character of shrines as it was at the time of Independence. The Central government will have to repeal the Act if a campaign for liberation of Mathura and Kashi is launched and this will not be an easy task -- socially and politically. Ayodhya, incidentally had been exempted from the Act, which was passed a year before the demolition of Babri mosque. One major factor which sets Ayodhya apart from Mathura and Kashi is that the Ayodhya movement was initiated and pursued rather aggressively by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and its leaders that included Ashok Singhal and Praveen Togadia. Both the leaders had managed to turn the campaign for the temple into a people's movement and the active involvement of the common man was evident in all programmes held by the VHP for the Ram temple. The call for Kashi and Mathura does not have the active involvement of the VHP though some leaders have spoken about it randomly. Moreover, even the present VHP leadership is not as aggressive as Singhal and Togadia and may not be able to whip up similar passions for these two shrines. The VHP does not seem adequately interested to do so either. The All India Akhara Parishad, the apex body of priests, had declared in October 2019 that it would soon launch an agitation to demolish the mosques in Mathura and Varanasi but that has not happened so far. The BJP, which was propelled into becoming the dominant political force in the country because of the Ayodhya movement, is also not very interested in pursuing the Kashi and Mathura issues. So, it seems. "When we have the governance and charisma of Prime Minister Modi to boast about, why rake up contentious issues? Muslims have started supporting us in large numbers and there is no need to take up these issues. The Prime Minister has imparted unmatched grandeur to the Kashi Vishwanath temple and we are sure he will do something similar in Mathura without disturbing the Eidgah," said a senior BJP functionary who did not wish to be named. The Shahi Idgah in Mathura and the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi are not the only two Islamic shrines under threat from the right-wing Hindu organisations affiliated with the Sangh Parivar. Court cases are ongoing over the Qutub Minar and the Tile Waali Masjid in Lucknow. The cases are being pursued with arguments that match those made previously over the Babri Masjid -- first try to 'prove' their argument, and if that fails, then claim that it is a 'matter of faith' that cannot be subject to judicial scrutiny. However, since the people have apparently moved ahead of such issues and are focusing on a better tomorrow, issues like Kashi and Mathura are unlikely to turn into poll issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-polls-why-kashi-and-mathura-are-not-ayodhya/articleshow/88501537.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cyber crime: CID campaign promotes helpline||KOLKATA: The CID has launched an online campaign this festive season to popularize a six-digit helpline to report cyber crime. The number — 155260 — is the helpline for the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. According to CID, reporting the crime on this helpline provides some quick steps on dos and don’ts and helps the victim seek help even as they report the matter to the police. “Often, valuable time is lost for the victim of what he or she needs to do once the victim realizes that a cyber fraud has taken place. But some quick action helps law enforcers to stop any further illegal transaction. This is especially true for the festive season when such crimes usually witness a jump,” said an officer. The number and the portal linked with it also provides the different categories of complaint which includes online and social media related crime, hacking, online cyber trafficking, online gambling, ransomware, cryptocurrency crime, cyber terrorism, and any other related crime. On the other hand, in cases of crime against women and children, the victim has the privilege to mask her name and report it anonymously. This function helps the female victim in a very efficient manner by protecting her identity. Once all the details are provided along with any evidence or proof of the suspect or the crime committed by him, the complaint is registered and the victim receives the tracking I.D.of his/her reported crime. The victim can track the status and know the progress of his/her report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyber-crime-cid-campaign-promotes-helpline/articleshow/88501527.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He reached Pokhran after taking part in a BJP rally in Barmer on Friday. Attacking the Gehlot government, he said, the state is leading in unemployment. Even in the RTI activist case, he said that law and order in the state has totally deteriorated. This is the fate when someone tries to raise a voice against corruption. He alleged that the government, which is losing on all fronts, is supporting and protecting the criminals in the state. The dispute within the congress is visible in its governance too. The government was holidaying in hotels with its MLAs and ministers for 34 days. He asked, “What is this celebration for?” An agitated Rathore said Ashok Gehlot is misusing government machinery and organizing rallies to please his high command and to increase his numbers. This is only deteriorating the goodwill of his party rather than increasing it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-bjp-attacks-congress-government-over-rising-crime-and-corruption/articleshow/88501335.cms||---

Of the new local cases of coronavirus, 157 were reported in Shaanxi and one in Guangxi provinces, besides 48 imported cases, the National Health Commission (NHC) said. The spike in cases ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics has sparked concerns in the country as officials scampered to arrest the spread. Though China has controlled the contagion by drastically limiting international travel, sporadic clusters of cases continued to surface in different parts of the country, putting its “Zero case” policy under stress. Chinese officials reported a case of Omicron on December 13 in Tianjin city followed by a few more cases. However, there is not much information about its spread in the country. The health officials also reported an outbreak of Delta strain sub-lineage AY.4 in Zhejiang province in the middle of the month which was reportedly brought under control. There were 2,011 active cases in China as of Saturday, with nine in critical conditions, the commission said. No new deaths related to the disease were reported, while 76 patients were discharged from hospitals on Saturday, it added. The total number of cases on the Chinese mainland stood at 101,077 since the virus broke out in Wuhan in 2019 with the death toll unchanged at 4,636. The Beijing Winter Olympics, the 24th edition of the showpiece that started way back in 1924, will be held from February 4 to 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-reports-sudden-spike-in-covid-19-cases-ahead-of-winter-olympics/articleshow/88501614.cms||---

He urged the Supreme Court to take cognisance of the hate speech and take action against those responsible for the same. The hate speeches against minorities were made in the two-day Dharam Sansad held in Haridwar from December 17-19. The matter sparked wide outrage after videos of the hate speech went viral. “It is a matter of shock that nobody has been arrested in the case till date,” said Gehlot, who questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami. He asked citizens to decide whether such violent and instigators can be representatives of any religion. “Do governments that avoid taking action against these miscreants have any right to remain in power?

---||Bhubaneswar||The year that was: Bitter-sweet tryst with a tumultuous year||By Amarendra DasThe year is about to end amid the looming fear of another Covid surge, owing to the Omicron variant, with the government bringing back restrictions on large gatherings. At the same time, the political weather is heating up for the panchayat election, most likely in February. But before we look ahead, let's take a look at the year gone by, from the political and economic standpoint. It started with the government declaring that it would transform the SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack, into a world-class institution. Next up was the economic survey, presented in February, reporting a 6.2% contraction in the state's output. Surprisingly, the agriculture and allied sectors reported a nearly seven per cent contraction. Though the finance minister had earlier said the government would spend Rs 1.5 lakh crore during 2020-21, it ended up spending Rs 15,000 crore less than the allocated amount. In spite of this, the finance minister earmarked Rs 1.7 lakh crore for the 2021-22 fiscal. According to the monthly data presented by CAG, the state witnessed a significant rise in revenue collection, until October, compared to the last fiscal. However, in spite of a relatively higher revenue mobilisation, the state spent only 40.58% of the budgeted amount of Rs 1.7 lakh crore. By March, the second wave of Covid-19 had engulfed the entire state. The controversies surrounding the actual Covid deaths raised the political temperature during summer. The number of cremations in the crematoriums of the twin cities did not match with the Covid death toll announced by the government. This provided fodder to opposition leaders to accuse the government of under-reporting Covid deaths. Unlike some other states, Odisha did not come up with revised data of the deaths caused by Covid. The silence of the chief minister on this matter also drew criticism from the legislators of his own party. In June, the NITI Ayog rankings put Odisha in 8th place from the bottom in the sustainable development goal index. The state's performance in the poverty, hunger, gender equality, quality education, decent work and industry categories remained dismal. In November, the NITI Ayog released the multidimensional poverty index, putting Odisha in the ninth place from the bottom. This showed slight improvement in the state's overall ranking in poverty. However, the concentration of poverty in the tribal-dominated districts implied the failure of the percolation of the growth benefits to the state's hinterlands. Odisha is definitely progressing, both in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction. The growth is largely driven by the mining and metal industries. But in terms of distribution of the benefits of the growth, the performance is not satisfactory. The state's focus has remained on providing subsistence to the poor and winning their votes. Even in terms of preparing the state for the long-term sustainable development, the efforts are not enough. Large number of vacancies in healthcare and educational institutions will have severe consequences in the long term. The opposition in the state has remained weak. Both the Congress and the BJP have failed to mobilise the people against the failures of the state. In order to divert the attention of the public from major controversial issues, the government uses the defence of setting up inquiry commissions. Most of the commissions either do not submit reports or the reports are never brought to the notice of the public. The biggest asset of Naveen has been his clean image. But the Biju Janata Dal - is gradually becoming a one-man show. The legislators of his party remain insecure as he brings a number of new faces in every election. Last but not the least, the adjournment of the legislative assembly much before the scheduled time and the high-voltage political drama in the House by both the ruling party and the opposition does not augur well for the state in the days to come.

The two private firms have been asked to deposit Rs 3 crore as security. "The work will start in January next year. After the security deposit is received, the BMC will give the go-ahead to take up the work at the site. While household waste once separated will be processed for making on-site compost, the hard materials such as metals and plastic will be extracted for recycling. The government will spend Rs 100 crore on the project," BMC deputy commissioner (sanitation) Suvendu Sahu said. Bio-mining involves the segregation and processing of waste at the source itself and subsequent reshaping of land. The project had been accorded cabinet approval in November. The bio-mining work was entrusted to the two firms through a tender. After cabinet approval, the work order was issued. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had asked the civic bodies to clear legacy (old) waste, following which the Centre had issued a similar direction citing the NGT order. The BMC has been dumping waste at Daruthenga since 2008. But stiff protest from local residents forced the civic body to move out of Daruthenga gradually. It has also started transporting waste to the micro composting centres, which convert waste into compost. At present, BMC is able to divert about 30% of 600 metric tonnes of waste the city generates daily to the MCCs, while the remaining is still being sent to Daruthenga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/bhubaneswar-municipal-corporation-to-sign-pact-with-2-private-firms/articleshow/88501722.cms||Riyan Ramanath V
