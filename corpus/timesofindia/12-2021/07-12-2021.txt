There has been a severe outbreak of CD in the city and it has claimed many lives, with surviving dogs suffering untold misery. The fact that the virus is not communicable to humans has made the government ignore CD, which could be very well prevented with annual vaccination. The expensive vaccine is a bottleneck that prevents most pet owners from immunizing them. Suma Ramesh, honorary trustee, Animal Care Trust (ACT) says, "To our shock there has been an outbreak in September affecting a vast population of dogs, even older one’s which we thought were resistant,’’ indicating mutation. She says the government should provide vaccines at subsidized costs so that dogs can be vaccinated, lest dogs will fall prey to this disease with pet owners reluctant to vaccinate them. The fallout is pet owners abandoning infected dogs on the streets to fend for themselves, rues Suma. ACT shelter has seen more than 200 cases this year and 60 this year. "These numbers are much more on the streets,’’ she says. ACT’s birth control programme has also been casualty of this virus. ``We neuter a dog, which may be in the incubation period and after we leave the dog in that area, it gets full blown CD and dies/ suffers. Residents think that it is because of our operation while it is the other way round. As the virus is airborne during the outbreak, all dogs are in the danger zone barring vaccinated ones,’’ notes Suma. Also she points out that when the disease progresses a dog may lose recognition and tries to attack people and shows symptoms of rabies, hence people beat the dog to death suspecting the dog to be rabid. Dr Supriya Salins, a veterinarian, says the usual symptoms include, losing strength in the limbs, twitching or paralysis of the mouth area. The initial indicative symptoms are watery to pus-like discharge from their eyes, fever, nasal discharge, coughing, lethargy, and reduced appetite and vomiting. Once the dog is infected there’s nothing much that can be done, barring symptomatic treatment and hoping for the best, she says. Some deadly canine viral diseasesCanine distemper- Symptoms: runny eyes, fever, coughing, vomiting, paralysis Canine parvovirus (parvo)- Symptoms: fever, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss  Rabies- Symptoms: fever, pain, tingling or burning at the wound, hyperactivity||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/canine-distemper-outbreak-worries-vets/articleshow/88130262.cms||Stanley Pinto

The real estate giant, which is grappling with over $300 billion in liabilities and is at risk of becoming China's biggest ever default, said on Monday that the committee included officials from state entities and would play an important role in "mitigating and eliminating the future risks" of the group. On Friday, Evergrande said it would seek to restructure its offshore debt after acknowledging that it may no longer be able to meet its financial obligations, prompting the provincial government of the southern province of Guangdong, where it is based, to step in to help manage the fallout. "Evergrande's been trying to sell assets to repay debt, but Friday's statement basically says it is going to 'surrender' and needs help," said Conita Hung, investment strategy director at Tiger Faith Asset Management. "This sends a very bad signal." Evergrande shares slumped to a record low on Monday as it teetered, yet again, on the brink of default with the end of a 30-day grace period looming on dues totalling $82.5 million. At the end of Asia business hours, two bondholders said they had yet to receive payments. Evergrande, which has made 11th-hour coupon payments in the past, declined to comment. If Evergrande was declared in formal default it would trigger a wave of cross defaults that would ripple through the property sector and beyond, potentially rattling global investor confidence, already shaken by the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. "Until there is a further announcement everybody is waiting to see if this time will be the first real trigger event. This is also set against the anticipated febrile equities market this week," said Karl Clowry, a partner at Addleshaw Goddard in London. Chinese authorities have ramped up efforts to reassure markets that Evergrande's woes can be contained. In the latest move, China's central bank said on Monday it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, its second such move this year, releasing $188 billion in long-term liquidity to bolster slowing economic growth. Evergrande's shares tumbled 20% on Monday closing at an all-time low of HK$1.81 after it said late on Friday that creditors had demanded $260 million and that it could not guarantee funds for coupon repayment, prompting authorities to summon its chairman. Analysts said authorities' concerted efforts signalled Evergrande has likely already entered a managed debt-asset restructuring process. Morgan Stanley said such a process would involve coordination between authorities to maintain operations of property projects, and negotiation with onshore creditors to ensure financing for project completion. Regulators would also likely facilitate debt restructuring discussion with offshore creditors after operations stabilise, the US investment bank said in a report. The recent tumble in Evergrande's dollar-denominated bonds accelerated with the March 2022 issue dropping 4.35 cents in the dollar to 27.7 cents, while other issues like the 2024 and 2025 bonds , tumbled to record lows below 20 cents, MarketAxess data showed. Liquidity sqeeze The firm is just one of a number of developers starved of liquidity due to regulatory curbs on borrowing, prompting offshore debt defaults, credit-rating downgrades and sell-offs in developers' shares and bonds. To stem turmoil, regulators since October have urged banks to relax lending for developers' normal financing needs and allowed more real estate firms to sell domestic bonds. read more Still, the government may have to significantly step up policy-easing measures in the spring to prevent a sharp downturn in the property sector as repayment pressures intensify, Japanese investment bank Nomura said in a report on Sunday. Quarterly dollar bond repayments will almost double to $19.8 billion in the first quarter and $18.5 billion in the second. Easing measures such as the ability to sell domestic bonds are unlikely to help Evergrande refinance as there would be no demand for its notes, CGS-CIMB Securities said on Monday. Evergrande's inability to sell projects - with almost zero November sales - also makes short-term debt payments "highly unlikely", the brokerage said. On Monday, smaller developer Sunshine 100 China Holdings said it had defaulted on a $170 million dollar bond due December 5 "owing to liquidity issues arising from the adverse impact of a number of factors including the macroeconomic environment and the real estate industry". The delinquency will trigger cross-default provisions under certain other debt instruments, it said. Last week, Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd, China's largest offshore debtor among developers after Evergrande, said bondholders had rejected an offer to exchange its 6.5% offshore bonds due December 7, leaving it at risk of default. The developer has begun talks with some of the bondholders to extend the deadline for the $400 million debt repayment, sources have told Reuters. read more Smaller rival China Aoyuan Property Group Ltd last week also said creditors have demanded repayment of $651.2 million due to a slew of credit-rating downgrades, and that it may be unable to pay due to a lack of liquidity. read more Aoyuan Chairman Guo Zi Wen on Friday told executives at an internal meeting to have a "wartime mindset" to ensure operation and project delivery and to fund repayments, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Such tasks will be priorities for the developer, which will leave bond repayment negotiation to professional institutions in Hong Kong, said the person, declining to be identified as the matter is private. Aoyuan did not respond to a request for comment. The developer's share price fell nearly 8% on Monday. Kaisa lost 2.2% and Sunshine 100 plunged 14%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/evergrande-moves-toward-restructuring-state-swoops-in-to-contain-risk/articleshow/88131431.cms||---

India and Russia also signed 28 agreements, 9 between the 2 governments and the remaining business to business, during Putin’s brief visit Monday evening. While confirming that the supply of S-400 air defence system under a "legacy contract" has begun, and that it will continue to take place, the government also asserted that both India and Russia followed independent foreign policies and that there was no discussion over the US CAATSA sanctions threat during the summit. Read AlsoFocus on Afghanistan, terror in Russia summit; S-400 supplies to continueThe 21st India-Russia annual summit featuring PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin saw the 2 countries, while reaffirming commitment to the S-400 deal despite the threat of US sanctions, strongly take up the issue of cross-border terrorism with focus on ensuring Afghanistan wasn’t used forForeign secretary Harsh Shringla said that there was a particular focus on counter-terrorism during the talks and also highlighted the specific mention of LeT in the joint statement in the context of the terror threat from Afghanistan. ``The leaders emphasised that Afghanistan’s territory should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing any terrorist groups including ISIS, Al Qaeda, LeT etc,’’ said the joint statement titled partnership for peace, progress and prosperity. Asked whether or not the China-related border concerns were raised, the government said all issues in the Indo-Pacific and India’s security concerns were discussed. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the S-400 deal was being implemented, while hailing India for not listening to the US on the issue. "We witnessed attempts on the part of the US to undermine this cooperation and make India obey the American orders. Our Indian friends clearly and firmly explained that they are a sovereign country and they will decide on whose weapons to buy and who is going to be a partner of India in this and the other areas," he said. While differences over the Indo-Pacific initiative remained, Modi and Putin outlined the priorities in Afghanistan which, they said, included ensuring formation of a truly inclusive and representative government, combating terrorism and drug trafficking, providing immediate humanitarian assistance and preserving the rights of women, children and minorities. ``The 2 leaders also reiterated strong support for a peaceful, secure and stable Afghanistan while emphasising the respect for sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and non-interference in its internal affairs,’’ said the joint statement. Welcoming Putin earlier, Modi said in his public remarks that while there had been many fundamental changes at the global level in the last several decades, and a number of geo-political equations had emerged, India-Russia friendship had been a constant among all these variables. ``Both the countries have not only cooperated with each other without any hesitation but have also taken special care of each other's sensitivities. It is truly a unique and reliable model of inter-state friendship,’’ said Modi, while recalling that the 2 sides had set a target of $30 billion in trade and $50 billion in investment by 2025. Read AlsoIndia, Russia ink 28 pacts; decide to expand cooperation in dealing with terrorismNEW DELHI: India and Russia on Monday inked 28 agreements to further broad-base their partnership and vowed to expand cooperation and coordination in dealing with major challenges like the threat of terrorism and the unfolding situation in Afghanistan. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan ShringlaPutin said Russia had been promoting military-technical cooperation with India “like with no other partner of ours’’. He described the developments in Afghanistan as a matter of great concern. While talking about the focus on terrorism and Afghanistan, Shringla said the 2 sides held similar views on what was required to deal with groups like Al Qaeda, ISIL and LeT. The mention of LeT in the Afghanistan context is significant for India because of a lack of a consensus in Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral mechanism over naming of terror groups as China remains opposed to any mention of groups like LeT and JeM. The recent RIC joint communique had specifically mentioned ISIL and Al Qaeda but not LeT. "They reaffirmed their firm commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its financing, the dismantling of terrorist infrastructure and countering radicalization, to ensure that Afghanistan would never become a safe haven for global terrorism,’’ said the joint statement. The 2 leaders also “highly appreciated’’ the finalisation of the roadmap of interaction between India and Russia on Afghanistan which, according to the joint statement, symbolised convergence of views and interests of the two Sides. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov suggested after the inaugural 2+2 dialogue that India and Iran could be included in the extended troika on Afghanistan. While Russia again expressed serious concerns over the Indo-Pacific and Quad initiatives, according to the India there was a realisation that both sides were already working together in the region, including in the form of the Chennai-Vladivostok corridor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/focus-on-afghanistan-terror-in-russia-summit-s-400-supplies-to-continue/articleshow/88131393.cms||Sachin Parashar

---||World||US sanctions DRCongo figure as Biden unveils anti-graft plan||The United States on Monday slapped sanctions on a Democratic Republic of Congo associate of blacklisted Israeli investor Dan Gertler as President Joe Biden's administration released a new global anti-corruption strategy. The US treasury said Alain Mukonda helped reorganise Gertler's businesses and transferred millions of dollars for him after the Israeli tycoon's oil and mining businesses in DRC were hobbled by earlier sanctions. Mukonda set up companies for Gertler and moved between $11 million and $13.5 million into them, the treasury said, helping Gertler skirt sanctions aimed at blocking him from accessing the global financial system. "Treasury is committed to supporting the Democratic Republic of the Congo's anti-corruption efforts by going after those that abuse the political system for economic gain and unfairly profit from the Congolese state," said Treasury deputy secretary Wally Adeyemo in a statement. The announcement came as the White House unveiled its "first-ever US government strategy on countering corruption". The core aim of the strategy, which comes ahead of International Anti-corruption Day on Thursday, is to tighten regulations on US real estate transactions to prevent them from being used to launder money earned through trafficking, embezzlement or bribes. It also aims to increase financial transparency by identifying better who is behind shell or front companies. "As a fundamental threat to the rule of law, corruption hollows out institutions, corrodes public trust, and fuels popular cynicism toward effective, accountable governance," the strategy document said. "Corruption robs citizens of equal access to vital services, denying the right to quality healthcare, public safety, and education. It degrades the business environment, subverts economic opportunity, and exacerbates inequality." Congress passed a law in January requiring US companies to declare their beneficial owners to the federal government. This marked a breakthrough in the United States, where laws on the matter are extremely flexible, in particular in Delaware, Biden's home state. The White House wants to better regulate real-estate transactions, particularly when made in cash. "With the United States being the world's largest economy, we understand that we bear particular responsibility to address our own regulatory deficiencies," a senior administration official said. In a report published in August, the Washington think tank Global Financial Integrity (GFI) estimated that in the last five years, at least $2.3 billion in dirty money had been laundered through real estate transactions in the United States. "Yet the US remains the only G7 country that does not require real estate professionals to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations," it said. The sanctions on Mukonda are part of a growing US effort against key figures whose alleged corruption retards development in poorer countries. Gertler, a close friend of former DRC President Joseph Kabila, was first sanctioned by the United States in 2017 for allegedly cheating the country of about $1.4 billion in revenues through opaque mining deals. With Mukonda, 46 people and entities in Gertler's network have been placed on the US Treasury blacklist. The Treasury said it "is committed to ensuring that Gertler is not able to corruptly profit from continued access and influence in the DRC and globally." The Treasury added that it plans to announce a series of sanctions this week in the lead-up to International Anti-corruption Day and, on Friday, International Human Rights Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-sanctions-drcongo-figure-as-biden-unveils-anti-graft-plan/articleshow/88131564.cms||---
---||India||Pak lynching: Govt to review counter-terrorism strategy, says minister||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s human rights minister said on Monday that the government has decided to review the country’s National Action Plan (NAP) against terrorism in the wake of the lynching of a Sri Lankan national over blasphemy allegations. The implementation of a 20-point NAP, aimed at rooting out Islamist terrorism and religious extremism, was agreed between Pakistan’s military and civilian leaders after the 2014 attack on a school in Peshawar that had left around 150 people dead, 132 of them school kids. While some of its provisions, like action against terrorism and formation of military courts, were implemented, most of the measures that were agreed upon to stem terrorism and extremism were completely ignored. Whenever any violent incident of Islamic extremism occurs in Pakistan, the government vows to implement NAP in letter and spirit. The lynching of a Sri Lankan resident by an angry mob has prompted Pakistani authorities again to call for “strict government action (implementation of NAP)”, terming it the “need of the hour”. “This lynching was not the first of its kind. We have seen the case of Mashal Khan (a university student lynched by fellow students on the campus in Mardan in the northwest), and two of our Christian community members (lynched in Sialkot) were burnt.... it’s now time to take definitive action as the state,” Pakistan’s human rights minister Shireen Mazari told local media. She said the distortion of religion and torture of people in its wake should be condemned in the strongest terms. The minister also expressed worry over growing “extremism” in the country, saying that NAP has to be fully enforced to combat the menace. Priyantha Kumara, 48, was working as a manager at a Pakistani textile factory in Sialkot. Hundreds of violent protesters, including employees of the factory where the slain foreigner was a manager, had tortured him to death on Friday and later burnt his body. His remains were sent to Colombo from Lahore airport on Monday. The inhuman incident came days after the government had lifted a ban on a far-right religious party, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), known for its protests in opposition to any change to Pakistan’s blasphemy law since its formation in 2015. The party was formed after taking a firm stand to defend the killer of Salman Taseer, Punjab’s former governor. Taseer was gunned down by his own bodyguard Mumtaz Qadri for speaking in support of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who had spent a decade in prison over blasphemy charges. The TLP, however, has distanced, itself from Kumara’s killing, but its supporters and followers strongly defend his killers on social media forums. An FIR was registered against 900 workers of Rajco Industries on the application of a senior official of a local police station. Armaghan Maqt, the applicant, stated in the FIR that the protesters had slapped, kicked, punched and hit Kumara with sticks in his presence, and dragged him out of the factory on Wazirabad Road in Sialkot where he died. They then set the body on fire. The SHO said he was helpless in front of the mob owing to shortage of police personnel. Over the past three days, the police have arrested dozens of suspects. According to police, out of the 131 people arrested, 26 had played a “central role” in the brutal killing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pak-lynching-govt-to-review-counter-terrorism-strategy-says-minister/articleshow/88131498.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Biden announces diplomatic boycott of Beijing Olympics||WASHINGTON: The United States will stage a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing to protest Chinese human rights abuses, the White House confirmed Monday -- a move that China has vowed to greet with ``firm countermeasures". "The US diplomatic or official representation would treat these games as business as usual in the face of the PRC's egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang, and we simply can't do that," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during Monday's briefing. She said that the US athletes will continue to compete and will ``have our full support", but added ``we will not be contributing to the fanfare of the games". "We have a fundamental commitment to promoting human rights. And we feel strongly in our position and we will continue to take actions to advance human rights in China and beyond,'' Psaki added. Biden this week will host a White House Summit for Democracy, a virtual gathering of leaders and civil society experts from more than 100 countries that is set to take place Thursday and Friday. The administration has said that Biden intends to use the convening "to announce both individual and collective commitments, reforms and initiatives to defend democracy and human rights at home and abroad". Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Robert Menendez, D-N.J., called such a diplomatic boycott ``a necessary step to demonstrate our unwavering commitment to human rights in the face of the Chinese government's unconscionable abuses". He called on ``other allies and partners that share our values to join with the United States in this diplomatic boycott". Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian accused the US politicians of grandstanding over the issue of not sending dignitaries to attend events that China hopes will showcase its economic development and technological prowess. Speaking to reporters at a daily briefing, Zhao said such a move would be an "outright political provocation", but gave no details on how China might retaliate. Human rights advocates and lawmakers in the US who support a boycott say it is a necessary step. They cite China's poor record on human rights as justification, saying China is using the games to whitewash its ill treatment of civil rights activists, political dissidents and ethnic minorities. "Without being invited, American politicians keep hyping the so-called diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics, which is purely wishful thinking and grandstanding," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing. If the US side is bent on going its own way, China will take firm countermeasures". The dispatching of high-level delegations to each Olympics has long been a tradition among the US and other leading nations. Then-President George W. Bush attended the opening of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Summer Games. First lady Jill Biden led the American contingent to the Summer Olympics in Tokyo this year and second gentleman Doug Emhoff led a delegation to the Paralympic Games. The possibility of a diplomatic boycott comes as the U.S. attempts to stabilize turbulent relations with Beijing, even as it maintains a tough approach toward trade and conflicts over China's actions on Taiwan, human rights, Hong Kong and the South China Sea. Beijing has mounted a stiff response to all US criticisms, denouncing them as interference in its internal affairs and slapping visa bans on American politicians it regards as anti-China. It wasn't clear who the US might have sent to Beijing for the games and Zhao's comments appeared to indicate that China has not extended any invitations. Australia, whose ties with China have nosedived over a range of disputes, has also raised the possibility of a diplomatic boycott.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-announces-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-winter-olympics/articleshow/88131582.cms||---

---||India||Political compulsions can’t undo verdict: SC to Maharashtra||NEW DELHI: In a setback to the Maharashtra government just a day before the last date of filing nomination papers for elections to local bodies, the Supreme Court on Monday stayed the ordinance brought by the state to reserve 27% seats for OBCs in these bodies and directed the Election Commission to stay the polls. The SC questioned the state for bypassing its verdict on OBC reservation by taking the ordinance route without fulfilling the “triple test” criteria, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. “Your political compulsion cannot be the basis to undo our judgement,” the SC told the state. The court noted that the state government’s decision was violative of its March judgement in which it had held the government cannot justify the reservation for OBCs without fulfilling the ‘triple test’ — (1) setting up a dedicated Commission to conduct empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness qua local bodies (2) specifying the proportion of reservation required to be given and (3) in any case such reservation shall not exceed aggregate of 50% of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together. Senior Advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioners, contended that the ordinance was illegal, unconstitutional and not in conformity with the SC’s ruling and sought immediate stay. Opposing the interim stay, senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, appearing for state, contended that no one from the OBC community would be represented in local bodies if it is stayed. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar, however, said, "You (the state) have to face the problem as you have created the problem. It amounts to undoing the judgement of the Constitution bench and three-judge bench in March." The bench then directed the state EC to not proceed with the polls on seats reserved for OBCs. It, however, clarified that the Commission can conduct polls on the rest of reserved for SC and ST and the unreserved seats as per the schedule fixed by it. The SC on March 4 upheld validity of the Maharashtra law to reserve seats for backward classes in Zila Parishad election but said it cannot be implemented till the government meets the triple conditions fixed by its Constitution bench. Noting that even the first step of setting up of Commission remained a "mirage" and the state itself conceded that in case of some local bodies, the reservation has far exceeded 50 per cent, the apex court quashed all the notifications issued by the state for OBC reservation in election. Exactly ten months after its verdict, the apex court again blocked the state move for OBC quota in local bodies election and said although the state appointed the commission but it moved ahead without waiting for the report of the commission. The court said that the state government passing ordinance impinges its verdict and cannot be allowed. The state government had brought an ordinance to amend two laws — the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayats — to ensure reservation for OBC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/political-compulsions-cant-undo-verdict-sc-to-maharashtra/articleshow/88131857.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Omicron scare: Expert panel split, call on additional dose put off||NEW DELHI: The scientific advisory group on Covid immunisation has deferred “any decision on additional dose” in the absence of consensus on whether there is a need to administer a ‘booster’ to those at high risk of infection or severe illness caused by the coronavirus. “No recommendation has been made by the NTAGI yet,” a senior official told TOI. Read AlsoCovid: 85% adults got at least 1 dose, over 50% fully vaccinated85% of India's adult population has been vaccinated with at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted to announce this on Monday evening.Experts remain more keen on protecting immunocompromised children with vaccination, for which guidelines are likely to be submitted by the end of this week. Sources said the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) for Covid-19 has assessed data, which shows high seropositivity in the country’s population. Some experts, however, are of the view that healthcare workers (who were among the first to be vaccinated), those who are immunocompromised, and the elderly may have waning immunity and can be at higher risk, particularly in the wake of the emergence of new variants. “The NTAGI will wait for the WHO’s guidance on the issue and deliberate again,” an official said. Read AlsoOmicron mutations may provide clues about origin, analysis showsOmicron’s unusually large number of mutations on the gene that helps the coronavirus spread may provide clues as to how it developed, according to computational analysis of the variant. The co-existence of mutations on the so-called S-gene that would normally inhibit the ability of the virus toThe World Health Organisation’s scientific advisory board is also scheduled to meet on December 7 to deliberate on the issue of additional dose for those who might be vulnerable to severe infection. Officials said at present there is no concrete evidence to suggest waning immunity as far as vaccines in India are concerned. “However, we are watching the data closely, including the trend in hospitalised patients or that of re-infection. Such decisions cannot be taken in a hurry just because there is a new variant,” the official said. The fact that most people here are young and have a good level of immunity is also relevant, he added. Recently, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG ) said low levels of neutralising antibodies from existing vaccines may not be sufficient to neutralise the new variant Omicron, suggesting a booster dose can be considered for people above 40, prioritising those at high-risk or high-exposure. The government maintains there are adequate stocks of vaccine but a decision on booster doses and vaccination for kids will be taken on scientific advice. As on Monday morning, there were over 21 crore unutilised doses of vaccine available with states and Union territories. Besides, the government is expecting at least 31 crore doses of Covishield and Covaxin to be available by the end of this month. While 85% of the country’s adult population — that is currently eligible for Covid vaccination — has received at least one dose and 50% are fully vaccinated with both doses, the government’s focus currently is to maximise vaccination coverage and ensure all adults are fully vaccinated as per their schedule.

The state authorities, as a precautionary measure, have promulgated prohibitory orders in the affected areas,” he said, first in the Lok Sabha and then the Rajya Sabha, assuring that the situation was tense but under control.

Though deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh called on RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha, who had submitted his name to the Chair, to seek clarification, he had to adjourn the House for the day due to lack of order. Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio during a mass funeral of civilians who were killed by security forces, in Mon district on Monday. (Reuters)Shah, in his statement informed both Houses that an additional secretary from the ministry of home affairs (MHA) was in Kohima to review the situation and had on Monday discussed with the state brass the steps to restore normalcy at the earliest. It was decided during the meetings with the Nagaland chief secretary and senior officers of the para-military forces that all agencies should ensure that such unfortunate incidents do not recur while undertaking operations against the insurgents in the future. The home minister said the state DGP had visited the spot and an FIR has been registered. Considering the complexity of the case, it has been transferred to the state crime police station (SCPS) and a special investigation team (SIT) constituted and directed to complete the investigation within one month. The home minister mentioned the Army 3 Corps’ press statement deeply regretting the incident and its aftermath. The statement had said that the cause of the unfortunate loss of lives was being investigated at the highest level and that appropriate action would be taken as per law. Sharing he had got in touch with the Nagaland governor soon after learning of the incident, Shah said the MHA was monitoring the situation in consultation with the chief secretary and DGP. “More forces have been deployed in the area to prevent any further untoward incident,” he said. The home minister said that based on inputs received by the Indian Army about movement of insurgents near Tiru village in Tizit area of Nagaland’s Mon district, a team of the 21 Para-Special Forces of Indian Army laid an ambush on Saturday evening. During the ambush, an approaching vehicle was signalled to stop. However, the vehicle tried to flee, which aroused suspicion that it was carrying insurgents. This led the Army to fire upon the vehicle, resulting in the killing of six out of eight persons travelling in it. “It turned out to be a case of mistaken identity. The two persons who sustained injuries were evacuated to the medical facilities by the Army personnel,” Shah shared. The local villagers thereafter surrounded the Army team, burnt two of their vehicles and assaulted the personnel, leading to the death of one and injuring several others personnel. To disperse the crowd, the security forces opened fire which resulted in killing of seven more civilians. “The local administration and police have tried to defuse the situation, which remains tense,” said Shah. He added that on Sunday evening, a 250-strong mob tried to ransack the company operating base (COB) of Assam Rifles at Mon town. The mob burnt buildings of the COB following which troops had to open fire to disperse the mob. One civilian was killed while another was injured in the firing. As soon as the Lok Sabha met on Monday morning, opposition members, including Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay, raised the issue. In response, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi assured the House that the home minister will make a detailed statement on it. Speaker Om Birla told the House that the home minister has given him in writing that he will make a statement on the incident in the House, later in the day. On Sunday evening, an agitated crowd targeted Assam Rifles company operating base and forces had to open fire in which one civilian was killed, Shah stated. It has been decided all agencies must ensure such incidents do not happen in the future during action against insurgents, the minister said. Expressing dissatisfaction with the statement, opposition parties including the Congress, DMK, SP, BSP and the NCP walked out of the House. Earlier in the day, Lok Sabha members condemned the Nagaland incident and demanded an impartial probe. Members also called for the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). On Sunday, the Army expressed deep regret over the incident and ordered a Court of Inquiry. According to the police in Nagaland's capital Kohima, it was investigating whether the incident was a case of mistaken identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-killing-nagaland-civilians-unfortunate-shah-tells-house/articleshow/88132069.cms||---
---||World||NYC to impose vaccine mandate on private sector employers||NEW YORK: From multinational banks to corner grocery stores, all private employers in New York City will have to require their workers to get vaccinated against the Covid-19, the mayor announced Monday in the most sweeping vaccine mandate of any state or big city in the United States.  The move by mayor Bill de Blasio comes as cases are climbing again in the US and the worrisome but little-understood Omicron variant is gaining a toehold in the nation's largest city and elsewhere around the country.  "We in New York City have decided to use a preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of Covid and the dangers it's causing to all of us," he said.  De Blasio, a Democrat with just weeks left in office, said the mandate will take effect December 27, with in-person workers needing to provide proof they have received at least one dose of the vaccine. And they will not be allowed to get out of the requirement by agreeing to regular Covid-19 testing instead.  The measure will apply to roughly 184,000 businesses not covered by previous vaccine mandates, ranging from big corporations to mom-and-pop businesses in the city of 8.8 million people, according to a spokesperson for the mayor. The city's private-sector workforce is 3.7 million.  De Blasio said the move is aimed at staving off a spike of infections amid holiday gatherings and as cold weather drives more people indoors, where the virus can spread more easily.  Vaccine rules across states and cities vary widely, with some states resisting any mandates and others requiring the shots for government employees or certain sectors that run a particularly high risk, such as health care workers.  But no state has announced a broad private-sector mandate like New York City's, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan National Academy for State Health Policy.  President Joe Biden sought to impose a less far-reaching mandate nationally, requiring employees of businesses with 100 or more workers to either get vaccinated or undergo regular testing. But federal courts have blocked that plan for now ahead of the January 4 deadline.  De Blasio said he expects his mandate to survive any legal challenges. Employees will be able to ask for religious or medical exemptions.  The mayor also announced that anyone 12 or older who wants to dine indoors at a restaurant, go to a gym or see a show will have to produce proof of having received two shots of the vaccine, up from the current requirement of one dose. In addition, children ages 5 to 11 will have to show proof of at least one shot, de Blasio said.  De Blasio said he will release more details next week about how the mandate will be enforced.  About 5.9 million adults in New York City have gotten at least a first dose, out of 7 million people age 18 and up. That translates to 84%. About 5.8 million New Yorkers of all ages are fully vaccinated.  Cases of the omicron variant have been reported in about one-third of the states, but scientists cannot say for certain yet whether it is more dangerous than previous versions. The delta variant still accounts for practically all infections in the U.S., and a rise in cases in recent weeks has swamped hospitals, especially in the Midwest and New England.  Health experts have strongly urged people to get their shots and a booster, saying they believe the vaccine will still offer protection against the new form of the virus.  "Vaccination is the central weapon in this war against COVID. It's the one thing that has worked every single time across the board," de Blasio said at a virtual news conference.  "A lot of folks to me in the private sector have said to me they believe in vaccination, but they're not quite sure how they can do it themselves," he continued. "Well, we're going to do it."  Vaccinations are already required in New York City for hospital and nursing home workers and for city employees, including teachers, police officers and firefighters. A vaccination mandate for employees of private and religious schools was announced last week.  Some other private-sector employees, including those at restaurants, gyms, theaters and other entertainment sites, were also required to be vaccinated under rules issued earlier by the mayor.  De Blasio, who leaves office at the end of the month and has indicated he may seek the nomination for governor of New York next year, has sought to portray himself as a national leader in the fight against Covid-19. His other vaccine mandates have largely survived legal challenges, and he has credited the policy with raising vaccination rates among the reluctant.  The new mandate takes effect days before de Blasio leaves office and Democrat Eric Adams is due to be sworn in. Evan Thies, a spokesman for Adams, said in a statement that the mayor-elect "will evaluate this mandate and other COVID strategies when he is in office and make determinations based on science, efficacy and the advice of health professionals."  The Greater New York Chamber of Commerce, which includes some 30,000 businesses big and small, said it supports the tightened measures.  But other industry groups said the plan would add to the strain on businesses still struggling to recover from the pandemic and find enough employees.  Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a leading business group, said it is unclear who will enforce the mandate and whether it is even legal.  "It is hard to imagine that the mayor can do what the president is being challenged to accomplish," Wylde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nyc-to-impose-vaccine-mandate-on-private-sector-employers/articleshow/88132179.cms||---
---||India||Apex court grants permanent commission to 12 women SSC officers released from service||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday took the unprecedented step of granting permanent commission to 14 women short service commission (SSC) officers, 12 of whom had already been released from service without grant of PC, and heaped praise on the armed forces for displaying a complete change in mindset and supporting equal status for female officers. After resisting the induction of women SSC officers post their release from service and citing provisions of the Army Act, the authorities bowed to the persistence of a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna, who deluged additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain and senior advocate R Balasubramanian with the importance of fair play and women empowerment and persuaded them to impress upon the authorities the importance of providing equal opportunities to women in armed forces. Stung by the bench’s remark during the last hearing — “discharging short service commission women army officers without a comprehensive evaluation about their ability to meet threshold level would be a disservice to the nation and the armed forces”, the ASG and Balasubramanian persuaded the Army authorities to take a fresh evaluation of the credentials and fitness of the 12 women SSC officers and reported back to the court that these officers would be granted permanent commission. However, Jain cited Section 2(2) of the Army Act to request the court to order their reinstatement in the Army and grant of permanent commission. But, senior advocates V Mohana and Huzefa Ahmadi told the court that since the Army authorities had discharged the 12 women SSC officers in complete disregard of the apex court’s judgment, their services should be regularised without a break, which was caused by the unfair release from service. The bench struck a balance and ordered their reinstatement while clarifying that since it was being done on court orders and because of pending proceedings, the provision of the Army Act would not come into play. The 12 women SSC officers who would get permanent commission are — Gopika Bhati, Vandana Grover, Nitisha, Madhvi Singh, Kavita Gusain, Vandana Sharma, Sonali Singh, Anuradha Dhadwal, Ipsa Ratha, Umeed Tahapa, Parkhee Preetal Anil and Selokar Amita Namdeo. The SC also ordered the Army authorities to grant permanent commission to two other women SSC officers — Preeti Shinthe and Poonam Sharda, who were scheduled to be discharged in March next year. Out of a total of 615 women SSC officers in the zone of consideration for grant of PC, 86 did not opt for it and 529 had already been granted PC. Out of the remaining 42, half were found unfit and released from service. Of the balance 21, five opted out, three faced disciplinary/vigilance inquiry, one referred to and another's medical documents were under scrutiny. Remaining 14 have qualified for grant of PC, Jain informed the SC. Justices Chandrachud and Bopanna were in praise of the armed forces for showing remarkable and praiseworthy change of attitude and approach towards women officers. The bench recalled a recent statement of the Indian Navy chief about posting women officers in warships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/apex-court-grants-pc-to-12-women-ssc-officers-released-from-service/articleshow/88132272.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The number of Covidcases at a central government-run school in Narasimharajapura taluk in Chikkamagaluru district crossed the 100-mark on Monday, with 35 more students and three staffers testing positive on Monday. On Sunday, 59 students and 10 staffers (teaching and non-teaching) had tested positive for the virus. The cluster was detected when a teacher had tested positive four days ago. In all, 104, including 94 students, have tested positive so far. There has been a series of cluster outbreaks in educational institutions across the state. “All our concerns will be placed before the Covid-19 technical advisory committee and we will take a decision based on its suggestions,” Bommai said on the sidelines of his campaign in North Karnataka for the December 10MLC polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-cases-in-karnataka-school-cross-100-mark/articleshow/88132429.cms||---

Singh’s blunt statement came in the backdrop of the deepening partnership between Russia and China, which has also seen Beijing emerge as one of Moscow’s top clients in terms of arms imports. “The pandemic, the extra-ordinary militarisation and expansion of armaments in our neighbourhood and the completely unprovoked aggression on our northern border since early summer of 2020 have thrown in several challenges,” the minister said during the inaugural two-plus-two dialogue with Russia. While noting that New Delhi was confident of overcoming these challenges, Singh said, “Recognising that its development needs are colossal and that its defence challenges are legitimate, real and immediate, India seeks partners who are sensitive and responsive to India’s expectations and requirements.” Expressing hope that Russia will remain “a major partner” for India in these changing circumstances, he called for greater military-technical collaboration, advanced research, co-development and co-production of defence equipment, which can lead to self-reliance in defence production in India. “Separately, we proposed greater engagements in central Asia and the Indian Ocean region,” he said. Preceding the two-plus-two dialogue, the 20th meeting of India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) was held between the delegations led by Singh and his counterpart General Sergey Shoigu. The agreement on the programme for military-technical cooperation from 2021-2031 was inked during the meeting. Another clear takeaway was the Rs 5,124 crore contract for procurement of 6,01,427 AK-203 assault rifles through the joint venture called Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited. Among the other deals in the pipeline is the $1.5 billion one for the IGLA-S very-short range air defence missile systems (VSHORADS). The deal will involve an initial off-the-shelf purchase of the shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile systems followed by technology transfer to Bharat Dynamics for subsequent production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-and-russia-ink-10-yr-pact-on-defence-tech-deal-on-ak-rifles/articleshow/88132477.cms||Rajat Pandit

This draconian act should be removed,” Rio said while addressing mourne-rs at a mass funeral service for the 14 civilian victims of Saturday’s botched Army operation in Mon. He said AFSPA had been in force in Nagaland for 59 years, 25 of those despite a ceasfire with insurgent groups. “But still they (centre) do not remove the Act. They (Centre) argue that insurgency and the Naga movement are still alive, and till the conflict is resolved, they cannot remove this Act. I am asking them, when all insurgent groups are in ceasefire and there is peace, why do you tag our state as a disturbed area? Everytime the state cabinet recommends to the Centre not to extend the disturbed area tag, Delhi extends it.” Meghalaya CM Sangma said he would personally speak to Shah about the need to repeal AFSPA. “We have seen that putting AFSPA has not really given any result and in the last many years that the Act has been there, it has only been counter-productive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-ne-cms-both-nda-allies-want-afspa-gone/articleshow/88132669.cms||Prabin Kalita

The report said the villagers attacked the troops after seeing their dead brethren and the commandos “again opened fire”, leading to the death of seven more civilians. “Eyewitnesses have confirmed that the Special Force personnel fired indiscriminately as they fled the scene towards Assam, even shooting at coal miners’ huts on the way.” The villagers, the report said, found that the Special Force personnel were “trying to hide” the six bodies by “wrapping and loading them in another pick-up truck, apparently with the intention of taking” them to “their base camp”. “On finding the bodies... under a tarpaulin, violence broke out... the irate villagers burnt three vehicles belonging to the Special Forces,” the report said.  Eight villagers were returning home in a pick-up truck when “they were ambushed and killed by security forces (reportedly, 21 Para-Special Forces based in Assam ) at random, apparently without any attempt for identification”, it said. “They were all unarmed civilians... travelling in an open pick-up truck in broad daylight...,” the report said.  Fourteen civilians were gravely wounded and two of them were taken to Assam “by the security forces” and admitted to hospital, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/commandos-found-trying-to-hide-bodies-top-official/articleshow/88132641.cms||Prabin Kalita

---||India||Major General to head court of inquiry||NEW DELHI: New Delhi: The Army has begun a court of inquiry (CoI) headed by a Major General to probe all the circumstances under which the botched operation by the 21 Para-Special Forces took place in the Mon district of Nagaland on Saturday evening. The CoI will also examine the so-called “credible intelligence” on the basis of which the special forces detachment led by a Major was deployed for the operation that eventually led to the death of at least 14 civilians and a soldier. “The entire chain of events, from the initial ambush going horribly wrong to the clash that erupted later with enraged civilians, will be examined,” said a senior officer on Monday. “The Army has fully accepted its mistake…there was no intent to kill any civilians. The CoI will fix responsibility for acts of omission and commission,” he added.  The botched operation was in all probability the result of faulty intelligence, which was not properly corroborated and verified in the rush to lay the ambush, and lack of due diligence, coupled with the intense pressure on the security forces to deliver results in counter-insurgency operations in the northeast, as was reported by TOI. The 21 Para-SF, incidentally, is a much-decorated battalion affiliated to the Army’s Dimapur-based 3 Corps. Among other operations, the elite unit was awarded one Kirti Chakra, one Shaurya Chakra and five Sena Medals for the cross-border raid against two insurgent camps around 10-km inside Myanmar in June 2015 after 18 Indian soldiers were killed in an ambush in Chandel district of Manipur. The 21 Para-SF detachment involved in Saturday’s operation claims “a rifle-like thing” was seen being carried by one of eight passengers in their open Mahindra pick-up truck through surveillance devices like spotter-scopes from a distance on the Oting-Tiru road. The commandos say they opened fire only after the pick-up truck did not stop despite being flagged down by their scouts. On realizing that the “suspects” were actually unarmed coal miners, and not insurgents of the Yung Aung faction of proscribed outfit NSCN (K) as the intelligence had claimed, the commandos called for medical help for the two of the eight civilians who were still alive. It was while the commandos were waiting for medical and police teams to arrive that they were surrounded by enraged villagers from the area, some of them armed with machetes. The ensuing clash saw seven more civilians and a soldier being killed, with several more being grievously injured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/major-general-to-head-court-of-inquiry/articleshow/88132776.cms||Rajat Pandit

Biden and Putin are due to speak by video conference on Tuesday with Ukraine certain to dominate the agenda as a Russian troop build-up has fuelled concerns of a possible attack. Moscow denies any such plan.  Ahead of the talks, Reed's parents Joey and Paula said they feared a major escalation over Ukraine could deal a setback to their 30-year-old son's chances of getting released.  "We need president Biden to do whatever it takes to bring our son home before it's too late. We don't want Trevor... left behind," they said in a statement to Reuters.  Reed, from Texas, was sentenced to nine years in jail last year after being found guilty of endangering the lives of two policemen in Moscow while drunk on a visit in 2019. He denied the charges and the United States called his trial a "theatre of the absurd".  He and Paul Whelan, an American jailed in Russia on spying charges he denied, have been touted as possible candidates for a prisoner swap with the United States.  Russian media have touted Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot serving 20 years for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine and Viktor Bout, a Russian arms trafficker serving a 25-year prison sentence, as possible candidates for a swap.  "He (Reed) needs his president to bring him and Paul Whelan home and he needs elected officials to support the president in doing what it takes to make that happen," the statement from the parents said.  Reed and Whelan are on a long list of contentious issues between Putin and Biden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ex-us-marines-parents-urge-biden-to-push-for-jailed-sons-freedom-at-putin-talks/articleshow/88132800.cms||---

A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh, however, allowed the state police to proceed with its investigations against Singh. In the meanwhile, CBI told the bench that those cases should be transferred to the agency as it is already conducting a probe into the allegation levelled by the IPS officer against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. “We have no objection if the probe is given to us,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the bench which asked the agency to file its response on affidavit. However, the state government opposed the plea for transfer of probe to CBI and senior advocate Darius Kambatta told the Bench that Param Bir Singh is not the whistleblower he has projected himself as, but was part of the system and responsible for transfers and postings which he now says involved corruption. “He turned whistleblower when he started feeling the heat,” he told the bench. Opposing the CBI probe, Kambatta pointed out that the present CBI director was also part of the transfer and posting decisions when he was the DGP of the state and he will be “a witness if not accused” in the case. He said the Bombay high court has already reserved its verdict on a plea for court-monitored SIT probe on the FIR lodged by CBI against Deshmukh. He said CBI Director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal was part of the Police Establishment Board (PEB) that oversaw the transfers and postings of police officers in question.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-sees-chances-of-bias-restrains-mumbai-police-from-filing-charges-against-pbs/articleshow/88132781.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Flyers deferring leisure trips but cancellations not high||NEW DELHI: Delta delayed the wedding of Mayank and Khushi Bansal (names changed on request) from March to last week. And now Omicron has forced this Delhi-based couple to defer their dream honeymoon in Switzerland indefinitely. “Several Schengen states are witnessing an upsurge in cases. Also, we don’t want to fly back to IGIA and spend hours there with thousands of other passengers for our on-arrival RT-PCR test,” said Mayank on Monday — ironically the day Switzerland, that accepts Covaxin and is a big magnet for desi travellers, got an air bubble with India allowing direct flights between the two countries for the first time since last March. The Bansals are not alone. Stricter testing and quarantine norms globally following the latest mutant has led to many deferring their non-essential travel plans to and from India. Given the fact that regular international flights had not yet opened and only those with a real reason to travel had booked the few super expensive bubble options, cancellations are still not high as the world is watching with bated breath the real impact of Omicron. Essential travel is still happening. Travel Agent Federation of India joint secretary Anil Kalsi said: “No major change (cancellation) is being noticed as seat availability is nearly non existent. Avoidable business travel, which was anyway low, is being cancelled. Many leisure travellers supposed to go to Maldives this winter are rescheduling to March and April as refunds are not possible.” A Lufthansa spokesperson said: “Our flight capacities under the bubble system cover the most essential travel demand to and from India. Lufthansa bookings remains stable, flights are full. This clearly shows the continued trust people have in aviation as the safest way to travel.” Thomas Cook India MD Madhavan Menon said: “We are seeing rescheduling, not cancellations. Due to very high international airfares (under bubbles) and EU being one of our primary (source) markets, there was no real inbound anyway.” Regarding domestic travel, a top official of an Indian carrier said: “Advance bookings for travel beyond 15 or 30 days has dipped by 10-15%. We are not seeing a spurt in cancellations due to Omicron as of now.” Travel portal Yatra also said it has so far “not witnessed any cancellations or fare hike owing to the new variant as of now, but people are wary of future bookings and are enquiring about cancellation policies…. if anyone is choosing to cancel or postpone their travel, we are helping them make alternate plans.” Travellers remain wary given the experience earlier this year when Delta saw sudden imposition of travel restrictions, leaving many stuck in India and abroad. A Singapore Airlines spokesperson said: “(we are) closely monitoring the situation…. will make adjustments to our services where necessary. Singapore Airlines continues to operate direct passenger flights between Singapore and India (Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai). The health and safety of our customers and staff is our top priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/flyers-deferring-leisure-trips-but-cancellations-not-high/articleshow/88132824.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Upholding a decision of the Reserve Bank of India to decline permission to an Indian merchant, Akshay N Patel, from entering into an agreement to facilitate export of Chinese-made PPEs to US, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and B V Nagarathna said the deference of the RBI to the government policy banning export of PPEs was justified as it was in the public interest to stop shortage of PPEs during the pandemic. It said that exports from a foreign country to yet another country may not have caused shortage of PPEs in India but would surely have depleted the stocks in the world, which could have been grabbed by rich countries for hoarding and reduced India's share to import PPEs. Writing the judgment, Justice Chandrachud examined in detail the regulatory role of RBI in sync with the economic as well as regulatory policies of the government to nuance the role of the constitutional courts in issues involving such policies. The three-judge bench said the constitutional courts must be circumspect that "the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution do not become a weapon in the arsenal of private businesses to disable regulation enacted in the public interest."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cardinal-rule-for-courts-is-not-to-interfere-in-govt-policies-supreme-court/articleshow/88132850.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Childless Hindu widow's death leads to flawed property succession: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Two decades after India celebrated the year of women empowerment, a 65-year-old law continues to discriminate against women in matters of property succession requiring the Supreme Court to intervene on Monday and ask solicitor general Tushar Mehta to provide the Centre's views on a flawed provision of the Hindu Succession Act. Amicus Curiae Meenakshi Arora laid bare before a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna the glaring inequality in property succession as provided under the Act-on the death of an issueless Hindu married male, his properties would vest with his parents; in case of the death of an issueless widow, her properties, excluding those inherited by her from her parents, will vest not with her parents, but with her husband's parents or relatives. The preference in succession given to the husband's relatives on the properties of a childless widow, even if the properties were gifted to her by her parents or blood relatives, after her death appeared "clearly discriminatory" to the bench headed by Justice Chandrachud, which asked the SG to get the government's view on this within four weeks. Interestingly, if the issueless widow sells her property, which was inherited from her parents, and buys another property utilising that money, then that newly acquired property would not be categorised as inherited property to vest with her parents after her death. Mehta said the flaws in the succession law pointed out by the court concerning an issueless widow may require legislative intervention by Parliament. The bench agreed with the SG and said the discrepancy, which has remained in the statute books for so long, needs correction either through judicial or legislative intervention. An issueless widow faces another discrimination under the succession law. Whether the property is inherited from the father or mother, in both the cases, the devolution will be upon the 'heirs of the father'. That is, even if she inherits from her mother, the 'heirs of mother' cannot succeed. However, if the issueless woman dies survived by her mother, she would count as an heir along with the other heirs of the father. India had framed the National Policy for the Empowerment of Women in 2001, which included several policy measures to provide equal opportunities to women in all spheres of life for equal participation in every field of nation-building and work. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 for the first time allowed a Hindu female to become an absolute owner of property. She could inherit equally with a male counterpart and a window was also given importance regarding the succession of her husband's property as also to her father's property. The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 made the daughter, like son, a coparcener in a joint family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/childless-hindu-widows-death-leads-to-flawed-property-succession-supreme-court/articleshow/88132887.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Agreeing with advocate V K Biju, who appeared for petitioners - two social activists and a woman lawyer who said she was a victim of dowry harassment, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna said, "It is a field requiring legislative action after debate on social situation and remedial measures. The court orders may have serious consequences." "Legislative action too may have limited success as we have seen in other issues. Respect for women must come from within and be developed as a core social value," the bench said after Biju pointed out the recent cases of dowry deaths and rising number of dowry cases in Kerala requiring the governor to visit the women victimised for dowry. "We will refer it to the Law Commission for a comprehensive review of the existing laws against dowry harassment. The matter requires a fresh look to engage in crafting a suitable remedy," the bench said. Biju highlighted that while, on the one hand, Parliament has stepped in by enacting penal provisions, such as Sections 304B and Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 and the National Commission for Women has also been constituted, the wide prevalence of the social evil requires a fresh look so as to give more teeth to the legislation. The petitioners sought a direction to the government to designate in every government/public office, a Dowry Prohibition Officer, (as similar to Public Information Officer, under RTI Act, 2005) to implement the Dowry Prohibition Act in letter and spirit. The bench said the reliefs sought are in the realm of legislative policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-to-ask-law-panel-to-review-dowry-laws/articleshow/88132937.cms||---

BMC officials said the first patient in the city is a 37-year-old male, a resident of the western suburbs who returned home from South Africa on November 25. His 36-year-old fiancee, who had returned from the US on November 25, was among his high-risk contacts who were tested. Their Covid-positive samples, taken for genomic sequencing, showed the Omicron variant, said the health officials. Both are asymptomatic, vaccinated (with the Pfizer vaccine) and at present admitted in Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri, for observation, said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Five high-risk and 315 low-risk contacts of the couple have been traced and more are in the process of being traced, said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate.  In Mumbai, Omicron suspects have increased to 29 since surveillance started on December 1. "We have found 20 travellers from high-risk countries who are positive. They include 16 males and four females. While tracing the contacts of these 20 patients, we found nine were positive,'' said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. Samples of all these patients have been sent for whole genome sequencing. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Monday that the government needs to take strict measures as Omicron is now infecting children. Four children -the daughter and nieces of a Pimpri-Chinchwad patient -are among 10 identified with the Omicron variant in Maharashtra. Pawar said the Centre should come out with a policy on the booster dose. Meanwhile in Rajasthan, a 47-year-old man who arrived in Jaipur from Germany on November 27, a medical student from Ukraine and a 46-year-old person of the same Adarsh Nagar family where five persons have already been found infected with Omicron variant, tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. The health department will send samples of all the three suspected Omicron cases for genome sequencing. The state health department also intensified sampling and contact tracing in a case of a four-member family from South Africa which attended a wedding on November 28 and tested positive for Omicron variant of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-more-test-positive-for-omicron-in-mumbai-maharashtra-count-hits-10/articleshow/88132942.cms||---

---||World||Ghislaine Maxwell trial: British woman testifies about being forced to give massage to Epstein||NEW YORK : A British woman testified Monday that Ghislaine Maxwell pressured her into giving Jeffrey Epstein sexual massages when she was still a teenager, assuring her she would have "fun" with him.  The woman, testifying at Maxwell's sex-abuse trial in New York City using the pseudonym "Kate" to protect her privacy, described one episode during the mid-1990s at Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida estate where Maxwell left out a schoolgirl's outfit with a pleated skirt for her to wear for the financier.  "I thought it would be fun for you to take Jeffrey his tea in this outfit," the witness recalled Maxwell telling her.  After a sexual encounter that followed, the British socialite "asked me if I had fun" and told her, "You are such a good girl", she said.  The witness was the second woman to take the witness stand against Maxwell in federal court in Manhattan. But unlike the first, she was at the age of consent in Great Britain and the United States during her sexual contact with Epstein, so the judge barred her from detailing specific sex acts.  Maxwell, 59, has denied charges she groomed girls as young as 14 for Epstein who killed himself in jail in 2019. Her lawyers say the government is making her a scapegoat for Epstein's alleged sex crimes.  The woman who testified on Monday said she met Maxwell at age 17 through a friend of hers she had dated on and off, and was eager to be friends with the British socialite. Maxwell told her Epstein, then her boyfriend, was a philanthropist who could help her with her singing career, she said.  Maxwell also told her that Epstein was "demanding" when it came to sexual massages, saying it was "very difficult to keep up" with his needs, the witness said. After agreeing to give him massages in London, she was later flown on commercial flights to Florida, where she said the interactions continued when she was 18.  She recalled that the first time she saw Epstein naked, Maxwell was standing right next to him. "I remember it so clearly because I was terrified and frozen," she said.  By contrast, Maxwell's demeanor was "almost like a schoolgirl", she said. "Everything was fun. Everything seemed to be like a fun, silly joke."  She said she resisted "disengaging" from Maxwell and Epstein "because I had witnessed how connected they both were and I was fearful".  Asked about wanting to testify anonymously, she said, "I have a huge amount of humiliation and shame around the events that took place" and wanted to protect her child from knowing details.  On cross-examination, a lawyer for Maxwell got the witness to acknowledge instances where she had spoken out publicly about Epstein and Maxwell using her real name. The lawyer also asked whether her history of drug and alcohol abuse affected her memory.  "It has not had an impact on the memories I have always had," she said.  The jury also saw bank statements on Monday showing that between 1999 and 2007, roughly $30 million was transferred from Epstein's accounts to those of Maxwell's. About $7 million of that was used in the purchase of a helicopter, the records showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-british-woman-testifies-about-being-forced-to-give-massage-to-epstein/articleshow/88132983.cms||---

AICC general secretary Ajay Maken has been named the chairperson of the party's screening committee for the polls. A prominent Hindu face of the party, Jakhar has been picked for the coveted position following his meeting with Rahul Gandhi last week. Earlier, there had been reports that Jakhar was miffed with the party for not being suitably rehabilitated after being replaced by Navjot Singh Sidhu. After narrowly missing the race to succeed Amarinder Singh as the CM, Jakhar had turned down an offer to join Channi's cabinet as one of the two deputy chief ministers. Jakhar has been critical of the state government and has been posting cryptic tweets.

While the government insisted that the suspended MPs first express regret, the opposition ruled it out. The RS witnessed five adjournments owing to disruption by the opposition and barely ran for 45 minutes. Amid the deadlock, leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge and Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh met RS chairman Venkaiah Naidu with their demand for revocation of suspension of 12 MPs. Kharge said, "Suspension of MPs is in violation of the Constitution's provisions. So, question of apologising does not arise."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/house-disrupted-by-demands-to-revoke-suspension-of-mps/articleshow/88133012.cms||---

The country's large coastline with many major and minor ports is sensitive to drug trafficking through maritime also, the 2020-21 Smuggling in India, released by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence said. The report said that seizure of narcotic drugs such as heroin being smuggled on boats, ships emanating from the Gulf region and Iran in the recent past, coupled with some Covid-19 curbs on air, land routes, suggested that the sea route would be exploited by drug traffickers in future also. "Therefore, extra vigil is required for monitoring the territorial waters and the import consignments arriving through the sea route," the report said. Citing some examples, the report said on August 10 last year DRI officers seized 191 kg of heroin at JNCH port. The heroin was concealed under goods declared as "mulethi - a medicinal herb. "Concealment of narcotics in courier or postal parcels and containerized cargo poses a formidable challenge for the Customs and the DRI. The volume of trade makes it impractical to check all consignments," said the report, adding that this makes it imperative for the DRI to use data analytics for tracking such consignments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/courier-postal-cargo-favourite-modes-of-drug-trafficking-dri/articleshow/88133034.cms||Surojit Gupta

After the House reassembled at 2 pm, deputy chairman Harivansh sought initiation of a discussion on 'situation arising out of price rise in the country, including the rise in the prices of petroleum products". He called upon leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge to speak but the latter insisted on the Chair revoking suspension of the 12 MPs so that they could also be part of the discussion. "I request you to please call them inside (the House) for once," he said, even as the chair suggested that the leader of the opposition and leader of the House should sit together to find a solution to the issue. When Kharge continued with his plea to call the suspended MPs to the House, Harivansh called the name of Anand Sharma then Fauzia Khan and subsequently Manoj Jha to participate in the debate. However, no member was willing to initiate the debate on price rise. Opposition members started shouting, leading the deputy chairman to adjourn the House for an hour.

---||World||Myanmar's Suu Kyi convicted in further blow to democracy||BANGKOK: Aung San Suu Kyi, the civilian leader of Myanmar who was ousted in a de facto coup this year, was convicted on two charges on Monday and handed a four-year sentence that was quickly cut in half - in proceedings widely criticised as a further effort by the country's military rulers to roll back the democratic gains of recent years. They serve to cement a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the Nobel Peace laureate, who spent 15 years under house arrest for resisting the Southeast Asian nation's generals but then agreed to work alongside them when they promised to usher in democratic rule. Monday's verdict was the first in a series of cases brought against 76-year-old Suu Kyi since her arrest on February 1, the day the army seized power and prevented her National League for Democracy party starting a second term in office. If found guilty of all the charges she faces, Suu Kyi could be sentenced to more than 100 years in prison. She is being held by the military at an unknown location - and state TV reported that she would serve her sentence there. That sentence was reduced hours after it was handed down in what the report said was an amnesty ordered by the country's military leader, General Min Aung Hlaing. The court earlier offered a 10-month reduction in the sentence for time served, a legal official said. The army seized power claiming massive voting fraud in the November 2020 election, which Suu Kyi's party won in a landslide. The cases against Suu Kyi are widely seen as contrived to discredit her and keep her from running in the next election. UN high commissioner for human rights Michelle Bachelet called the proceedings a "sham trial". The US joined others in calling for the release of Suu Kyi and others who are detained. "The regime's continued disregard for the rule of law and its widespread use of violence against the Burmese people underscore the urgency of restoring Burma's path to democracy" secretary of state Antony Blinken said, using a former name for Myanmar. As is typical, China, a neighbour that has maintained friendly ties with Myanmar's military leaders, declined to criticise the verdict. Beijing hopes "all parties in Myanmar will bear in mind the long-term interests," a spokesperson said. On Monday, she faced an incitement charge that centred on statements posted on her party's Facebook page after she and other party leaders were detained by the military. She was accused of spreading false or inflammatory information that could disturb public order. In addition, she was accused of violating coronavirus restrictions for her appearance at a campaign event .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmars-suu-kyi-convicted-in-further-blow-to-democracy/articleshow/88133077.cms||---

The novel coronavirus has killed 5.26 million people globally, wiped out trillions of dollars in economic output and turned life upside down for billions of people. "The truth is, the next one could be worse. It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both," Sarah Gilbert said in the Richard Dimbleby Lecture, BBC reported. "This will not be the last time a virus threatens our lives and our livelihoods." Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said the world should make sure it is better prepared for the next virus. "The advances we have made, and the knowledge we have gained, must not be lost," she said. Gilbert said the Omicron strain's spike protein contained mutations known to increase the transmissibility of the virus. "Until we know more, we should be cautious"  The warning came as Russia, Nepal and Thailand reported their first Omicron cases. "Two citizens who returned to Russia from South Africa have been diagnosed with the Omicron strain," the country's Rospotrebnadzor health agency said. The agency said that all Russians returning from South Africa and its neighbouring countries are tested at the border and placed in special observatories. Nepal detected two cases and Thailand one.  Meanwhile, UK health minister Sajid Javid said there is now community transmission of the Omicron variant across England but it is too early to say if this will "knock us off our road to recovery". He said there are now 261 Omicron cases in England, 71 in Scotland and 4 in Wales - a total of 336. "This includes cases with no links to international travel, so we can conclude there is now community transmission."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/future-pandemics-may-be-more-lethal-oxford-az-vax-scientist/articleshow/88133095.cms||---

The ministry said the countries purchasing Israeli cyber technology would have to sign a declaration pledging to use the products "for the investigation and prevention of terrorist acts and serious crimes only". It said countries that violate the terms of use could be subject to sanctions, "including limiting the cyber system and/or disconnecting it". The updated certificate would list in detail what qualifies as "terrorist acts" - like attacks on people, public facilities, seizures of aircraft, the release of dangerous substances - as well as "serious crimes" referring to those that warrant imprisonment of six years or more. It would also spell out uses that are prohibited - like targeting people for political affiliation or applications that break that country's privacy laws - for which Israel could revoke licences and the systems be shut down. The announcement made no mention of NSO. But it came just days after it was revealed that 11 US state department employees were hacked with NSO spyware. The employees were all located in Uganda. It was the first known instance of NSO Group's Pegasus spyware being used against US officials. Last month, the US commerce department blacklisted NSO. Apple sued NSO last week over its hacking of iPhones and other Apple products. Facebook has filed a lawsuit over similar claim that it intruded WhatsApp. Pegasus allows its operator to gain access to a target's mobile phone, including contacts, text messages and real-time communications. NSO says it sells its tech to governments only to battle crime and terrorism. However, human rights groups and outside researchers have said the company's safeguards are insufficient. They say customers have abused Pegasus to keep tabs on journalists, human rights activists and political dissidents from Mexico to Saudi Arabia. NSO declined to comment on the guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/post-pegasus-scandal-israel-tightens-supervision-of-cyber-tech-exports/articleshow/88133142.cms||---

"All our concerns will be placed before the Covid-19 technical advisory committee and we'll take a decision based on their suggestions," Bommai said on the sidelines of his campaign in North Karnataka for the council polls. In Bidar, Bommai said cluster management guidelines will be released to tackle the rising Covid-19 cases in schools and hostels. "All guidelines given by experts will be strictly implemented. If they suggest shutting down hostels temporarily, we'll do it,'' the CM added. Primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh hinted at closure of schools and hostels if Covid cases there continue to rise. "The education department is monitoring the situation on an hourly basis and won't hesitate to shut down educational institutions temporarily if more cases are reported from schools and hostels,'' he added. The minister, however, maintained that experts were of the opinion there was no problem in holding regular offline classes now. He said the education department has taken all stringent measures to contain the spread of the new variant and emergence of clusters. "There is no need for parents to panic and they should know that we started regular schools after a year of lockdown. In case schools are shut again, it will be difficult to bring back children to classes,'' he said On exams being held in several schools and colleges, he said the government will not backtrack from stopping exams if cases go up although they are being held under close watch ensuring physical distancing. The clusters emerged in residential schools in Bengaluru Rural, Mysuru and Chikkamagaluru. A large number of students and staff of a medical college in Dharwad also tested positive. In Hubballi, Bommai said all primary and secondary contacts of the Bengaluru doctor who tested positive for Omicron have been identified. While all of them are asymptomatic, genomic sequencing reports of a couple is awaited. "We are prepared in every way, and gathering information from experts regarding the spread and effect of the infection. Accordingly, preparations are on to provide treatment,'' he added Allaying fears of a third wave, health minister K Sudhakar said the government has faced the more virulent Delta variant. Compared to it, the new variant is only fast in spread, but does not seem to be intense, so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-consult-experts-onclusters-in-schools-hostels/articleshow/88133206.cms||---

These had reached the Foreign Post Office (FPO) as many Bengalureans imported them through purchase on foreign portals unaware of laws that prohibit import of toys that resemble human body parts. With e-commerce portals, including foreign websites, selling a variety of items with an offer of shipping to India, online buyers in Bengaluru have attempted their luck in buying sex toys. Several foreign e-commerce websites exclusively selling sex toys offer assortment of toys for both men and women. This comes with a large price tag and additional shipping charges but the law of the land takes it course when products reach the Foreign Post Office here through air courier parcels. "I purchased a dildo worth $140 from a Dutch portal in mid-2019 and it was shipped to the Foreign Post Office in Chamarajpet. When I went to collect it, I was told by Customs officials that it's illegal in India to import sex toys and the piece would be seized. This was not alerted to me by the seller," said a Banashankari resident, who wanted to be identified only as Sid. The youngster, like many Bengalureans, was unaware that Section 11 sub section 2(u) of Customs Act 1962, prohibits the importation and exportation of sex toys. The Indian Penal Code (Section 292) bars import of obscene items including sex toys, literature, video films or photographic negatives. The latest victim of the law, which many term as draconian, is Shirley (name changed) from Mathikere who imported an assortment of goods from a famous US portal. "I received a call from the post office that there was some objectionable content in the parcel I ordered and it would be confiscated. I don't know who is getting so upset by my personal choices," she said. Sources with the Chamarajpet FPO said an assortment of sex toys have piled up at the Customs godown following seizure, mainly from individual importers. "It is very unfortunate that these people are ignorant about the law and import very expensive sex toys. Some people have taken out their anger on us for not releasing their purchases, but the law is against it," said a Customs official. He added that there's no data available on number of items seized but there has been a spike post-Covid. With the seized sex toys now occupying a major part of the godown, Bengaluru Customs sleuths as per protocol, plan to approach a magistrate for a court order to destroy them, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sex-toys-hit-city-customs-barrier-end-up-in-godown/articleshow/88133221.cms||Petlee Peter

This, according to activist T Narasimha Murthy, is not in sync with the Model Prison Manual which allows prisoners to meet family members and legal advisers once a fortnight. Ashish was arrested on October 9 after cops named him as one of the prime accused in the case pertaining to mowing down farmers during a protest in Tikonia, Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. Murthy said he had filed the RTI aplication to know about Ashish’s vistors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/violating-jail-norms-mishra-had-11-visitors-says-rti-reply/articleshow/88133232.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Indian SaaS cos will have 8% mkt by 2025: Bain||BENGALURU: Indian SaaS companies are poised to reach $30 billion in revenue, capturing an 8% to 9% share of the global SaaS market by 2025, says a report by Bain & Company. The stellar debut of Freshworks on the Nasdaq in September has sparked a new wave of exits. India having 13 SaaS unicorns and with about 9 firms with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $100 million each, have made investors cozy up to India’s SaaS story in an otherwise consumer internet-centric playbook, the report said. Investments into the SaaS landscape grew to $4.5 billion this year, a 170% increase compared to last year, and this comprised 8% of the overall private equity and venture capital deal value in India. The growth was driven primarily by an increase in the number of $50 million deals. Prabhav Kashyap, associate partner and leader of the private equity practice in Bain, said there’s a greater sense of maturity in the SaaS ecosystem. “Last year, we had 10-12 firms with $50 million ARR and that number is 20 already and that number might go up to 25 this year-end. More than 250 new Indian firms have been founded by former employees of Indian SaaS companies and now employ more than 5,000 people. Indian SaaS companies currently employ more than 62,000 people in India and this is set to scale up further,” he said. The top 10 investors’ share in total deal value across 2019-2021 was 30%-35%, with Tiger Global (by value) and Sequoia (by volume) being most active over 2020–2021. This year, over 35 Indian SaaS companies had $20 million ARR—a sevenfold increase over five years. Horizontal business software used to run, build and manage the tech stack, remains the largest sub-segment from an investment standpoint, accounting for more than half of all SaaS funding in India. The Bain report said that the Indian SaaS firms have excellent ARR-to-funding ratios, in line with global SaaS peers, with select Indian companies even outperforming their US counterparts. “If you do an ARR to funding ratio, these firms are productive, generating value much faster. For top Indian SaaS companies, the average ARR to funding ratio was 0.4, and for the global firms it was 0.5. If you look at Freshworks, they raised nearly $500 million before the IPO and their ARR was $350 million, BrowserStack raised $250 mn and their ARR is at $100 million,” Kashyap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/indian-saas-cos-will-have-8-mkt-by-2025-bain/articleshow/88133233.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Huskur may get railway station; Heelalige & Bellandur facilities to be rebuilt||BENGALURU: In a relief to passengers, many railway stations along Byappanahalli-Hosur section are likely to get a facelift in the next two years. This would be possible due to the doubling work undertaken by Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), a joint venture between the railway ministry and state government. The deadline for Byappanahalli and Hosur (48km) doubling work is December 2023. While Huskur near Electronics City is likely to get a new railway station, old and dilapidated station buildings at Heelalige, Bellandur Road and Anekal will be demolished. Maranayakanahalli station building, located between Hosur and Anekal stations and which was inaugurated in August 2020, will also be rebuilt. FOBs will be provided at three stations — Bellandur, Heelalige and Anekal — for passengers to access platforms. K-RIDE’s plan to build a station at Huskur is expected to benefit thousands of people, particularly techies in Electronics City. Compared to the existing Heelalige station, which is around 10km from Electronics City, Huskur is only 5km away, which would be more convenient for residents. Huskur station, which is coming up between Heelalige and Carmelaram stations, will have four rail tracks. Pruthvin Reddy, a rail activist, welcomed the plan and said: “Huskur station will help people working in Bommasandra and Veerasandra industrial areas as well as techies working in Electronics City Phase 2. Regular passenger trains can also be stopped at Huskur.” He said once the doubling is completed, stoppage for long-distance express and mail trains can be provided at Anekal and Heelalige stations. “The railways will be able to run more trains once the doubling work is over and new station buildings will have better amenities as well as FOBs, which will benefit passengers,” said Reddy. “It’s unfortunate that the Maranayakanahalli station building which was constructed last year will also be dismantled,” he added. According to K-RIDE’s plan, Bellandur will have five rail tracks, Huskur four, Heelalige five, Anekal four and Maranayakanahalli six. “Stations like Bellandur (two platforms) and Heelalige (three) will be connected with FOBs and these existing station buildings will also be razed. In Anekal, two platforms will be connected with FOB. Stations like Maranayakanahalli are being demolished for maximum utilisation of space and also to accommodate more tracks. There is huge commercial and real-estate potential for stations along the Hosur line,” said an official. Many passengers travelling on the Bengaluru-Hosur route had been complaining about inadequate trains and amenities at these stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/huskur-may-get-rly-stn-heelalige-bellandur-facilities-to-be-rebuilt/articleshow/88133238.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: IAF ex-sergeant held 11 years after he escaped from police custody||BENGALURU: When he made a new beginning 3,000km away from Bengaluru at Nellie, a town in Assam, this former sergeant of the Indian Air Force (IAF) thought he had completely erased his notorious past. But when a Bengaluru police team picked him up in a covert operation, he realised that for the second time he had run out of luck. As police escorted him to the city, 53-year-old Dharam Singh Yadav’s past stared at him: He had escaped from police custody in 2010 by spraying chilli powder on two cops after being arrested for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and two children. Yadav, who is from Haryana and worked with the IAF from 1987 to 2007, built a house in Bengaluru’s Vidyaranyapura area and settled down with wife Anu and children Keerthi, 14, and Shubham, 8. Despite being a father of two, he’d check out matrimonial websites for profiles of women seeking alliances.  In 2007, he met a woman from Rajajinagar and the latter showed interest in him thinking he was single and had a good job as purchasing officer at a private firm. Yadav planned to marry the woman and decided to get rid of his wife and children, whom he saw as obstacles. At 6:30am on October 19, 2008, Yadav picked up a log and bludgeoned his wife and children to death inside the house. He tried to make it appear like a botched-up robbery by some hardcore criminals, who wanted to loot the house. However, police found that he was the real killer and packed him off to prison on charges of murder. After languishing in jail for over two years, Yadav decided to escape. He claimed he had kidney issues and was brought to the prison ward of Victoria Hospital for treatment. Before going to the hospital, Yadav stole some chilli powder from the prison canteen. On December 4, 2010, he sprayed the chilli powder on the two constables escorting him and escaped along with the handcuffs. Following this, he fell off Bengaluru police’s radar. Yadav’s case file was reopened a few months ago when young IPS officer Harish Pandey, who is deputy commissioner of police (south), made a database of criminals who had been absconding after committing heinous crimes. A special team was constituted and they started tracking Yadav’s probable hideouts based on his family connections. Police learnt that Yadav was running a liquor shop at Ateli Mandi in Mahendragarh district of Haryana in 2012. The team visited Ateli Mandi and learnt that Yadav had gone to Assam after marrying a woman from Nellie, whom he met in one of the matrimonial sites. The police team tracked him down to Assam and arrested him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iaf-ex-sergeant-held-11-yrs-after-he-escaped-from-police-custody/articleshow/88133240.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||10-hour classes 6 days a week for first-year engineering students: VTU to colleges||BENGALURU: Engineering students should brace for a hectic first year when classes begin on December 13. In a bid to make up for the time lost due to the delay in conducting entrance exam and counselling, Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) has asked colleges to take classes for two extra hours daily. Additionally, VTU, the umbrella university for all engineering colleges in the state, has asked colleges to work full day on Saturdays. It has permitted them to operate on Sundays too if necessary. Thus far, colleges have been working for eight hours a day, five-and-a-half days a week, with Saturday being a half-day. The schedule will now change to six working days of 10 hours each. “We have lost around three months due to the delay when compared to the normal schedule. With these measures, we are hoping to catch up on three weeks this semester with extra hours,” said vice-chancellor Karisidappa. March 30 will be the last working day. Practical exams will be held from April 1-April 8. Theory exams are scheduled from April 11. There will be a students induction programme of 105 hours, which will be completed in blended mode within 10-12 days. Unlike previous years, activity points from the same will be considered for the final grades. Also new this year is the mandatory internship in first year. Internships will be held from April 25 to May 14 at the college level itself, wherein students will engage in activities at the local level like in NCC or NSS. There will be no semester break, with even semesters set to begin the next day after the end of the internship. “Classes will be held in blended mode, which means lecturers can ask students to follow some virtual courses or watch some lectures online. It varies with teachers and courses,” explained the VC. This academic calendar released on November 4 is also applicable to autonomous colleges. Karnataka Examinations Authority had extended the last date of reporting to colleges to December 6 (5.30pm). Engineering colleges say the next few months will be taxing for all stakeholders. “It will be demanding for everyone. We are trying to figure out a way to have 10 working hours per day. We have to take into consideration public transport facilities, concentration levels, Covid protocols like wearing a mask and faculty members’ availability. We will also look at the option of blended learning to tide over this. We need the cooperation of all stakeholders — students, teachers and parents — to execute it,” said KM Babu, director, AMC institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vtu-to-colleges-10-hr-classes-6-days-a-week-for-first-year-engg-students/articleshow/88133242.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

An inquiry has been ordered against PSI Harish Kumar. The youth, identified as A Tausif of Old Guddadahalli and a petty trader, was picked up by Harish on the night of December 1 in connection with a brawl in the neighbourhood. Tausif had taken objection to two youths coming to meet a woman in the area, and an argument broke out between the two parties. Though cops intervened, the youths said they won’t file a police complaint. Tausif’s father Aslam too spoke to the two youngsters and the latter assured him that they wouldn’t pursue it. However, Harish is said to have picked up Tausif post midnight. Harish reportedly took Tausif to Byatarayanapura police station, where he allegedly thrashed him. “Harish and others abused me and thrashed me with a cricket bat. They trimmed by beard and when I asked for water, they gave me a bottle filled with urine,” Tausif told the media at his house. Aslam said Harish demanded Rs 1 lakh to release his son. “I somehow managed to arrange Rs 30,000 at night. But Harish refused to release Tausif and threatened us saying he could ‘fix’ my son in some heinous case like kidnapping. We then approached a local politician and after he called Harish, my son was let off,” said Aslam. Tausif suffered injuries on his legs and back . A senior police officer confirmed that Harish had illegally detained Tausif and beat him up. “We shall initiate action against Harish for his misdeeds. However, other allegations made by Tausif, such as his beard being trimmed and the urine allegation, are false,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/psi-in-soup-for-thrashing-youth/articleshow/88133244.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Rs 443 crore crop loss relief for rain-hit farmers in Karnataka||BENGALURU: While farmers across Karnataka are crying foul over the poor and delayed disbursal of compensation for crop losses due to unseasonal rain, the government has allocated Rs 443 crore under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The state has already paid compensation to about 6.6 lakh eligible farmers. “We had distributed about Rs 132 crore in instalments among the affected farmers before November. Recently, the government released another Rs 311 crore,” said Tushar Girinath, principal secretary, revenue department. He said the compensation was directly credited to farmers’ accounts through direct benefit transfer (DBT) after they uploaded crop loss details on the Parihara portal. Girinath added the state government is expecting a claim of another Rs 150 crore in the coming days towards crop losses due to untimely rain. On the other hand, the agriculture department on Wednesday will launch payment of crop insurance claims to farmers under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Insurance companies will start paying farmers in Chitradurga, Kolar, Tumakuru and Koppal in the first phase, where heavy rain-related losses have been reported. Agriculture commissioner Brijesh Kumar Dikshit said two companies will begin crediting the insurance money of over Rs 80 lakh to farmers who registered their post-harvest losses within 10 days of the incident. With the unseasonal rain hurting a majority of the southern districts and pockets of North Karnataka, crop losses had been recorded at 10 lakh hectares for the months of September to November. While crops on 5 lakh hectares were destroyed in September and October, the heavy November rain alone flooded 5 lakh hectares and destroyed ragi and maize crops. Government sources say negotiations are yet to be carried out with other insurance companies that remain non-committal on paying the amount. But farmer-leaders say the money claimed to have been released by the government is not sufficient. Some say farmers haven’t received the amount. “Under SDRF norms, the government is paying Rs 2,500 per acre of crop loss. A farmer pays no less than Rs 3,000 for only labour for sowing. What is the use of such alms given to farmers,” questioned Kurbur Shanthakumar of the state farmers’ associations union. Complaints against insurance firmsT Yeshavantha from Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha claimed the biggest problem has been disbursal of the insurance amount. “There is not a single farmer in Mandya who has got the amount for the premium he or she has paid. While the government says it’s paying, the farmer gets nothing in most cases as insurance companies have a rule that unless an entire hobli or taluk is washed out and reports crop losses, no individual farmer can claim insurance,” said Yeshvantha. Shanthakumar said government insurance rules need to be amended to help farmers secure higher compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/443cr-crop-loss-relief-for-rain-hit-farmers/articleshow/88133248.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Senior functionaries like former chief minister BS Yediyurappa had publicly stated about the reshuffle even as chief minister Basavaraj Bommai chose not to deny it. Yediyurappa on Saturday said Bommai may get the nod to induct some new faces. Prior to that, Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal had said some non-performing ministers would be asked to leave, as the leadership is set to initiate performance assessment. Reinforcing this statement, while remaining silent on the assessment, Bommai told the media that “Yatnal appears to be in the know.” On Monday, Bommai said he will consult the high command and go by its advice on the expansion. “We are focusing on MLC polls and the legislature session for now. I’ll seek the advice of my party leadership about the cabinet rejig,” he said Chief minister’s political secretary DN Jeevaraj said: “There is discussion about the reshuffle at present, but the CM may take a call after the MLC polls (on December 10) and the winter session of the legislature.” While the 10-day session in Belagavi is set to end on December 23, the reshuffle is expected mid-next month. They said the central leadership has already obtained performance reports of some ministers who have been in the cabinet ever since the BJP came to power in July 2019. Bommai has been asked to send the assessment of ministers inducted in August 2021 after he took over as the CM. Several ministers and BJP functionaries confirmed this, while many said the exercise is needed to give a facelift to the administration and prepare the party for the 2023 assembly polls. While food and civil supply minister Umesh Katti said he is prepared for the assessment, housing minister V Somanna said the best performers should be rewarded. “Due recognition for best performers is needed and it is good that the exercise is being taken up. The hope is that those who have worked hard for the party and not given the opportunity so far will be considered,” said Somanna. As the roadmap for the 2023 elections is being prepared, the high command seems to have taken the setback in Hangal bypolls seriously and is exploring an option to induct young faces from Lingayat and Vokkaliga communities. Sources said names of state vice-president BY Vijayendra, a Lingayat, and Hassan MLA Preetham J Gowda, a Vokkaliga, are being discussed. However, other party members sought to rule out both names for various reasons.  “Vijayendra is not even an elected member, while Preetham Gowda is just a first-time MLA. The high command should have a strong reason to choose such candidates while many deserving candidates are waiting,” said a source. “Periodical assessment is a good practice that ensures efficient performance of ministers,” said CN Ashwath Narayan, minister for higher education and IT&BT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rumours-over-performance-based-cabinet-rejig-put-pressure-on-mins/articleshow/88133283.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Former CM BS Yediyurappa was the first to announce that BJP would seek the support of JD(S) in seats where the latter isn’t contesting. While BJP is contesting 20 seats, the JD(S) is going for just six. The meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda last week in Delhi was also being viewed in this backdrop. But since then, there has been no visible forward movement. Though Yediyurappa has spoken to JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy seeking his party’s support, the latter is keen on a formal request from either chief minister Basavaraj Bommai or state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel. “Only Yediyurappa has asked for our support. No other leader from BJP has approached us. How can you expect us to announce our support,” Kumarswamy asked while replying to queries on delay in broaching an alliance with the BJP. However, neither Bommai nor Kateel responded to Kumaraswamy’s statement. “We have already conveyed our view and it is now for Kumaraswamy to make his party’s stand clear,” Bommai said. It is being said that division in the BJP over the issue is the reason behind the party not making a formal request. “Most leaders aren’t keen on any sort of understanding with the JD(S) as it would send a wrong signal to the voters,” said a BJP insider.  Kumaraswamy who was supposed to make his stand clear on Monday, said he will take a call on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/no-clear-picture-on-bjp-jds-alliance/articleshow/88137999.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||ZP & TP election: SEC moves HC against amendment Act||Bengaluru: The high court on Monday ordered notice to the government in response to a petition filed by the state election commission (SEC) over zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat polls. The SEC has challenged the Karnataka Gram Swaraj & Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Act, 2021 which was published in the gazette on September 18, 2021, contending that it would delay the elections. Appearing for the commission, senior advocate KN Phanindra said if the amendment Act is allowed, the entire process of conducting elections to zilla and taluk panchayats in the state will get delayed by at least one or one-and-a-half years. The court was told that SEC had issued notifications — on March 24, fixing the number of seats, on April 30 determining the different categories of reservation (SC, ST, BC-A & BC-B) for all seats and on March 30 vis-a-vis delimitation of territorial constituencies. It had also published voters’ list on June 28. Section 12(i) of the Act stipulates that all delimitation notifications of the constituencies of TPs/ZPs stand lapsed. Section 12 (ii) says all notifications reserving the constituencies based on the existing delimitation also stand lapsed. According to the SEC, if the amendment is allowed, the supremacy of the constitutional mandate under clause (3) of Article 243-E will be defeated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/zptp-election-sec-moves-hc-against-amendment-act/articleshow/88133285.cms||---

---||Business||Sensex dives 949 pts over inflation, Omicron worries||MUMBAI: A slew of global and domestic factors — from anxiety over Omicron’s impact on the global economy to raging inflation fears in US and India — led to a 949-point (1.7%) slide in the sensex to 56,747 points, its first sub-57k close in over three months. Monday’s selloff was led by foreign funds with Infosys, RIL and TCS together accounting for over a third of the loss. In a rare instance, all the 30 constituents closed in the red. In the last two sessions, the sensex has lost 1,714 points, or nearly 3%. And from its all-time intraday high of 62,245 points recorded on October 19, the index is now down nearly 5,500 points, or 8.8%. US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell had indicated last week that the rising trend of inflation in the world’s largest economy, near a 30-year high, could be here to stay and was not ‘transitory’ as was believed earlier. Market players globally interpreted this as an indication that the Fed will wind down its easy money policy at a much faster pace that earlier indicated. This, in turn, meant that the rate of interest in the US could rise earlier than in the second half of 2022. Both these decisions could prompt fund managers of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to take money out of emerging markets like India. Investors globally are also unsure of the impact of the Omicron variant and are cautious about it affecting supply chains worldwide and slowing down the economic recovery process, broking house reports noted. In India, investors on Dalal Street are also eagerly awaiting the decision of the RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC), due on Wednesday. Religare Broking’s VP (research) Ajit Mishra said markets plunged sharply and lost over one and a half percent in continuation to Friday’s fall. “The rise in Covid cases has again started haunting global markets and the situation may deteriorate further in the near future. Besides, the upcoming (RBI) MPC’s policy review outcome and macroeconomic data (index of industrial production & consumer price index-based inflation) would keep volatility high,” Mishra wrote in his post-market note. The selloff on D-Street on Monday left investors poorer by Rs 4.2 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 259.7 lakh crore. BSE data also showed that its midcap and smallcap indices each closed 1.4% lower, compared to sensex’s 1.7%. This indicated that foreign funds were more aggressive sellers on Monday compared to Indian investors who have large holdings in stocks beyond the blue-chips. Strong selling by FPIs also led to a 26-paise weakness in the rupee which closed at 75.43 to a dollar. So far in December, FPIs have net sold stocks worth Rs 14,616 crore against Rs 5,945 crore net selling during the whole of November, data from CDSL and BSE showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-dives-949-pts-over-inflation-omicron-worries/articleshow/88132130.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat mulls lifting booze barrier to boost fintech hub at GIFT city||AHMEDABAD: Dry Gujarat is mulling over a proposal to relax prohibition rules at the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT), Gandhinagar in a bid to attract national and international fintech firms to set up offices as well as lure top talent to shift base to the state capital. The move aims to offer “evening social life” in GIFT City which is on a par with what is enjoyed by professionals in other finance and technology hubs in India and abroad, said top officials close to the development. The push comes at a time when the Union government envisions the GIFT City, which houses the country’s first international financial services centre, as the gateway to the global fintech world. On September 27, 2020, the GIFT management had written to the superintendent of prohibition and excise seeking a relaxation in liquor laws in the special economic zone (SEZ) area of the GIFT City. The request was to enable “evening public social life”. The concessions have been sought under sections 139 (1) (c), 146 (b), and 147 of the Gujarat Prohibition Act, 1949. Top sources said that the chief minister’s office is in the process of dealing with the queries about the relaxation in the run-up to the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit scheduled in January, 2022. On September 20, 2021, the chief secretary is learnt to have written a detailed letter to the additional chief secretary, urban development, drawing up a roadmap for developing the GIFT City and its peripheral areas. The chief secretary’s letter talks about buttressing road infrastructure, extending the riverfront up to Gandhinagar, and setting up a fintech institute apart from relaxing liquor laws. Under the current laws, the state allows liquor permits to tourists and business travellers from outside Gujarat and India. “Inside SEZs, the current notification allows liquor permits only to residents. This is not in line with the dispensation in other centres in India or abroad,” said a senior bureaucrat. “To create evening social life, which is at least as good as in other centres, liquor bars with wine-and-dine facilities are required in the SEZ area.” The bureaucrat went on to say: “Exemption is required to create an international experience as well as to attract talent from competing centres abroad.” Prohibition has often been a point of conflict between the business community and the political class cutting across party lines in Mahatma Gandhi’s Gujarat. The pressure from stakeholders such as Gandhians and women rights’ organizations has posed a moral dilemma for policy makers when it comes to diluting prohibition laws. The laws have been in force since 1960, when Gujarat was carved out of Maharashtra. Of late, however, the chorus to ease prohibition has grown louder as businesspersons say stringent liquor laws often dissuade young talent from coming to the dry state. The issue also cropped up during the meeting of CM Bhupendra Patel with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her recent visit to the state. Earlier in August this year, the Gujarat high court decided to hear on merit nearly half a dozen petitions which pleaded for the right to drink in the privacy of home. The high court termed the petitions maintainable despite strong objections from the state government. The petition, filed in 2019, had questioned certain provisions of the prohibition policy and petitioners had demanded permission to consume alcohol at private places by citing the recently enunciated right to privacy. The petitioners had also alleged that the government is adopting a dual policy by allowing outsiders visiting Gujarat and defence personnel to drink. Besides, the petitioners pointed out that the government issues permits to the rich on health grounds in the dry state. They have also challenged the “disproportionate punishment” under the Gujarat Prohibition Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-mulls-lifting-booze-barrier-to-boost-fintech-hub-at-gift-city/articleshow/88131159.cms||Harit Mehta

However, the state government is fully alert keeping in mind the threat of a likely third wave of the Coronavirus, he said. Responding to a media query, he said the danger of Covid-19 is still there. It is spreading once again in many countries across the world. “The state government has already issued guidelines in the wake of the Omicron variant. State’s health minister Mangal Pandey, too, has given complete information about the government’s preparedness regarding the new Covid variant. Recently, we held a review meeting over the Omicron issue. All people in the state government are alert,” Nitish said while responding to media queries after his weekly ‘janata ke darbar mein mukhyamantri’ programme. “It takes 5 to 7 days to find out whether a person found positive for Covid-19 is infected with Omicron variant or not. So far, no case of Omicron has surfaced in Bihar,” he said. On being asked if some people have gone traceless after returning to Bihar from foreign countries, Nitish said all the DMs have been asked to locate all such persons and ensure their Covid-19 test. “People in administration are engaged in tracing such people. All people should remain alert over these issues,” Nitish said. Admitting the fertilizers crisis in the state, the CM said he spoke to the Union minister concerned on Sunday and he assured him to send sufficient consignment of fertilizers to Bihar in the next seven days. Nitish said the state’s agriculture minister also spoke to the Centre over the crisis in Bihar. The agriculture minister and the chief secretary also sent separate letters to the Centre, seeking dispatch of more fertilizers to the state. “I will again hold a meeting after two days to review the availability of fertilizers in the state,” Nitish said. The CM heard grievances of altogether 200 people from different districts at the janata darbar programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-alert-against-omicron-nitish/articleshow/88130665.cms||---

Since July 3, when 18 cases were confirmed in a day, daily cases dipped and reached an average of five and six cases a day. The surge comes at a time when 23 Omicron cases have been reported in the country. A total of 106 cases have been reported since November 15 while in the past six days, 29 cases were confirmed. There has been a steady rise in daily cases since two weeks. As on Monday, 62 active cases were reported. The city has two returnees from South Africa and the genome sequencing test report is awaited. Over the last two weeks, testing has also increased from 1,200 to around 2,000 a day. “In the absence of much testing, positivity rate was less. Enhancement in testing is one of the best strategies to regulate transmission rate,” said a public health expert. He added, “From August onwards, there were three to five daily cases with no sudden daily spike. However, since the end of November, there have been as many as eight and nine cases.” Although nothing is clear about the severity of the Omicron variant yet, doctors feel it will spread in the community irrespective of vaccination. Therefore social distancing, prevention of closed room gatherings and wearing of masks is important. “Those who have been infected at any time of the year and have been vaccinated are less vulnerable to the severity of the infection or even re- infection. Natural infection provides long-term protection. So those who have not been infected till now must be more careful,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chd-reports-most-covid-cases-since-july-3/articleshow/88131361.cms||Shimona Kanwar

According to Guntakal DSP U Narasingappa, Dasa Naresh Kumar (33), a resident of Kosigi village in Kurnool district, K Doraswamy Reddy (61) of Chittoor district and P Gopala Krishna of Kurnool district, formed a gang to dupe people by spreading misinformation about ‘black’ currency being printed and stacked by the Reserve Bank of India and claimed they had access to this currency. The gang lured people by promising to provide them with four ‘black’ currency notes, in exchange of one regular Indian currency note. Police said the gang used to cut regular paper to the size of the Indian currency in circulation and later blackened them using chemicals. They would claim that these notes, when washed, were the same as other currency notes. Guntakal DSP told reporters that Dasa Naresh Kumar was the mastermind behind the racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/three-held-in-currency-scam-bust/articleshow/88130775.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The downtrend in stock markets following the detection of the new Covid variant has also not deterred the government as the macro benefits of the IPO are seen to outweigh the challenges. According to sources, the insurer has done the groundwork in respect of the draft red herring prospectus and its half-yearly results for the current financial year. The consulting actuary, Milliman Advisors, is expected to officially submit its report later this month. Bankers have already held preliminary meetings with potential investors for a fourth-quarter IPO. A successful LIC IPO would support the rupee, help contain the fiscal deficit and would be seen in a positive light by rating agencies. Sources said that the success of the IPO would depend on getting the pricing right. One indication that the government is going ahead with the IPO is that the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam) this week appointed a PR firm for the IPO process. For investors, the issues of interest are the embedded value multiple that the government will be seeking. They also want to know whether there is a road map for increasing the surplus distribution to shareholders. Although the law was amended to allow LIC to distribute 10% of its surplus to shareholders, the government, through a letter issued in November 2013, allowed the corporation to continue with a 95:5 distribution. Industry officials said that even if LIC continues with a surplus distribution ratio of 95:5, the 5% dividend is enough to provide a substantial yield. For instance, in FY21, the corporation had a valuation surplus of Rs 57,780 crore on its life fund of Rs 34.4 lakh crore. Of this, the dividend distributed at the rate of 5% works out to Rs 2,889 crore. SBI Life Insurance, which is the closest proxy for a public sector life company, has a dividend yield of 0.2% and a market capitalisation of Rs 1,14,845 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-set-on-lic-ipo-in-q4-despite-mkt-woes/articleshow/88132161.cms||Mayur Shetty

After the construction of Benz Circle flyover, traffic eased here and at Skew bridge, Nirmala Road, Guru Nanak Junction and some spots on the NH-16 in the city’s limits. However, traffic congestion increased at Mahanadu Road and NTR Health University. Ramavarappadu Ring, Sri Sakti Centre, Prasadampadu and Enikepadu 100 Feet Road are places where city vehicles enter the NH. Nineteen road accidents were reported on this stretch between January 1 and December 1, 2021, and 14 people died. The R&B authorities and Vijayawada MP Kesineni Nani had requested the NHAI to construct underpasses to end traffic problems. The NHAI has given in-principle approval for the project on condition that the state government will take up land acquisition. The NHAI has intensified Vijayawada bypass road work from Chinna Avutapalli to Gollapudi to divert heavy vehicle movement from the city. “The R&B department is eyeing to surrender the maintenance of the road from Gannavaram to Kanaka Durga Varadhi after completion of Vijayawada bypass. This will ease traffic congestion in the city,” MP Kesineni Nani said. The state government has also requested the NHAI to construct the underpass .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nhai-gives-green-signal-for-vehicle-underpasses-in-vij/articleshow/88130745.cms||Venu Lanka

The CCI said that for the 2021-22 season, they have opened 30 procurement centres besides 41 procurement points at notified ginning and pressing factories, said CCI Guntur branch manager G Sai Aditya. He added the Centre has announced a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 6,025 per quintal for the current season. This is the rate at which cotton is being purchased at the Adoni market at Rs 7,689 per quintal and this year, the highest amount paid to the farmers has been Rs 8,219 per quintal, Sai Aditya said. “The CCI does not procure cotton that does not belong to the Fair Average Quality (FAQ) grade,” he sad. The CCI is particular about the procurement of FAQ grade cotton, which is determined by the moisture level, which should range between 8 per cent and 12 per cent. “If the moisture is above 12 per cent, the CCI will not procure it,” Sai Aditya asserted. Further, the CCI does not procure immature cotton or those with red, yellow or black marks as such cotton is below the FAQ grade, he added. The rains have damaged the cotton crop this season, leaving the CCI unable to procure cotton in these places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/procurement-centres-set-up-to-aid-cotton-growers/articleshow/88130736.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Fake agriculture inputs sale to invite tough action||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has proposed criminal action against dealers and companies found supplying spurious seeds and fertilizers. He said the government would incorporate criminal procedure in the laws or bring in an ordinance recommending at least two years of imprisonment. The chief minister spoke to officials of the agriculture department and allied sectors at his Tadepalli camp office on Monday. He wanted the officials to keep strict vigil on the supply of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides and ensure quality. Officials were directed to see that seeds, fertilizers and pesticides are made available to farmers at all Rythu Bharosa Kendras. The chief minister also told officials to make all agriculture tools available to farmers through community hiring centres established at the RBKs. He told them to promote organic farming. Instructing officials to create awareness among the farming community on organic and natural farming, the chief minister told them to take the RBK as the unit to promote organic farming. Jagan also told the officials to encourage farmers to take up alternative cropping. He advised them not to promote paddy cultivation with borewell water, adding that farmers could cultivate commercial crops or horticulture crops that have a greater demand in the market. Referring to bulk milk collection with the help of Amul, the chief minister asked officials to expand collection to other districts. Officials informed the chief minister that milk collection started in Krishna and Anantapur districts this month. The Palavelluva scheme is benefiting 1,77,364 women in the state. The scheme, which started with collection of 2,812 litres of milk in November 2020, reached 71,191 litres in November 2021, officials told the chief minister. Officials told the chief minister that farmers are gradually coming forward to register on the e-crop portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fake-agri-inputs-sale-to-invite-tough-action/articleshow/88130757.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: ‘Chaddi Gang’ resurfaces in Tadepalli||VIJAYAWADA: A gang of burglars believed to be the notorious ‘Chaddi Gang’ has once again caused panic in Tadepalli after they allegedly targeted the residences of former MLA Amanchi Krishna Mohan, Tanuku legislator Karumuri Nageswara Rao and those in other high-profile areas. The incident happened on December 3 night and came to light on Monday after the management of Rainbow Villas in Navodaya Colony lodged a complaint with Tadepalli police. According to Tadepalli police sources, Rainbow Villas is treated as a VIP zone as it is close to chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s residence. Cops said the unidentified accused used a plastic drum to climb the fencing wall of the villas from the adjacent Banana Orchids and trespassed into Amanchi Krishna Mohan and Karumuri Nageswara Rao’s residence. After breaking the doors using iron rods, the alleged Chaddi Gang members had to return empty-handed as the premises are used as a camp offices by the respective leaders and hence no valuables were inside. The watchman witnessed the intruders, screamed at them, and raised an alarm, after which they fled the scene. However, cops managed to retrieve CCTV footage, showing the accused wearing shorts and their faces covered. Just a week ago, similar offences by the ‘Chaddi Gang’ were reported near the Kabela centre and Guntupalli village under Ibrahimpatnam police station limits. Vijayawada police formed a special team to nab the culprits. Now, another case has been registered at Tadepalli police station. Further investigation is still on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/chaddi-gang-resurfaces-in-tadepalli/articleshow/88130801.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Broken speed-breakers make commute a nightmare for motorists in Salt Lake||KOLKATA: From flattening tyres to making bikers lose control, broken plastic speed-breakers on Salt Lake roads are posing a regular threat to motorists leading to frequent accidents in recent weeks. Alerted by complaints from local residents, TOI took a drive around the township and found scores of such broken yellow and black speed-breakers — the residuals of the plastic/ fibre body and the sharp iron fixture, which were used to fix the speed-breaker on the streets — dangerously posing a threat and hazard to motorists. At several places, the humps were completely off the road leaving a void large enough to topple any biker riding at a decent speed. The stretch in front of Bidhannagar sub divisional hospital has two such speed- breakers – 70% of which has been eroded off leaving a bare depression and broken plastic base stuck to the ground to the left. The sharp residuals of the fibre speed-breaker (hump) or the steel/ iron nails used to fix the speed-breakers are also sharp enough to pierce a car tyre. “The broken speed-breakers have left such deep depressions on the ground that we have to literally move the steering left and right just to ensure the wheel doesn’t fall into the potholes and injure the patients,” said Santu Das, an ambulance driver. A tea seller near City Centre whose stall is on the footpath right next to two large gaping holes left behind by two plastic speed-breakers said she is witness to atleast a dozen accident every week on the broken speed- breakers. “Tyres of taxis and cars burst or get deflated after landing on them. There also have been multiple instances of bikers toppling over on the depressions and uneven portion of the road and injuring themselves,” she said. Locals said some residents and local rickshaw pullers were responsible for the damage. Police said they are aware of the problem and promised an immediate solution very soon. “We have also received multiple complaints about the broken speed- breakers. We will soon conduct a survey and ensure all of them are repaired,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/broken-speed-breakers-make-commute-a-nightmare-for-motorists-in-salt-lake/articleshow/88131398.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Gyanoo, in his statement given to a section of the media, touched the raw nerve of the BJP that has greater number of MLAs than of the JD(U) in the state assembly. “In the NDA, (CM) Nitish Kumar is the only leader who has vision.” “At one time, the likes of (Rajya Sabha member and former deputy CM) Sushil Kumar Modi and (minister) Mangal Pandey mattered. If there would be any problem in the NDA, Sushil Kumar Modi was available to solve it. He had influence on the legislature party and on the organization, but today there is no one,” Gyanoo said. “Even the party did not try to create leadership. Jaise taise logon ko mantri bana diya (novices were made ministers) or put them in the organization. There is dissatisfaction even among upper caste people,” Gyanoo said, adding that the “leaders acted to serve their own vested interests.” The severe indictment made by Gyanoo elicited immediate reaction from the BJP’s state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal. Public health and engineering department minister Ramprit Paswan even suggested that action should be taken against Gyanoo. “The BJP is an organization-based party and its workers lead it. Only they, and they alone, run the organization,” Dr Jaiswal said to neutralize any damaging effect that Gyanoo’s statement might have caused in the party’s rank and file at large. Ironically, Monday was also the day when the party’s rank and file were engaged in the observance of the 65th death anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar. Talking to mediapersons, Dr Jaiswal said PM Narendra Modi has been fulfilling the aspirations of the scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), backward caste and extremely backward caste (EBC) sections in the country. Paswan echoed the BJP’s ministerial group’s concerns. Besides demanding action against Gyanoo, he also said: “There is nobody above the party. Is there any party that is without leadership? What he has said is his personal opinion and he might be feeling personally dissatisfied for some reasons.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-mla-says-his-party-lacks-leadership-in-state/articleshow/88130768.cms||Abhay Singh

In a letter issued on Saturday, the DEO said schools should conduct both offline as well as online classes so that students can opt for either of the two modes. “Online classes cannot be discontinued in view of the Omicron threat. Students should be kept out of offline classes on the complaint of any ill health. As per the directive of the home department (special branch), the standard operating procedure and Covid-appropriate behaviour should be followed in the educational institutes,” he said. “Schools should follow the safety protocols during the offline classes and admission process in pre-primary classes in the coming month. Keeping in mind the new variant, school staff and students should wear mask all the time and use hand sanitizer. School premises/vehicles must be sanitized daily. It is also necessary that all school staff should be allowed to enter the premises only if fully vaccinated,” says a part of the letter. Baldwin Academy principal Rajiv Ranjan Sinha said the school administration is ready for any eventuality. “If the state announced closure of schools, we are ready to switch over to the online classes as all our classrooms are equipped with cameras and computer system. But conducting both online and offline classes is difficult for teachers. Most of the guardians want offline classes as kids do not study online. The study habit of kids have deteriorated much during the pandemic. Most of the students only login to virtual classes and then keep busy on social media,” he said. “We are still conducting online examinations and extra classes in the evening on the request of parents. The school is conducting both online and offline classes. If the situation deteriorates, we will switch over to online classes,” said Ashfaque Iqbal, vice-principal of Bishop Scott Boys’ School. “The school has already made all arrangements for online classes. We will follow the instructions issued by the DEO,” Mary Alphonsa, principal of Don Bosco Academy, told this newspaper on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-deo-asks-private-schools-to-conduct-classes-in-hybrid-mode/articleshow/88130260.cms||Faryal Rumi

One sample is already undergoing genome sequencing test at IGIMS in Patna. Its result is awaited. Though total four persons with the history of foreign travel have tested positive for Covid-19, their variant is yet to be identified. State health society executive director Sanjay Kumar Singh said it takes at least 10 days to two weeks to get genome sequencing result.

The test reports of others are awaited.” Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh said they have got the information of 680 people in the district with foreign travel history in the past 20 days and the samples of 177 have been collected. When asked about the preparations, especially to counter the Omicron variant, Singh replied, “The study about this variant is still going on. However, the state has been working to tackle Covid-19 of any variant.” Officials said stress is on testing, tracing and treatment.

The new app will improve the grievance redressal system in the areas that fall under the jurisdiction of the civic body. During a standing committee meeting on ‘Swachh Survekshan’ here on Monday, PMC commissioner Animesh Kumar Parashar instructed the officials concerned to expedite the work on the app’s development so that the residents can lodge their complaints and get them resolved within the stipulated time. A PMC official told this reporter that the ‘City of Patna’ app was outdated. “Since there were different platforms to raise civic issues, the residents got confused. The new mobile app, however, will be a one-stop solution for all such problems,” he added. With a view to fetching a better ranking in the ‘Swachh Survekshan’, the executive officers of all the PMC circles – Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankerbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City — were asked to do field inspection of their areas and discuss the problems with the senior officials. The executive officers and the ward councillors were also instructed to organize awareness camps through posters, banners, rallies and competitions. During the meeting, the PMC commissioner directed the officials of the sanitation wing and the executive engineers to maintain public toilets and ensure uninterrupted water supply. He also asked the executive engineers to get the damaged manholes repaired. Parashar asked the officials to regularize the door-to-door garbage collection facility in all the 75 wards to get a better ranking in the next ‘Swachh Survekshan’. They were also told to conduct anti-encroachment drives in the city to remove illegal structures that lead to traffic snarls in Patna.

Tejashwi also took a jibe at the allegations of JD(U) MLA Gopal Mandal against his own party MP from Bhagalpur, Ajay Mandal, that he was involved in liquor trade. Tejashwi also pointed out that three persons died in Vaishali district due to the consumption of spurious liquor, as claimed by their family members. “There is administrative anarchy in Bihar. Health and education are in the worst form and law and order has failed. Without bribe, no work can be done at block level or in police station. Corruption is at its high. Students, teachers, farmers, labourers and contractual employees all are fed up,” Tejashwi tweeted. In another tweet, he mentioned the statement made by BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal earlier about the involvement of police in illegal liquor trade. Hitting back at Tejashwi, JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said, “Tejashwi hardly stays in Bihar and does not understand the administrative framework of the state. It will take him time to understand all these. Today is Baba Saheb’s death anniversary and look at the way Tejashwi has paid homage… on social media.

Teachers have been observing that children from both private and government schools have been finding it difficult to grasp English, mathematics and science. Though online classes and the Vidyagama programme were implemented, it has not been as effective as in-person classes. Schools are concentrating on these subjects, so that children are able to get back on track for regular classes and learning. “It is a matter of concern that students, especially from government schools, are finding it hard to grasp subjects like English and mathematics. Schools have been advised to concentrate more on these subjects for some time. The closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and non-availability of in-person classes is the main reason for learning difficulties among students,” said Rajalaxmi, BEO, South. C Lokesh, BEO, Puttur, said that their priority is SSLC students, who will soon appear for final examinations. “In order to prepare SSLC students for the final examinations, we are conducting bridge courses, pass mark packages for academically poor students and workshops on tough chapters. High school students are finding social science, science and mathematics hard to crack. The difficulty level of English has decreased, since many schools have the subject being taught from LKG onwards, and it’s a common subject in the bilingual medium and Karnataka Public Schools. Subjects like science and mathematics need practical classes, and it is impossible to learn these subjects online,” he added. Some school managements complained that they need to concentrate on the social and behavioural aspects of students as a priority, rather than academic learning. “Students are not able to sit in class and concentrate like before. They have forgotten basic etiquette of the school environment, and are unable to mingle with classmates. We are seeing a lot of behavioural issues, and are trying to mend them through workshops,” said a headmaster of an aided school in rural Puttur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/focus-on-teaching-maths-science-english-at-schools/articleshow/88130900.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The insurance regulator has also asked the government for health regulations or some power to regulate hospitals as it is not possible to control health insurance costs without control over hospitals. The pandemic is making both life and health insurance more expensive. Life insurers have been complaining about back-to-back rate hikes by international reinsurance companies like Munich Re, which control the prices of term insurance. Non-life insurance companies have seen hospitals increase their billing and reject cashless treatment, a mode where insurance companies have more control over pricing. Speaking at an insurance summit organised by CII on Monday, Irdai member (non-life) T L Alamelu said that, during the pandemic, the health insurance industry has settled 27.5 lakh claims for Rs 25,000 crore, while the life industry has settled death claims of nearly 1.7 lakh amounting to Rs 14,000 crore as claims. Alamelu said that unlike insurers, hospitals can keep increasing tariffs. “As an insurance regulator, we do find it difficult to regulate the health ecosystem,” said Alamelu. Comparing it to having to operate with hands tied behind the back, she said that there have been cases where patients were stuck as hospitals were refusing to accept ‘cashless treatment’ where insurers settle bills directly with insurance companies. “We had to step in and ask the state governments in such cases,” she said. “There should be a regulator for the health sector, or we should be allowed to regulate,” she said. Speaking at the event, IndiaFirst Life Insurance MD & CEO R M Vishakha said, “Covid impact on the life insurance industry has been harsh. The industry had to draw on their global reserves to pay claims. Our analysis showed that 80% of deaths reported in the first half of FY22 took place in two months during the first quarter.” She added that reinsurers had increased their rates twice. Alamelu said, “Reinsurers have their perspective on rates and it is not just Covid. We are in talks with reinsurers about why they are increasing premiums at this juncture.” According to Bajaj Allianz General Insurance MD & CEO Tapan Singhel, unlike general inflation, health claims are subject to medical inflation which is around 15%. This is because new medical technology catches on very quickly and leads to a medical trend that increases costs. Meanwhile, the industry has appealed to the government seeking a reduction in the 18% goods and services tax on health insurance, said Niva Bupa Health Insurance MD & CEO Ramachandran Krishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-questions-price-hikes-by-reinsurers/articleshow/88132141.cms||---

His initiatives to uplift these sections of the people found place in the Constitution, which is one of the best in the world, the chief minister said. Jagan said the YSRC was converting every dream of Dr Ambedkar by giving due recognition and representation to these neglected and weaker sections. “We are treating the Backward Classes as ‘backbone classes’. This is our commitment to the welfare of these sections,” the chief minister asserted. He further said the YSR Congress was giving the highest priority to the representation of women in political and constitutional posts in the state. He said the YSRC had given representation to several neglected castes for the first time, in the letter and spirit of what Dr Ambedkar had advocated. — Gopi Dara||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-pays-tributes-to-dr-ambedkar/articleshow/88130765.cms||Gopi Dara

This is RIL’s maiden green loan and is split into a $250-million six-year term borrowing, a $150-million working capital loan and a $336-million five-year bank guarantee facility, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. Drawdown of the loan took place on December 1 after which the entire outstanding liabilities at REC Solar were settled and the purchase was concluded, Refinitiv said. In October, RIL announced the purchase of REC Solar from China National BlueStar for $771 million, including debt. The deal represented a rare instance of an Indian company buying assets from a Chinese seller. The $736-million green loan is also a rare acquisition financing from RIL, which opted for a term borrowing instead of a short-term bridge facility as is typically employed in most M&A situations, the Refinitiv report added. REC Solar is a 25-year-old company with three manufacturing plants — two in Norway for making solar grade polysilicon, and one in Singapore manufacturing photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules. RIL plans to use REC Solar’s technology in its fully integrated, metallic silicon to PV panel manufacturing giga factory in Jamnagar, Gujarat, initially starting with annual capacity of 4GW and eventually growing to 10GW. After REC Solar, RIL announced a stake-purchase in Mumbai-based Sterling & Wilson Solar. The acquisitions and the green loan mark RIL’s first steps in its goal to become a net carbon zero company by 2035 and make India a hub for low-cost solar manufacturing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-makes-green-finance-debut-with-736mn-loan/articleshow/88132151.cms||---

The friend, who received a minor injury near his ear, had filed a complaint against the accused, who also happened to be his neighbour. Police have recovered the weapon and a live cartridge from his house. Preliminary interrogation has revealed that the accused wanted to enter the world of crime and wanted others to know about him and his intentions. SHO (Rajeev Gandhi Nagar) Anil Kumar said that Raja Meghwal (23) shot at his friend Sunil Samyani on November 26 and fled from the spot. Samyani was fortunate that the shot missed him.  “He sustained a minor injury on his right ear,” said the officer, adding that since then Meghwal had been hiding at different places as far as up to Kanpur, UP. Describing the incident, the SHO said that on the day of incident, Meghwal had intercepted Samyani when he was going home at night and demanded Rs. 50 from him. “He refused to give the money. An enraged Meghwal whipped out a pistol from his pocket and shot at him,” the officer said. Where he got the weapon from is yet to be investigated, however, preliminary interrogation has brought an alarming revelation, which once again reaffirmed the growing fascination with the world of crime and possession of weapons. ACP Neeraj Sharma said that the main intention of the accused by shooting at Samyani was to spread terror and draw the attention of other criminals and peer group. “He said that he wanted to enter the world of crime and wanted to be known as a criminal,” said Sharma. Interestingly, both the accused and the victim are neighbours and there was no apparent enmity between them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-arrested-for-firing-at-his-friend-over-money-issue/articleshow/88132103.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Rising input costs to push up truck, bus rates||Chennai: After cars and SUVs, now trucks and buses will cost 2-2.5% more from January as manufacturers cite a sharp rise in raw material costs, particularly steel. Tata Motors has announced that it will hike prices “in the range of 2.5% from January 1, 2022” across its various segments from medium & heavy commercial vehicles (CVs), intermediate & light CVs, small CVs and buses. “The increase in the prices of commodities such as steel, aluminium and other precious metals, in addition to higher costs of other raw materials, has incited this price hike for commercial vehicles,” the company said in a statement. It earlier hiked CV prices by 2% in October. Ashok Leyland has also decided to go in for a price hike across its range in January with the range fixed at around 2%. Like Tata Motors, Leyland too had increased prices earlier this year — 2% each in March and July. Others like Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV) are also looking at a markup to pass on part of the raw material cost increase. VECV managing director (MD) & chief executive officer (CEO) Vinod Aggarwal said, “We are also thinking about a price hike as it has now become imperative. Steel prices have doubled in the last one year and other components like tyres have also seen a sharp increase in prices. There is no alternative to a price increase.” Auto analysts say CV companies are being forced to mark up rates because of inflationary pressures and because the truck market is beginning to look up after three years of negative sales. Rating agency ICRA’s VP Shamsher Dewan said, “The price hikes are due to pressure on the raw material side, but demand has also improved. Particularly for heavy trucks aided by demand from infrastructure spending, e-commerce and retail.” CV sales have been picking up year on year with the latest retail stats from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations showing a 26.4% jump in October 2021 over last year. CV sales went from 44,865 units in October 2020 to 56,732 units this year. Commercial vehicle companies have also been launching products with market leader Tata Motors unveiling 21 variants, refreshes and other new models before the festival season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rising-input-costs-to-push-up-truck-bus-rates/articleshow/88131578.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

It was revealed in the medical examination (culture) report from the microbiology lab of Shri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Vinay Kumar Sharma on Monday said the investigation revealed that the infection was spread by the bacterium (microscopic living organism) found in the operation theatre (OT) of Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital. “The swab samples were collected from the OT and medicine shop of the hospital by a four-member team constituted last week,” he told the mediapersons. The panel, however, said the operating surgeons were not responsible for the incident. “The investigation report shows that two different types of bacterium — Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus — was found in the OT. Both are quite virulent and damage the eyes a lot in just one to two days. The same have been found in the samples of people whose eyes had to be removed surgically after infection spread. We have sent the report to the state health department,” Dr Sharma said. A four-member committee probing the incident of alleged botched-up cataract surgery in the Juran Chapra hospital had collected the swab from the operation theatre and sent the samples for examination on November 30 to identify the source of infection. Altogether 65 people had undergone cataract surgery at the hospital on November 22. Those who lost their vision suffered severe pain and discharge of water from the eyes. Fifteen patients are undergoing treatment at IGIMS-Patna for the infection. As many as 19 more victims were also referred to IGIMS on Monday for treatment. These people are mainly from East Champaran and West Champaran. East Champaran civil surgeon Dr Anjani Kumar said total 13 patients from the district had undergone cataract surgery at Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital on November 22. “We have identified them and referred them to the IGIMS for medical treatment and check-up. Only six of them are willing to go while five are reluctant. Two patients are undergoing treatment at SKMCH,” he said. No one from Bettiah was ready to go for treatment at IGIMS as they are scared that they may lose their eyesight completely, said West Champaran civil surgeon Dr Virendra Kumar Chaudhary. “One person’s eye was removed during treatment at a private hospital in Bettiah, while another one’s eye was removed at SKMCH. Three persons, who also suffered from the infection, are not ready to go to any hospital giving free treatment while one patient left for Nepal. We will send the report to the state health department,” he told this newspaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bacteria-in-muz-hosp-ot-caused-infection-report/articleshow/88130826.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||Adapt on climate, not just mitigate: Study||MUMBAI: With the COP26 UN conference mobilising efforts among nations to build an ambitious climate agenda, the responsibility shifts to corporates to focus on adaptation from just mitigation action till now. To help drive this, corporate goals and government regulations need to be altered to achieve decarbonisation goals, with company boards setting the bar higher, says a report by KPMG. Over the past couple of years, though there is high awareness in India with certain large corporates initiating action on a ‘green’ portfolio, this needs to move further from just ‘talk’ and onto small firms & supply chains now. Moving from a climate-mitigation strategy, companies will need a lot more firepower to meet the challenges of climate change, while boards will need to step up significantly, way beyond their regular role to drive that change, said the report titled ‘Decarbonisation and the evolving role of corporate boards’. The recently concluded COP26 Summit in Glasgow — or the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties — has kept alive the goal of keeping global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius, and will reconvene in Egypt next year to update the goals. This would require countries and the private sector to urgently put forth ambitious new climate programmes and policies, including technological advances, experts say. With climate goals ratcheting up and regulation getting tighter, organisations will need to step up and move beyond only compliance, Anish De, global sector head (power & utilities) at KPMG and national head (energy & natural resources) at KPMG India, told TOI. When companies were looking at climate-related matters, they were reporting on emissions alone. A big change now has to be enabling real-time decision making, and enablement of front line staff. It will thus move beyond mitigation to adaptation, which has not been under focus till now. For instance, how to make supply chains resilient. This will be a big cultural change (for corporates), and it is not about short-term maximisation any more. It’s about creating new levels of organisation agility, and the board will take hard calls and go beyond their remit, according to De. It is important to stay clear of ‘greenwashing’, and instead set goals backed by viable action plans, tangible actions and measurement. Setting clear goals backed by the right key performance indicators (KPIs) that meet business and regulatory needs is of great importance, the report says. Corporations will have to tailor the implementation to suit regional priorities in the near term, even as they focus on a global decarbonisation agenda in the long term. Long-range planning and action, difficult as it is, will be necessary, but coupled with short-term agile actions. Manpreet Singh, partner (ESG) at KPMG India, said, “Organisations recognise that stakeholders — such as investors, regulators, and customers — expect organisations to deliver a positive impact. The purpose-led CEO follows through and delivers on commitments with a big focus on ESG programmes. Organisations need support from the government, to turbocharge climate investments.” Despite challenges and uncertainties, there is a very big opportunity in funding the energy transition. The capital needs are very large and convergence of global political and investor priorities because of climate change make this area very prospective, even as risks will require scrutiny, the report adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adapt-on-climate-not-mitigate-study/articleshow/88132178.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Mumbai||Plea in Bombay HC for quashing 2% SBC reservation||MUMBAI: A city advocate has filed a petition before the Bombay high court to seek quashing of a 1994 Maharashtra notification that permits 2 percent reservation to Special Backward Classes (SBC). The challenge is on the grounds that it takes the overall quota in the state to 52 percent, breaching the 50 percent bar on quotas without showing extraordinary circumstances or compelling reasons, as held by the Supreme Court. The challenge is to the 2 percent SBC reservation in public services in Maharashtra under a December 8, 1994 notification. Such excessive reservation is “invalid and violative of the provisions of the Constitution of India,” says the petition filed by advocate Sanjeet Shukla as an “authorized representative” of an organization called ‘Youth for Equality’. The petition was scheduled to be heard on Monday before a bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar. Due to paucity of time, it did not reach and will be heard in due course. The petition contends that there is a cabinet note dated 30.11.1994 regarding inclusion of specific castes and tribes in the backward class category. The note, the petition adds, led to declaration of certain castes such as Gowari, Mana, Koshti, Koli etc as special backward category. The petitioner wanted a hearing for orders of an interim stay against implementation of the “excess 2 percent” quota granted to SBC for government jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/plea-in-bombay-hc-for-quashing-2-sbc-reservation/articleshow/88132115.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: DMRC agrees to deposit Rs 1,000 crore in escrow account, disputes arbitral amount||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Monday disputed the amount payable as per the arbitral award of over Rs 4,600 crore passed in favour of Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL). Even as it agreed before Delhi High Court to deposit within 48 hours Rs 1,000 crore in an escrow account towards the award, DMRC maintained that as per its calculation, the amount to be paid is approximately Rs 5,000 crore, and not over Rs 7,000 crore as claimed by the Reliance Infrastructure subsidiary. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing DMRC, added that the private company was arm-twisting the government to realise the amount claimed and pointed out that since the public corporation was facing a financial crunch, undertaking a sudden liability would impact public function. DMRC sought time and also suggested taking over DAMEPL’s debt to the extent of the award money. “We are working out possibilities etc. Even if we have to pay, we may have to borrow (from banks). If it can be looked into, we can take over your (DAMEPL) debt and we will take care of the banks,” Mehta submitted before Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, who was hearing DAMEPL’s plea seeking execution of the arbitral award. Senior advocate Parag Tripathi, also appearing for DMRC, explained to the bench that if the corporation dealt with the banks, there would be greater flexibility due to the presence of public interest. The plea was opposed by senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, appearing for DAMEPL, who contended that the final payable amount must be first ascertained as according to their calculation, it was over Rs 7,000 crore. He also argued that DMRC must first deposit 50% of the awarded amount with the court and not deal directly with the banks to which DAMEPL owed money. “This is a government undertaking... Let the amount come to the court first. Can we say the government has gone bankrupt? They are sitting over a reserve of Rs 10,000 crore,” Nayar argued. In response, Mehta said it was not possible for DMRC to deposit half of the awarded amount, and for anything beyond Rs 1,000 crore, the public transport firm might have to borrow from banks. “Take proper instructions,” Justice Kait told DMRC, referring to the final payable amount under the award, and posted the matter for December 22. The court also recorded that DMRC would deposit Rs 1,000 crore in an escrow account within 48 hours and asked the counsel for DAMEPL to take instructions on the Metro rail corporation’s suggestion. An arbitral tribunal, in May 2017, had ruled in favour of DAMEPL, which had pulled out from running the Airport Express Metro line over safety issues, and accepted its claim that the running of operations was not viable due to structural defects in the viaduct. Last month, the Supreme Court dismissed DMRC’s plea seeking a review of its judgement that upheld the 2017 arbitration award in favour of DAMEPL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-agrees-to-deposit-rs-1000cr-in-escrow-a/c-disputes-arbitral-amount/articleshow/88132145.cms||---

He was handed over to Anupgarh police. The intruder was identified as Mohammad Ahmar (22), a resident of 22 FW in Hasilpur village of Bahawalpur province of Pakistan. Police have recovered some foreign currency and a mobile phone from his possession. Sriganganagar SP Anand Sharma said Ahmar will be questioned by a joint interrogation committee of security and intelligence agencies and will be pushed back if nothing is found suspicious. During preliminary inquiry, Ahmar told security forces that he came in contact with a Mumbai woman through social media and fell in love. They decided to marry but he failed to get a valid visa. Heartbroken over not being able to get legal travel documents, he decided to walk up to the Indian border taking a bus from his village to Bahawalpur and then crossed the Zero line in the dark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/in-love-with-mum-woman-pak-man-sneaks-into-indian-territory/articleshow/88132113.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Omicron: Kerala awaits test results of 3 persons||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state is awaiting the results of the three samples sent for genome sequencing to detect the new variant of Coronoavirus, Omicron. The samples have been taken from the three persons who have come from high-risk countries and have been tested positive for Covid-19 here. Health minister Veena George said that so far there was no threat in the state and more samples were being collected from those who have come from the high-risk countries and are having even the slightest symptoms. Meanwhile, George defended the circular issued by the director of health services that the district medical officers should not speak to the media. She said that the circular will not be withdrawn. The circular had said that only the health minister or the director of health services can speak on the issues relating to Omicron to the media. She said that the circular has been issued to have a unified information in the messages being passed to the media. There is no ban on giving the information to the media, but the decision is to have no conflicting reports being given to the media. On the visit made by her to the Attapadi tribal hospital and the criticisms made by the hospital superintendent, George said that the visit was planned a day before and it was a surprise visit made to the hospital. More such visits will be made in the future too. George said she was not ready to listen to the criticisms made by the hospital superintendent and was not ready to comment anything on that. Meanwhile, the state has started to source the testing kits for Omicron such that the tests can be done in the labs here itself. At present only Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology is having this testing facility in the state. Hence the state government has decided to seek the permission of the ICMR and the Union health ministry to conduct the tests in the state itself if the number of suspected cases increases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/omicron-state-awaits-test-results-of-3-persons/articleshow/88131413.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Will not perform Corona duties, resident doctors warn||AHMEDABAD: After withdrawing from out-patient department (OPD) services last week, the Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA) at BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital has now said that its members will not take up emergency and Covid-related duties if their demands are not met. In a written representation, the association has given an ultimatum till Tuesday 6pm to the college and hospital authorities to accept its pending demands. The demands include a fast-track process for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test postgraduate (NEET-PG) counselling 2021. The medicos say they are overworked as only two batches of students are currently deployed at medical colleges. NEET-PG exams for MD/MS admissions are usually held in January, but due to Covid they were held in September. While counselling was to commence on October 25, petitions challenging a central government notification stalled the process. Senior resident doctors (final-year students from the 2018 batch) were relieved a few months ago. As a result, hospitals are managing with only two batches, instead of three. The association has demanded that the resident doctors who are in their second year be provided with medical officers to assist them till the new batch joins. JDA has also sought the implementation of the bond plus senior residency scheme for the batches that have joined after 2018. “This scheme was implemented for the 2018 batch and it has been very successful in peripheral hospitals of the government and district hospitals where skilled doctors are available,” according to the representation. “It should be extended to batches that have joined after 2018.” Resident doctors from various parts of the country have joined a pan-India agitation of medical students against the postponement of NEET-PG counselling. JDA of NHL Medical College has decided to join the ongoing protest. On Monday, the association said its members will withdraw from all routine and emergency services from Wednesday to protest against the repeated delays in NEET-PG 2021 counselling. JDA of Surat Medical College and New Civil Hospital has also announced its withdrawal from all routine services from Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-not-perform-corona-duties-resident-doctors-warn/articleshow/88131416.cms||---

---||Mumbai||SC: Another agency should probe cases against Singh||New Delhi: The CBI told the SC bench that cases against Param Bir Singh should be transferred to the agency. “We have no objection if the probe is given to us,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench which asked the CBI to file its response on affidavit. However, the state government opposed the plea for transfer of probe to CBI and Senior advocate Darius Kambatta told the bench that Param Bir Singh is not the whistle-blower he has projected himself as, but was part of the system and responsible for transfers and postings which he now says involved corruption. “He turned whistle-blower when he started feeling the heat,” he told the bench. Opposing the CBI probe, Kambatta pointed out the present CBI director was also part of the transfer and posting decisions when he was state DGP and he will be “a witness if not accused” in the case. He said Bombay HC has already reserved its verdict on a plea for court-monitored SIT probe on the FIR lodged by CBI against Deshmukh. He said CBI director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal was part of Police Establishment Board that oversaw transfers and postings of police officers in question. The bench, after a brief hearing, adjourned the case for January 11 and asked CBI to file its response. The bench, however, clarified it will examine the plea of an ex-Mumbai top cop on the issue of alleged bias of state machinery. The bench said that by the next date of hearing, the HC verdict might also come on SIT probe. “We are on likelihood of bias.. Let me be upfront... We think that other agency should look into it,” Justice Kaul said. With the Param Bir Singh contending that he was being targeted by the state machinery for exposing the corruption and extortion racket in the police administration and the state government accused him to be part of the that same “corrupt” system but donning the hat of whistle-blower to protect himself , the bench expressed deep concern over them washing dirty linen in public. The bench raised questions on what signal is going out to the general public with these allegations and counter allegations and termed the Param Bir Singh-Anil Deshmukh episode as “very unfortunate” which undermined the system. The court said it was happening because state governments were not complying with its order on police reform. While seeking SIT instead of the ongoing CBI against Deshmukh, the state contended before the HC that over 92% of PEB recommendations were approved by the home department during Deshmukh’s tenure, so they were not mere recommendations and the central agency headed by Jaiswal cannot conduct an impartial investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-another-agency-should-probe-cases-against-singh/articleshow/88132133.cms||---
---||Goa||ISL: FC Goa huff and puff past East Bengal for first win||FC Goa ended their three-match losing streak with a hard-fought 4-3 win against SC East Bengal in the Indian Super League (ISL) at Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Wednesday. Alberto Noguera scored a brace including the decisive strike that separated the two teams. Jorge Ortiz was the other scorer, while Antonio Perosevic scored an own-goal to help Goa’s cause. But Goa coach Juan Ferrando will not be happy as his side committed errors, conceding two goals from Perosevic and one from Amir Dervisevic. With this win, the first of the season, Goa displaced East Bengal from the 10th spot. East Bengal have two points and are still waiting to register their first win of the campaign. Back in the starting 11, Edu Bedia’s presence added stability in midfield and the captain could have put them ahead early in the game. A poor clearance from the East Bengal defence fell straight to Bedia and the Spaniard should have done better with the quality he possessed, before striking the ball over the crossbar. However, it was another Spaniard that gave Goa the breakthrough with a spectacular finish in the 14th minute. Noguera picked up the ball from Ortiz on the edge of the box and unleashed a stunning right-footer that gave no chance to goalkeeper Suvam Sen. After suffering three straight defeats, it was the first time Goa took the lead this season. Soon, Noguera split open the rival defence with a fine pass to Ortiz, but the narrow angle made it difficult for him to hit the target. Goa were dominating with superior ball possession but the decision to have only three in defence backfired before the half an hour mark. It gave Bikash Jairu a lot of space and last man Seriton Fernandes had to bring him down on the edge of the box before he could do any damage. The initial free-kick by Amir Dervisevic hit the wall, but the rebound fell straight to former Croatia international Perosevic, whose half-volley was simply unstoppable. Goa kept going and Seriton soon made amends when he won a penalty in the 32nd minute after a tackle by Sourav Das. Referee Ramaswamy Srikrishna initially gave a free-kick, but changed his decision after consulting his assistant. Ortiz stepped up and made no mistake. Goa, though, could not maintain focus, particularly goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh who was deceived by Dervisevic’s freekick. Goals continued to flow and Goa needed a bit of luck for their third when Perosevic netted in his own-goal after a header from Devendra Murgaonkar hit his thigh. At the hour mark, Goa gifted East Bengal a goal when Glan Martins' back pass went terribly wrong and fell to Perosevic, who finished neatly for his brace. Goa produced the killer blow in the 80th minute when Ortiz sent in a good low cross across and Nongdamba Naorem did well to leave it for Noguera to score his second of the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-fc-goa-huff-and-puff-past-east-bengal-for-first-win/articleshow/88152116.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Con’ realtor in US, his business partners told to stay put||MUMBAI: After the police informed that a developer who stopped appearing in court has fled to the United States of America, Bombay high court on Monday directed his two partners not to leave the country without taking its prior permission. “We learn from such matters to first pass an order not to leave the country,” said justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav. They heard five petitions by flat purchasers against Jayesh Rami, Rajesh Savla and Ashwin Mistry who are partners and directors of Raj Arcades and Enclave Pvt Ltd. They “cheated” several flat purchasers and also Anand Rathi Global Finance Ltd (ARGFL) in respect of their project, Raj-Shivganga, at Babrekar Nagar, Kandivali (west). The trio collected substantial amounts from flat purchasers in 2010-11, issued allotment letters and entered into registered agreements for sale in 2018-19. In 2017, they mortgaged 22 flats to ARGFL, from whom they had borrowed Rs 12 crore, by misrepresenting that they were unsold flats. ARGFL won in proceedings before a magistrate. On November 10, HC directed it not to take possession of the flats. On November 12, the three directors appeared in court. The court receiver was directed to take possession of their Kandivli office and auction it. The judges also sought disclosures, including of their assets, bank accounts and IT returns. On November 18, Rami’s advocate said he was not contactable. The judges directed him to be present on November 22. Since he did not turn up, the judges issued a bailable warrant. On November 30, the judges issued a non-bailable warrant after the senior inspector of Kandivli police station informed they are unable to trace Rami. On Monday, the judges were told by a police officer that Rami’s son-in-law informed that he went to the US through Dubai on November 18 when he was directed to appear in court. Also, his wife and son live in the US. The judges then directed Rami’s son-in-law to remain present on Tuesday so that “at least he can give some details”.  “It seems the whole family is in the US. See that the other two directors don’t go to the US,” said justice Kathawalla. Restraining Savla and Mistry, the judges directed “they shall deposit their passports in court” on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-con-realtor-in-us-his-biz-partners-told-to-stay-put/articleshow/88132159.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Mumbai||BMC to give poll panel new wards’ draft list this week||MUMBAI: With the state government notifying the addition of nine more electoral seats in the BMC last week, the municipal corporation is likely to submit its new draft of ward boundaries to the State Election Commission (SEC) by the end of this week. “We are working on the draft of ward boundaries; our proposal will be ready soon,” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said. Despite the delay in the state notification, SEC officials said the BMC elections will be conducted as scheduled in February.On November 10, the state cabinet decided to increase the electoral seats to 236 from 227, and sent the ordinance to the governor for approval on November 16. The ordinance was approved and the notification issued last week. The BMC has proposed to add five seats in the western suburbs, three in the eastern suburbs and one in the island city. The BMC will submit the list to the SEC, which, in turn, will invite objections and suggestions from the public before finalising the ward boundaries. The last time electoral wards were increased in Mumbai was in 2002, when the number went up from 221 to 227. According to the 2011 census, there has been a 3.87% increase in population within the jurisdiction of the BMC. After the 2011 census came out, the BMC had redrawn electoral wards to account for a rise in population in the suburbs and a decline in the island city. “Mumbai’s population is around 1.2 crore and average number of voters per ward is around 54,000. With nine more seats, the average number of voters in each electoral ward would be nearly 51,000, though in some wards, it could be 10% above or below average,” said an official. “Once we get the orders from the government, we will rework the ward boundaries keeping in mind the new average of voters per ward and redraw the boundaries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-give-poll-panel-new-wards-draft-list-this-wk/articleshow/88132749.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Resident doctors across the state have been peacefully protesting for almost a week against the delay in NEET PG counselling and the shortage of junior residents in various hospitals in the state. However, there has been no positive response on concrete action from the state health department, said Dr Athul Ashok, Kerala Medical Post-graduate Association (KMPGA) state president. “We are left with no other option but to boycott all emergency services from Wednesday, excluding Covid postings. We wish to emphasise and reiterate that we do not want patients to suffer. Rather, we want more doctors to be employed for better patient care,” said Dr Naveen R, KMPGA state secretary. Association leaders said that resident doctors of all government medical college hospitals are already overburdened, and there are currently only two batches in place of the usual three. With the looming threat of the third Covid wave, they are concerned and desperately want the healthcare system to be well prepared with adequate manpower in hospitals. “We have already proposed a plan to recruit non-academic junior residents on a temporary basis to share our duties so that we could concentrate on our academic works as well. We have already discussed the issues with the health minister on August 8. The decisions made that day still remains in papers,” said Dr Naveen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pg-medicos-to-boycott-emergency-services-from-wed/articleshow/88131449.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Garbage burnt on mangroves, Bombay HC raps Uran civic body, state||MUMBAI: Concerned that garbage is dumped and burnt on mangroves at Uran in Navi Mumbai, Bombay high court on Monday rapped the authorities, including Cidcdo, over the delay in identifying a dumping ground for the Uran Municipal Council area. “We can see from the photograph that garbage is being burnt on mangroves. On one hand, we talk of preservation of mangroves, and we destroy them by burning them,’’ said justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav. TimesViewWhy does it require the courts to nudge and push civic authorities to do their statutory duties? Mangroves not only protect coastlines from storms and floods, but are also valuable nursery areas for fish. Dumping and burning garbage in such eco-sensitive areas must be halted and the local administration must quickly finalise a new dumping ground.The judges heard a petition filed in December 2018 by a fisherfolk body, Hanuman Koliwada Macchimar Vikas Sanstha Maryadit, that the dumping of solid waste on mangroves is impacting the breeding ground of fish and affects their livelihood. The judges noed that Uran Municipal Council and the collector, Raigad, have been making statements for over two years and shifting responsibility from one authority to the other. “This blame-game has to stop. It has been over two years. This will go on for 20 years. Ping-pong match is going on,” said justice Kathawalla. Last month, Cidco was added as a party after the court was told it is developing open lands in the areas concerned. Its advocate, G S Hegde, informed that it is an “uphill task to find land” as most of its lands are developed or covered by coastal regulation zone (CRZ). Justice Jadhav said, “The problem will become worse. It will affect your own developed areas. Where will they dump the garbage? As planning authority, you (Cidco) need to have vision. Something has to be done. Cause is very serious.” The petitioner’s advocate, Meenaz Kakalia, said, “Two metric tonnes of unsegregated solid waste is every day dumped on the mangroves.” The judges, in their order, noted that in 2018, Uran civic boy had said it had identified a plot. The collector, in 2019, said land is yet to be identified. Also, their statements to high court are not complied with for over two years and they are shifting responsibility from one authority to another. “Such conduct on part of the council and/or the collector cannot be tolerated. It is their duty to abide by statements made before the court and also to comply with the directions of the court,’” they added. The judges directed the collector, Cicdo’s executive engineer (civil) and member-secretary, state pollution body to appear at Tuesday’s online hearing to assist court resolve “long-standing issue of dumping waste in mangroves”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/garbage-burnt-on-mangroves-bombay-hc-raps-uran-civic-body-state/articleshow/88132165.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Chandigarh||PGI faculty assns demand recruitment of support staff||Chandigarh: PGI faculty associations have submitted a representation to the Union minister of health and family welfare about shortage of manpower and lack of office space. The minister had come to PGI on Sunday but could not meet faculty association members due to paucity of time. “The institute is expanding but support staff to run OTs is lacking. There is shortage of some 500 junior and senior residents who are to be appointed. These have not been provided since the start of the pandemic,” said a faculty. He added, “Some four years ago, around 250 faculty were recruited but more residents were required to assist them. Residents are the backbone of the institute, who work round the clock in emergency.” The faculty association, led by president prof J S Thakur, is conducting a survey to get a database of the shortage and requirement of office space for the faculty. The representation stated, “Though the faculty of the institute has increased to meet demands of increasing number of patients visiting the institute, the institute has not proportionately expanded in terms of infrastructure and support staff. This is resulting in suboptimal functioning of the staff due to lack of office space, accommodation, sufficient OT tables etc.” The association also demanded setting up of a dedicated infectious disease hospital, new OT complex, advanced laboratories for research along with trained technical staff. “There is not enough housing and office space for the junior faculty. This is one of the pending demands for a few years. A committee was set up and assurance was given for allocation of office space to the faculty. If we struggle for basic amenities, how can we perform on world class standards for patient care?” said a faculty. The letter to the minister mentioned, “The issue of rotatory headship for developing leadership and equal opportunity to senior faculty is also pending for long. For outstanding performance of any institute, it requires good faculty. A good pay package at the entry level can attract the best minds and avoid brain drain. The downgrade of pay at entry level and difference in the basic pay of medical and non-medical faculty, which happened during implementation of the 7th pay commission is affecting the morale of the faculty. Implementation of conveyance allowance is also pending.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-faculty-assns-demand-recruitment-of-support-staff/articleshow/88131439.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Seven pistols, a machine and some tools used in firearms' manufacture have been recovered from them. The two arrested men are Shailesh Kumar (29) from Aligarh and Mohammad Hanif (81), a resident of Kasganj. According to police, they received information last week that one person would come to Sarita Vihar on a motorcycle to deliver a consignment of illegal firearms. “Acting on the input, a team laid down a trap near a CNG pump in Sarita Vihar and around 12.40 am, a motorcycle rider was seen coming from Ashram Chowk. He was asked to stop, but he took a sharp turn seeing the cops. However, his motorcycle slipped and he fell on the road. He was overpowered and illegal firearms were recovered from him,” said a senior police officer. The man was identified as Shailesh Kumar and a case was registered against him. “During questioning, he disclosed that one of his associates Mohammad Hanif was also involved with him in operating the supply of illegal firearms. Two days later, Hanif was arrested from his house in Kasganj, UP. The team recovered two country made pistols, a machine and equipment used in making firearms from his house. Further investigation is under progress to nab their associates,” the officer said. During interrogation, Kumar disclosed that one of his acquaintances introduced him to Hanif and his associates who used to make illegal firearms at their native places. “He used to buy illegal firearms from Hanif and sell them in Delhi to unknown people. Hanif disclosed that he used to make illegal weapons at his house.

All these centres are likely to be constructed by the UT engineering department, as they did the earlier ones. “The civic body has no funds for such projects. Earlier too, the UT’s engineering department has constructed community centres,” sources said. “The MC has received the drawings to check and approve them. Technical officials of the engineering department are checking the drawings,” sources said. Community centres of Manimajra and Sector 63 have more area than that in Bapu Dham’s due to availability of land. Although financial estimates of the projects were yet to be prepared, sources said the cost of each project would be around Rs 4 to 5 crore. Besides, marriage and other functions, these community centres would also offer accommodation for elderly and would be equipped with different facilities other than parking. Community centres have been designed in a manner so that maximum people could be accommodated according to availability of land at the site. All the community centres constructed in the recent past were spacious with multiple facilities. The new ones would have all such facilities. Box: MC out of funds The new community centres will cost a lot according to new specifications, designs and facilities. As the civic body has been short of funds, these works were given to the engineering department of the UT administration. Development works related to building and roads (B&R) wing of the MC’s engineering department were also given to the UT engineering department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-dept-approves-design-of-3-new-community-centres/articleshow/88131447.cms||Deepak Yadav

At present, though, Imran Sheikh, former captain of India’s deaf team, is busy coaching young and aspiring cricketers across the state. In fact, many young deaf cricketers are also getting lessons right in their own backyard thanks to the YouTube channel and a website launched by Sheikh. “The state is home to a lot of talented and aspiring cricketers. I realized this when I started coaching youngsters in the city some years ago. Among my wards were some deaf and speech impaired youngsters who wanted to get professional cricket coaching,” Sheikh said. “It was then that I decided to reach out to aspiring cricketers. It isn’t possible to gather youngsters in large numbers amid Covid pandemic and many can’t even travel long distances. So, I decided to start a YouTube channel where I regularly share cricketing tips,” Sheikh, who has started Deaf Cricket Club of Baroda, told TOI. He uses sign language to convey his coaching and fitness tips on his channel. “There are not many institutes for the deaf cricketers who live in district areas and remote locations. The idea is to give a helping hand to such cricketers who want professional coaching,” said 36-year-old Sheikh. He also gives live demonstrations of how to bowl a delivery and field while ensuring that a cricketer doesn’t suffer any injury. Sheikh, an all-rounder, played a pivotal role with bat when India won the deaf and mute cricket World Cup in 2005. His consistent performance catapulted him to the captaincy of the team in 2012. Sheikh later led the deaf cricket team on many occasions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ex-captain-of-indian-deaf-team-goes-hi-tech-to-train-cricketers/articleshow/88131468.cms||Tushar Tere

DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu confirmed the commission had received the representation. The letter, signed by 530 people from diverse backgrounds, said, “Delhi has the dubious distinction of implementing one of the world’s longest pandemic-induced school closures, surpassed only by Uganda and Nepal as per Unesco data. After more than 600 days of closure, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) authorised the reopening of schools for all classes at 50% capacity, effective November 1. Unfortunately, this coincided with the annual pollution cycle and schools were once again closed on November 13.” The letter said while the Delhi government allowed schools to open from November 29 in view of improved air quality, it once again closed them from December 3. “Extensive learning losses have rendered the right to education meaningless for many children,” it added. In their letter, parents said that the benefit of closing schools to protect children from air pollution is “unclear”. “Since air purifiers are expensive, a tiny percentage of Delhi homes will have them. Most Delhi children, therefore, breathe the same air at home – they are not benefiting from school closure. On the contrary, they are suffering further learning and health losses,” they said in the letter. Pointing out that DCPCR had been active in the matter of Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant and lactating women, the letter said: “The present matter concerns our children’s fundamental rights and welfare, and the discussion in the Supreme Court has so far not focused on this aspect.” The parents further said they hoped that an intervention by DCPCR will help the SC and other authorities in the capital “strike the correct balance between the rights and well-being of Delhi’s children and other considerations”. Several parents had made a representation to the lieutenant governor in this regard earlier as well. DCPCR had also written to the LG and DDMA seeking reopening of schools and highlighting the adverse impact on students’ learning outcomes if they remain closed for too long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/500-parents-write-to-dcpcr-seek-reopening-of-pvt-schools/articleshow/88132212.cms||Shradha Chettri

Shardanand got a hero’s welcome on his return to the city on Monday. Hockey players, friends, family members and residents garlanded Shardanand and appreciated his performance in the Junior World Cup. Talking to TOI, Shardanand said his dream was to win an Olympic medal for the country. “Initially, I was not serious when I took up hockey. Soon, it became my passion and I decided to make a career in sports. The financial condition of my family was not good due to which I had to face many hardships,” he said. “Earlier, I used to play as forward but later switched role as a defender on the advice of my coach Rashid Aziz Khan. When the turf changed at the Sports College Lucknow, I brought a piece for myself on which I practiced a lot,” Shardanand added. Asked as to what was the scene in the dressing room after the quarterfinal win, Shardanand said, “One of our teammates had his birthday that day. We decided that we will cut the cake after we win the match.” On the team’s loss in semi-finals, he said: “We got chances but we failed to capitalize on it. My aim is to win medal for the country in the 2024 Olympics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/want-to-win-olympic-medalfor-country-shardanand/articleshow/88132210.cms||Fazal Khan

It said that 79% of the total surrendered flats are located in the newly-developed Narela sub-city. In a written reply, junior housing minister Kaushal Kishore said the DDA has informed the ministry that out of 56,932 flats offered by it since 2014, about 15,500 flats have either been surrendered by the allottees or have remained unsold. He said the DDA sought feedback and suggestions from the allottees and residents for reasons of surrender or cancellation of allotted flats. The reasons cited include: flats are located in remote areas; cost of flats is on higher side; non-availability of Metro connectivity and small size of the flats. “In order to improve saleability of these flats, DDA has undertaken various remedial measures including improvement of transport infrastructure, construction of Urban Extension Road-II and some concession to the purchasers,” the minister said.

---||Ahmedabad||GPCB is just for name’s sake, says Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday lambasted the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for its poor oversight of seven common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) in Ahmedabad and remarked, “It could be said that the GPCB is just for name’s sake.” While issuing interim directions to improve the functioning of CETPs and sewage treatment plants (STPs), the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati held GPCB solely responsible for the pollution caused by improper treatment of industrial effluent and sewage discharged into the Sabarmati river. For the inefficient functioning of the CETPs, the judges said, “It is very unfortunate that the GPCB never paid any attention so far to the dismal and absolute poor functioning of the CETPs. It was the statutory duty of the GPCB to take action at an appropriate time, more particularly, when it realized that the CETPs are hardly treating industrial effluent. It could be said that the GPCB is just for name’s sake. It has not only let the people of Gujarat down but has dragged them to a potential health hazard. We hold the GPCB wholly responsible for bringing about this kind of alarming situation.” The HC also asked whether the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) should have encashed the bank guarantees of the companies running the CETPs. The court has sought an action plan from the AMC, GPCB and the state government for repair and overhauls of all seven CETPs. “We want to know why no action has been taken till this date against the companies running the CETPs,” the court asked. The court directed GPCB to furnish details about the last visit and inspection of CETPs and if it brought to the notice of the companies any deficiency. The GPCB will have to say what action it has taken to ensure that CETPs function at optimal level and in accordance with the rules and regulations. The court’s rebuke came after the authorities concerned confessed that only three of 14 STPs out and one CETP of seven are functioning in a reasonable manner. All the other STPs and CETPs are functioning at 30% of optimal levels and untreated sewage is being directly discharged into the river. “A very grim picture emerges today. Untreated sewage and untreated industrial effluent in a huge quantity is being discharged straight into the Sabarmati river and this is why a stretch of almost 200km of this river is now dead,” the court noted. The HC ordered the companies running CETPs to be joined as party respondents in the litigation and asked the advocate general to assist the court on this issue on December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gpcb-is-just-for-names-sake-says-hc/articleshow/88131569.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Second service lane at Lucknow airport to decongest traffic||LUCKNOW: A second service lane has been created at the entry/exit points of Lucknow airport to decongest traffic during pick and drop of passengers. The lane would be mainly for passengers arriving in a taxi, while the first lane would be for private cars coming for pick up or drop. “Since we don’t charge fee from private vehicles for upto 10 minutes for pick and drop, their simultaneous movement along with taxis creates traffic jams outside the terminal. But now taxis will have a dedicated separate lane,” said the airport spokesperson. Taxi drivers have to pay Rs 90 to pick and drop a passenger at airport. The charges are applicable upto 30 minutes, after which Rs 150 is charged for 120 minutes with Rs 40 additional charges for every two hours. For 24 hours, taxi drivers have to pay Rs 590. Further, the airport operator has introduced waiting area for taxi drivers outside Terminal 2. Washroom facility is also available in the space. “Earlier taxi drivers had to wait for passengers in their vehicles, but now we have developed a waiting area for them. The charges for public toilet has been waived for everyone,” said the spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2nd-service-lane-at-airport-to-decongest-traffic/articleshow/88132252.cms||---

On the 29th anniversary of the incident on Monday, VHP issued a statement saying, “Once idols of Ram Lalla are placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ram temple, then the issue of ‘Srikrishna janambhoomi’ will be taken up.” Working president of VHP Alok Kumar said, “We will consider the Mathura issue in 2024. Today is a big day for the whole country and we will continue to celebrate this as ‘Shaurya Diwas’ (day of bravery) always.” Meanwhile, Ayodhya remained quiet throughout the day, marked as both ‘Shaurya Diwas’ and Black Day. There was no gathering or event but security was heightened, with police searching vehicles and verifying identity of visitors. A special Quran recitation was organised in mosques after the morning prayers for those killed in connection with the dispute over the years. On security arrangements, Ayodhya SSP Shailesh Pandey said, “Security forces in Ayodhya are on high alert in view of the anniversary of the demolition of Babri Masjid. The administration has established a special control room in the district magistrate’s office to keep a vigil on any development.

Chadha said the revised date of her appearance before the committee will be decided later. The committee had last month issued a notice summoning Ranaut to depose before the panel on December 6 after complaints cited an alleged offensive and derogatory Instagram story posted by her. The actor has cited personal and professional reasons for her unavailability on Monday. Chadha said that the actress has sought a fresh date for her appearance before the committee to aid and assist it in its ongoing proceedings. “The committee has taken cognisance of this request of Kangana Ranaut. In due course, we will let her know the new date of her appearance,” Chadha said. Last month while issuing the notice to the actor, the committee in a statement said that complaints claimed that Ranaut, in her Instagram story, labelled the Sikh community as ‘Khalistani terrorists’. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kangana-seeks-time-to-appear-before-house-panel/articleshow/88132260.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi court frames charges of murder, rioting against Sajjan Kumar in 1984 riots case||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has framed charges of murder and rioting against former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar in a double-murder case that took place during the anti-Sikh riots. The court said there was sufficient material on record to form a prima facie opinion that the accused was not only a participant, but also led a riotous mob. A father and son duo was allegedly burnt alive by a thousand-strong mob on November 1, 1984, in Raj Nagar in west Delhi. The prosecution claimed that upon Kumar’s instigation and abetment, the mob burnt alive the two men and also damaged, destroyed, looted and burnt their house and inflicted severe injuries on their family members and relatives. Special Judge Manoj Kumar Nagpal said a case was made out against Kumar for framing of charges under IPC sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (murder), 308 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 395 (dacoity), 397 (robbery with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), 427 (mischief), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house) and 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt). In its order given on December 4, the court said oral and documentary evidence collected by the investigating officers was sufficient to form the opinion that a mob armed with deadly weapons resorted to large-scale looting, arson and destruction of property of Sikhs to avenge the killing of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. However, Kumar was discharged for destruction of evidence and attempt to murder as the statements of the complainant and other victims ruled out that the common object of unlawful assembly was to kill the female victims. “…rather, it appears to this court that there was no such intention on part of the mob to kill them as some of them dragged away the female victims to a nearby house for shelter,” the court stated. Police had filed a final report before a magistrate court and the case was directed to be sent as untraced in 1994 after it was held that the evidence collected by the IO was not sufficient to initiate prosecution against any particular person. Later, an SIT was formed in 2015 and it was decided that this case was required to be further investigated. Kumar was arrested on April 6, 2021 while serving life imprisonment in Tihar Jail in another riots case. His counsel claimed that the investigation conducted by the SIT was nothing but an abuse of the process of law for some vested political interests and this probe actually amounted to re-investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-frames-charges-of-murder-rioting-against-sajjan-in-1984-riots-case/articleshow/88132270.cms||Usha Das
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Sewage lines of 303 units snapped||AHMEDABAD: Till Monday, a record 303 factories in industrial estates surrounding Ahmedabad have had their sewage connections severed for illegally pumping untreated effluents into the domestic sewage network of the city. After being rebuked by the high court, the AMC and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had coordinated a drive against the errant factories. Officials said that more than 500 units have been pumping their untreated waste into the sewage system which ultimately is let into the Sabarmati near Vasna-Narol Bridge. Since December 2, about 40 units’ drainage lines have been disconnected. Most of these units are located in areas such as Shahpur, Amraiwadi, Bhaipura, Thakkarnagar, Naroda, Sardarnagar, Indrapuri, Behrampura, and Danilimda. Almost a month ago, the AMC admitted to the high court that “untreated or partly treated” industrial waste from “improperly working” effluent treatment plants (ETPs) was being “discharged into the Sabarmati directly”. The present action is the biggest since the mid-1990s. It comes at a time when one of the members of the HC-appointed task force, environmentalist Rohit Prajapati, told the court that the Sabarmati for a 120km downstream stretch to the Arabian Sea is a “dead river”. Ideally, industrial units have to drain their waste into an effluent channel that takes it to a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) after which the treated effluent is pumped into the AMC’s domestic sewage treatment plant (STP). But these industries had bypassed this process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sewage-lines-of-303-units-snapped/articleshow/88131567.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Rs 1,600 crore later, Dravyavati riverfront is squatters’ hub||JAIPUR: Makeshift houses, cattle tethered on the walkway and filth dumped inside the catchment area was not a sight expected on Dravyavati riverfront after the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) spent approximately Rs 1600 crore on its rejuvenation. As project remains unattended even after three years of its completion, the encroachments are increasing at an alarming speed inside and on the outer boundary of the river bank. Vaishali Nagar resident Ankit Shiyag said, “On the walkway of the riverbank near Hassanpura, the people have started encroaching the riverbank. One of the aims to build the concrete nullah was to protect it from encroachment. As people are still grabbing the land, not only public money is wasted, the purpose of the project is also defeated.” Residents also alleged that the civic body has turned a blind eye towards these encroachments and no action has been taken despite several complaints. Ram Devenda, another resident said, “There was a provision not to construct any house within 10 meters from the river boundary. Defying all norms, many people have constructed houses near Nirman Nagar. We have registered a complaint, but no action was taken due to alleged political pressure.” With JDA and Tata Projects Limited locking horns over maintenance charge issue, the condition of Dravyavati riverfront is expected to deteriorate further in future. While JDA is not willing to take the possession of the project, the firm has expressed helplessness to continue the maintenance for long as the civic body is not releasing outstanding amount for maintenance. An official said, “To resolve the problem, a meeting was held two months ago where it was decided that remaining amount of the firm will be released. But, nothing has been done so far.” As per the contract, the JDA is now planning to release the operation and maintenance costs once the project is completed and handed over to the user. However, the firm is stressing to take possession of the completed portion of the project. Sources said, “Though JDA is asking to complete the project before releasing payment, work on the 550-metre stretch near Hassanpura cannot be initiated due to court stay. If land is not provided for another three months, the company will have to incur maintenance costs.” All major works including development of sewerage treatment plants (STP), parks, jogging and cycle track are complete. Parks developed under the project are also under-utilised as the firm closes them after sunset to save electricity bills. Bhanwar Singh, resident of Mansarovar said, “The cycle track and open-air amphitheatre should have been opened for the public as they could be an added attraction. The project was completed after spending public money and people should get the benefit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-1600cr-later-dravyavati-riverfront-is-squatters-hub/articleshow/88131513.cms||---

They marched from ITO crossing to AAP office raising anti-Kejriwal slogans, demanding immediate reduction in VAT on diesel. “Kejriwal never got tired of speaking against the central government regarding petrol and diesel prices to control inflation, but has betrayed the people of Delhi by reducing only Rs 8 VAT on petrol. The Centre has reduced excise on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10, respectively, and BJP-led states have further reduced VAT on petrol and diesel,” Gupta said. Bidhuri said the protests against AAP government will be further intensified if the VAT on diesel is not cut immediately. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-holds-protest-for-vat-cut-on-diesel/articleshow/88132300.cms||---

A senior SDMC official said a request had been made for cancelling the registration of these commercial vehicles as some of them were repeat offenders. “For the convenience of vehicle owners and to save their time, we have asked the toll operators to download an app and get RFID tags issued within 10 minutes after taking minimum charges. The vehicle owners can later recharge these tags with any amount they are comfortable with. An attempt is also being made to simplify the payment method by giving more options, such as attaching a payment gateway considering most taxi operators use such systems frequently for taking fare from commuters,” added the official. SDMC claimed that adherence was 90% and its teams were taking rounds regularly at all toll plazas to keep things in order. “We are not taking things lightly and making all efforts to ensure that cash transactions are controlled and use of RFID is implemented based on the court’s direction,” said the official. The civic body is the nodal agency for implementation of the RFID system and installed the technology at all 124 toll plazas. “The system is operating successfully on a majority of tolls, except for those where the RFID system can’t be installed or the farmers’ protest is going on,” the official said. “Vehicles without the tag or having insufficient recharge are being denied entry into the city. Enforcement teams have been deployed at toll plazas for regular inspection. The toll operators have been asked to deny entry to defaulting vehicles,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rfid-tags-sdmc-seeks-action-against-repeat-offenders/articleshow/88132274.cms||Vibha Sharma

As many as 70,559 seats were filled through direct admission, the process of which got completed on Monday. “For direct admission, a candidate does not mandatorily need scores of the Uttar Pradesh Combined Entrance Test (UPCET) and the admissions can be done on the basis of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) scores also. A candidate should have either UPCET or JEE mains for direct admissions,” said a university official. He said direct admission got a good response as compared to university counselling due to the local factor attached to it. For example, a student from Lucknow can get admission at a private college in Lucknow through direct admission, which is otherwise not possible through AKTU counselling as he may or may not get a college in his or her hometown. At times students prefer to study at a private college in their hometown, he added. Earlier of the 1.34 lakhs seats, only 19,057 seats of the university were filled through the counselling while 70,559 seats have been filled through direct admission. Even after seats filling through university counselling and direct admissions, 44,384 seats are still vacant. “Last year, around 70,000 seats had remained vacant,” said AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-poor-show-at-counselling-aktu-manages-to-fill-66-seats-via-direct-admission/articleshow/88132277.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Cybercheats posed as officials of pvt firms to dupe banks, held||New Delhi: A cyber module whose members allegedly posed as high-ranking officials of private firms to pocket large sums has been busted. The module created fake email IDs in these officials’ names and used them to communicate with the firms’ banks to get money transferred, said the southeast Delhi police. The gang even forged company letterheads and authorisation letters and used rented bank accounts to receive money fraudulently. Recently, they got Rs 80 lakh from a firm’s account, police said. The two arrested men have been identified as Mehndi Hasan aliad Harpal Singh, and Mohammed Arbaj Khan. According to DCP (southeast) Esha Pandey, the kingpin is an African who is already in a jail in Uttar Pradesh. The cyber unit of the district had received a tipoff that two absconding cyber criminals of an interstate gang had been spotted in the area. A team comprising SHO Sandeep Panwar and others checked CCTV camera footage in the adjoining areas of Sarita Vihar and Badarpur. Around that time, the accused moved to Jaipur, but police got to know, and arrested them from Jaipur’s Fareedpur. “The gang usually targeted big companies and created similar email IDs or spoofed them to impersonate key managerial people. Thereafter, they sent mails and forged letters to banks to transfer the amount from the targeted company’s account into several fake current accounts,” said an officer, adding that the money was then withdrawn through ATMs. One of the gang members, Ruksar Mansoouri, allegedly got many currents accounts opened in different banks in the name of several people after paying them a commission for receiving and withdrawing the money. The accused told police they had come to Jaipur earlier to give the kingpin his share of Rs 80 lakh. However, a dispute arose over it and they got the African and Mansoouri arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cybercheats-posed-as-officials-of-pvt-firms-to-dupe-banks-held/articleshow/88132284.cms||---

Taking note of the untreated water being discharged in the river, the court said that this polluted water of is being used for irrigation downstream. It further said, “If this water contains high quantities of poisonous elements like lead, mercury, etc. and if this water is treated for the purpose of irrigation, what quality of crops and vegetables can we expect. Its virtually poison that the people are consuming.” The court asked the state government and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to keep river cleaning as the first priority in the larger interest of the people “rather than going for a big project in the form of the second phase of the Sabarmati Riverfront”. The court elaborated on this issue and said, “If the government wants to go for this project, then this court will never come in its way as it is a policy matter. However, if crores of rupees are to be spent on this new project, then some amount should be earmarked for the repair or overhauling of STPs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prioritize-river-cleaning-over-riverfront-phase-ii/articleshow/88131518.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi civic bodies crack down on liquor shops opened, operating ‘illegally’||NEW DELHI: Taking action against liquor shops opened and operating illegally after the implementation of Delhi government’s new excise policy, the three municipal corporations are carrying out a ground survey and serving notices to those violating the building byelaws. Last week, North Delhi Municipal Corporation sealed a shop and its south counterpart issued notices to three shops for violating the provisions for commercial and residential norms under the Master Plan of Delhi-2021. “We are only acting on the complaints filed by local residents and councillors against entities violating the building norms,” explained an SDMC official. The deliberative wing of the three corporations clarified that liquor shops weren’t allowed in areas designated for a mixed commercial and residential land use. “Even shops in commercial areas have to be verified, building plan approved, completion certificate obtained, conversion and parking fees paid and illegal construction avoided,” said East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal. In south Delhi, notices have been served to properties in Amar Colony, Sewa Nagar and Dayanand Colony for illegal amalgamation without obtaining completion certificates. “Annoyed residents constantly approached me for help against the three recently opened shops,” said Abhishek Dutta, Andrews Ganj councillor. “I, therefore, approached the south corporation for verification of building details.” SDMC standing committee chairman Colonel B K Oberoi (retd) said that para 15.6.2 of MPD-21 categorically prohibits opening of certain types of shops in mixed land use areas. “These include liquor shops, storages and godowns, and those involved with printing and dyeing,” said Oberoi. “In other places also, we are inspecting for unauthorised structural changes. If no permission was taken for these, we can seal the complex.” The north corporation sealed a liquor shop in the DDA complex at Naraina for such violations, while another shop in Kamla Nagar will be served notice soon, said Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairman of the civic body. The EDMC mayor has given civic officials time till Thursday to submit a report on the action taken. “Under the new excise policy, there is the opportunity of opening 200 new liquor shops in our areas, but the officials should ensure that these operate only in commercial areas,” Agarwal told a recent meeting. “If the shops are running on leased premises, the property tax payment records should be scrutinised. The entire report has to be submitted to the corporation in a week's time.” On Monday, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta asked the three mayors to order an immediate survey to prevent even a single liquor retailer from operating in violation of municipal byelaws or MPD guidelines. “Residents’ welfare associations have informed me that such liquor shops and bars are opening up in non-conforming areas, residential areas and in the vicinity of schools and places of worship. As you are aware, not even meat or tobacco shops can be opened within 200 metres of a school or place of worship. But complaints are coming, among others, from Sita Ram Bazar in old Delhi, Karol Bagh, Uttam Nagar, Mustafabad, Krishna Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and Rajouri Garden etc,” Gupta claimed. There was no comment offered by Delhi government when asked about the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-bodies-crack-down-on-liquor-shops-opened-operating-illegally/articleshow/88132307.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Lucknow||UP: Focus on Purvanchal, PM Narendra Modi to open AIIMS, fertilizer unit in Gorakhpur today||LUCKNOW: After inaugurating and laying the foundation stones for various flagship projects, including the 341km Purvanchal Expressway and Noida international airport, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be back in UP on Tuesday, this time in CM Yogi Adityanath’s home turf Gorakhpur, for the inauguration of AIIMS and a fertilizer plant. This would be PM Modi’s first visit to Gorakhpur ahead of 2022 Assembly election in UP. The foundation stone for both the projects were laid by the PM on July 22, 2016. The PM’s visit to Gorakhpur, the political nerve centre of east Uttar Pradesh, gains importance as the BJP has stepped up the electoral spade work to take on the opposition in Purvanchal region comprising around 160 assembly seats. While AIIMS will improve medical infrastructure in east UP, the fertilizer factory is likely to help the BJP to reach out to the farming community, especially after the repeal of the three farm laws which were at the center of a raging farmers’ agitation for the last one year. The revived fertilizer unit, to be operated by Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Ltd (HURL), will have an installed capacity to produce 3850 metric tonnes of ‘neem coated’ urea per day and 12.7 lakh metric tonnes of fertilizer per annum. This will augment the domestic production of urea to meet the existing demand of 350 lakh tonnes. Currently, the government is forced to import about 100 lakh tonnes of urea. After remaining shut for over 30 years, the Gorakhpur fertilizer plant has been revived and built at a cost of around Rs 8600 crore. The plant, operated by the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCIL), was set up in 1969 for urea production with naphtha as feedstock. The unit was closed in 1990 following losses stemming from technical and financial non-viability of operations, particularly the high cost of naphtha. An accident of an employee in the plant is also said to have contributed to the closure of the unit. The demand for revival of the plant was being raised for nearly two decades. According to political analysts, PM Modi could use the occasion to corner the opposition for neglecting the “popular demand”. The PM had raised the issue of the Gorakhpur fertilizer factory ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. After becoming the MP from Gorakhpur in 1998, Yogi Adityanath also consistently raised the demand in the parliament for the factory’s revival. Officials said the plant would not only supply urea to farmers in east UP but also in neighboring states. “It will help in generating direct and indirect employment for both skilled and unskilled manpower of the region. The plant will help in facilitating development of small and medium scale industries as well. It will also play a part in ensuring price stability in the domestic fertilizer market,” the PMO said in a statement. The central government has galvanized the revival of five fertilizer plants in Gorakhpur, Barauni (Bihar), Sindri (Jharkhand), Ramagundam (Telangana) and Talcher (Odisha), which have the potential to augment the country’s overall urea production by more than 60 lakh tonnes per annum. Likewise, the fully functional complex of AIIMS, Gorakhpur, has come up at the cost of over Rs 1,000 crore. It would not only serve the districts of east UP but also neighboring Bihar and even Nepal. The facility will boost healthcare infrastructure in Purvanchal which has been hit hard by vector-borne diseases, including Japanese Encephalitis. The government’s endeavour provisioning quality tertiary healthcare was projected by former PM late Atal Bihari Vajpayee during his Independence Day speech on August 15, 2003, when he announced the ‘Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana’ (PMSSY) to establish six new hospitals with modern facilities on the lines of AIIMS, New Delhi. These were set up in Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Jodhpur, Patna, Raipur and Rishikesh. Officials said PM Modi took Vajpayee’s vision forward by announcing 15 AIIMS in different parts of the country in the last seven years. These facilities, which are in various stages of completion, are coming up in Gorakhpur (UP), Nagpur (Maharashtra), Kalyani (West Bengal), Mangalagiri (Andhra Pradesh), Bibinagar (Telangana), Bhatinda (Punjab), Deoghar (Jharkhand), Guwahati (Assam), Bilaspur (Himachal Pradesh), Vijaypur (Jammu), Awantipora (Kashmir), Rajkot (Gujarat), Madurai (Tamil Nadu), Darbhanga (Bihar) and Manethi (Haryana). The projects get reflected in higher budgetary allocation in the health sector. The PMSSY allocation also went up from Rs 891 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 7517 crore in 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/focus-on-purvanchal-pm-to-openaiims-fertilizer-unit-in-gkp-today/articleshow/88132295.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Kochi||Kerala: Not infant deaths, it’s murder in Attapadi, says VD Satheesan||PALAKKAD: What is happening in Attapadi is not tribal infant deaths but their murder, said leader of opposition VD Satheesan on Monday. A UDF delegation led by Satheesan visited tribal hamlets and hospitals in Attapadi on Monday when the tribeswomen shared their woes with the leaders at the government inaction and lack of medical and other facilities for those living in faraway tribal hamlets. “It is condemnable that health minister Veena George, during her visit, did not announce any new schemes for resolving the health problems, including the deaths of infants, in Attapadi. The present tragedy is due to the destruction by the LDF government of an old system that was in force,” alleged Satheesan. “Gone are the days when the then Oommen Chandy government (2015) would hold a mini-cabinet meeting in Attappadi and launch a number of schemes, after taking stock of the situation. Today what we came to know is that most of the schemes have been discontinued by this government,” he added. He alleged that the recent visit by the health minister on Sunday has not improved the situation in Attappadi and instead the only change was a reduction in medical facilities available there. “There is no coordination of the works of various departments engaged in tribal welfare in Attapadi. The nodal officer was deliberately kept away during the health minister’s visit here. This is suspicious,” Satheesan said. “Earlier, many schemes were implemented and many benefits were extended to the target groups –— pregnant women, lactating mothers, adolescent girls and tribal infants. The scheme of providing a Rs 2,000-monthly assistance to all the pregnant women here from their third month of pregnancy to be continued for the next 15 months, which included money for post-natal care, has all been discontinued,” he said. Satheesan was accompanied by UDF convener MM Hassan, Mannarkkad MLA N Shamsudheen, CMP leader CP John, among others. Tribal outfits on dharna Meanwhile, tribal organizations in Attapadi sat on a dharna on Monday in front of Kottathara tribal specialty hospital demanding that the government should address their problems and resolve them. Inaugurating the dharna, TR Chandran, convener of Attapadi action council, demanded an inquiry into the funds spent for tribespeople in the last 10 years in Attapadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/not-infant-deaths-its-murder-in-attapadi-says-satheesan/articleshow/88131555.cms||---

Morbi A Division police booked clerk Prakash Nakum for cheating, forgery and various other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on a complaint filed by Dharmesh More, deputy manager of the bank’s Morbi branch. According to the complaint, between 2019 to 2021 Nakum prematurely withdrew fixed deposits (FDs) of the account holders without their knowledge. More alleged that Nakum had prematurely withdrawn 59 FDs worth Rs 1.92 crore by forging signatures of the account holders and making false entries in the bank software. Nakum had also transferred the money from the bank to his different account through net banking. The fraud came to light in July this year when one of the FD holders approached the bank to claim his fixed deposit only to find that the amount had already been withdrawn. The bank instituted an inquiry that led them to Nakum. On Sunday night, the bank official formally lodged a cheating, forgery complaint against Nakum, who is absconding, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bank-clerk-forges-signature-siphons-off-rs-1-92-cr-in-morbi/articleshow/88131532.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Bids invited for 10 flyovers between Jaipur and Kishangarh to ease traffic||JAIPUR: After Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari’s recent announcement, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited tenders to construct 10 flyovers between Jaipur and Kishangarh. To unclog the vehicular movement, the authority will spend approximately Rs 220 crore to construct these flyovers on the route. An official said, the Centre had approved a budget of Rs 619.48 crore for the construction of underpass, flyovers and bridge on the entire 6-lanes of Gurgaon-Beawar national highway stretch. The stretch between Jaipur-Kishangarh will be also a part of this project. “The tenders were invited and work orders will be issued soon after evaluation. The work on entire stretch is expected to be constructed once paper work is finished,” said an official. While six flyovers will be constructed for rectification of the black spots, four will be constructed to provide smooth passage. The authority has decided to construct flyovers on the route including Bhankrota, Heerapura, Narsinghpura, Mahlan, Mokhanpura and Padasoli as these points are considered black spots. Apart from this, the NHAI will construct flyovers at Bandarsindhri, Dhami Balaji, Gadota and Savarda to decongest the traffic on the stretch. Many residents living in the catchment areas of Ajmer Road will breathe a sigh of relief as demand to construct flyovers on many points was long pending. As city has expanded till Mahlan, the project is expected to solve the perennial traffic problem at various junctions on the route. The absence of a flyover on these points leaves the traffic in knots. The project is long pending and it will resolve traffic issues once constructed. “In traffic control board (TCB) meetings, the department has strongly urged the JDA to construct a flyover at Mahapura and Bhankrota crossroads several times,” said an official. In the past, frequent accidents and snarls near Bhankrota, Mahapura, Heerapura had raised concerns of the traffic department. The JDA periphery ends at C-zone bypass. “The authority’s move to construct a flyover over these stretches will benefit the residents of state capital as it passes through urban areas,” said a senior engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bids-invited-for-10-flyovers-between-jaipur-kishangarh-to-ease-traffic/articleshow/88131522.cms||---

Police on Monday said the wooden bat with which both were clobbered to death have been recovered. Police suspect that the killer was known to both of them. According to police, the incident came to light on Sunday evening when people living in the neighbourhood complained of rotten smell coming out from a house. “When our team rushed to the spot, the house was locked from outside. After opening it, we found two decomposed bodies with severe injuries on the head and other parts. The body of Amarti Devi (75) was lying in the kitchen while the body of her physically challenged daughter Rukiya Devi (38) was found in another room,” said an officer of Bagari Nagar police station. In the primary investigation, police said a person known to the mother-daughter duo could be associated with the twin murder. “It was learnt that Amarti Devi had adopted a boy of her family as her son, who was the main reason behind some family feud. We have taken statements of some of the relatives and will soon solve the mystery,” the officer added. People in the neighbourhood said for the past four days they had not seen both the woman and her daughter and thought they had gone outside town. “Murder must had taken place almost five days ago and people were not aware of it. We have asked the family members for post-mortem of the deceased,” the officer added.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Traffic Police tweak timings at some signals for smooth traffic flow||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Traffic Police has tweaked signal timings at some important crossings for peak office hours and at night due to a rise in the number of vehicles. Opening of educational institutes, the wedding season and a few constructions that are going on near some of the important crossings have prompted the traffic police to change the signal timings. Recently, cops have changed the signal timing at Ballygunge Phanri to ease the movement of traffic. Similar changes have been made at the Chingrighata crossing on EM Bypass, AJC Bose Road-JL Nehru Road crossing and Cathedral Road-AJC Bose Road crossing post 10pm. “We are not changing the overall traffic cycle as it may affect the movement of vehicles across the city. Rather, we are experimenting with one or two flank of a particular stretch, where we are either reducing or increasing the signal timing. For example, we have done an experiment with the Ballygunge Phanri crossing recently,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. Traffic cops have been studying the traffic cycles of the city since October this year to facilitate the movement of vehicles during non-peak hours. “Following a study, we have changed the signal timing at Ballygunge Phanri. Free left turn from Ballygunge Circular road has been added when Hazra Road and Bondel Road are open. In the morning peak hours, extra 10 seconds are provided to the signals at Ballygunge Circular Road and Hazra Road. We will allow right turn on Bondel Road when the signal at Ballygunge Circular Road is open,” said an officer. Cops have made similar changes at several other important crossings like Brabourne Road-Canning Street, DPS Road-Charu Avenue crossing and Cathedral Road-AJC Bose Road crossing post midnight. During the peak hours the timings are tweaked for three or five seconds. Since August this year, cops have switched from the automated system to the manual one that gives them the flexibility to control signal timings. The automated signal timings, which had been introduced to reduce the wait period at signals when traffic volumes dipped to near zero during the lockdown, was gradually calibrated between June and December as traffic returned to the road. Cops brought back the signal timing that existed in February 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-tweak-timings-at-some-signals-for-smooth-traffic-flow/articleshow/88131541.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Dehradun||Cabinet OKs repeal of Devasthanam Board||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand cabinet, which met on Monday, has given a nod to the tourism department's proposal to repeal the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. The stage is now set for the government to initiate proceedings to withdraw the Act in the state assembly. Following large-scale protests by priests of the revered Char Dham shrines, the state government had formed a high-powered committee and a cabinet committee to look into the board issue. In another major decision, the cabinet approved free-of-cost medicines in OPDs of all government hospitals. To prescribe medicines from outside the hospital, the doctor would have to explicitly mention the reasons behind the same. The Uttarakhand cabinet on Monday also announced that it will regularise the nazul land occupied by people. This was after the Supreme Court recently stayed the Uttarakhand high court's decision of June 19, 2018, in which it had struck down the nazul policy of Uttarakhand and directed the government to take possession of the land, which was earlier declared freehold. According to the cabinet decision, the cut-off date for the regularisation of nazul land is November 8, 2011. Those who have deposited the entire fee before the high court order would be given the land free of cost. Those who have paid 25% of the circle rate would be given ownership of the land at the present circle rate. An upper ceiling of 300 metre has been set by the cabinet for the freehold of nazul land. An ordinance for nazul land regularisation would be brought into the state assembly. The cabinet also decided to provide relaxation to the MSME sector. It gave a nod to district-level approval for units worth Rs 10 crore to Rs 50 crore. Those setting up units over Rs 50 crore would be required to take permission at the state level. For setting up an electronic park, the cabinet gave a nod to the transfer of 133.82-acre land from the industry department to SIDCUL. Through this move, it aims to draw a Rs 25,000-crore investment in the state. The cabinet has also directed authorities to refund the booking of all tourists who had booked rooms in the Corbett Tiger Reserve but did not turn up because of Covid-19. Similarly, it authorised the departments to come up with a mechanism to refund the booking amount of tourists, who were unable to visit the state because of emergency reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cabinet-oks-repeal-of-devasthanam-board/articleshow/88130776.cms||Kautilya Singh

Brigadier Ravi Kapoor, Group Commander, NCC Group Headquarters Lucknow and Colonel Sumeet Puri, Commanding Officer of 63 UP NCC Battalion were also present on the occasion. The three women shared their tales of hardships after demise of their husbands in the Bangladesh liberation war. Chandrana Devi had a seven-year-old son when her husband Naik Raja Singh, a Vir Chakra recipient (posthumously) from 21 Rajput Regiment made the supreme sacrifice while clearing enemy post at Fakira haat bridge of eastern sector on November 26, 1971. Chandrana, hailing from Sarswan Paharpur village in Lucknow, was illiterate but refused to marry again and raised her son Lal Singh on the pension. In 2013, Lal Singh succumbed after prolonged illness following which she has been taking care of her three grandchildren. Her granddaughter Indu Singh said, “Our grandmother is a very strong woman. She is illiterate but ensured her son got educated. In initial years, she used to get Rs 79 as monthly pension in which she arranged everything.” Chandrana lost her hearing ability and is often ill but continues to guide her grandchildren. “She is an inspiration for us,” said Indu, a clerk in district soldier welfare board. Manju Mishra was mother of five months old kid when her husband Pasupati Narayan Mishra of Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers was killed in Poonch sector by Pakistani troops. She had passed high school and got Rs 172 per month as pension for years. Determined to give a better life to her son, Manju completed her graduation and post-graduation and joined Army Public School, Nehru road, as primary teacher. Her son Ajay Mishra joined Indian Air Force and is a Wing Commander. “The pension was not enough but my strong will power sustained me,” said Manju, who retired as teacher in 2012. Lila Devi, whose husband Sowar Jit Singh was killed in Morapara Hills of eastern sector in 1971 war, was only 15 when she was married. She married again after more than a decade and had three children. “I was a teenager when I was married to Jit. He was in 69 armoured regiment. After his death, life as widow was extremely difficult so I married again,” said Lila Devi.

As many as 70,559 seats were filled through direct admission, the process of which got completed on Monday. “For direct admission, a candidate does not mandatorily need scores of the Uttar Pradesh Combined Entrance Test (UPCET) and the admissions can be done on the basis of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) scores also. A candidate should have either UPCET or JEE mains for direct admissions,” said a university official. He said direct admission got a good response as compared to university counselling due to the local factor attached to it. For example, a student from Lucknow can get admission at a private college in Lucknow through direct admission, which is otherwise not possible through AKTU counselling as he may or may not get a college in his or her hometown. At times students prefer to study at a private college in their hometown, he added. Earlier of the 1.34 lakhs seats, only 19,057 seats of the university were filled through the counselling while 70,559 seats have been filled through direct admission. Even after seats filling through university counselling and direct admissions, 44,384 seats are still vacant. “Last year, around 70,000 seats had remained vacant,” said AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-poor-show-at-counselling-aktu-manages-to-fill-66-seats-via-direct-admission/articleshow/88132315.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Also, fresh bookings too have seen a dip. Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand hotels association, said, “Hotels in Uttarakhand are reporting cancellation of up to 20% of the bookings that had already been made for Christmas and New Year.

Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA), which represents professors and lecturers of the six government medical colleges, said in a press statement on Monday that they recently organized rallies in Vadodara, Rajkot, Surat, Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar to put across their demands to the government. Over the past few months, professors have been facing salary cuts in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 96,000 per month. The government gave dearness allowance for about five months but decided to withdraw it, and recovered the money paid from the salaries of professors. “Some demands are very old but still there is no response from the government. The new CM and ministers are not aware of our issues, it seems, and hence we had to take out rallies in different cities. Government should stop appointment of doctors and health workers on a contractual basis and give them permanent employment or hire on ad hoc basis. These and other demands should be immediately met by the government,” said a GMTA member. Also, promotions of many faculty members at GMERS colleges have been pending for a long time, he added. Members of GMTA will go on an indefinite strike beginning December 13 if their demands are not met and that they will be joined by in-service doctors of GMERS colleges, according to GMTA press statement. Earlier this year, GMTA members called off their strike when they were assured by the state government that their demands would be addressed. The demands included higher non-practising allowance in line with the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/medical-teachers-strike-from-dec-13/articleshow/88131562.cms||---

He said the party is prepared to fight a situation where everyone is pitted against BJP. Tanavade admitted that BJP was in talks with MGP for an alliance, but it was handled by the central leadership. “I do not want to speak on the issue,” he said. “Our planning is ready, and based on that, I will tell you that in 2022, BJP will form the government. During the ZP election, all parties came together to fight BJP, but BJP won 33 of 50 seats,” he said. He also said out of 12 municipalities, BJP was able to win 10. From day one, MGP functionaries have maintained that they will not forge a pre-poll alliance with BJP as it has been backstabbed by BJP on four different occasions. When asked about Congress MLA and former chief minister Ravi Naik joining BJP, Tanavade said there is a discussion on the issue everywhere, but Naik has to resign and approach them to join the party. “Till now, I have not received any proposal from Naik to join BJP,” he said. Speaking on the alleged sex scandal involving a BJP minister, Tanavade said that his deadline to Congress president Girish Chodankar was over, but if he has the name, he should announce it as “our leaders are in Goa”. “Once Chodankar declares the name, we will immediately act against the minister,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/makes-no-difference-to-us-bjp-on-mgp-tmc-tie-up/articleshow/88132320.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rapid PCR test, online booking for international flyers start in Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: The first day the Rapid PCR test facility was introduced for flyers arriving in the city from other countries, reducing the waiting time for results from six hours to less than an hour, Kolkata airport also opened online registration for the test to cut down on queues.  The online booking of Covid test has been extended to all passengers arriving by international flights, including those from the list of “at-risk” countries, for whom undergoing a Covid test on arrival is mandatory. At present, passengers arriving from Singapore in daily flights as well as from the UK in a weekly flight have to undergo a Covid test on arrival and wait for the negative report before they can proceed to their destinations. Passengers from other countries require the mandatory RT-PCR negative report at the time of boarding but a further 2%, selected randomly by state health department officials, have to undergo a Covid test on arrival. “We had received a good response. A majority of passengers arriving by the Singapore flight, like many others arriving by other international flights, opted for the Rapid PCR test. Both the options — regular RT-PCR and Rapid PCR — are available. If a passenger is unwilling to wait six hours for the RT-PCR report, the person can pay a higher price and avail of Rapid PCR. Passengers can also pre-book the slot by logging into the website https://tinyurl.com/PATREGKOL,” said a senior airport official. Till Sunday, passengers had to wait for at least six hours to get the RT-PCR test report. Though Rapid PCR test was available at the airport, it was offered only to those passengers flying to the UAE, where a Covid test is required within four hours before departure in addition to another test carried out at least 72 hours before taking a flight. The long wait for the traditional Covid test result had left many flyers fuming and also brought down the load of the Singapore Airlines flight. Many cancelled their trips to Kolkata and other parts of India as they found a a six-hour wait following a journey annoying. A flyer, Lal J Punjabi, wrote on Twitter last week: “All airports in India are allowing Rapid PCR tests for international at-risk county arrivals except Kolkata airport. Could you please get that enabled if possible? Waiting for 6 hours at the airport for the results is an inherent risk.” While the cost of RT-PCR test at the airport is Rs 700, the price for Rapid PCR test is Rs 3,600. Rapid PCR test was introduced at the airport in August this year when it was priced at Rs 4,000. With a few takers for the expensive facility, the airport authorities had suspended it. Now, it has been re-introduced at a reduced price of Rs 3,600 but still remains more expensive than that in Kochi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi. The test is costlier in Mumbai and Hyderabad airports. Meanwhile, with the domestic footfall at the airport going back to the pre-Covid level, several passengers complained that despite carrying double dose vaccination certificate and RT-PCR report, their documents were not checked at the airport. “I had a tough time getting the RT-PCR done for the five-year-old child and carried the photocopies of vaccination certificates. But none was checked it at the airport,” said a passenger, who came to Kolkata from Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rapid-pcr-test-online-booking-for-intl-flyers-start-in-kol-airport/articleshow/88131558.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Sources privy to the planning of the event told TOI that all ‘shakti kendras’ (earlier known as BJP’s organizational sectors) of the party would be activated. Livestreaming of the PM’s KV Dham inauguration and offering of prayers would be done on big LED screens at all the 28,0000 ‘shakti kendras’ in the state. A BJP insider said all ‘shakti kendras’ had been asked to ensure crowd for livestreaming of the ceremony and added that UP ministers, MPs and MLAs would be asked to remain present at the ‘shakti kendra’ of their respective constituencies. BJP leaders and workers have also been asked to perform ‘jalabhishek’ at a prominent Shiv temple in the assembly constituency concerned. Livestreaming will also be done at prominent temples in other states of the country, including Somnath Temple in Gujarat. The decision was taken after a meeting with temple priests and saints in this regard, sources said. The final draft of planning would be chalked out soon. Mega celebrations for the opening of KV Dham will commence from December 12 and continue till December 14. Celebrations similar to Diwali and Dev Deepawali are being planned by the Varanasi district administration with the cooperation of the residents of Varanasi. All government, commercial and institutional buildings will be cleaned and decorated beautifully with lights. Best three decorated buildings in Varanasi will receive cash rewards. Opening of KV Dham will also boost local economy. Direct access to Kashi Vishwanath Dham temple from the Ganga side has become possible with the completion of KV Dham project, which began in March 2019. The PM is expected to reach Kashi Vishwanath Dham on a boat, taking the Ganga route to inaugurate the over Rs 700-crore project, touted to be his dream plan. He is likely to enter the project area from Jalasen Ghat, the entry point of the corridor on the river bank. After reaching KV Dham premises, he will perform the rituals of opening this ambitious project at Mandir Chowk. The PM is likely to address a select gathering at the venue. The KV Dham project was initiated by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. After completion of basic exercise, especially the purchase of 320 identified buildings and its removal, the PM laid the foundation of the mega project on March 8, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/eye-on-up-polls-bjp-plans-nationalevents-to-mark-opening-of-kv-dham/articleshow/88132319.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

In an order dated November 9, additional senior civil judge Ajay Kumar Malik noted that even after availing many opportunities, the plaintiff failed to get any of the witnesses examined in court and failed to bring forward any evidence to prove his complaint. The complaint, registered on May 10, 1991, claimed that the woman was occupying the premises without any licence from the plaintiff and he was entitled to recover damages for the period between March 1, 1989 and April 30, 1991. The woman had claimed that the plaintiff was in unauthorised and illegal possession of the rooms belonging to her and her children. She had further said that she was residing in the one-room property rightfully and there was no question of any damages being claimed by the plaintiff. The court said the matter was adjourned for lack of evidence and the plaintiff did not get any witnesses examined.  “The defendant also never had any opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/30-year-long-trial-ends-mans-case-seeking-damages-rejected/articleshow/88132352.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt goes hyper local on development projects||Lucknow: Even as the inauguration of various flagship projects like airports and expressways by PM Narendra Modi hogs all the limelight in poll bound Uttar Pradesh, the Yogi Adityanath government has rolled out a micro-scale development plan straddling as many as 28 districts including 14 in the west UP region. The plan, essentially entailing rapid economic development of hyper-localized areas in the districts, has already received a budgetary push of nearly Rs 60 crore — that too in one go — by the state planning department. The districts where the heavily localised developmental works are proposed to be taken up include Farrukhabad, Aligarh, Shamli, Meerut, Bijnor, Firozabad, Etawah, Bareilly, Hapur, GB Nagar, Etah, Bulandshahr, Mathura, Agra, Basti, Lucknow, Bhadohi, Hardoi, Jaunpur, Unnao, Kanpur (rural), Maharajganj, Chitrakoot, Kanpur, Kaushambi, Gorakhpur and Kushinagar. The budgetary allocation for various districts for the micro-level development ranges from Rs 30 lakh up to Rs 3 crore. Experts said that the idea is to lend a push to small but locally important projects which have a potential to connect with the people according to their need. This, according to officials, includes development of district roads and other civic amenities. As per the series of government orders issued by the state planning department on December 5, the funds will be utilized for the purpose for which they have been released and there should not be any diversion. Authorities will also have to ensure that the projects undertaken are not being covered under any other scheme of the Centre or the state government. Authorities will also be required to get the projects technically examined and all necessary clearances including those pertaining to environmental issues be taken. The move comes amid the ruling BJP stepping up the developmental pitch to counter its political rivals which have been hitting out at the incumbent dispensation over alleged failure on a host of fronts including development. The fast-tracking of localised projects in west UP gains much significance in the wake of recent farmer disquiet over the three farm laws which were later repealed by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-goes-hyper-local-on-dev-projects/articleshow/88132321.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Goa||Goa: In a first, MGP shuns BJP for pre-poll pact, aligns with TMC||PANAJI: In a significant political development that may lead to realignment of electoral battle in the tiniest state, Goa’s oldest regional party MGP on Monday announced that it has forged a pre-poll alliance with the latest entrant, Trinamool Congress, for the 2022 assembly elections. This is the first time that Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party is going for a pre-poll alliance with any other party other than its natural ally BJP. The saffron party had claimed that they were in talks with MGP to forge a pre-poll alliance. The pre-poll alliance, announced by both MGP and TMC, comes a week ahead of the scheduled visit of Bengal chief minister and TMC chairperson Mamata Banerjee on December 13. “Our party’s central committee has unanimously decided on the alliance. When Banerjee arrives in Goa, the alliance will be declared jointly, if all conditions are agreed to,” MGP president Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar said. MGP has governed Goa for around 17 years, and this is the first time it has forged a pre-poll alliance with a party that doesn’t have a similar ideology to itself. MGP, often considered BJP’s “natural ally”, had allied with the saffron party in 1994, helping it win four seats, including the Panaji constituency, represented by former CM Manohar Parrikar. “For now, TMC and MGP are going forward in an alliance. Our party chairperson is coming here, and we will make it formal. But yes, we are in an alliance. Discussions on seat modalities are on,” TMC MP and party’s Goa in charge Mahua Moitra said. Dhavalikar said TMC’s ideology is not a concern for MGP, because “our party will contest in our bastion”. He said the chief ministerial candidate of the alliance would be announced by January 15. Senior MGP functionary Ramkrishna Dhavalikar is likely to be the face of the alliance. “The agenda of the alliance is to defeat BJP and Congress in the upcoming assembly polls,” Dhavalikar said. He also said more parties are likely to join the alliance. Dhavalikar said MGP has the capacity to fight the assembly election independently but has decided to forge an alliance with a political party which agrees to MGP’s demands. He said that as per the party’s survey, 60% of people in the state have not decided who to vote for even as the election is nearly two months away. “The decision of MGP will be accepted not only by MGP voters but all voters of the state,” he said. Political observers differed with the view, but felt Goa with very small constituencies, any shift in votes would impact the overall results. “Both in terms of chemistry or mathematics, this is not an alliance material, but our constituencies are so small that chipping of votes matter, and MGP-TMC could create a psychological disadvantage for Congress, which appears to be starved of funds,” political observer Cleofato Almeida Coutinho said. “In any alliance, who can transfer how many votes to the other is an important point. TMC has nothing to transfer at the moment. However, there is an impression that TMC has a large amount of resources,” he said. “For BJP, it could also be a disadvantage in certain constituencies. But a greater disadvantage is to Congress, which I feel was depending on a cushion of five MGP seats,” Coutinho said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-first-mgp-shuns-bjp-for-pre-poll-pact-aligns-with-tmc/articleshow/88132331.cms||Murari Shetye

On Monday, 64 international passengers arrived in Vadodara taking the total number of passengers from high-risk and other countries to 246. “Around 15 of them have come from eleven countries which have been declared as high-risk countries. These include five who hail from Vadodara rural, seven from Karjan and three from Waghodiya,” said Dr Surendra Jain, chief district health officer of Vadodara district. In total, 26 passengers from high-risk countries have come to the district. “As per the SOP, our team of medical officers are tracing all of them. They have arrived with Covid-19 negative reports and are being asked to directly go for home isolation for a week. Our teams visit their residences again at the end of the week and they are asked to undergo re-test. If they test negative, they are asked to continue home isolation for another week,” he said. Currently, there are ten of them who are under home quarantine, 15 others who are being traced while one of them has returned to London. “None of them have tested positive of Covid-19 so far,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/26-international-passengers-under-watch/articleshow/88131573.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata experts root for third Covid vaccine shot||KOLKATA: With the pandemic still on and a new variant on the prowl, it is time to introduce a third shot, after the two Covid vaccine doses, that will help curb transmission, feel experts. The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization met on Monday to take a decision on administering the third dose to immune-compromised individuals. The third dose could be introduced as an additional vaccine and not a booster dose, the members said. The third vaccine should soon be opened to the elderly and healthcare workers and not only to the immuno-compromised, said IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar. “It will help protect the high-risk groups. But it is still not clear how far a third vaccine will be effective as there has been no credible study on that. While vaccines, like those of Pfizer and Moderna, have a declared efficacy period, there is yet no evidence on the efficacy period of Covidshield or Covaxin,” Sarkar said. He added a study published in Lancet on a small group of people, who had taken Covishield, showed it might remain effective for about a year. “But the study wasn’t broad enough for a conclusive evidence,” he argued. A third vaccine was the way forward, especially for those who took the shot before April, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. Sarkar said the third shot ran the risk of failing as Omicron was on the prowl. “Our vaccines should provide significant protection, but there is a possibility of Omicron rendering them less than 50% effective. But once vaccinated, T-cells, B-cells, memory cells continue to provide resistance,” he said. A study in the UK found two doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were 88% effective after one month, which dropped to 74% after five or six months. The Oxford/AstraZeneca version declined from being 77% to 67% effective. Moderna found cases among fully vaccinated people jumped from 88 out of 11,431 people, who received their second dose between December and March, to 162 out of 16,747 people vaccinated five months earlier, a jump of around 36%. Pfizer revealed its vaccines decline from being 96% to 83.7% effective after four months. Antibodies were not the only barriers a vaccine provided, said internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas. “While a third vaccine is needed, those with double shots need not panic now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-experts-root-for-third-cov-shot/articleshow/88131563.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

According to meteorologists this is not due to poor air quality caused by pollution, but mainly due to cold air gushing in from the North mixing with the humid air along Mumbai coast resulting in the formation of fog which eventually can also lead to localised drizzling. This, said Gufran Beig, programme director of SAFAR (the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune) is also an indication of temperature in Mumbai getting colder soon. Recently Mumbai had seen a reversal of sea breeze causing heavy rainfall for a few days. Monday's air quality Index (AQI) for Mumbai suggested that almost all major suburbs have ‘satisfactory’ air quality while Colaba, BKC and Malad showed ‘moderate’ quality taking the overall AQI of the city to a ‘No risk’ level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fog-in-mumbai-city-due-to-cold-air-and-not-pollution-say-experts/articleshow/88132852.cms||---
---||Nagpur||MARD: Paucity of resident docs could cause havoc if 3rd wave hits||Nagpur: Resident doctors of all Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) in the state stopped working in outpatient departments (OPDs) on Monday for the demand of early counselling and admissions of post-NEET PG first year. By late Monday evening, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray met them as a ‘representative of the chief minister’ and took several steps to ensure the timely counselling process. After this, doctors decided to join work from Tuesday morning. IGGMCH Nagpur doctors told TOI the batch of senior residents has passed out and no fresh batch of doctors has started working in the GMCs. Due to this, there is a major shortage of doctors. In case the third wave hits, the situation will be grave, they said. “Due to the unexpected postponement of NEET PG counselling, all medical colleges across the country are in acute shortage of resident doctors. At present only two batches of residents are present in hospitals. This has led to overburdening of resident doctors. We are on the verge of breakdown,” said Dr Nitin Jagtap of IGGMCH.As the central committee of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) has extended support to this agitation, resident doctors were missing from the OPDs on Monday in most medical colleges.Aaditya Thackeray assured the resident doctors that state government will start recruitment of junior residents (non-academic) to cover up the deficient number of resident doctors for patient care in Maharashtra. “He also said the state government will request Centre to fasten the counselling by releasing a letter about it soon,” said Central MARD president Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhoble Patil. Moreover, Patil added, “The Maharashtra government will start its preliminary process of NEET PG counselling like form filling and document verification to avoid extra delay from their end.” Thackeray has arranged another meeting next Monday for follow-up and sound preparedness of the state for NEET PG counselling. “So, as a gesture to appreciate the sentience of state government towards resident doctors and the sharp rise in number of Omicron cases in the state, the Central MARD in its state meeting has decided to reduce the intensity of its ongoing agitation and resume serving in OPDs,” reads the statement issued by Central MARD. However, doctors will continue supporting the nationwide agitation. Doctors needed Senior batch of resident doctors passed out, but junior batch yet to be admitted This is because court has stayed counselling process, hearing underway in SC Resident doctors in state GMCs had stopped working in OPDs to raise voice Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray met MARD delegration today as ‘representative of CM’ After several assurances by Thackeray, doctors decided to join services from Tuesday Maharashtra govt will take all steps to avoid delay in admission process||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mard-paucity-of-resident-docs-could-cause-havoc-if-3rd-wave-hits/articleshow/88130833.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The RSS has decided to supervise the BJP’s progress till the booth level to nullify resentments, if any, among the cadre ahead of polls. Asked if RSS has workers at booth level, a senior pracharak told TOI that wherever BJP did not have workers at the booths, RSS members stood the ground. “There is no dearth of volunteers for such a mission,” he said. “As per the strategy, the RSS has deployed at least two ‘swayamsewaks’ at the booth level who will be known as ‘paalaks’,” a senior RSS office-bearer said. About the deployment of footsoldiers till the booth level, the office-bearer said they would be deployed to ensure coordination among the members of all the off-shoots of the RSS, BJP leaders and candidates. He said the booth-level paalaks would be supervised by those at mandal (division) level. “They will be looked after by paalaks at Vidhan Sabha, district and Lok Sabha levels,” he said. At the state level, kshetriya karyawaah and sah-karyawaah would keep a close watch on works at the ground level while overall supervision would be in the hands of kshetriya pracharak (east), Anil Kumar, and kshetriya pracharak (west) Mahendra Kumar, he added. The job of paalaks will be to stay in touch with RSS members and provide details to BJP candidates asking them to connect with these workers.“The deployment of paalaks began about a month ago and their work would continue till assembly elections,” the RSS office-bearer said. “These paalaks have also been entrusted with the responsibility of pacifying those workers who are unhappy ” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-co-ordinators-to-act-as-bridge-between-candidates-masses-in-polls/articleshow/88132333.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Goa||Goa: Nip in the air, as mercury drops by three degrees||PANAJI: On Monday morning, the coconut oil in the container appeared frozen — an indication that mercury had dropped considerably. At Old Goa, the meteorological observatory at Indian council of agriculture research (ICAR) recorded a minimum temperature of 18.5 degrees Celsius. The nip in the air was rather pleasant, as the sudden drop in mercury was noticeable. “The minimum temperature fell by almost four degrees within three days at Old Goa,” said Gopal Mahajan, a scientist with the ICAR. The mercury also dropped to 19.2 degrees Celsius in the city — the lowest of the season so far for Panaji. India meteorological department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature 2.5 degrees below normal on Monday morning. While the mercury dropped by over two to three degrees in a couple of days, the chill was even sharper in the hinterland. Goa experiences a mild winter during December, January and February, as temperatures fall below 20 degrees C and sometimes hover around 17-18 degrees C. This year, it has been like an extended monsoon, with occasional rainfall during October and November, which ended recently as the second-wettest November in many years. The cloudy skies prevented any drop in the mercury, which goes down if the skies are clear. IMD, Panaji, has forecast a minimum temperature of around 20 degrees for Tuesday. But the pleasant nip in the air may be gone, as minimum temperatures and maximum temperatures — which had dropped below normal — are likely to gradually stabilise during the next three to four days. “Change of wind direction is likely in lower atmosphere over Goa from Northerlies-north easterlies to easterlies during the next few days,” said Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji. In 2020 and early this year, the minimum temperature had hardly gone below 20 degrees, as Goa experienced warm nights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nip-in-the-air-as-mercury-drops-by-three-degrees/articleshow/88132348.cms||Paul Fernandes

Targeting Samajwadi Party without taking its name in a rally at Karehabagh in Karchana assembly segment in trans-Yamuna area here on Monday, Singh said, “Jo desh ka batwara karke Hindustanion ka qatle aam kar, trainon mein shav bhejne wale Jinnah ka samman karta hai, kya use vote dena chahiye (Will those honouring Jinnah, who was responsible for killing of Indians and sending their bodies to India in trains get votes?)” “Dharti Maa ki kasam hai, joh Jinnah ka samman karega, use janata kabhi maaf nahin karegi (It’s a promise to motherland, that people would never forgive those who honour Jinnah),” Singh exhorted. BJP state chief further said that the opposition wants Hindus and Muslims to fight against each other and riots to happen. “Under the Yogi Adityanath government, both Hindus and Muslims are fighting together against poverty, and will continue to do so. Will people of the state like to vote for these people,” he asked. The forthcoming assembly election in UP is to ensure nation’s prosperity and making it strong. The election will be fought on the issue of ‘rashtravad’ (nationalism), not caste and creed, Singh added. “Over 42 lakh pukka houses have been built for the poor in UP and each such family in state would get house before 2024. Toilets were constructed, potable water supply is being ensured, and the poor are getting free treatment with Ayushman cards. People are getting 18 to 23 hours power supply in Yogi regime” he added. Gone are the days when police used to sweep streets for criminals, they are now tightening the noose around mafias and goons and putting them in jail, said Singh. Urging people to vote and ensure lotus blooms in assembly polls, Singh said, “Laxmi ji cycle aur hathi par nahin aati, woh Kamal par hi aati hain.” He added that PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi worked tirelessly during Covid pandemic to save precious lives and livelihood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/people-will-never-forgivethose-hailing-jinnah-bjp/articleshow/88130839.cms||---

The distraught family told TOI on Monday that Gautam, the youngest of eight siblings, supported the entire family. Gautam's inconsolable brother Suresh Kumar, who was handed the body after it arrived at Nauli Gramsabha in Tehri Garhwal from Nagaland, said, “Yesterday morning we received a call and we were told about the incident. He was the youngest and most responsible among all of us. There were eight of us but it was only he who had managed to get a government job. We belong to a family of daily-wage earners, and we looked to him for all our needs.” Kumar said that Gautam had come home during Navratri and met everyone, discussing in detail the health of his grandfather with whom he was very close. "Our grandfather has gone quiet now. He loved our dada and our specially-abled sister. They were very dear to him. Gautam had joined the Army when he was just 21. We could not do anything for him and he did so much for us.” Jagdish Mistri, a villager, said, “Lal came from a humble background. His family members are mainly labourers, depending on MNREGA work for a living. It's a huge blow to the family."

---||Kolkata||ID Hosp ready to isolate, treat Omicron patients||Kolkata: The state’s nodal hospital for infectious diseases is prepared to isolate and treat suspected Omicron patients as and when detected in Bengal. The Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital has kept a 50-bed unit ready for housing any Covid patient suspected to be infected with the latest variant of concern. So far, at least 21 Omicron cases have been detected in India in six days. In Bengal, no suspected case was found till Monday, but state health officials said detection and containment measures were important to limit the spread of Omicron and that going by the protocol, the Bengal government was fully prepared. “We have earmarked a 50-bed ward exclusively for this, 25 beds for female patients and 25 for male. All our doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers have been asked to remain alert and be ready to tend to such patients when requireed,” said ID&BG Hospital principal Anima Haldar. Even earlier, the Beliaghata hospital had dedicated wards to isolate and treat patients, infected with or suspected to be infected with variants, such as Alpha and Beta. On Monday, a review meeting was held under pulmonologist Kausik Chaudhuri, where doctors, nursing-in-charge and the nursing superintendent discussed the government protocol on tackling Omicron. An assistant superintendent has also been assigned to the Omicron ward to ensure all necessary facilities are implemented. “We are ready to take in patients as and when the state health department directs us about any such patient, referred by the Kolkata airport or any other place. Such patients will be kept and treated here while the swab samples will be sent to National Institute of Biomedical Genomics Kalyani through School of Tropical Medicine Kolkata,” said Chaudhuri, the hospital’s nodal officer for Covid-19. “As for the clinical and management part, the protocol remains the same. I am closely following Omicron cases across the globe. So far, there has been no significant increase in virulence though there is a possibility of immune evasion,” said infectious diseases specialist Sayantan Banerjee, in charge of the Covid CCU. Though a section of doctors claimed Omicron patients could be treated in the same ward as other Covid-19 patients, health officials said a separate ward was needed to minimise the transmission risk. “We need measures for restricting transmission and spread of the infection, which will ultimately reduce the case load. Therefore isolate, test, track and treat are very essential. We are ready with our dedicated isolation ward for the purpose,” said ID&BG Hospital medical superintendent and vice-principal Assis Manna, a public health specialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/id-hosp-ready-to-isolate-treat-omicron-patients/articleshow/88131579.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Vijayawada||6 years on, GVMC’s erosion mitigation plan awaits nod||Visakhapatnam: Even six years after the Andhra Pradesh Disaster Recovery Project (APDRP) was sanctioned to the cyclone Hudhud-affected districts, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation could not take the ‘coastal erosion mitigation and shoreline management plan’ forward. One of the sub-components of the APDRP, the erosion mitigation initiative is yet to get the approval of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. The project has once again come to the fore after the tides damaged a part of the children’s park on the RK beach road on Sunday. The World Bank approved a credit for an amount of US $250 million towards APDRP after cyclone Hudhud devastated several districts of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, including Visakhapatnam. The counterpart funding from the state government would be US $120 at the ratio of 68:32 Out of the six components of the APDRP, the component-III deals with protection and restoration of the beachfront. The ‘coastal erosion mitigation and shoreline management plan’ is proposed to be taken up with a tentative cost of Rs 100 crore. Visakhapatnam has been subject to coastal erosion due to weather conditions and human intervention. It had affected the RK beach area several times in the past with the tides vanishing the embankment. The erosion even extended to the far-off Rushikonda beach in the past. The major objective of the proposed beach erosion project is to suggest a suitable scheme to mitigate the coastal erosion and to prepare a shoreline management plan for Visakhapatnam. The GVMC entrusted the responsibility of preparing a detailed project report jointly to a Netherlands-based private agency and National Institute of Ocean Technology for about Rs 4.4 crore. But the project could not be taken forward for the want of the approval from the Union ministry. A GVMC engineering official informed that they are reworking on the project to get the needed approvals from the MoEF. “We will prepare revised proposals for the project,” said the official. The GVMC has proposed two projects under the APDRP, including the shore protection works. The other project involves beachfront development. While the bidder was finalised for the beachfront development project, tenders are yet to be floated for the erosion project. The APDRP project attempts to restore damage incurred by the disasters while improving the resilience of infrastructure and communities from impacts of future disasters and climate change. The underground electricity cabling project taken up by the Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited is one of the major components of the APDRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/6-years-on-gvmcs-erosion-mitigation-plan-awaits-nod/articleshow/88130844.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Lucknow||Upgraded ICMR Gorakhpur Centre to bolster in-depth medical research in UP||Lucknow: From being a field unit of National Institute of Virology, Pune, the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Gorakhpur, is set to expand into a full-fledged medical research facility. Now, in-depth medical research in areas of viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases will be possible in UP with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) — the apex medical research body of India. PM Narendra Modi will inaugurate the upgraded centre on Tuesday. In its new avatar, RMRC will undertake genome sequencing work which will help the state in identifying disease-causing microbes at the earliest. “The biggest advantage of the centre is that UP will not have to send samples to NIV Pune or NCDC Delhi for analysis and assessment. The work will be done at Gorakhpur. This means that authorities will not have to wait for more than five-six hours to identify disease outbreak causing microbes. In comparison, the average turn-around time of samples ranged between 24 to 48 hours,” said centre director Dr Rajnikant. The centre, which comes under ICMR, will carry out research in vector-borne, communicable and non-communicable diseases and nutritional challenges in addition to its regular research on Japanese encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome. In 2008, the Centre started medical research on encephalitis which wreaked havoc in the eastern UP region. Listing out achievements of the centre over the years, Dr Rajnikant said: “Our biggest accomplishment is research in the field of encephalitis. It helped in identifying that scrub typhus was a key contributor to the condition in the region. Accordingly, public health policies and plans changed, and the interventions have brought down both mortality and morbidity significantly.” The unit also conducted encephalitis vaccine efficacy studies which paved the way for a mass encephalitis control programme across over 35 districts of the state. ICMR officials said the centre was extremely helpful during the Covid-19 pandemic period. “Until now, we have tested 7,59,876 samples, of which 14,516 were found positive,” claimed a staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/upgraded-icmr-gorakhpur-centre-to-bolster-in-depth-medical-research-in-up/articleshow/88132363.cms||Shailvee Sharda

They misguided the minister while they accompanied her during the hospital visit. I was kept away from Attapadi deliberately. Attempts are being made to make me look corrupt, even though I always opposed any corrupt practices in running the hospital,” Prebhudas told media persons in Attapadi on Monday. He said that he had written many letters to the health department seeking funds to complete the construction of a ward, lift, for more doctors, staff and other facilities at Kottathara hospital. “All these letters were ignored. If adequate facilities are not made available in the tribal specialty hospital, the tribal infant deaths will continue in Attapadi,” he added. “I am being punished not for no fault of mine. Neither the minister nor the health department top official asked me anything over the complaints that are said to have been raised against the hospital. The hospital in Attapadi is a good one due to the tireless efforts of doctors and other staff there. When we ask for more facilities, we are being made the culprits. But we cannot take the responsibility for no fault of ours,” said Prebhudas. When asked about punitive action against him by the government, he said, “I do not fear for any action. I have been working as a doctor in Attapadi since 2007 and became the nodal officer in 2013. I was awarded the best doctor of the state. The tribespeople of Attapadi know me well and appreciate my work too. This is my biggest award.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribal-health-nodal-officer-puts-health-min-in-a-spot/articleshow/88131618.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot's OSD Lokesh Sharma appears before Delhi cops||JAIPUR: Lokesh Sharma, officer on special duty (OSD) to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, appeared before the Delhi police crime branch on Monday. This is the first time he has appeared before the Delhi police despite being served four notices in the alleged illegal phone-tapping case. Sharma is accused of circulating a telephonic conversation between one Gajendra Singh and Congress MLAs after illegally tapping them for the alleged poaching of legislators during the political crisis last year. He was questioned for three-and-a-half hours, centred mainly on the source of the tape which he had circulated. The Delhi police had issued the notice to him on a complaint filed by Union minister and BJP leader Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. The Congress had alleged that Gajendra Singh was none other than Union minister Shekhawat himself, which he denied. However, the Union minister refused to give voice samples to the SOG as well as the ACB which is investigating the matter. The next hearing of the case is on January 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cms-osd-lokesh-sharmaappears-before-delhi-cops/articleshow/88132381.cms||---
---||Goa||Five foreigners test positive for Covid in Goa, Omicron suspected||PANAJI: Five persons from Russia and Georgia who tested positive for Covid-19 in Goa are suspected to have the Omicron variant. The samples of the five — all crew members of a vessel — have been sent for genome sequencing to the National Centre for Cell Science, Pune. “Only one among them is mildly symptomatic and is admitted to a private hospital at Chicalim, while the other four are completely asymptomatic and are being isolated at the Cansaulim health centre,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI. The vessel, with around 20 crew members, reportedly arrived in Goa on November 18. The first suspect, a Russian, boarded the vessel in Goa on November 23, and was tested for Covid after he turned symptomatic on board on November 29. He had travel history, and had travelled Russia-Dubai-Delhi-Goa before he boarded the vessel. “Four more crew members tested positive on screening for contacts,” director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said. The ship touched Cape Town, South Africa, among other places, on its way to Goa. Three of the Omicron suspects are Russian and two Georgian. “All the five samples have been sent to NCCS Pune on Monday and the reports are awaited,” Dr Betodkar said. Health minister Vishwajit Rane told presspersons that the suspected cases are “not from within the state of Goa but from the ship” and appealed to people not to panic and to continue taking all precautions to stay protected from the virus. When asked about precautionary measures the state is taking in view of the festive days ahead, Rane said the state is already taking precautions. “The state government is very sensitive and alert and we don’t want any situation… Goa is a tourism state and we need to see that protocols are strictly followed. I appeal to people to stick to SOPs,” he said, adding that every international traveller coming in from high-risk countries is being checked with testing facilities being enhanced at the airport. The government, he said, wants to have genome sequencing at Asilo and GMC, but as of now, most states are sending samples to notified centres for genome testing. Cansaulim health centre and TB hospital have been identified as isolation facilities. The health services will ramp up isolation facilities, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/five-foreigners-test-ve-for-covid-in-goa-omicron-suspected/articleshow/88132384.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Goa: Now, section of Zuari bridge may open only in February next year||PANAJI: The state government had announced early this year that one four-lane section of the new Zuari bridge will be ready for use by commuters by mid-December, in time to mark the 60th year celebrations of Goa’s Liberation. However, officials said that they are struggling to get a visa for the Chinese consultants to travel to India, even after interventions by Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari. The Chinese consultants are required to oversee the assembly of the cable-stay section of the superstructure of the bridge. Officials said that the contractors for the new Zuari bridge work, Dilip Buildcon, are now expected to ready the first section for use only by end of February 2022. “During laying of the cable-stay structure of the bridge, there is need for geometry control — alterations are required to be made as per the ground situation to achieve the perfect alignment. The Chinese consultants were to oversee this crucial process, but their visa has not come through for months now. Some solutions are being worked out, and the bridge can now be ready only towards the end of February 2022 for use,” said an official. Officials said that most of the other works, including the approach roads, are nearing completion. One overbridge at Siridao in the approach road section of the new Zuari bridge project is expected to be opened up later this month itself for commuters on a trial-basis. The new eight-lane Zuari bridge has been designed by French bridge specialist Erwan Vicat of Ingerop, Paris, in association with Infinite Civil Solutions, India. Dewei Chan of Tongji University, Shanghai, China, is acting as design consultant. At 640m, the new Zuari bridge, once completed, will be the second-longest cable bridge in the country after the Vidyasagar Setu in Kolkata. Work on the Rs 1,400 crore project began in October 2016 and the project was expected to be completed within three years, by late 2019. However, in the design stages of the bridge itself, changes were required, as the terrain of the bridge construction was found to pose some challenges. Later, the work on the bridge was delayed after the state government could not divert traffic, as it had promised to the bridge work contractor. The official plan to divert vehicles via Sancoale on the Margao to Panaji route was opposed by locals. The plan was to help the bridge work gain pace by ensuring commuter safety, but was proving to be highly inconvenient for citizens, adding more than 22 kms to their daily journey. The pandemic brought with it yet more hurdles in 2020, as it hit availability of construction material as well as labour. The government then set an April 2021 deadline for one-lane section of the bridge to be ready, but, having failed to meet that deadline too, had said that the section will be opened for Goa’s 60th Liberation year celebrations in December 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-section-of-zuari-bridge-may-open-only-in-feb-next-yr/articleshow/88132377.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Nagpur||1 West Africa, 2 UK returnees test positive||Nagpur: Three international flyers — a 40-year-old man from Burkina Faso, a 39-year-old woman and her 9-year-old daughter from the UK — have tested positive for Covid-19 after Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) traced and tested people with recent foreign travel history amid Omicron variant concerns. Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing. The man, a resident of Dighori, returned to the city on Sunday evening from Delhi and has puzzled surveillance officials. On December 3, he left from Burkina Faso in West Africa carrying an RT-PCR negative report. He landed in Delhi on Sunday and took a connecting flight the same day to Nagpur, where he tested RT-PCR positive on arrival. He is unvaccinated.The woman and her daughter were among 175 international travellers who reached the city between November 1 and November 30, after which the new restrictions were imposed by Maharashtra government. They had reached Nagpur on November 29 after landing at Mumbai airport. Her husband too tested positive and is admitted in a Mumbai hospital, officials said. Though UK is not among the countries on the red list of state government, around 11 confirmed cases of Omicron variant have been reported in England and Scotland. Burkina Faso too is not among the ‘at-risk’ nations. Besides the two positive cases, 116 flyers have tested negative.NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said the man and mother-daughter duo have been shifted to AIIMS Nagpur where a special ward has been set up. “All of them are asymptomatic. They were staying in Dhantoli. The woman was fully vaccinated. Some had already taken the RT-PCR test at private labs, including these two patients, while some samples were sent to IGGMCH and GMCH.Dr Chilkar added that rest of the 57 flyers were untraceable and the civic body was taking the help of cops. “We have requested the police department to trace these 57 flyers. We were not able to connect with them on phone. The list was provided by the Bureau of Immigration,” he said. Dr Chilkar added that all the negative flyers would continue to be monitored through phone calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1-west-africa-2-uk-returnees-test-positive/articleshow/88130857.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The police made the submissions in its status report filed before additional chief metropolitan magistrate Sachin Gupta. “As per the allegations in the complaint, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar addressed his party workers in Chandigarh on October 3, 2021 and the same went viral. From the contents of the complaint and the alleged video attached with the complaint, no cognisable offence is made out,” the report stated. It further said that as per the complaint, the alleged video has been recorded in Chandigarh, which does not fall in the jurisdiction of Delhi. “Hence the complaint after inquiries has been closed/filed.” Earlier, advocate Amit Sahni, the complainant, submitted that the alleged controversial video was available on various social platforms on the internet and being viewed by netizens of Delhi and NCR. “The farmers are already sitting on the border of Delhi NCR and in the past also, a law and order situation was created due to rallies and protests. Such kind of hate speech and incitement by a government functionary like the incumbent chief minister in its all potential could have spiked the agitation and created law and order situation in Delhi and NCR,” he further claimed.

---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: Checks at inter-state border causing locals inconvenience||KOLHAPUR: The mandatory requirement of fully vaccinated Covid certificate or RT-PCR test negative report at the Maharashtra-Karnataka border is causing major inconvenience to thousands of locals who commute between these two states on a daily basis. Checkposts have come up on both sides of Maharashtra and Karnataka border to screen the travellers in the wake of new Omicron variant’s emergence. Both state government’s have intensified screening and checking and those without Covid vaccination certificates for both doses or RT-PCR negative reports are sent back. The locals as well as the daily commuters, especially those working in the industrial areas across border, are facing inconvenience and calling it an harassment. Many from both sides are yet to get their second dose as they have not completed the mandatory 84-day gap. Also, the RT-PCR testing facilities is not easily accessible. Since the check posts have come up, the industries are facing shortfall of workers who are busy getting the RT-PCR tests. Mohan Panditrao, president of Gokul Shirgaon Manufacturers Association (Goshima), said, “The industrial zones such as Gokul Shirgaon and Kagal Five Star MIDC have over 50% workers residing on either side of the border. The industrialists too have to commute frequently to Karnataka especially to Belagavi, Huballi and Dharwad. Each time the demand of Covid vaccination certificate or the RT-PCR negative report is causing difficulties to all of us. We had requested the district authorities to relax the rules or issue identity cards to the daily commuters especially the workers, however our request has been turned down. During the first wave of Covid commuting was hassle-free as those with the identity cards can easily cross border any time.” Authorities claim that the locals, especially farmers and those travelling in buses, should be allowed to commute freely without forcing them for the Covid vaccination certificate or RT-PCR negative report. Shailesh Balkawade, Kolhapur district superintendent of police, said, “We are letting the farmers in by checking their address and farm documents.We have no other option but to send those back who are unable to furnish the mandatory document.” To avoid infiltration, the administration from both the states have deployed police force at every route connecting the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/checks-at-inter-state-border-causing-locals-inconvenience/articleshow/88130059.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Unique protest: No candidates for two seats||VADODARA: Voters boycotting polls to press for various reasons is known, but at a village in Dahod district there are no candidates on two seats for gram panchayat polls. Peeved at changes in these two wards, villagers ensured no one contested the polls. Changes in wards six and seven of the Tunkivaju village in Garbada taluka ensured that some voters were exchanged between the wards. Villagers from these wards were unhappy at this and raised the issue with leaders, but it was not resolved. As a drastic step, they decided to ensure that nobody contested polls from these wards. Former taluka panchayat president Soma Chauhan said that there are no candidates in the two wards. “Candidates had kept their nomination papers ready. But till the last moment, the villagers did not relent and nobody submitted the forms,” Chauhan said. Some voters from the two wards remained present at the taluka panchayat office where the forms were to be submitted and ensured that no candidate went inside. Chauhan said that if the forms had been submitted an election would have taken place as rival candidates were prepared to contest. Former sarpanch of the village, Ranjansinh Sangod, said that candidates like him had to suffer despite not being with the ruling BJP. “We tried to tell these voters that we were not involved with the decision, but they did not agree,” he said. The elections will be held in the remaining 10 wards of the panchayat as well as for the post of the sarpanch. Contestants for the post of the sarpanch are trying to convince the voters of the two wards to vote for the sarpanch. A byelection will have to be held for these two wards. The voters of the two wards have said that if a byelection was held without reversing the changes, they will oppose the election and repeat what they did this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/unique-protest-no-candidates-for-two-seats/articleshow/88131608.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Goa||16 years after introduction, GCET criterion may be relaxed to fill engineering seats||PANAJI: Since 2005, the Goa Common Entrance Test (GCET) has been an essential criterion in the state to determine merit for admission to engineering degree seats. But for three years now, almost 50% seats in private engineering colleges in the state have gone vacant after the admission rounds. Now, the directorate of technical education (DTE) has proposed to the state government that the GCET criterion should be relaxed for 2021-22 while filling up seats left vacant after the second admission round. It is felt that it’s better for seats to be filled rather than let over 400 go vacant just because GCET is insisted on. Engineering seats were upped in the state in 2019-20 to accommodate the quota for economically weaker sections (EWS). Ever since, between 350 and 550 seats go vacant every year, mostly across the four private engineering colleges in Goa. “This year, at the end of the first admission round in Goa, around 300 engineering seats are vacant. But this number is expected to go up further, as admissions to institutes like NITs are presently on, and students may give up state seats if they get a slot in one of the national institutes,” said a state official. The second round of engineering admissions is expected to take place between November 14 and 24. This, however, depends on the schedule of admissions for medical and dentistry seats, which is presently awaited by the state from the central government. “At the end of the second round, seats left vacant will be allowed to be claimed by students who have not answered GCET. The student has to have passed Class XII from a recognized board with the subjects of physics, chemistry, mathematics with minimum of 45% marks. This is the eligibility criteria even now. GCET is held to determine merit. But rather than allow hundreds of seats to go vacant, interested students who have not answered GCET will be allowed to claim the slots,” said an official. There are around 1,600 engineering degree seats available in Goa, of which the seats in the state-run Goa Engineering College go full within the first admission round. The remaining around 1,150 seats in private colleges see a collective vacancy of almost 50% at the end of the two admission rounds. “Until now, DTE was permitting admissions to take place without GCET only if seats are left vacant in a private college, and the college seeks the relaxation to fill it under management quota. Such seats were filled up at the college level itself. But this year, DTE will be carrying out admissions for the first time without GCET, but after all interested GCET candidates are exhausted at the end of the second admission round,” said the official. Last year, four admission rounds were held, and only at the fag end of the admission process were students allowed to claim seats without GCET, which did not help much, and colleges were collectively left with 550 vacancies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/16-yrs-after-introduction-gcet-criterion-may-be-relaxed-to-fill-engg-seats/articleshow/88132404.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Vote out BJP to save Constitution, says Mayawati||LUCKNOW: Saying that only a change in government could help in saving the Constitution, BSP chief Mayawati on Monday said that there was no point in her party taking to streets if the ruling dispensation was anti-Constitution. Speaking on the death anniversary of BR Ambedkar, the former UP CM accused the central and UP governments of working against constitutional tenets and said it was necessary for the government to change. Appealing to her workers to thwart the designs of such parties and organisations, Mayawati said that they should work towards ensuring that the BSP came to power in UP in the 2022 assembly elections with a full majority. “There are people and organisations who are bent upon dividing votes of Dalits, STs and OBCs for their personal agendas. They are trying to weaken Ambedkar’s movement. It is also true that after the elections, these communities will be left alone to fend for themselves,” Mayawati said, There were also such narrow-minded and casteist parties, Mayawati said, which always opposed BR Ambedkar’s ideology and also insulted him. But now for political gains these parties were acknowledging him and pretending to honour him. “Whatever the BJP may claim about working as per law, people know it is not true. The ground reality is different. In all 75 districts of UP marginalised and weaker sections of society have to face harassment daily. Though most of these cases are not reported,” she said. Hitting out at the Samajwadi Party, the BSP chief said no alliance was going to save them in the upcoming election. “These parties are taking out Vijay Rath Yatras even when they have won nothing so far,” she said, referring to SP. On Sunday, SP workers misbehaved with police in Chandauli, she said. “This is their situation when they have not even won the election. Let them do whatever they want, people remember that when the SP was in power, goons and mafia were thriving in the state. However, under the BSP regime, there was rule of law,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vote-out-bjp-to-save-constitution-says-maya/articleshow/88132386.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: A week later, Trichy on the verge of another flood||TRICHY: A week after the deluge that disrupted the normal life of residents, Trichy city is again on the verge of another flood. Though the city has not received rainfall till Monday, heavy downpour in the catchment areas including Manapparai has triggered authorities to sound flood warnings in the Korayar and Ariyar rivers passing through the city. The public works department has identified low-lying points to immediately strengthen bunds to avoid breaches and inundation. The district administration said that Manapparai town recorded 274.6mm rainfall between 6am and 9am on Monday. The downpour has filled eight major tanks and the Upparu and Mamundi rivers become swollen. A breach in the Appu Iyer tank has left Rajiv Nagar and Manapparai bus stand flooded affecting bus services. The unprecedented rainfall is most likely to flood the Ariyar river, which enters Trichy near Dheeran Nagar and merges with the Korayar river. Both Ariyar and Korayar carrying surplus water from Manapparai, Dindigul and Pudukottai feeds the Kudamurutti river near Kuzhumayee Amman temple behind Trichy district collector office and merge with the Cauvery after passing through several residential neighbourhoods. Anticipating floods on the banks of the three rivers, district collector S Sivarasu issued a flood alert. In the Ariyar, Punganur near Srirangam was identified as vulnerable, while AUT Colony, Fathima Nagar and Tyagaraja Nagar were identified as vulnerable in the Kudamurutti river. “We can mobilise one lakh sandbags based on demand. Metal pipes were used for reinforcement. We expect the flow of water to increase from Monday night,” a senior official with the PWD said. While the flow in the Korayar is moderate, the Ariyar is likely to cause flooding as surplus water from Manapparai will approach the downstream. “Encroachments in the drain is the major cause of concern. Periodical desilting and strengthening of tanks were not carried out,” Sakthivel Rengasamy, a resident of Manapparai, said. The surplus water from Manapparai may flood Dheeran Nagar, Pirattiyur and the suburbs of the city on the Dindigul NH. “Last week, we had surplus water coming from both the Korayar and Ariyar rivers, this time it is only from the Ariyar, and the situation can be controlled,” another PWD official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/a-week-later-trichy-city-on-the-verge-of-another-flood/articleshow/88132392.cms||---
---||Dehradun||251 dog bite cases in 5 months in Mussoorie||Mussoorie: Mussoorie is struggling to combat stray dogs these days. In the past five months alone, 251 dog bite cases have been reported from the hill town. After a toddler was brutally attacked by a stray dog last week, there has been widespread anger among the residents who are demanding that the Mussoorie Municipal Council (MMC) take immediate action. "My daughter was bitten on the face by a stray dog. She received seven stitches and was lucky not to have lost an eye," said Soni, the mother of the toddler. She narrated that while she was admitted at the government civil hospital in Mussoorie, her seven-year old daughter was attacked by dogs on the hospital premises. According to the data provided by the government hospital, 251 cases of dog bite have been reported in the hill resort from July to November. Several residents also reported of being chased by dogs, especially in the morning hours. “The cases of dog bites are on the rise and we are fearful of our safety,” said a resident who did not wish to be named. “The MMC must take this on priority and find an effective solution. The residents, especially the children and the elderly, are the most affected,” remarked Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders' Association. When contacted, MMC chairman Anuj Gupta said that sterilisation of strays was being done at a rapid pace. “We have set up a sterilisation centre and a specialist agency has been hired to sterilise the dogs. So far, we have sterilised 1,440 strays and as a result new progeny is not coming up. In the next few years, population of strays will decline,”he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/251-dog-bite-cases-in-5-months-in-mussoorie/articleshow/88130881.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Aurangabad||Beheading case: Clashing claims over suspect’s age||Aurangabad: Legal issues have emerged over the key suspect’s age in the case of murder of a 20-year old woman who, on Sunday, was beheaded by her brother for marrying the man of her choosing. The autopsy report has now revealed that the woman was two-month pregnant at the time of her death. The young woman had eloped with her boyfriend, who belongs to the same community, and had married him on June 21 this year. Her actions had angered her family members, who felt that she had embarassed all of them. According to the police, the key suspect (the brother of the deceased) is an adult. However, his family has now produced a gram panchayat record before the court to claim that he is a minor. Vaijapur sub-divisional police officer Kailash Prajapati told TOI, “Initially, the suspect was claimed to be 17 years old. Later, on verifying his school transfer certificate, we found out that he was 18 years and seven months old.” Based on this record, the accused was arrested along with his 38-year-old mother on murder charge. The mother and son were produced before the court on Monday as the police were seeking their custody. However, the lawyer representing the accused produced a certificate from the gram panchayat, claiming that he is a minor. The Vaijapur-based court took cognizance of the contradictory claims, and asked the police to produce him before the child welfare committee, which sent him to a remand home. His mother has been remanded in one-day police custody. Prajapati said the police are seeking legal opinion on this matter. “We are of the view that the key suspect is an adult. Efforts will be made to address the issue legally,” he said. The preliminary probe has revealed that the victim was two-month pregnant and her mother was well aware of this fact. Her brother, using a sickle, had beheaded her in Ladgaon of Vaijapur tehsil on Sunday afternoon. The probe revealed that the victim’s mother too assisted the suspect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beheading-case-clashing-claims-over-suspects-age/articleshow/88130075.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Till date, all samples processed for genome sequencing in the region have shown presence mostly of Delta or its sublineages.City doctors warned that Delta, which triggered the second wave, could bring a third wave too.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said Omicron’s severity was not clear yet. “The genome sequencing study indicates Omicron is not present in Nagpur. It will take some time as it will spread gradually, maybe by January last week,” he said.Dr Shinde added that the possibility of Delta triggering a third wave was higher. “Delta is still relevant. It can still find susceptible population and lead to a spike in cases. As of now, large number of people have immunity but after six months immunity can wane and things can be different,” he said.The infectious diseases specialist added, “In South Africa, Omicron patients have had mild symptoms or got discharged early. Many were admitted only for isolation. The actual impact would be more clear in the next two weeks as the severity of a Covid variant is seen only after three weeks.”Dr Shinde said Nagpur may be a difficult city for Delta to attack because conditions here remained severe for a long time. “It will be difficult for the variant to find a new host but you never know,” he said, adding that a second Delta attack could not be ruled out. Internal medicine specialist Dr Mohan Nerker said chances of a third wave look bleak because of good vaccination and herd immunity. “But the existing strain can be harmful for people with comorbidities. Also, the second vaccine dose for most healthcare workers was administered long back. Yet, booster guidelines have not been fixed yet. Delta was very severe. Omicron is infectious but has mild symptoms. Omicron doesn’t have a high admission rate,” he said.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik explained that mutations keep taking place every minute in every individual virus. “But 80% of the mutants are killed by the virus itself. A small segment of mutants regenerate themselves. It depends on their potential characteristics — how virulent, infective and severe they can be. Across the world, Delta is prevalent. High vigilance is needed. There is also a possibility that the strain whose transmission is faster will gradually replace the existing variant,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/delta-still-relevant-may-find-susceptible-population/articleshow/88130865.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

This will affect Covid management. The health department officials said not only the testing, but other areas of pandemic management get affected because of staff shortage.Officials say as contractual employees under the National Health Mission (NHM) and under the state government scheme are on strike for the past many days, daily testing has been hit. Against the daily target of 8,000 to 10,000, less than 6,000 tests are being conducted in the district. Officials say there was a time when vaccination was done at more than 250 sites, but now the number has shrunk to 116. The state health department report of December 3 says contact tracing value of Ludhiana district is 7.3 as compared with the state average of 17.1 for the past seven days. As per the November 13 report, the contact case ratio of Ludhiana district was 14 and of the state was 16.7.A health officer says Omicron threat has come at a time when the department has more than 50% employees on strike and since contractual staff is involved in Covid management, including testing, contact tracing and vaccination, it has become a big challenge for us. Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh also confirmed that they have been facing problems as more than 50% of staff (contractual ones) are on strike. He says they are trying to cope with the help of available resources. An officer says even as not much is known about Omicron especially it’s characteristics, they are asking people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Health department officials say that since this is an election year, contractual employees want to get their demands, especially regularisation, fulfilled and the strike has not impacted the working of the civil hospital as the authorities have made temporary arrangements. Residents want the department to take all necessary steps to check the virus spread. “We have been hearing that Omicron cases have been reported in India, so we are worried. Though we are following Covid norms, including wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing, among others, we request the health department to beef up surveillance and get more people vaccinated. And people should also cooperate with the department,” says Narinder Singh, a city resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/omicron-stares-in-face-health-dept-is-hit-by-staff-shortage/articleshow/88130867.cms||---

The employees of the centres affiliated with de-addiction centres were on strike on the day in support of their demands. In Jagraon, a large number of patients reached the OOAT centre to get their medicines. But its employees, who were on strike, turned them back. Agitated, the patients staged a protest and blocked the Jagraon-Raikot Road. Locals said, “During the protest, there were long queues of vehicles on both the sides of the road. Amid the chaos, arguments broke out between the commuters and the protesters.” Later, police reached the spot and pacified them. One of the protesters said, “As we are not getting the medicines, our condition has started deteriorating. If the employees of the OOAT clinic are on strike, then the department concerned should have made some other arrangements.” There were protests in Khanna too, where patients raised slogans against the state government. One of the patients said, “I started having drugs about 25 years ago. I gave them up four years ago and since then have been taking medicines from OOAT centre. On Monday, when I reached the centre, I didn’t get the medicines despite a long wait. The centre employees told us that they are on strike. I have not faced such a problem before.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/de-addiction-patients-protest-in-jagraon-khanna/articleshow/88130860.cms||---

A hormonal disorder has left her growth stunted, but as she moves around by pushing her body on her hands, the 27-year old has become the lifeline for remote Reyatkhada village in Melghat.For any medical emergency at the village, deep in the jungles, it is a phone call from Lata that brings aid. The healthcare system in Melghat hills, once infamous for malnutrition deaths, depends on messengers like her.The messengers’ service is vital here and also typical of the Melghat region. They call up the nearest primary health centre (PHC) or a sub-centre to report any kind of sickness. Even delivery cases are taken care of. In interior villages, the messengers are individuals owning a mobile phone. Locals have now begun to buy phones, but network connectivity remains elusive in some pockets. The phone catches signal near Lata’s house, making her the sole point of contact for getting medical help, say sources.These days, she has also been engaged in pushing the villagers to get vaccinated. Nearly 85% of the village of over 450 has got the first dose of vaccine. Lata has been instrumental in relaying messages to the vaccination teams.“She suffers from a hormone deficiency that hampered her growth, and she crawls to move around. It’s because of phone calls from her that we have been able to attend a number of emergencies,” says Dr Dipak Kundetkar, community health officer, who discovered Lata.The emergency can range from anything like fever to childbirth. A medical team rushes to the village on receiving the phone call.Normally, it’s the health worker who does the calling, but in Reyatkheda the mobile signal reaches only near Lata’s home. Her disability has not come in the way of discharging her duty. The last call she made was about a child birth case, said Kundetkar.“I have been working since one year, after sir (Kundetkar) told me. I keep the phone a little out of the door and it catches signal,” says Lata.She stays with her old parents who tend cattle and don’t have any land holding. “I had two elder brothers who passed away before I was born, and have no siblings now,” she says. Asked about her future plans, she says, “I haven’t thought about that yet.”Lata has studied till Std VIII, but did not study further because the school was far. “I cannot walk, and there was no one to carry me to the other school,” she says.“Reyatkheda is just 10km from Semadoh, where we have a health centre. However, it takes not less than an-hour-and-a-half to reach because of the forested road. Even in a vehicle, we have to drive dead slow as there is no proper road,. The village is cut off after heavy rains,” says Kundetkar. Lack of roads to villages is the biggest problem, adds Lata.There are other villages too with messengers appointed. “Under my own jurisdiction there are other remote villages. Another hamlet Raksha also depends on the messenger. The messengers have to first hunt for a signal at times, maybe reach an elevated point to call,” Kundetkar said.“Our pocket comes under the Semadoh PHC headed by Dr Mahesh Kurkoti,” he adds.“Melghat, due to its remoteness, has messengers in villages. Even if there is no call from them, we make a call each day,” said Dr Nita Nagale, a health department officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dwarfed-by-health-but-standing-tall-as-messenger-in-remote-village/articleshow/88130894.cms||Shishir Arya

Addressing the anganwadi workers, Dhami said, “My both the children got formative education from anganwadi, therefore, I understand their importance and role in society-building. Anganwadi plays a significant role in dispensing best education, health and social services for a state. So, we have decided to provide them insurance cover as they work under difficult conditions due to the state’s tough geography.” Not just this but the state government has also decided to provide 25% vacancies of anganwadi 'karyakartri' to those existing anganwadi workers who have completed 10 years of service and hold requisite education qualification, said Rekha Arya, the women and child development minister, while addressing the workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/anganwadi-workers-to-get-rs-2l-life-insurance-cover/articleshow/88130862.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||District procuring 1,000 SGTF kits for Omicron surveillance||Nagpur: Viral Research Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) of the Government Medical College and Hospital and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital will be provided 1,000 ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) kits to primarily test samples of international flyers for Omicron surveillance in the city.As the kits are not abundantly available, the two labs are likely to process samples collected by private labs too. The kits are likely to help administration to focus on suspects from among the large number of samples. The decision was taken during a Covid review meeting at the divisional commissioner’s office on Monday.District collector Vimala R told TOI that an order for 1,000 kits has been placed with a Hyderabad institute, which is exclusively manufacturing these. “Not all international flyers will be tested with the new kits, but only the suspects,” she said. Divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma said till the arrival of the kits, all positive samples from the district would be sent for genome sequencing.Dr Meena Mishra, professor and head of the department of microbiology, AIIMS Nagpur, said the available RT-PCR kits can only tell whether the sample is positive for Covid-19 or not. “For the Omicron variant, though the specific diagnosis is done by genomic sequencing, provisional diagnosis can be done by using ‘S’ gene kit. In the new mutation, the ‘S’ gene is missing. So, we need a kit which can detect the ‘S’ gene dropout in the positive sample,” said Dr Mishra.“As the time required for the results of genomic sequencing is more, this provisional diagnosis could help in detection of Omicron early, thereby aiding in timely intervention. Though the cost of the kit is high at present, it may go down as the demand increases,” she said.Officials sources informed that the kits would be available only to GMCH and IGGMCH initially. “The administration will issue guidelines and accordingly the kits would be distributed. Samples of only high-risk individuals having international travel history will be tested using the new kits in case they test positive after reaching the city. Those RT-PCR positive samples failing in ‘S’ gene target will be treated as suspected Omicron patients and their samples would be immediately sent for genome sequencing,” said the sources.During the meeting, the VRDL in-charge officials were also asked if they would process the private lab samples. Meanwhile, Nagpur Municipal Corporation has started testing flyers arriving on Sharjah-Nagpur flight and even those foreign travellers entering through other Indian cities. A private lab is conducting the RT-PCR test of the flyers. The lab too doesn’t have the SGTF kits. Samples of three flyers who have tested positive will be sent to genome sequencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-procuring-1000-sgtf-kits-for-omicron-surveillance/articleshow/88130877.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The government will extend full support to KPGC in opening new professional courses, said deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma during the 48th foundation day celebration of the institute on Monday. “In 2019, chief minister Yogi Adityanath inaugurated the new building on the college campus. I am happy that the classes of science faculty will shortly begin in the new building,” said the Dy CM, the chief guest. He said new professional courses like nursing and paramedical, if launched, could offer good job prospects to students. The government will provide full support to the college in this initiative. All colleges should upgrade their courses as per the need of the industry and at the same time should work towards teaching and promoting Sanskrit language, he added. Uttar Pradesh Basic Education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi, who was the special guest on the occasion, expressed thanks to a former student and veteran BJP leader late Lalji Tandon for the development and growth of the college over the years. State urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon, who was also present during the celebration, congratulated the college on its foundation day and said, “The college should continue imparting quality education and aim at touching new heights by offering multidisciplinary courses.” Illustrious alumni like the renowned author Amritlal Nagar and Babushyam Sunder Das, noted historian Prof BN Puri and others were remembered during the celebrations, which saw cultural dance, music and play performances by the students. Newly-appointed principal Chandra Mohan Upadhyay said, “We are already a NAAC ‘A’ grade institute now we will work harder to make Kalicharan figure in the top 10 colleges of the country."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/start-job-oriented-courses-dy-cm-exhorts-kalicharan-college/articleshow/88132402.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While city police claim that the civic body was asked to remove the signboards specifying the parking lots, stakeholders of the project claimed that on-street paid parking was not abandoned, but was only temporarily withdrawn in view of the pandemic.Trichy Corporation introduced on-street paid parking in Thillai Nagar Main Road in December 2020. Two-wheelers were charged Rs5 per hour, while cars were charged Rs20. Signboards, CCTV cameras and parking lanes were established on Thillai Nagar Main Road. Meanwhile, without any public notice the corporation withdrew the initiative in July. However, the parking zone, signboards and CCTV cameras are still intact in the commercial street. But residents say that city traffic police have started slapping fines on them for parking their vehicles in the designated parking area.“I parked my car in the paid parking zone, but traffic police were stringent and collected a penalty. Parking boards were not erected,” A R Yoagendran, a resident, said. Residents alleged that the collection of penalties was unfair when the ‘paid parking’ signboards were there.“We have asked the local body officials to remove the parking signboards,” a source with the traffic police said. But this claim was contradicted by a stakeholder. “We will resume parking fee collection on the Thillai Nagar Main Road from January 2022, as we have permission. Supervisors will be appointed to streamline parking,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-residents-in-a-fix-over-status-of-on-street-parking/articleshow/88132397.cms||Deepak Karthik

The man was admitted to a hospital where he underwent 25 stitches in his head. Police said that Anwar of Hata Rasool Khan along with his wife was returning home on a bike. Around 11.45 pm, when the couple passed via the Chitwapur crossing, a group of youth forcibly got Anwar to stop the bike.  They asked his name and the place which he had visited that night. The group later started abusing the couple and even abused Anwar’s wife. “We do not know why they stopped us and interrogated us. After asking where we are coming from, they started abusing us. I opposed their act, asking them not to abuse her," he said in his FIR to the police.  Anwar said the youths flew in rage and attacked me with some sharp-edged weapon on the head. “I began to bleed profusely, and we cried for help.

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Flyover to facilitate elephant movement||COIMBATORE: In a first, the national highways (NH-181 – Chinthamanipudur – Coonoor) wing of the state highways department is planning to build a 2.4km flyover through a reserve forest, from Kallar to the IInd hairpin bend of Mettupalayam – Coonoor Road, to protect wild animals including elephants. Madurai-based COS Consultancy Services has been roped in to conduct feasibility study for the Rs 200 crore structure and a detailed project report (DRP) will be prepared soon, an official told TOI. “Feasible study for the 12-metre-wide flyover will begin at Kallar on December 15. DRP will be submitted to the national highways wing before June,” he said. “It will be designed to be environment-friendly.” The World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature - India has been conducting studies at the Kallar elephant corridor since 2007. The corridor, on the busy Mettupalayam – Coonoor Road, is used by animals including elephants, leopards, deer, sloth bears and gaurs. With more than 8,500 vehicles passing through the stretch daily, animals are forced to cross the road, risking their lives or find alternative routes through populated areas, resulting in human-animal conflicts. Chief conservator of forests of Coimbatore circle and field director of Anaimalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) S Ramasubramanian said the forest department has adopted several measures to protect the corridor. “We welcome the plan to construct the flyover and hope the ministry of environment and forests will clear the project soon,” he said. D Boominathan, landscape co-ordinator of WWF-India in Coimbatore, said the corridor is a crucial link between two major elephant habitats of Coimbatore, Attapadi, Palakkad- Mannarkad and Silent Valley in the south, and Sathyamangalam, Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and Erode forest division in the north. “The narrow habitat between Bhavanisagar and Kallar, where elephant movement occurs along the southeastern slopes of Nilgiris, has several bottlenecks. Among these, the national highway at Kallar is the most critical barrier for movement of elephants.” “The flyover would ensure free and safe movement of animals, especially for long-ranging species like elephants that migrate seasonally for food, water and socialising,” Boominathan added. In 2014, former Coimbatore collector Archana Patnaik and forest department officials had visited Kallar to discuss the plan to construct an overpass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/flyover-to-facilitate-elephant-movement/articleshow/88131623.cms||A Subburaj

In his complaint to the police and HR&CE department, the priest, M Mahesh Kumar, a native of Dharapuram in Tirupur district, claimed that a temple security guard, also his neighbour, hurled casteist slur and threatened him to leave the job.Kumar said that the security guard M Varadhan on November 22 threatened him to stop interacting with a family, with whom the latter had a tiff. “I lodged a complaint with the HR&CE. On December 5, Varadhan in an inebriated state threatened me to withdraw the complaint. He insisted me to leave the priest job as I belong to the scheduled caste,” Kumar told TOI. Kumar added that Varadhan used slur words referring to the community of the priest. Alleging that there is a threat to his and his family’s lives, Kumar lodged a complaint with the Samayapuram police on Sunday night. Meanwhile, HR&CE officials said that an inquiry by a joint commissioner was ordered into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/temple-priest-31-alleges-threat-caste-discrimination/articleshow/88132401.cms||---

MLA Suchi Chaudhary sat in agitation against the UP irrigation department, which was responsible for its construction, and alleged corruption. The department made a counter allegation and said that the road was "deliberately damaged using a spade." Talking to TOI, state cabinet minister (jal shakti) Mahendra Singh, said, "Two engineers, including the assistant engineer and junior engineer, have been suspended for dereliction of duty. In addition, a show-cause notice has been served to the executive engineer for the road construction in Bijnor. A committee has been set up to probe the matter thoroughly. The road will be reconstructed." Bijnor's district magistrate Umesh Mishra said, "We are yet to receive an official letter of suspension of any officer." The UP irrigation department has been at loggerheads with the MLA over the coconut issue. Bijnor MLA Suchi Chaudhary alleged that low-quality material was being used on the road in Haldaur because of which it "broke when the coconut struck the ground." Chaudhary has levelled corruption charges against the contractor and officers of the irrigation department. In a letter to the DM of Bijnor, the executive engineer of the department said, "This was the restructuring of an old and damaged road. Only initial-level laying had been conducted. The real work was yet to begin. The MLA was invited to inaugurate the same. The allegation that the coconut broke the road is false. A spade was used to scrape off the road portion."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-engineers-suspended-1-served-notice-over-coconut-breaking-incident/articleshow/88130890.cms||Harveer Dabas

As the DEO apologised to the court, Justice Battu Devanand directed him to serve food with his own expenses at an old-age home or an orphanage of his choice. The court further directed to submit details of his compliance with the court’s order. One P Venkata Raman, a secondary grade teacher, had moved the high court in 2019 seeking directions to the education department to give him notional seniority. Though the court disposed the petition in his favour, the orders were not implemented, following which he moved a contempt petition against the officials concerned. The principal secretary for school education B Rajasekhar, commissioner of school education V Chinaveerabhadrudu, and Anantapur DEO K Samuel appeared before the court on Monday. While the court was satisfied with the explanations given by Rajasekhar and Chinaveerabhadrudu, it found Samuel responsible for not implementing its orders. As Samuel agreed to do social work, the court closed the contempt petition. While disposing the contempt petition, Justice Devanand expressed displeasure that officials were not complying with the court’s orders. “Wilful disobedience of court orders is not only insulting the high court but also depriving justice to the litigants. Many institutions have lost their credibility because of this kind of attitude of officials,” he said, and suggested not to bring such bad reputation to the courts also. He also directed advocate general S Sriram to give instructions to officials to ensure court orders are complied in letter and spirit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-orders-a-weeks-social-work-for-deo-in-contempt-case/articleshow/88130897.cms||Srikanth Aluri

This campaign started after such a demand emerged in 2015.The postcard campaign is part of the one lakh letters to chief minister campaign, which was started in Athani taluk two months back, and is now being conducted across the taluk. Over 7,000 letters have already been sent to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai in this regard.The demand for carving out a separate district of Athani emerged in 2015, and was put forth by the Athani Jilla Horata Samiti, which was supported by Kannada literatteurs, writers, advocates, activists and social outfits. Initially, the forum carried out a campaign to get 5 lakh signatures of people from across Athani, to carve out a separate district. The Horata Samiti activists and residents visited villages in Athani for this signature campaign, and managed to get the signatures of 3 lakh people.However, despite approaching people’s representatives and MLAs of Athani, their demand was not met, and so the campaign was continued. However, the campaign was paused due to bypolls and the Covid-19 crisis. Now, the campaign has been commenced again, said Horata Samti members.Speaking to TOI, Prashanth Todakar, the president of Athani Jilla Horata Samiti, said that they were receiving step-motherly treatment from different governments. “Despite Chikkodi and other taluks having a large population, in case any work needs to get done at the district level, to avail benefits and for medical treatment, people here need to travel 200 km. The poor villagers from Kottalagi have been struggling to go to the BIMS hospital in Belagavi,” he said.“To solve these issues, we are staging this campaign. A Jilla Horata Samiti delegation will meet Kudachi MLA P Rajeev to put forth our demand. The Horata Samiti will meet the chief minister to discuss this issue in the winter session in Belagavi,” he said.Farmer Ramoji Jadav from Kottalagi village, said that he had to go to Belagavi to ask about flood compensation, as his name was not on the list. “I felt bad as I spent over Rs 5,000 to get Rs 20,000. The bus fare was a burden, and I had to travel over 400 km. I had to stay in Belagavi for some time to finish my work. Hence, I support the campaign to make Athani a district. Recently, advocates have also boycotted work for the same reason.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/athani-residents-launch-postcard-campaign-demanding-separate-dist/articleshow/88130089.cms||---

Divided into three stages, the discounts will be available only on online deposits to promote digitisation. The corporation also hopes that the scheme will help it cover more properties, generating an additional estimated revenue of Rs 100 crore. “In the first stage, all property tax payers can avail the benefit of 100% interest and penalty waivers, and 15% discount on the principal amount,” said Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairman. In the second stage, 75% waiver on interest and 100% on penalty will be given on the payment of the tax by February 28. In the third stage, 50% waiver on interest and 100% waiver on penalty will be given if the tax is paid by March 31. Assistance will be provided in the zonal offices for online payment. The corporation will also set up five special counters at the corporation headquarters in Civic Centre. However, Jain said, the benefits will not be extended to the properties falling in Lal Dora, extended Lal Dora, extended abadi areas of village and 544 unauthorised regularised and unauthorised colonies as an amnesty scheme is already in force for them.

Jumping four spots, the AAU has been placed 20th in the 2020 national rankings released recently by ICAR’s education division. In 2019, the state-funded AAU had bettered its position by jumping 13 notches to be ranked among top 25 agriculture universities of the country at 24th position. The AAU achieved the best ranking among Gujarat universities. ICAR is the apex body for coordinating, guiding and managing research and education in the field of agriculture including horticulture, fisheries and animal sciences. “Our team has ensured that we keep on improving when it comes to taking new technologies to the doorsteps of farmers as part of our extension activities or providing better exposure to our students and scientists. There are various parameters on which these rankings are done. And we have scope to still improve our own performance,” said AAU vice-chancellor Dr K B Kathiria. The national rankings covered 67 agriculture, veterinary, animal sciences, horticulture, fisheries and ocean studies universities across the country. For other universities in the state the rankings have come as a mixed bag. The Navsari Agricultural University (NAU), for instance, has jumped to 31st rank, up from the 42nd spot it had bagged in 2019. But its performance is still dismal compared to 2018, when it was ranked 14th. Performance of both Junagadh Agricultural University (JAU) and Sardar Krushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University (SKDAU) at Sardarkrushinagar however slipped further. JAU which had slipped to 30th rank in 2019 from 20th in 2018, has this time been ranked at 40th position. Similarly, SKDAU which had slightly improved its performance from 46 in 2018 to 45 in 2019 has been ranked at 60th position now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/aau-jumps-four-spots-finishes-among-top-20-in-natl-ranking/articleshow/88131654.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Delhi||Delhi high court ultimatum on installing CCTVs at Chandni Chowk||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday ordered the city’s police commissioner to ensure steps to install CCTV cameras at key points in Chandni Chowk, failing which he shall remain present before it on February 28. “It is not dawning on you that there is delay. What steps have you taken since the last date on installing CCTVs? Have you taken even a simple step? Not lifted even your little finger till now,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jastmeet Singh observed. “We have issued repeated directions, it is falling on deaf ears. We are compelled to pass such orders since nothing is happening. After this order, now even these officers will wake up,” the bench told the counsel for Delhi Police when he urged the court not to summon the police chief. The HC’s deadline came while hearing a plea by Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal seeking direction to the authorities to install CCTVs and remove illegal hawkers and vendors from the no-hawking zone in Chandni Chowk, which has recently undergone redevelopment. Anybody encroaching upon public space must be removed and it cannot be permitted that the whole pavements in markets are encroached leaving no space for people to walk, the court said, asking the municipal corporation to prepare a street vending plan “for god’s sake”. “Our directions are very clear. We are not asking you to carve out any exception for the members of the petitioner association. You (North MCD) are not understanding the problem. If you take up a (street vending) plan, this situation can be defused. So first set the ball rolling and formulate a plan,” the bench said. “The whole pavement is covered with encroachers, making it impossible for people to walk. Please, please for God’s sake, do the planning and do not make communications at the last moment,” the bench remarked, adding that “all of you are making a complete mess on this law”. It also directed that experts be nominated from Shahjanabad Redevelopment Corporation, Delhi School of Planning and IIT Delhi “immediately” without any delay in the matter relating to preparation of the street vending plan. The court had earlier observed that there was no executive or political will to remove illegal hawkers and vendors from streets and barring Lutyens’ Delhi, there was no place in the city which was clear from unauthorised squatters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-ultimatum-on-installing-cctvs-at-chandni-chowk/articleshow/88132423.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Meerut||17 girls sedated, molested by school owner, aide in UP||MEERUT: Police have booked the owner of a school, along with the principal of another, under relevant sections of the IPC and Pocso Act, for allegedly sedating and molesting 17 girls studying in class 10. All of them are minors. The incident took place on November 18 in Muzaffarnagar after the girls were asked to stay the night under the pretext of "practical exams" that were to be held in another school in the same area. Though the girls told their parents about the incident a day after the assault, it took the police 16 days to book the two men. A local MLA had to intervene to get an FIR lodged. Police are investigating the role of cops who were allegedly trying to hush up the case. An SHO has already been suspended. The school owner was arrested on Monday. According to police, the principal had told parents that their wards would have to stay back in the other school overnight to take two back-to-back practical exams. "We were told that it would be very time-consuming for the girls to travel to and fro the same day," the father of a schoolgirl told TOI on Monday. Parents said that they sent their daughters in "good faith" despite there being no female supervisors. “We were not too worried about them as they were in a large group of almost 20. We thought they could take care of themselvestogether,” said the parent of another schoolgirl. "We later found out that the principal did not ask the male students to stay back. There were 14 boys in the same class." The school has over 250 students. It was in the other school, some distance away, that the girls were allegedly sedated and molested in the night by the two men. One of the girls, 16, told TOI that she was given ‘khichadi’ to eat, after which she became unconscious. Another said that when she woke up in the morning she found one of her friends crying in the washroom. "She told me something bad had happened to her in the night. A few others said they could feel something was not right with their bodies.” Parents alleged that they kept making rounds of the police station to get an FIR lodged but the police did not register their complaint until the local MLA from Purqazi, Pramod Utwal, intervened. Utwal said he learned about the incident on Friday after a few families asked for his help. "I immediately called up the circle officer and also requested the assistant superintendent of police to intervene in the matter," he said. "The school had asked only the girls to stay back for the practical exams while the boys were let off. It is shocking what happened." SSP (Muzaffarnagar) Abhishek Yadav said a probe has begun. "We have suspended the station house officer of the Purkazi police station for negligence on duty. We have booked the two accused under section 328 (causing hurt by poison), 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman), 506 (criminal intimidation), and relevant sections of the Pocso Act. Statements are being recorded.” He added that five teams of the police, crime branch and SOG are involved in the case.

Chimmanakatti, who had sacrificed the Badami constituency for Siddaramaiah in the 2018 assembly election, began his speech by questioning why Siddaramaiah had come to Badami while avoiding Varuna and Chamundi. He continued, without mentioning Siddaramaiah's name, "You have two constituencies to contest, whereas I have no other option than Badami."Chimmanakatti's followers responded to him with the meme 'Howdu Huliya.' "Yes, I was a 'Huli' (toger), but now I am an 'Ili' (rat). If you (the people) want, I can become a minister or even the Prime Minister," Chimmanakatti said.At this time, supporters of Siddaramaiah and Chimmanakatti were heard shouting slogans in their support. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, some Congress leaders urged Chimmanakatti to end his speech and even turned off the microphone for a few moments. Siddaramaiah, former ministers MB Patil and HY Meti, and others on the dais sat as mute spectators.Meanwhile, former minister SR Patil, who has missed the MLC ticket, did not attend the campaign meeting led by Siddaramaiah. Patil has been elected four times in a row from the Vijayapura-Bagalkot local authorities constituency, but the party has denied him a ticket this time. Later, speaking to reporters, Siddaramaiah stated that he had no role in Patil being denied the ticket. "In fact, Patil had stated that he would contest again if the party fielded only him for the two-seat constituency. However, the high command decided to field two candidates," he claimed.On the talks doing rounds about the change of chief minister in the state, Siddaramaiah said he has no clue about it. “We know that BJP has two groups and Yediyurappa was sacked from the CM’s post,” he added.When asked about HD Kumaraswamy’s statement on the impact of JD(S) in the MLC elections, he said he would not comment on the party which exists just in 4-5 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/siddaramaiah-faces-awkward-moments-at-campaign-meeting-in-badami/articleshow/88130104.cms||---

A statement from the Southern Railway on Monday said that the 23rd meeting of the DRUCC of Salem division which was scheduled for December 10 stands postponed as a precautionary measure in view of the pandemic. The meeting is conducted thrice a year for the users to raise several pertinent demands such as new train services, passengers’ amenities, station development and infrastructure requirements for the western region. But there has not been any meeting convened since January 2020.“It is disappointing to note that the Salem division of Southern Railway did not organize even a single meeting in the last two years when people have adopted different methods in conducting meetings in the pandemic situation. This has affected the train users,” P Rajendran, a DRUCC member, said.“We have been stressing for the commencement of regular Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) train service from Mettupalayam to Coimbatore five trips a day. At present, the train makes only one trip a day. A MEMU circular train service in Coimbatore city which will reduce the traffic on road and complement the Metro train was proposed six years back. We wanted to recall the proposal as it is the need of the hour for Coimbatore,” he said.K Jayaraj, another member of DRUCC, sought restoration of trains from Coimbatore to Dhanushkodi and Tuticorin besides the need for Salem-Arakkonam MEMU service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/railway-postpones-users-meeting/articleshow/88131642.cms||---

High emissions and discharge of chemicals in the river pose threat to the lives of residents of Chandrapur, reads the complaint. Bele also claimed many people have suffered from different ailment following the discharge of chemicals into the river. MPCB office here had tested the samples of such polluted water and found it to be dangerous for human life, he said. Bele pointed out that all the evidences of life threatening discharge and excessive emissions are available with the MPCB regional office here. In fact, the MPCB had served latest show-cause notice to the CSTPS on November 26, seeking explanation about high pollution from the plant, he has stated. “Despite repeated reminders and show-cause notices by MPCB, the power plant administration appears to be taking no measures to curb the pollution or following the instructions by the board. The apathy of the power plant management has endangered the lives of people, hence criminal offence should be registered against the plant management,” Bele demanded. He has sought offence under sections 15, 16 and 17 of Water and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Acts, as well as sections 166, 269 and 270 of IPC against the plant managers. Ramnagar police station officer Vishal Mule confirmed the receipt of the complaint and maintained that offence could be registered if they find any substance in the allegations during the investigation. Guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar too underlined the need for curbing high pollution in Chandrapur on Monday. Interacting with reporters, he claimed that industries responsible for pollution need to shell out their CSR funds for measures to curb the pollution. The minister claimed that MPCB has been told to take stringent action against polluting industries. Wadettiwar also emphasized on the need for having a concrete action plan against pollution and that he would hold a special meeting on the issue in coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngo-files-plaint-against-cstps-for-endangering-lives/articleshow/88131634.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Lucknow||HC stays SIC order forPIO in private schools||Lucknow: The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court has stayed an order of the State Information Commission (SIC) whereby it had directed the UP chief secretary to ensure appointment of a public information officer (PIO) in all schools and institutions that are covered under the Right to Education Act 2009 in Uttar Pradesh. A division bench of Justice Rakesh Srivastava and Justice Shamim Ahmad passed the order on a writ petition filed by the Association of Private Schools of Uttar Pradesh. The bench considered an earlier order passed in relation to a similar controversy in which the HC had granted relief to the City Montessori School. Reiterating its earlier order, the bench termed the SIC’s order as ‘bad’ and said that it acted beyond its authority in exercise of powers under original jurisdiction. “This order will not absolve the educational institutions of their obligation, if any, under the RE Act 2009 nor does it absolve them from providing requisite information in this regard to any officer of the state/public authority which it is otherwise obliged to provide in law,” said the bench. The petitioner had challenged an order passed by the SIC which, while hearing a complaint moved by an RTI activist Sanjay Sharma before it, directed the chief secretary to ensure appointment of PIO in each institution which are covered under the RE Act 2009. Filing the petition before the HC, the petitioner had pleaded that the SIC’s order was beyond jurisdiction. “The schools which are part of the petitioner/association do not fall within the definition of public authority and no such direction could be issued to the state’s chief secretary for appointing the PIO in private institutions as has been ordered,” the petitioner said. Passing the interim order in favour of the petitioner, the bench, however, clarified that the complaint of respondent Sanjay Sharma would still be alive and open for the SIC to proceed on it in accordance with law. The bench has also issued notice to the complainant. Welcoming the order, president of the Association of Private Schools, Atul Srivastava, said: “Since private schools are self-financed and don’t take any funds from the government, they are not covered under the RTI Act. Our autonomy should be secured.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-stays-sic-order-forpio-in-private-schools/articleshow/88132417.cms||---

It is not usual for a taluk level hospital to do such a major surgery, which would cost around Rs 3-4 lakh in private hospitals.The girl was diagnosed with pancreatic divisum – a congenital anomaly of the pancreatic duct.Chief medical officer of Mettupalayam GH Dr Kannan and chief paediatric surgeon from SGK hospital Dr Vijayagiri, who is a visiting doctor at the GH, formed a team of 15 doctors to perform the surgery. Dr Anand Bharathan, a specialist in pancreatico biliary surgery from Sri Ramakrishna Hospital, Coimbatore, also joined the team.The operation lasted for over 4 hours where the damaged pancreatic head was cored out and a slender malformed pancreatic duct was laid open. About 15 stones were retrieved and drainage procedure was carried out. There was no blood loss during the procedure and the child is recovering well, doctors who performed the surgery said.“Pancreas is a single organ with a single major ductal system. In this condition, the child has pancreas as two different parts and separate draining ducts,” Dr Vijayagiri said.The major duct is not well developed with obstruction at its orifice and resulting in poor drainage of pancreatic juices into the intestines. Gradually, the pancreatic head was damaged, and the duct got filled up with stones, a condition called chronic calculous pancreatitis. Dr Kannan said that they were able to perform the surgery in a taluk level government hospital which is not usual. “Such operations are usually performed in medical college hospitals and big private hospitals which cost around Rs 3-4 lakh. Here the surgery was done free of cost under the chief minister health insurance scheme,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mettupalayam-govt-hosp-performs-major-pancreatic-surgery/articleshow/88131631.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Demand for extending college admissions||Aurangabad: As the admission process for engineering courses for the academic year 2021-22 is scheduled to last till December 16, a section of stakeholders has demanded extension for admissions to other degree courses for the benefit of students. In a memorandum submitted to state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant, NCP MLC Satish Chavan has sought admission for other degree courses till December 20. “Candidates who do not get engineering seat of their choice often turn to other courses. As the admission process for such other courses is already closed for many state universities, candidates could face academic loss,” he said. The ongoing extended strike of MSRTC staffers has also been cited as another reason for extending admissions to different courses. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) had declared November 30 as the last date for admissions while Swami Ramanand Teerth Marahtwada University (SRTMU) in Nanded, another state university from the region, carried out admission much earlier by September 11. SRTMU public relations officer Ashok Kadam said the university would ensure no academic loss to any students. “If students as well as colleges demand more time for carrying out admissions, the university will consider the demand,” he said, adding that a section of student unions has already pressed for such demand. Meanwhile, Bamu authorities concerned could not be reached for their comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/demand-for-extending-college-admissions/articleshow/88130123.cms||---

Her age and identity are yet to be ascertained. Sanjay Sharma, SHO Kharkhoda police station, said, "It appears the girl was strangled a couple of days ago and has deep marks on her neck. She looked to be in her early 20s, and was found wearing jeans and a top. We have sent her photographs to different police stations in the neighbouring districts to find her identity." The trunk was found near Kali river next to a sugarcane field and was first noticed by farmers who called the police. This is the second such case in the past one week. A six-year-old girl was earlier found stuffed inside a trunk in a locked house in Hapur. She had been missing for two days.

The reason for this is the lack of government alertness, said senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala. The instances of rave parties being reported from various parts of the state proves this matter. The rave party that was busted in Poovar is only the tip of the iceberg. Since excise and police are conniving and not taking action, no significant steps are being taken against the drug mafia, he added. He also alleged that the death of two models in Kochi is an example of the deep-rooted drug mafia in state. Chennithala said there are also reports that several gambling dens were also functioning in Kerala and claimed that it is scary that police officers, who are supposed to take action against them, are part of such activities. All these show the lapses on the part of the home department ruled by the LDF government for the past five-and-a-half years, Chennithala said. He added that the government should wake up now and take strong action against the drug mafia that is eating up our society. He further demanded that the government should immediately register cases over the infant deaths in Attapadi. It is with selfish motives that the nodal officer was asked to stay away during the visit of the health minister to Attapadi. He said that the minister was in a hurry to visit Attapadi before the UDF team visited the places in Attapadi where infant deaths were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-not-vigilant-against-drug-mafia-chennithala/articleshow/88131669.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Later in the night, the Bharati Vidyapeeth police arrested Mehboob Balurgi, a childhood friend-turned-foe of victim Sameer Manur Shaikh (28), and his accomplice and also established the role of two other men in the murder. The police questioned Balurgi and his accomplice for establishing the whereabouts of the other two suspects, besides recovery of the firearm. The police said Sameer was into construction and building material supplies and associated with a political party. He was also fond of wearing gold ornaments, the police added. “The assailants fired eight rounds, of which six were from close range at Manur’s head, shoulder and back. He was sitting on his bike in front of the eatery and slumped to his death,” said senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Bharati Vidyapeeth police. “I was sitting inside my restaurant when I heard loud sounds. I thought that many people have fitted modified silencers to their bikes which sound like firecrackers. Soon, there was commotion and traffic jam outside and I rushed out to check what had happened. I saw a man lying motionless on a motorcycle,” said a local restaurant owner. The two assailants fled on a scooter, but the police later managed to detain Balurgi — from whom Sameer had taken Rs5 lakh. Sameer had returned Rs2.5 lakh to Balurgi. Later in the evening, the police detained Balurgi’s aide. Manur Shaikh, the victim’s father, told TOI, “Sameer married over one-and-a-half years ago and his son is five-month old. We moved to Pune from Gulbarga, Karnataka, in 1987. I have seen Balurgi grow up with Sameer as classmates in the same school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-fire-8-rounds-in-morning-kill-small-time-builder-in-katraj-area/articleshow/88131657.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Visakhapatnam||Blame loose soil for Vizag coastal erosion: Expert||VISAKHAPATNAM: The coastal erosion at the children’s park close to the coastal battery area is attributed to loose soil as there is no natural sediments. Severe cyclonic storms associated with new moon time caused wave heights to increase and cause erosion, former head of meteorology and oceanography wing of Andhra University, professor KVSR Prasad, said. He submitted a report on beach erosion in 2014 to the district administration and Vizag port following the erosion at submarine museum area. He said erosion is common during the southeast monsoon and it was visible at north of Ramakrishna beach and submarine museum area many times. Erosion in the northeast monsoon period is unusual but it has taken place now. Erosion at coastal battery area was reported previously. “It is not natural sediment but loose soil. It was filled after erosion, unconsolidated, and developed as a park”, the professor said. Apart from this, a few development activities are taking place at south of coastal battery which will also increase erosion. The port management has been undertaking beach nourishment activity after 2014 erosion. But this year, it could not take up the activity, he said and added continuous sand pumping may stop erosion. The erosion of the Vizag shoreline started way back in 1993 when island breakwater was constructed for the development of inner harbour. The littoral drift during the southwest monsoon got deposited near the entrance channel and the northern beaches were partially cut off from the sand supply. Earlier, the erosion was not significant and was confined only to a short distance northward from the entrance channel. Professor Prasad said erosion of the shoreline north of the entrance channel near the present coastal battery was so alarming in 1962. A sea wall was constructed but it provided only temporary relief.

An MSRTC official said this was the third depot from where buses, though a handful few, have started operations adding that they were not sure if these buses would continue tomorrow (on Tuesday) as well. In the past too several buses started from Nashik-1 depot in Nashik city, but from the next day the MSRTC drivers and conductors failed to get back to work. “We have three buses rolling out from Pimgalgaon depot for the first time during the strike period. The buses carried intra-district passengers to various locations. This is a good sign and we hope that the things improve further,” a senior officer from the Nashik division of MSRTC said. This is the third depot after Sinnar and Lasalgaon from where two and five buses respectively have been plying within Nashik district during the past several days. The official also pointed out that there were number of bus drivers and conductors who were ready to resume their services, but were scared of being targeted by their colleagues who are protesting. “We have little role in this as they were already in talks with the people not to target the ones who have resumed duty. We, however, have transferred as many as 20 employees from their regular appointments to other areas and depots,” he said. “With this we have now transferred a total of 45 employees from their regular offices. Many of these are the ones who have been instigating the employees. Hence, the action was taken,” he added. The state transport utility has suspended eight more people — taking the total number of suspensions till date to 457. There are in all 5,290 employees in Nashik division and the action of suspension was carried as per the government orders as these people failed to get back to work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-3-st-buses-roll-out-from-pimpalgaon-depot/articleshow/88130120.cms||---

One of them is currently lodged in jail. A bitter family rivalry is said to be the reason for the attack. Yunus, the prime target in the shootout who managed to escape, alleged, “This is the handiwork of Anas Aleem who is in jail for murdering his father and my brother, former BSP MLA Aleem. He, along with his three brothers, Danish, Zaid and Asad, are involved in this attempt on my life.” Around 40 bullets were fired at the vehicle carrying Yunus and his supporters in Bulandshahr on Sunday. Five of them were hit and one died. The ferociousness of Sunday’s attack speaks volumes about the bitter family rivalry whose genesis goes back to the day in October, 2018, when two-time BSP heavyweight Aleem's body was found in his bedroom with a bullet wound in the head. Initially the case was handled by local police, who closed it as death by suicide. Yunus, who had lodged the complaint, was dissatisfied with the "shoddy investigation". He again filed a complaint with the UP government. In 2019, the case was transferred to the Meerut unit of the CBCID, which arrested Anas Aleem from Meerut in March 2020. Anas Aleem, who was sent to jail, has maintained that his uncle framed him in order to grab the business and properties of his father. He had moved court when police had shut the case as suicide. Anas and his brother, Danish, are also accused in the murder of Rehana, second wife of the former legislator in 2013. According to police sources, Aleem had married five times. He had five sons from his first wife, Kamar Jahan, including Danish and Anas. Aleem later married Rehana, who won his confidence and began handling his businesses much to the chagrin of his sons from the first wife, particularly, Danish and Anas. The two allegedly killed Rehana in Delhi in 2013, and were arrested and sent to jail, However, they managed to get bail the same year. Aleem, meanwhile, married again. His last marriage was with Farha in 2017. She bore him a son to whom Aleem had decided to bequeath his property. Anas learnt about this from Aleem's guard, Shariq. Later, Anas, Shariq and Aleem’s driver planned to eliminate Aleem. On October 9, 2018, during his brief halt at his Bulandshahr residence on the way to Delhi from Aligarh, Aleem was allegedly shot dead by Shariq on the orders of Anas. Two bullets were fired, one of which hit Aleem on the temple, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/family-feud-behind-bulandshahr-shootout-16-booked/articleshow/88130930.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Spider that shuns web discovered in Melghat Tiger Reserve||NAGPUR: The Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), known for its riverine ecosystem and tigers, is also home to rare species of spiders. A team of experts has discovered a new species of spider called lynx spider (oxyopes kolkhasensis) in the MTR. The new species was discovered by a team consisting of Atul Bodkhe, associate professor with JD Patil Sangludkar Mahavidyala, Daryapur, Irina Das Sarkar, and Virendra Prasad Uniyal from Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun. Bodkhe said the new species closely resembles oxyopes bharatae Gajbe discovered in 1999, but it is taxonomically distinguished from it. Lynx spiders are a fairly small family hosting 9 genera and 442 species. It preys on insects in grassy vegetation. These small to large sized spiders are distinguished by three tarsal claws, prominent setae on legs, and four distinct rows of eyes and mainly inhabit panicles of plants, leaves of the grass, and on other weeds found along field margins. Bodkhe said the type genus oxyopes, established by French zoologist Pierre Andre Latreille in 1804, had its first Indian subcontinent species recorded by French scientist Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1805. The genus represents a diverse group with global distribution. Of the 290 recorded oxyopes species, 55 are recorded in India. The reported specimen was collected from Kolkas region of MTR by sweep netting method from a grassland vegetation patch near the government guest house close to the banks of Sipna river. “The new species would be recorded in the World Spider Catalog 2021 soon,” said Bodkhe. The arachnologist has also recorded a male ant spider species (tropizodium viridurbium) from Melghat for the first time in the country. Melghat is home to over 700 spider species.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/spider-that-shuns-web-discovered-in-melghat/articleshow/88131659.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

On Monday, all the four traffic units of the police started the counselling sessions for such helmet-less bikers in different parts of the city. Many of such bikers caught by the police pleaded to the traffic officers to take the fine and let them go. However, their requests did not seem to make any effect on the police personnel. Over the past few months, the city police under the guidance of CP Deepak Pandey are coming up with different schemes to make bikers get into the habit of using helmets. As part of the same, from Monday, the counselling sessions by the traffic personnel got underway for helmet-less bikers. At one of such counselling sessions in Nashik Road, the helmet-less bikers appeared frustrated and helpless at the same time when caught by the police. When PSI Balasaheb Sanap and PSI Dhanraj Patil asked the bikers why they were not wearing helmet, the common answer by most of them were that they forgot to wear it while leaving their house in haste.

Since Congress and NCP leaders have appealed to Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena to elect Jayashri, the widow of sitting MLA Chandrakant Jadhav who died recently, unopposed. Sena has larger stakes in the constituency. In 2019 assembly election, Chandrakant Jadhav had defeated Sena’s two-time MLA Rajesh Kshirsagar. As per the seat-sharing arrangement between Sena and BJP, the seat was allotted to Sena in assembly elections. The MVA is a post-poll alliance between Congress, NCP and Sena. Since after 2019 election, Congress won the seat, it has again claimed the seat and even declared the candidate. It has infuriated local Sena leaders as they were ignored from the process. Now, none of the Sena leaders are making any public commitment of supporting Congress candidate. Kshirsagar said, “The call to support the appeal made will be taken by our leader Uddhav Thackeray. Whatever decision he takes, we will abide by it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sena-yet-to-open-cards-on-bypoll/articleshow/88130141.cms||---

Business associations have written a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, urging her to defer the implementation of the new rates of GST.Harish Kairpal, president of Ludhiana MSME association, said, “The GST council has decided to hike the tax to 12% on woven fabrics of silk or silk waste, woven fabrics of wool or of animal hair, woven fabrics of cotton, woven fabrics of flax, several types of textile garments, all types of woven and knitted fabrics and knitted garments. As of now, 5% GST is applicable on all these items, but from January 1, 2022, the GST will be hiked by 7%. It will be a huge burden on the textile and garment industry. It will become impossible for micro, small and medium enterprises to do business. Therefore, we have sent a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman requesting her intervention in the matter and deferment of this decision by at least one year.”According to Narinder Mittal, general secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, “If the GST on textile and garment products and raw materials is hiked from 5% to 12%, it will not only make the garment costlier, but will also lead to another problem for us as we will have to infuse more capital in our business. In the present circumstances, when there is huge fund shortage and recession as well, this decision of increasing GST can prove fatal for small industries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-write-to-fm-to-defer-new-gst-rates-rollout/articleshow/88130939.cms||---

Cumulatively, they stole cash and jewellery totally worth at least Rs97,000 from one of the flats that they struck during their spree. The Bharati Vidyapeeth police said closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera footage that was recovered from the site showed the trio arriving in a hatchback car and committing the break-ins between 3am and 4am on Friday. Strangely, none of the neighbours heard any commotion, police said. Police sub inspector (PSI) Dhiraj Gupta of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said, “Based on the car’s registration number, the police established that it was stolen just a day prior to the latest crime from Nigdi. We are now searching for the three men. They targeted flats that were locked as their occupants had either gone to visit family, their native places or on a holiday.” He added, “The flat from where the trio managed to loot some booty from was occupied by an elderly woman. She had gone that day to her son’s house on Sinhagad Road. Her son, Milind Sathe (52), is the complainant in the case. The thieves did not find anything worth stealing from the other six flats.” Cops have cautioned the area to stay alert to such thefts, while also assuring that they will nab the suspects in the latest crime. The PSI further said, “The three men were armed with sophisticated equipment to break open the locks and doors of the flats. We managed to trace their movements till Katraj Chowk, and are tracking them further as well. Two of the housing societies also have watchmen, but they neither heard any noise nor saw the thieves moving around the society premises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/burglars-strike-at-3-flats-flee-with-valuables-worth-rs-97k/articleshow/88131673.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Rare treat excites bird watchers as latest count throws up 246 species||NEW DELHI: The region’s wetlands are cacophonous with bird calls. No wonder bird watchers in the capital have big smiles on their faces. At the Delhi Winter bird count held in the last week of November, the birders counted 246 species of resident and migratory birds, some of them unusual for the area. The annual voluntary event — a count and not a census, the organisers emphasise — determines the species density at the beginning of the winter when water birds and raptors begin to fly into the region from far north and central Asia. While the species sighted this year were fewer than the 256 spotted at the last count two years ago, bird experts actually described the list as “Impressive”, given that the migrants were still arriving and the final picture would be clear only by January-end. Of the 246 species spotted, around 100 were migratory, the rest resident. “These are reasonably good numbers,” exulted birder Kanwar B Singh, one of the organisers of the count. “For the recent count, there were 24 teams trudging through major habitats as well as unregistered or unnotified wetlands such as in Najafgarh, Wazirabad and Mangar.” There were some impressive sightings. “The Himalayan griffon, a vulture species, was one of the best sightings, I would say. We spotted an elegant juvenile flying over the Wazirabad-Yamuna khaddar region,” said birder Prasanna Gautam. “The bird breeds in the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau. Sighting of the species in this region is rare, the last time being around four years ago.” Noida-based Jaswinder Singh added, “The greater crested grebe and great bitterns were among the most notable sightings among water birds, being absolutely rare here.” Other bird-of-prey that arrive this season include the hen harrier, a sub-species of the Egyptian vulture, Steppe eagle, Imperial eagle, greater spotted eagle and the peregrine falcon. Among the resident terrestrial birds sighted were the black hooded oriole, jungle prinia, painted sandgrouse and the white bellied drongo. Birders also said that while they were elated by the presence of water birds, mostly migratory, they noticed that the health of some of the wetlands in Noida and greater Noida were degrading and needed attention. They also felt the need to protect the unnotified wetlands. “Some of the best sightings were at these unprotected sites, areas like Wazirabad, Yamuna Khadar, Mangar and Najafgarh,” revealed K B Singh. “These aren’t officially avian hotspots, but attract thousands of birds. It is thus important to protect these sites for the future of avifauna in Delhi-NCR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rare-treat-excites-bird-watchers-as-latest-count-throws-up-246-species/articleshow/88132432.cms||Kushagra Dixit

The accident occurred between 3.30am and 4.15am when the victim, Akshay Vinod Thakare, was returning to his flat on Senapati Bapat (SB) Road on his motorcycle. “Thakare was wearing a helmet, but the impact of the accident was severe and caused a fatal head injury,” an officer from the Hinjewadi police told TOI. “The possibility of very low visibility due to thick fog causing the accident cannot be ruled out,” said the officer. On Saturday night, Thakare had gone to his friend Umesh Chaudhari’s flat at Mahalunge and left for home around 3am. Chaudhari said that after half an hour, he and other friends tried contacting Thakare on his cellphone, but there was no response. “After some time, an unknown person answered the call. He told us that our friend met with an accident on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass near Vallonia society at Bavdhan and was no more,” said Chaudhari. Thakare’s friends immediately drove to the spot. “There was a thick layer of fog. I had a tough time driving the motorcycle to reach Bavdhan from Mahalunge,” Thakare’s friend told TOI. When they reached the spot, they saw Thakare lying unconscious on the road with his helmet a short distance away. “We then informed the police. The Hinjewadi police reached the spot and took Akshay to a hospital. He was pronounced dead by the doctors,” said Chaudhari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/28-year-old-techie-dies-in-hit-and-run/articleshow/88131682.cms||---

The Supreme Court had on Monday stayed an ordinance promulgated by Maharashtra government for granting 27% reservation to OBCs in the state’s local bodies. Former Union minister of state and national vice-president of BJP OBC front Hansraj Ahir, leading the agitation, blamed the state government for not gathering empirical data of OBCs as directed by the Supreme Court. “Maharashtra is only state in the country that doesn’t have data on other backward classes. Apex court had issued orders to gather the data in December 2019, but the Maha Vikas Aghadi government failed to comply with it in time,” he said. Ahir demanded immediate postponement of local bodies’ elections until the matter is resolved. He also rubbished the MPCC president Nana Patole’s allegation of central government not handing over the empirical data to the state and claimed power to execute the task lies with the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-blames-mva-for-failing-to-defend-obc-quota/articleshow/88149182.cms||Mazhar Ali

Ed students from Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University are waiting for their final year results, which were to be declared by October end. After five months of delay, B. Ed final year exams were finally held in mid October. In an effort to hasten the announcement of results, exam papers were made objective and optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets were used to record answers. The results, however, which were supposed to be declared within two weeks after the exams, have still not been announced. According to students, it has become a huge challenge for them to seek jobs or admissions for further studies, without receiving their results. “The checking of OMR sheets is a quick, mechanized process. The university administration’s lackadaisical approach is the only reason behind delay in declaration of results,” said Vimal Kumar, a B. Ed. final year student. The practical exams (of B. Ed final year students), which are normally conducted prior to theoretical exams, were conducted after theoretical exams this year. According to sources, the university administration has still not received marks obtained by students from 6 out of the 42 nodal centres where practical exams were held. Shubham Srivastava, a B.Ed final year student said, “First, there was a lot of delay in our exams, and now, the declaration of results is being delayed. We have been making rounds to the university office to obtain results. We will be staging a protest if the results are not out within the next 10 days.” Agra University Controller of examination RK Yadav said, “Some of the colleges have not sent the list of marks awarded to students in practical exams. We have asked them to provide it without any further delay so that we are able to declare B. Ed. Final year results in next one week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/30k-b-ed-final-year-students-await-results/articleshow/88130949.cms||Deepak Lavania

This is a significant development as many of the wada owners have been demanding redevelopment so that the structures can be put to proper use. There have been several cases where these wadas, many of which are in delapilated conditions, had collapsed during the monsoon season. However, NMC officials have clarified that the redevelopment can be done at the plinth height of 0.45 metre above the red floodline level and all such structures must be authorized ones with proper building plan permission and the building completion certificates. NMC officials said there are hundreds of old wadas in gaothan areas in the red floodline on both the banks of the river Godavari. “We have already received a few proposals,” they said. They added that the area in the blue floodline will be a prohibited zone for any construction, except parking, open vegetable market, garden, lawns, open space, cremation and burial ground, sewage treatment plants, drainage pipelines. “There had been several issues of old wadas in gaothan areas located in the floodlines. The re-development of old wadas was affected due to lack of permission,” said Nilesh Chavan, architect and project management consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nod-soon-for-redevelopment-of-old-wadas-in-red-floodline/articleshow/88130164.cms||Tushar Pawar

Altogether 50 international standard shows will be held at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and the entry will be free for all. The shows will begin from January 5. In a press conference, Kejriwal stated: “A majestic play is being prepared on his life on a very large scale. The programme consisting of 50 shows will be held in a grand manner. The musical play will be based on his life, his thoughts, his ideas and ideology and will have the most famous artists and experts take part in it. A hundred feet stage is being prepared along with a production of international standards. The entry will be free to all so that each and every child can watch the show and seek inspiration from his life. We are perhaps the first nation in the whole world that is trying to extend the reach of Babasaheb’s legacy in such a manner.” Kejriwal said Dr Ambedkar had dreamt that every student should get the best possible level of education without having to struggle for it. “I have now taken a vow that I will fulfil his dream. It has been 70 years and still the poor of this country are unable to get quality education,” the CM stated, adding that Ambedkar was the architect of our constitution. “He spent his whole life fighting for the oppressed and especially the Dalit community and did his best to uplift them. I have never heard or read about anyone who had devoted themselves to education more than he did. He had a master’s qualification in 64 subjects. For us, it is even tedious to get one master’s degree, he had 64 along with two doctorates. He did one doctorate from America, one from England. And that too when he came from a very underprivileged background,” Kejriwal stated. Delhi government is already running Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana to help the underprivileged students get quality education. Under this scheme, meritorious students belonging to SC/ST/OBC and EWS categories receive free coaching from private institutes for competitive exams such as JEE, NEET, CLAT, civil services, banking, railways, SSC among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-organise-a-series-of-plays-to-celebrate-ambedkar/articleshow/88132448.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Surat||Surat: From makeshift shed to modern airport||SURAT: Today the Surat international airport sprawls over 784.37 acres and boasts of modern infrastructure and world class facilities. Just a decade and half back, the picture was anything but perfect. The airport at the Diamond City was built by the government in early 1970s and till early 2000s it was being operated from a makeshift, cement sheet-roofed structure. Until 2005 the airport was connected to the main road by a kutcha road. During the monsoon season, passengers had to wade through a flooded road to access the airport. Not just the road but also the airport used to get submerged in rainwater, which resulted in a flight being diverted in 2004. The airport shed had makeshift cabins for the officials. Things started to change for good in 2007. The airport shifted to a new building and the Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower too became operational during the same time. Since then, the airport kept growing. In 2019-2020 Surat airport, managed by the Airport Authority of India (AAI), handled 1.58 million domestic and international passengers. Presently, Air India, Alliance Air, SpiceJet, Indigo, GoFirst, Star Air and Ventura AirConnect are operating flights from the airport. Surat airport director Aman Saini told TOI that the under-construction terminal building is expected to be ready by the next year. “Currently we have capacity to attend to around 500 passengers during the peak hours. Once the new terminal building becomes operational, we will be able to handle around 800 passengers. “New terminal building will have facilities including an in-line baggage scanner, duty free shops, passenger lounge for international travelers, escalators, and special facilities for physically challenged passengers,” Saini said. From having just basic facilities a decade and half back, the airport at present operates few of the biggest jets including A320, A321, Boeing 737-800. It runs daily flights to Delhi, Goa, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Bhavnagar, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Patna, Bhuvneshwar and Kishangarh. In December 2019, international flights started operating from Surat. In the same year, on a weekly average 240 aircrafts operated from the airport. Post the second wave of Covid-19 things are limping back to normalcy, with the airport operating two international flights per week and 40 domestic flights per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/from-makeshift-shed-to-modern-airport/articleshow/88131707.cms||Mehul Jani

The court ordered that Rs5lakh of the fine amount shall be given to the woman as compensation. “The convict, who was arrested on February 1, 2011, and released on bail on February 24 the same year, was immediately taken into custody after the sentencing on November 30 and sent to the Yerawada central jail for serving his prison term,” additional public prosecutor Leena Pathak told TOI on Monday. Pathak said, “This is the first conviction by a sessions court in Pune for an offence under Section 67-A of the Information Technology (IT) Act.” Apart from this, the court also convicted the accused for an offence under Section 292 (2) (a) of the IPC, which deals with possession of sexually explicit material. Judge Ponkshe relied on the evidence recorded by key prosecution witnesses, including the woman, her brother and his friend (who first saw the obscene video clips on websites), internet cafe owner, computer experts and investigating officer Deepak Savant, among others, and also seizure panchanama of various electronic gadgets, which was admitted by the accused. Referring to the evidence in detail, the court observed that the prosecution had proved that the accused “made and prepared the object in the electronic form i.e. videos of his sexual intercourse with the victim” and the said videos were found in his possession as it were downloaded and recovered by the investigating officer under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. The court, however, acquitted the accused of charges of repeatedly raping the woman between November 2009 and May 2010 on the pretext of marrying her and cheating by making false promises. It observed that the woman’s evidence showed multiple episodes of consensual physical relationship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/techie-gets-5-years-jail-for-posting-girlfriends-video-on-websites/articleshow/88131691.cms||Vishwas Kothari

Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, chief guest at the event, stressed the importance of education and the need to take forward Ambedkar’s ideas, including removing inequalities within society. “In many of his speeches, he had stressed the importance of socio-economic equality, and that once that is achieved, political equality would follow,” Meghwal said. “While this is an important idea that subsequent governments should have paid heed to properly, it was only the Modi government that actively took it up,” he claimed. “The society’s mindset also needs to change rapidly so that one can take forward Ambedkar’s ideas. Socio-economic equality is essential and the country as a whole needs to move towards it,” the minister said. JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said, “As an educational institute and academicians, we need to imbibe the values and teachings of Babasaheb in working towards building a strong and united India.” Underlining that academicians play a key role in this, Kumar said, “I am sure scholars will motivate our students to take up many research projects to understand the great ideas of Babasaheb.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-pledges-to-imbibe-values-of-ambedkar/articleshow/88132457.cms||Nikhil J Nair

---||Pune||Pune: Primary classes start with 50% attendance on first day||PUNE: On their first day back in school on Monday, many students from Stds I to IV in rural Pune were greeted with flowers and decorated classrooms. Teachers said that it will be a big challenge to get the students back on track as many seem to have forgotten the basics such as the alphabet and numbers, but physical reopening will bridge the learning gap. Pruthviraj Kale, a ZP teacher, said that his school witnessed just over 50% attendance on day 1. “We had decorated the entire school with balloons and flowers as if it was a birthday party. We had called our sarpanch to greet the students and offer a rose to each student. A local trust had sponsored some bags and books which were distributed among the students. Since only 50% came today, we were able to make one student sit on each bench. We will see how the attendance improves and then decide whether to call students on alternative days or to conduct classes in shifts,” said Kale. Ashok Chepte, a primary school teacher, said that while the school did not assess the children on Monday and instead used the day to distribute a picture-story book given by the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) and to interact with children, he realised that the primary school teachers would need to start from the basics. “The students who will be in Std I are completely blank. Despite online classes, the condition of Std II students will also be similar. If the schools had reopened in June, by now, we could have brought them at par. But, students were happy to be back in school,” he said. Anil Gunjal, primary education officer of the Pune zilla parishad, said that the response was good across schools and is expected to increase over the week. “Teachers have been instructed to follow all Covid-19 safety norms strictly and also make students and parents aware of them,” Gunjal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/primary-classes-start-with-50-attendance-on-first-day/articleshow/88131701.cms||Ardhra Nair

These kittens were reunited with their mother late on Sunday. Amit Sayyed — founder of Wildlife protection and research society, an organisation working for conservation of forests and wildlife — said, “As these kittens look like leopard cubs, the sugarcane cutters got scared. Someone from the village contacted our team members for rescue. When our members, Pradip Jadhav and Ruturaj Patil, reached at the spot they found that these are not leopards, but rusty-spotted cat that too only 16 to 17 days old. As these kittens were hungry they were crying out for their mother following which the mission to reunite them with their mother was undertaken.” He added, “The villagers and sugarcane cutters were sensitized about these wild cats after which the entire area was made free from human interference. At 11:18pm, the mother came to the sugarcane farm and took them to a safe place — one kitten at a time. The last kitten was taken at around 3.30 am.” Sayyed said that such rescue operations are time sensitive as minimising the time of separation between kittens and mother is an important factor for a successful reunion. The rusty-spotted cat is one of the world’s smallest wild cats. These cats are nocturnal and feed mainly on rodents, birds, lizards, frogs and insects. Common threats to this species include deforestation, habitat modification, poaching and hunting. The rusty-spotted cat is also protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/four-rusty-spotted-cat-kittens-rescued-reunited-with-mother/articleshow/88130180.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav will chair a meeting on Thursday to take a call on whether to allow private and civic schools in the city to start classes after December 10. On Jadhav’s instructions, NMC’s education department has directed all private and civic schools to furnish details like strength of students in classes I to VII, whether all teachers and staff are fully vaccinated, number of classrooms in each school, consent of parents, among others. NMC’s education officer Sunita Dhangar said that her department has already asked all schools to furnish the information sought by the civic body. “We also asked them about their plans to ensure social distancing in case the strength of the students attending offline classes increases and whether they are willing to run schools in two shifts,” she added. Currently, there are a total of 504 civic and private schools in the city with student strength of about 1.85 lakh from classes I to VII. There are a total of 4,714 teachers in these schools. Meanwhile, Nashik ZP is also likely to take a decision about re-opening of classes I to IV in the next few days as it is still collecting details of the Covid-free villages where schools are based and also verifying whether they have all the facilities ready to host the children. The district administration had recently made it clear that it would take a decision on reopening of schools in rural Nashik only after getting details of the villages that are Covid-free. “The numbers of schools is large and scattered across villages and it takes time for the field officers to visit the schools physically to ascertain all the facts,” Rajeev Mhaskar, Nashik ZP education officer, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/more-time-to-decide-on-school-reopening/articleshow/88130187.cms||Tushar Pawar

This statement came a day after BJP MP from Ballia Ravindra Kushwaha said, "When the (Narendra) Modi government can repeal the farm laws keeping in mind protests by farmers, it can also withdraw the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 to pave way for construction of a grand temple at Krishna Janambhoomi in Mathura." Singh spoke about the Krishna temple in Mathura even as the city has remained on alert for days now, especially after a right-wing group announced earlier that its members would install an idol of Krishna at the Shahi Idgah on December 6, the day Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished in 1992. On Monday, Mathura saw the deployment of additional forces with 3,000 more police personnel patrolling the streets. Section 144 is already in place in the pilgrimage centre. Just a week ago, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had tweeted: "Foundations of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi have begun, now preparations are being made for Mathura.” Singh, the minister in charge of development, animal husbandry and fisheries, went on to say, “The question now is when will it (the Krishna temple) be built? Earlier, the same question was raised in connection with the Ram temple in Ayodhya.” He added that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, "himself a saint", will disclose the right time for construction of the Mathura temple. “Construction of the Krishna temple will be started the way the Ram mandir in Ayodhya was started. Ram lalla hum ayenge, mandir wahin banayenge… tarikh nahi batayenge (Lord Ram, we will come and make the mandir but won't let out the date)." Barring a minor incident at Krishna Janmasthan temple in Mathura, where a few people gathered and shouted slogans, the day passed off peacefully. Police took into custody five of the protesters. SP (city) MP Singh said all of them were arrested on charges of disturbing peace under section 151 of CrPC. Also, a man identified from his Facebook account as Deepak Yadav has been booked for spreading rumours, the police officer added. “Two drones and several CCTV cameras were in place to monitor activities near the temple and the mosque. Apart from that, there was heavy deployment of security personnel to avoid any untoward incident in the city,” said SSP Guarav Grover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/krishna-temple-will-be-made-in-mathura-not-lahore-sr-up-minister/articleshow/88130981.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Jaipur||Dream to make Jaipur National University medical tourism hub: Sandeep Bakshi||From Kindergarten to medical college, and everything in-between, it could be a dream for any edu-preneur. But it is a reality for Sandeep Bakshi, founder of Jaipur National University. He is living his dreams, but not bereft of new ones. “I want to see JNU Medical College as a destination for medical tourism. Hurdles, I have faced many. But they they only reconfirmed the power of my never-die spirit,” says Bakshi, who was instrumental in bringing the concept of private university to the state. Bakshi knows that it’s a long haul as the investments in medical education take 8-9 years to start paying off, but he has patience and perseverance to reach there. When Bakshi set out on his entrepreneurial journey, he had just taken over the management of a kindergarten school, Seedling School, set up by his mother, a Montessori-trained teacher. “Of course, I learnt the basics of running a school from her. But as I climbed up the ladder, I trusted my decisions and went to great lengths to achieve them,” says Bakshi. In fact, Bakshi says the south Indian states were much ahead in bringing reforms to their education systems. “I collected the acts and ordinances of the states that allowed private universities, and prepared a draft to convince our government. It was really tough to find a way through the bureaucracy. But finally it came. And fittingly, JNU became the first private university to come up in the state,” recalls Bakshi. Similarly, he also had to fight for academic independence for introducing programmes that had a lot of scope but were not understood well in the state. “I was running the college then. I went to the V-C of Rajasthan University, requesting him to allow us to offer courses in bio-technology, chemical engineering, etc. I foresaw a huge demand for these courses. But we did not have academic freedom. I had to fight for it. Thankfully, the government of the day understood the futuristic views. That’s how we started bio-technology, chemical engineering, and other programmes opening up new placement opportunities for students,” says Bakshi. When it comes to motivation, Bakshi says it is always his goal. “I am a self-made man. Of course, I borrowed from my parents to expand the education infrastructure. Also, the learnings from my mother still remain at the core, but I always get motivated by my dreams and passions,” says Bakshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dream-to-make-jnu-medical-tourism-hub/articleshow/88132464.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Agronomists and horticulturists in these nurseries are encouraging people with specialised knowledge on various plant species to come and carry out research. Workers receive all facilities in an acknowledgement of their role in developing and nurturing new varieties. Besides indigenous plants, nursery farmers import exotic plants from countries like Spain, China, Thailand and elsewhere in southeast Asia. Ficus plants from China, olive trees from Spain and multi-colour bougainvillea from Thailand are some of the attractions. Talking to TOI, MD, Palla Venkanna Nursery, Palla Satyannarayana Murthy said many exotic plants are being imported from Southeast Asian countries which attract plant lovers. Nurseries in Kadiyam are also instrumental in making desert countries in the Middle East green. Plants from the nurseries are used for landscaping in Gulf countries, with Dubai municipality and the World Trade Centre there importing plants from the region. V Jayakannan, MD, Fine Green Exports, told TOI that they are exporting plants to Dubai, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Eighty to 100 containers of plants are exported to the Middle East every year.

Teachers said that they were already short of funds and the purchasing of this material for Covid-19 precautionary measures was going to add to the financial burdens. As per government instructions, the schools were told to gather funds from public participation or CSR for the purchases. School management committee member from Kesnand-based school, Rajendra Kasabe, said, “We have been fortunate that one of the villagers gave us a good stock of sanitiser bottles and masks. We bought the temperature guns and oximeter ourselves. But, this is a recurring cost. So every time we will have to spend and there is nothing that we are getting from the government.” The teachers said although all students have been told to get their own masks every day there a could be days when some forget or lose one in the school hours for which they will have to keep some spare masks. Principal of Blossom Public School in Saswad, Sushila Chand, said that they have a poor fee collection for the past two years and expenses have increased with the sanitisation of classrooms, sprayers, additional housekeeping staff s that have added to spending. “If we send reminders to parents to pay the dues, we are threatened by the parent association. We are in a big fix over these purchases,” she added. The schools have been sanitising the classrooms before and after the school hours. Additionally, schools are taking extra care with the cleaning of wash rooms too. Preeti Bhatura, head of a private school in Lohegaon, said that the salaries of the housekeeping staff have gone up.  “We have employed 12 ladies for the daily cleaning of the school. At present, only the secondary section is functioning but when the primary section will reopen and this staff will not be enough for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-safety-expenses-stretch-resources-in-rural-schools/articleshow/88131709.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Following a Pimpri magisterial court’s directive in a private complaint proceeding, the woman’s husband had lodged a complaint on May 23 against the four men accusing them of kidnapping, assault and criminal conspiracy, among other charges. Lawyer Zaheer Khan Pathan, representing the four applicants, had submitted that the complaint was filed with a mala fide intention to harass his clients. That the complainant has mentioned that his wife left his home on her own accord and his wife has said the same in an affidavit stating, among other things, that the complainant forced her into a physical relationship with his friends. The prosecution had opposed the bail on the sole ground that the applicants would try to influence its witnesses. The court observed that the prosecution did not place on record any medical certificate to show the nature of injuries alleged to have been caused to the woman. The court directed the Chikhali police that in the event of the four applicants arrest, they shall be released against a personal bond of Rs15,000 and a local surety in the like amount and they must present themselves when called and not directly or indirectly contact the witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pre-arrest-bail-for-4-buldhana-kidnappers/articleshow/88131715.cms||Vishwas Kothari

The health department is administering the vaccine at market places and on roads. The health teams are stopping personal vehicles and public transports, and taking the details of the people who have not been vaccinated, upload the details on CoWIN application and administer them Covid vaccine. This is being done to expedite the process of vaccination. The process is being carried out in rural areas especially in villages where the first dose of vaccine has been administered to more than 70% of the eligible population while the rest of the people are either unwilling to take the vaccine or isn’t getting time to take it due to other priorities. The officials in Trimbakeshwar, Igatpuri, Surgana and other talukas are conducting the exercise to find out the beneficiaries, who have not taken the first dose yet. They have, therefore, decided to check for people in market places and travel from one place to another. The efforts are yielding results. According to taluka health officer Dr Kailas Bhoye, who is also in charge of the vaccination programme for the district, a team, comprising a vaccinator, a doctor to monitor the adverse effect, data entry operator and others, moves around to see if any person is yet to be vaccinated. This comes after the teams have been appealing to people in the villages to get vaccinated. After the doses are administered, the officers also wait for some time after vaccinating to monitor the health in cases of adverse effects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/spot-vaccination-in-rural-nashik/articleshow/88130193.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Jaipur||Always believed in excellence, JPIS proved many wrong: Jayshree Periwal||One does not come across many who fail in Class 3 but become the force behind hundreds of children joining universities of repute in the world. Between the two contrasting realities lies the gutsy, yet inspiring story of Jayshree Periwal, the founder of JPIS. “I could have cried, felt belittled and gone into a cell after experiencing failure at that tender age of seven. Till today, I don’t know where the courage came from that I decided not to succumb despite others laughing at my situation. I started learning myself with a fiery zeal to outdo others and succeeded,” recollects Periwal, who despite doing well in mathematics and Hindi failed because she could not speak English. The incident had a profound impact, motivating her to build resilience and capacity, which would shape the rest of her life. When in college, she became the rallying force to lead her class in multiple ways and even top scored in Delhi’s Indraprastha college. Periwal had no entrepreneurship thoughts till she got married and relocated to Jaipur. But every time she visited her husband’s office, she would realise her irrelevance. “I went to my husband’s office only to feel that I was not contributing anything. That’s when the thought of starting tuition dawned, it was in the garage to begin with,” says Periwal. After a few months, Periwal’s way of teaching struck a chord with the parents who started urging her to start a school. “There were many happy parents who virtually pleaded with me to start a school so that their kids can stay longer with me. That’s how I came to start my first school in 1996. Interestingly, the admissions were closed on the first day itself. The response was no different when my second school came up a year later,” says Periwal. But again she had no idea of entering the regular school sector. In 1999, the Kargil war had broken out, with countrymen in solidarity donating money for the welfare of the fallen soldiers’ families. Periwal too had gone to the chief minister with a cheque. “Ashok Gehlot ji was also chief minister then. He asked me why I didn’t start a big school. I said I did not have money. Moreover, I had no land against which bank loans are sanctioned. Later, he informed the JDC to give me a piece of land but I was clearly told to start the school within a year,” recollects Periwal. In seven months, the high school at Chitrakoot with a capacity of 750 students opened its gates for admissions. But she had to wait a few years for the big moment and it came in 2008 when she opened Jayshree Periwal International School (Step By Step earlier) in Mahapura. “Everybody from banks, bureaucrats, and friends to family members questioned me. They thought I was taking the biggest risk and it’s going to be a disaster. The IB curricula was never heard of. But I alwayed believed that anything of excellence will survive and excel. There has been no looking back. Today, we rank No. 1 in college placements and are among the top 5 IB schools in the country and have students from 26 nationalities, making it a global village,” says Periwal. Explaining the IB model, Periwal says the teaching is not basic but in-depth. “Here, one little thing is taught in different ways,” Periwal explains. Besides, she says the focus is not always on the mind but on the heart as well, especially in times when children do not have the luxury of peer contacts. “A lot of resources are devoted to training the heart. Students even create events where they disguise themselves as transgenders who are emotionally isolated. It makes them understand their pain. During lockdown, our students raised lots of money to help people deprived of livelihood resources,” says Periwal. Over the years, the number of students in JPIS has grown to over 10,000. The school employs over 2,000 teachers and generates employment for over 20,000 people. While she credits her son Ayush Periwal for the spectacular university placements, she says her daughter Swati Agarwal is very passionate and monitors the Kindergarten section. She is now on a mission to make the JPIS campus in Mahapura an ecological haven. “I have created a man-made lake and planted 1 lakh trees. The whole topography will change. I am now planning to grow vegetables so that the students in the hostels can eat the best. A butterfly garden in the campus is waiting in the wings,” informs Periwal. On higher education, Periwal says eventually, maybe in the next five years, JPIS will venture into the space. “We are very passionate about what we do. It will be another area of excellence. We are talking to foreign universities for tie-ups currently,” says Periwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/always-believed-in-excellence-jpis-proved-many-wrong-jayshree-periwal/articleshow/88132471.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The water level in Idukki at 9pm was 2,401.12ft. Earlier, the district administration had issued an orange alert when the water level in the Idukki reservoir crossed 2,40ft at 5pm on Monday. The orange alert level is 2,401ft and upper rule level is 2,403ft, which is also the full reservoir level. “The releasing of water from Mullaperiyar and rainfall in the catchment areas of both Mullaperiyar and Idukki reservoirs has resulted in the increase in water level in Idukki dam,” a KSEB dam safety official said. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu continued to raise spillway shutters of Mullaperiyar dam during night despite Kerala requesting to avoid doing so. At 6pm on Sunday, nine spillway shutters of the dam were opened, releasing 7,341.06 cusecs of water to the Periyar. At 8.30pm four shutters were closed and the water release was reduced to 3,967.55 cusecs. At 10pm the water release was again reduced to 2,064.45 cusecs. At 11pm Tamil Nadu closed all spillway shutters except V3. Later, at 4am on Monday, five spillway shutters of the dam were opened, releasing 3,967.55 cusecs of water. At 4.30am nine shutters were raised, releasing 5,668.16 cusecs of water. Nine spillway shutters were again opened by 8.30pm, releasing 12,654.09 cusecs of water to the Periyar. This was the highest volume of water being released to the Periyar this year. The tunnel discharge was 1,864 cusecs. By 10pm they closed three shutters and reduced the water release to 8,380.5 cusecs. According to residents living downstream, TN’s act has given them sleepless nights. P N Sebastian, a resident of Vallakkadavu, said that the entire government system failed to ensure the safe living of the people downstream of Mullaperiyar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-dam-shutter-to-be-opened-today/articleshow/88131724.cms||---

The TRS MPs have been protesting on the paddy issue since November 29 when the Parliament’s winter session began. As soon as the House convened on Monday, TRS LS floor leader Nama Nageshwara Rao gave an adjournment motion to discuss paddy procurement issue, but it was rejected by speaker Om Birla. Meanwhile, in the Rajya Sabha, party leader K Keshava Rao gave a notice insisting on a discussion on the issue, but that too was rejected by the vice-chairman. Demanding an assurance from the Centre that kharif paddy would be procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), TRS MPs protested with placards seeking a uniform national food grain policy and also legal protection for MSP in the country. While Union minister for food and public distribution Piyush Goyal replied to a query on the issue by Keshava Rao in the RS, the TRS MPs were not satisfied. “The Telangana BJP MPs are misleading the people on paddy sowing in coming rabi season. Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind is asking farmers to go for paddy at a time the Telangana government is discouraging them following the FCI decision not to procure it,” Nageshwara Rao said. He also accused the LS speaker of allowing BJP MPs to criticise the TRS government, while denying the mike to TRS MPs to express their concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-keeps-paddy-pot-boiling-in-parl/articleshow/88131719.cms||---

According to police, the man — Satish Tiwari, a resident of Vitkheda area of the city — had received a friend request from the woman on his Facebook account and the same was accepted by him. Later, they started chatting online and over a period of time the suspect informed him that she was sending a gift to him from England. After Tiwari agreed to accept the gift, a woman called Tiwari and asked him to pay a sum of Rs 18,700 as clearance fee for the gift. The complainant relented and made the payment. This was followed by another call wherein a woman claimed to be calling from the customs department said that the gift parcel contained around 30,000 pounds in cash and in order to avoid any legal action Tiwari was asked to pay Rs 57,800. The same cycle kept repeating and the suspect ended up paying around Rs 3 lakh. Realising that he has been taken for a ride, the man decided to lodge a cheating complaint against two suspects under relevant section of Information and Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/55-year-old-man-duped-of-rs-3-lakh-by-online-friend/articleshow/88130190.cms||---

The deceased, Vivan Raval, had come to Gandhinagar for his maternal uncle’s wedding on December 13 with his mother Pooja and father Dhvanil Raval, who works for a bank in Canada. The accident occurred on Sunday afternoon when Vivan and Pooja were waiting for a cab as they headed to CG Road in Ahmedabad for shopping.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Schools, medical education on JECRC’s radar||JAIPUR: Call it a rite of passage or boot camp, the 72-year-old Krishna Cloth Store in Johri Bazaar was more than a pit stop for the Agarwal family of JECRC University. It was here both Amit and Arpit had their brush with the business world, like their uncle and father OP Agarwal, who later became a CA. When the state government in 1998 decided to open up higher education to private players, OP Agarwal saw an opportunity. “He told us, both Arpit and me, to study the policy and decide what we can do. I was about 26-year-old then and Arpit was five years junior to me, when we made a blueprint for setting up a college. Our father listened to the idea and gave the go-ahead. That’s how JECRC (Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre) was born in 2000,” recalls Amit. It was a challenging environment as government degrees were perceived to be more valuable, credible than private ones, despite the latter offering better pedagogy. Amit says the college did attract good students, growing from 152 admissions in the first year to 4,000 now. For Amit and Arpit, the decade that ensued after was a phase for learning and growing the college both in number of programmes and quality. They had gained enough insights and acumen in the sector that it was not possible to overlook the state government’s new policy for allowing private universities. “Business somehow runs in our blood. The Krishna Cloth Store in Johri Bazaar, in a sense, just baptized us into that world. When we started college, we did not have experience, but were successful. When the opportunity came, we went ahead to set up JECRC University in 2012 in a brand new campus spread over 40 acres,” says Amit. From three disciplines and 650 students in 2012, JECRC University has expanded its programmes to 32, offering engineering, computer science, business management, law, mass communication, humanities, fashion design, etc. “The admissions have increased by over 22% this year to over 6,000. Together with the college, we have over 10,000 students. Our hostels with a capacity of 1,600 beds are almost full,” says Amit. The pandemic had its share of impact. But Arpit says that they tried to salvage as much as they can from the situation while taking care of its employees. “We did not lay off even a single staff, nor cut their salaries. Even increments due last year were honoured. I worked from home to ensure students are not deprived of placements. Over 430 students found placements in a time like that. Finally, we ended 2020-21 with 2,016 placements with 89 companies,” says Arpit. JECRC is now looking at entering school education on an asset-light model by taking over management of existing facilities on lease or revenue sharing basis. Similarly, it is also looking at opening a medical college. “Over the next three to five years, we would like to venture into both medical and school education. We are coming across schools which look for management takeover. As to the medical college, the discussions are at the primary level now,” adds Amit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/schools-medical-edu-on-jecrcs-radar/articleshow/88132474.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lured by fake FB ad, jobless man loses Rs 2.8 lakh||MUMBAI: A Powai resident, who was rendered jobless soon after the Covid-19 pandemic hit India last year, lost Rs 2.8 lakh in an online job fraud recently. Based on the 40-year-old graduate’s complaint, the Powai police have registered an FIR against an unknown person for cheating under the provisions of the India Penal Code and the IT Act.The victim, a former senior manager with an automation firm, fell prey to an advertisement link promising people fast and high income by working from home. He came across the advertisement on Facebook on November 25. According to the ad, he would get high returns on his investments by buying and selling electronic goods online. “For the next two days, he pumped in all his savings. He realised that he had been duped when the fraudster he was in touch with switched off his phone. We have sought the internet protocol (IP) address and the money trail from the bank to track the accused,” said a Powai police station officer. The victim had lost his job just a few days after his wife stopped working to take care of their three-month-old daughter. “I was lured by the fake online job ad. The fraudster provided me with a WhatsApp number and sent me a link to complete the login process to get my name registered on the webpage along with opening the wallet account on the page,” the victim, told TOI. The victim was asked to pay for buying electronic products at a ‘cheaper’ price that would be displayed under his name as a seller on the webpage. “The victim was promised that when the product gets sold, he would earn high commission points that would be credited into his login page account wallet. Within 24 hours, the victim’s page showed that he had earned Rs 7 lakh against the investment of Rs 2.78 lakh. However, when he tried to transfer the money to his bank account, he could not,” said the police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/lured-by-fake-fb-ad-jobless-man-loses-rs-2-8-lakh-in-mumbai/articleshow/88132489.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Pune||Pune: MIT-ADT students and parents demand online lectures, exams||PUNE: Several students from MIT ADT University in Loni Kalbhor and their parents have said that their repeated requests to the management to continue with online classes have fallen on deaf ears. Examinations are being held in the offline mode making many students from outside the city or the state seek an alternative. The students attending the classes said that no social distancing norms are followed on campus and those with one dose of vaccination are called to attend classes. “We were told to be present on the campus in full capacity from November 15. There have been Covid cases on the campus. These students were either kept in isolation or sent home. No contact tracing was done nor were the classes shut down for 7-14 days,” a student said. A parent said many emails and calls were made to the management requesting them to keep this semester either online or in the hybrid model. “The management did not pay any heed to our concerns and forcefully called our children on campus. Within a few days of the college reopening offline, there have been cases on the campus,” a parent said. Another student complained that the college does not adhere to any Covid-19 protocols and now has announced the schedule for compulsory offline exams. “Many students, including me, have got only one dose of the vaccine but that does not matter to the management. The college bus, the offices, the classrooms everything is crowded. Now ,the university has declared the dates for the end semester practical and theory examination in the offline mode. Examination dates for almost every department is the same which means again there will be crowding in the classrooms,” the student said. He added that for just a few months of stay, the college was demanding full hostel fees. Mangesh Karad, vice-chancellor of MIT ADT, said they have not made offline classes compulsory for first-year because students are below 18 years and cannot get vaccinated. “But, for everyone above that, they can and should get vaccinated. We have a Rs 1 lakh health insurance per student in case they require any medical care. We reopened physically on November 15 and since then everything has been running smoothly. A few cases that came up were instantly isolated and given proper treatment. We follow all safety protocols. The students are old enough to wear a mask all the time, ensure they do not crowd and also maintain physical distancing. We have opted for an offline examination for transparency,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mit-adt-students-parents-demand-online-lectures-exams/articleshow/88131734.cms||Ardhra Nair

Om Prakash, one of the three sons of victim Budhsen (goes by the first name only), on Monday morning informed police that his father was murdered by unidentified persons. Police said during the investigation, they found that Budhsen's youngest son Nekpal had killed him with an iron rod. When police started searching for Nekpal, they found his body nearly 2 kilometres away from the spot. Budhsen was a resident of Bhagwantpur ka Majhra village under Shahbad police station limits, and had been serving as a home guard for the past 20 years. After getting information, additional superintendent of police Sansaar Singh rushed to the spot and investigated the spot along with the local police team and forensic experts. Based on the preliminary investigation, an FIR was registered against Nekpal, who was later found dead. Both bodies were sent for autopsy. Rampur SP Ankit Mittal said, “Nekpal was unhappy with the property share given to him by his father. He was unemployed and wanted his father to share a part of his salary with him. The accused believed that his father had favoured his eldest brother Om Prakash. Nekpal bludgeoned his father to death with an iron rod and fled the spot. When we started searching for him, he was found dead on the roadside. It appeared that he was hit by a vehicle. However, we are trying to ascertain whether he died in a road accident or killed himself out of guilt.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-kills-father-dies-in-road-accident-while-fleeing-spot/articleshow/88131004.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The average number of tests per daily is around 25,000 over the last two weeks, with 37,000 tests the highest number of tests in a day, recorded few days back. “The fact that majority of the tests are rapid antigen tests also needs to change. While antigen tests have a high chance of false negatives, it means that if we are testing with RAT method, it has to be ramped up three times to detect the spread,” revealed an official in charge of a government testing centre. The health department currently has only 3.7 lakh RT-PCR kits in stock and 26 lakh RAT kits. “To ramp up testing to over 1 lakh per day, this stock will only last for 15-20 days. More stocks are going to be made available,” the official said. “Typically testing has to be increased to a level that the positivity has should be less than 5 per cent. Though currently positivity rate is well below that, we need to ramp up testing in light of the new variant, so that cases are detected early and spread can be prevented,” said Dr Kiran Madala, an ICMR-certified researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/testing-nos-still-around-25k-per-day/articleshow/88131641.cms||---

On Monday evening, Kachiguda traffic cops were conducting traffic rule enforcement at Alicafe X roads in Amberpet. On seeing police, a biker parked his vehicle on the roadside and when police keyed in the registration number in e-challan data base, they were in for a rude shock.

Police said they arrested the boy’s 23-year-old cousin and his two aides, who had kidnapped him and made a ransom call for Rs 50 lakh. After receiving the kidnapping complaint, SSP Abhishek Yadav had formed a special team to investigate the matter. The breakthrough, however, came after the accused made the ransom call and police tracked down the mobile phone location. ASP Krishan Bishnoi said, “The boy’s family had lodged a missing complaint on November 25 at Chhapar police station. On December 4, his father approached police again, stating that he had received a ransom call for Rs 50 lakh.” After tracing the phone’s location, the police team recovered the boy from a graveyard at Khoja Nagla village and arrested Sadiq Rana (cousin), Abdul Rehman and Shahzad Shaikh, and seized two country-made pistols from their possession. The accused have several criminal cases registered against them, said police. “Sattar, who is considered a rich man locally, landed in India after getting the information of his son’s kidnapping, and sought police’s help as soon as he arrived at the village,” said the ASP. The ASP told TOI that the cousin had lured the boy away on the pretext of visiting a fair. Later, his two accomplices joined him and hid the boy at multiple locations over the next ten days, added the ASP, adding that the accused were booked under relevant sections of the IPC and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cousin-two-aides-held-for-kidnapping-boy-12-demanding-rs-50-lakh-ransom/articleshow/88131030.cms||Mohd Dilshad

After pursuing education in Australia, international students can avail temporary graduate visa (subclass 485) that enables them to work in Australia for two years. Following completion of studies in November-December 2019 and securing work visa, many returned to India to meet families. But lockdown led to Australian government sealing borders, leaving many stuck. Bagudu Giribabu, 27, returned after almost three years of education in Central Queensland University in Melborne in December 2019. “I had a work visa valid till December, 2021. I planned to stay in India till March, 2020. However, pandemic has been a nightmare. I lost my father in June 2020 to an accident. Now, I am the bread-winner of my family with Rs 30 lakh loan. EMIs begin this month,” said Giribabu, whose work visa is to expire by December 9. Mounika Nama, 27, got married in Australia and returned to India with her husband in February 2020. Now, she is stranded in India with an expired temporary graduate visa. “For six months in the pandemic, I spent $2,000 per month on rent. Later, I got my belongings shifted to a rental space where I spent $600 per month. This, in addition to my education loan. Me and my husband are in financially weak condition. Australia government is not allowing our return,” said Nama. Many students are unable to apply for jobs here as original certificates are in Australia. Although Australia said it’ll allow temporary graduate visa holders to apply for a visa replacement from June, 2022, many rue it would lead to a loss of another six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oz-dreams-of-studentsdrown-under-virus-fears/articleshow/88131722.cms||Preeti Biswas

He hoped that this pool of ‘quality students’ grows further, without Covid-19 playing a dampener. “The numbers show that there is huge demand for quality education, especially among students from south India. That education is mostly free, communicating in Germany is easy since most people speak English and the cost of living is not very high, also work in their favour,” the German ambassador to India said, ahead of an Indo-German economic summit. The objective of the meet: To provide German companies a platform to interact with the Telangana government and explore investment opportunities. “Representatives from about 50 companies are participating. Though I am only a facilitator and the final decision on whether they want to set shop in Hyderabad (or anywhere in Telangana) or not lies with the firms, I must admit that I have been very impressed with the ease of doing business policy of the state government,” Lindner said, on his second visit to Hyderabad. At present, there are about 15 to 20 German firms in and around the city, including car spare parts manufacturer, ZF, that has set up its first technology centre in India here. Over the next five years, the firm is expected to add another 5,000 engineers. “Currently, most German companies — about 2,000 in India — are concentrated across Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru. There has not been too much focus on Hyderabad. This is an opportunity for companies to put this city on their radar. I think there are a lot of possibilities as, during my earlier interaction with IT minister K T Rama Rao, he had listed out a host of goodies the state has on offer for investors,” said Lindner who has another reason for loving Hyderabad: it’s rich culture, heritage and music. “I am certainly coming back to play here,” the ambassador said as he signed off – a day after he played the flute at the Qutb Shahi Heritage Park as part of fourth International Jazz Festival||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huge-demand-for-german-edu-in-hyd/articleshow/88131713.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Officials said that even parents were being asked to maintain social distancing and wear masks when they visit to meet their children. They added that most parents were fully vaccinated. “We have identified Covid-19 warriors in each class to report the health status of their classmates to their class teacher and principal,” said R Prashanthi, officer on special duty, Panacea Command Center, which monitors the health of the students at TSWREIS round-the-clock. Prashanthi informed that teachers have also been instructed to strictly implement all Covid-19 norms. “Even for lunch, students are being sent in a staggered manner,” she said. The official added that while they could maintain social distancing in classrooms when physical classes resumed for students in class 9 and above — with only 20 students per class, 40 students are being put in one classroom as of now due to space constraints. An official with KGBV said that they too have been sending alerts, regularly asking students to follow all Covid-19 norms in the hostels and classrooms. “As of now, there is no major issue as no Covid-19 cases have been reported from KGBVs. All norms are being followed. Even parents are being asked to be extra careful,” said an official. When it comes to private residential schools, managements said that they are not facing any difficulty in maintaining social distancing as hardly 50 per cent students have joined in hostels. “After Omicron cases being reported in India, hesitancy among parents has increased. Even teachers are a little scared and are being very cautious,” said president of Telangana Recognised School Managements Association, Shekhar Rao Y.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/residential-schools-tighten-norms/articleshow/88131661.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

An MoU was inked by Liteauto GmbH and the Telangana government on Monday during a German investors’ summit in the presence of Telangana IT & industries minister KT Rama Rao and German ambassador to India Walter J Lindner. Meanwhile, even as global investors work towards de-risking their investments in China by either having an additional manufacturing base or completely shifting to new countries, KTR urged German entrepreneurs to not only invest in Telangana but also grow the state's manufacturing ecosystem. “Especially when the world is looking to move away from China... I think India can take a pole position in attracting more manufacturing business…,” KTR said while adding that the state can learn lessons from German entrepreneurs who are well adept in this sector. The minister added that Telangana can emulate Germany’s dual degree education model, wherein students in grad schools need to intern with industries to get hands-on experience.

The fear of a looming Omicron-spiked third wave and absence of any auspicious date after December 20 any time soon has many people preponing crucial family functions. The surge in December demand has people scrambling for dates, function halls and priests for weddings and housewarming ceremonies. Confirming the hurry, priest Vinjamuri Ganesh Sharma, said, “As per Hindu calendar, the movement of Sun after December 20 prohibits any auspicious ceremonies.” From December 20 till the end of January, the period termed as Peedadinalu begins in Telangana (Mudham in AP) and it is not considered an auspicious time, priests said. “During these days, no one prefers housewarming ceremonies or even marriages. Good days for functions then come only in March,” said Pithuru Rajasekhara Sharma, another priest. Consequently, families who planned weddings and ceremonies for next year now want it held as soon as possible to outwit the virus before it spreads or the stars lock them out. “My daughter is engaged. If there is a wave next year, we may not get dates. So, we are trying to fix it as soon as possible even if the wedding is not on a grand scale. But we are finding it hard to get priests and function hall,” said KL Rama Rao, a private employee from Kothapet. Function hall owners have also reported a surge in bookings for December 8, 9, 10, and 12. “Most people are reserving for December 8 and 10. Our bookings took a hit due to the pandemic in the last two seasons. There is demand now, but we have not raised prices,” said Marri Rajasekhara Reddy, who has halls in Chital and Kompally. On its part, the health department clarified there won’t be a lockdown but some restrictions if cases grow. “People have to be careful while attending large gatherings.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 30% of open space plot may be lost to accommodation reservation||MUMBAI: A 700 sqm plot reserved for open space in Vile Parle East, for which the acquisition process had already begun, is now being sought to be acquired under the accommodation reservation policy of the BMC.Under the policy, the developer will get 30% of the plot approximately 200 sqm on which the entire FSI of the 700 sqm plot can be utilised, besides Transfer of Development Rights (TDR). The improvements committee will visit the site on Tuesday to decide whether the BMC should acquire the plot under the new policy. The original proposal for acquisition was approved in 2017. The BMC had even deposited Rs2.5 crore with the collector’s office for it. In 2019, the plot owner moved the HC, which in turn directed the proposal be reconsidered under accommodation-reservation policy. BMC’s senior counsel Anil Sakhare had then opined that the plot was less than 1,000 sqm and, therefore, the policy cannot apply. Now the administration has sought to club adjoining plots reserved for a school and playground with the 700 sqm tract to show it is part of a larger plot. The proposal has been reopened stating that if the improvements committee chooses, it can be acquired under accommodation-reservation. BJP MLA from Vile Parle, Parag Alavani, said the three plots are owned by different entities, and questioned the BMC administration’s intention to club the three plots to benefit the builder. “If the improvements committee approves the acquisition under the accommodation-reservation policy we shall challenge the decision in court,” said Alavani, who had initiated the process for its acquisition as an open space. “Vile Parle residents do not go to municipal school nor do they avail of medical services at municipal hospitals. Are they not entitled to at least amenities like open spaces. Why should the BMC which has Rs80,000 crore in fixed deposits not pay and acquire the plot for the benefit of residents?” asked MLA Alavani.  Local BJP corporator Abhijit Samant said the area has very few open spaces and applying the accommodation-reservation policy would mean the loss of 200 sq metres of the plot. “The cost of acquisition is less than Rs100 crore and the BMC can easily pay for the acquisition. Why must the public sacrifice its share of the open space?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-30-of-open-space-plot-may-be-lost-to-accommodation-reservation/articleshow/88132895.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC seeks details of paddy procured from farmers||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday directed the state government to provide details of paddy procured from the farmers till now and also the quantum of paddy it would procure till the end of Janaury 2022. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji was hearing a PIL filed by B Srikar, a law student, seeking directions to the state and Centre to procure from farmers all the paddy they harvested. Advocate general BS Prasad informed the court that the state had already commenced the process of purchasing paddy from the farmers, which is a continuous process that will go on till the end of January. Faulting the petitioner for coming to court with inadequate information, the AG said that the government had already procured 27 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from 4.5 lakh farmers by spending Rs 2,800 crore. “We are doing the job by setting up as many as 6,439 paddy procurement centres all over the state. We requested the central government to procure the paddy produced during the rabi season also,” the AG said. Dominic Fernandes, counsel for the Food Corporation of India, said Telangana had adopted a decentralised form of procuring paddy. “There is an MoU between the state and the Centre in these matters,” he said. The bench too said the issue of procurement and minimum support price, etc., were being deliberated upon between both the state and the Centre. “We cannot force them at this stage to procure a certain specified quantum of paddy,” the bench said while reminding the petitioner that neither the farmers nor their unions are before the court. “Show us a provision of law by which we can direct a state government to procure paddy,” the bench asked. The bench, however, asked the state to file its counter explaining its efforts in this regard and posted the case to February 4, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-seeks-details-of-paddy-procured-from-farmers/articleshow/88131755.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

It only demonstrates his disrespect to Dalits,” Kishan Reddy said. The minister claimed that during the TRS government’s seven-year rule it had never paid a proper tribute to Ambedkar. “However, the BJP government at the Centre has designated five sites to display Ambedkar’s life history,” Kishan Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kishan-asks-cm-about-dalit-bandhu/articleshow/88131772.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Realty agent accuses cops of assaulting him over land row||HYDERABAD: The family members of a real estate agent, who belongs to schedule caste community, alleged that Nalgonda II town sub-inspector Narasimhulu Goud and few others allegedly thrashed him over a land dispute case. They alleged that several policemen from Nalgonda district tortured the agent to pay money to a person at whose behest the police allegedly took action. After the issue came to light, deputy inspector general of police AV Ranganath ordered a probe into the matter. Royya Srinivasulu, a real estate agent, mediated and clinched a land deal several months ago. However, few months later, litigation started after one Shiva allegedly started construction at the same site. “My brother, Linga Swamy (the person who bought the 287 square yard land) and the seller Raju approached police alleging that one Shiva took up construction on their land. Police who promised to verify the facts started putting pressure on my brother to make Swamy stop making claims over the land,” businessman Krishna Prasad, brother of Srinivasulu told TOI. An FIR was registered by police against Srinivasulu in July and in November he was brought to the police station on multiple occasions. “SI Narasimhulu Goud used a rubber tube to beat my brother on several occasions. They wanted my brother to pay money to Linga Swamy and make sure he would not claim the property. Srinivasulu’s wife begged the SI to leave her husband as they do not have any money,” Krishna Prasad said. Ranganath on Sunday night issued an order directing the police training college superintendent of police C Satish to investigate the issue. Meanwhile, the family members of Srinivasulu filed a case in high court against the policemen involved in the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/realty-agent-accuses-cops-ofassaulting-him-over-land-row/articleshow/88131783.cms||---

It said since the accused have been filing scores of pleas like discharge petitions, etc., the trial court could not even frame charges against any of the accused till now. CBI counsel K Surender was arguing before Justice Ujjal Bhuyan of the Telangana high court who was hearing an appeal filed by AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Jagan was urging court to exempt him from need to appear before the trial court in all hearings pertaining to 11 chargesheets filed by CBI and nine chargesheets by Enforcement Directorate (ED) against him. Some were filing quash pleas and the high court stayed the trial court proceedings in respect of some accused in certain chargesheets, the CBI counsel said, wondering whether the accused were doing this as part of a collective strategy. While admitting Jagan did not file any applications seeking stay on trial court proceedings, the CBI counsel, however, said that such applications were filed by other accused. “The plea of Jagan need not be allowed at this stage,” he said. “For 10 years, there is no change in circumstances before the trial court. Let charges be framed first and then he can file such pleas citing the change in circumstances,” he said. The judge reserved his orders in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/quid-pro-quo-caseyet-to-see-trial-cbi/articleshow/88131780.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

BJP state general secretary P Sudheer said the students of St George School at Kottangal in Pathanamthitta were stopped by some PFI activists and they pinned the badge on their chest. “Irrespective of their religious beliefs all students who were on their way to the school were forced to wear the badge. It must be noted that Kottangal panchayat is ruled by the CPM with the support of SDPI, the political arm of PFI. It is this undercover political camaraderie that lends the PFI activists credence and helps them to carry out such objectionable acts,” Sudheer said. The BJP general secretary said the activities of PFI workers were reminiscent of the activities of Islamic terrorists in Syria. “This is nothing short of Talibanism. PFI workers indulge in such activities with the approval of the LDF government. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s stand on halal issue is another example of the understanding between the CPM and SDPI,” he said. Sudheer alleged that the LDF government was carrying out the agenda of fundamental organizations in Kerala. According to Sudheer, it was the alleged subjugation to the extremist elements that prompted general education minister V Sivankutty to go back from his announcement that he would publicise the names of school teachers who show vaccine hesitancy, risking their lives and that of students. Meanwhile, senior BJP leader P K Krishnadas petitioned national child rights commission against the incident in Kottangal. He urged the commission to take exemplary action against those who violated the child rights by using them for spreading PFI propaganda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pfi-forced-school-kids-to-wear-i-am-babari-badge-bjp/articleshow/88131793.cms||---

With news about the architectural marvel of the magnificent temple complex going viral on social media and other platforms, the footfall of devotees at Balalayam has gone up from 5,000 a day to 30,000 now. Confirming this, Yadagirigutta Temple Development Authority officials said the devotee rush is high during the weekends. “Many of them are visiting the Balalayam to soak in the religious splendour and spectacular workmanship at the temple complex,” an official said. The officials said work on the main road leading to the temple complex, links roads to the cottages and other buildings and lawns had been completed. “Once the main temple is thrown open to the devotees, we are expecting the pilgrim numbers to go up substantially. Keeping in view of the pilgrim rush, we are racing ahead to complete all civil works,” a YTDA official said. A new TSRTC bus complex in the downhill area will be completed by March. Accommodation and other facilities will be made available online, officials said. State government is planning to take up gold plating works to the 47-ft high main gopuram on the lines of Ananda Nilayam in Tirumala shrine.

---||Delhi||No lockdown, Delhi govt says ready with Covid infrastructure||NEW DELHI: Amid rising concerns due to several Omicron cases being detected in the country, Delhi government has intensified preparations to tackle any escalation in the situation. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said there was no need to panic because the government was working to ensure that adequate oxygen, beds, equipment and medicines were available. He is personally monitoring the situation. Delhi government has rejected the possibility of a lockdown. Health minister Satyendar Jain said the graded response action plan would be implemented if cases rise. This plan is a colour-coded detailed guide on imposing economic restrictions, which will start when the daily positivity rate crosses 0.5% and remains above it for two consecutive days. On Sunday, the positivity rate was 0.11%. “The Omicron variant has entered India. We are constantly receiving news regarding patients across the country and even in Delhi. However, there is no need to panic or lose sleep over it. I’m constantly monitoring the situation and the progress being made to deal with the possible threat of the spread of the virus,” said Kejriwal, while appealing to people to continue to follow Covid protocols. About 30,000 Covid beds are ready in Delhi and 100 beds per ward would be arranged when required on a two-week notice, which would take the total bed capacity to over 64,000. Soon, 6,800 ICU beds would also be ready. “Medicine stocks are currently being added and home isolation arrangements are being strengthened. Oxygen supply and storage is being bolstered. There are extra storage facilities of 442 metric tonnes and production capacity of 121 MT. Telemetry devices to provide real-time tracking are being installed in all oxygen facilities. Around 6,000 oxygen cylinders have been imported and 15 tankers bought to prevent shortage,” the government mentioned in a statement. People can call on the Covid helpline number, 1031, to get help for patients. To curb manpower shortage, 15,370 healthcare workers, including 4,673 doctors, 1,707 medical students, 6,265 nurses and 2,726 paramedics, have been trained in oxygen therapy and paediatric ward management. Around 5,000 health assistants have been given basic training in nursing, paramedics, home care, blood pressure measurement, vaccination, etc. A committee constituted by Delhi government has identified 32 medicines and it has been mandated to maintain a buffer stock for 60 days. In addition, a buffer stock of 30 days would be kept for eight drugs identified by the Centre. The process of procurement of equipment for which demand may rise has been started. Jain said Delhi government was testing all people coming from the countries affected by the Omicron variant. So far, 27 people have been admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital out of which 17 are positive and only one person confirmed to be infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-lockdown-govt-says-ready-with-covid-infra/articleshow/88131827.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Delhi high court: Was there a ban on Indians housing Tablighis?||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday asked Delhi Police to explain if there was any prohibition on Indian nationals from housing attendees of last year’s Tablighi Jamaat congregation who entered the country on a valid visa when there were no Covid-19 related restrictions. The court asked the police to file an affidavit answering its query if there was any prohibition on Indian nationals from providing accommodation to foreigners when the lockdown was imposed. Justice Mukta Gupta, who was hearing a batch of petitions to quash the FIRs registered against the hosts, said she would pass appropriate orders after the material was placed before the court. While some of the pleas for quashing of FIRs are by individuals who had provided refuge to the foreigners who had attended the event and could not travel owing to the subsequent lockdown due to the outbreak of Covid-19, others are by people like managing committee members or caretakers of different mosques, who have been accused of providing housing facilities to the foreign nationals in the masjids under the jurisdiction of Chandni Mahal police station. “They came under a valid visa. They were staying there then you can’t say they were violating these provisions,” Justice Gupta remarked. The prosecutor contended that when the police went to the “spot,” the locals did not inform about the date on which the attendees came to reside in the premises in question and that’s why the exact date could not be ascertained.  “Then your officers don’t deserve to be IOs (investigating officers),” responded the court. It stated that the police could have checked the passport entries of the foreign nationals and their call record data to verify their location. “Filing half-baked things will not work, you have to show that after lockdown, they (attendees) were moving here and there,” the court underlined after the petitioners claimed that the investigating agency has not specified the date of entry into the premises in the FIR or the chargesheet. The lawyer further informed the court that the crime branch of Delhi Police had also registered an FIR against the event organisers for the alleged violation of certain provisions of the Indian Penal Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act, etc. The court then directed the DCP concerned to file an affidavit disclosing if any of the petitioners are also accused in the crime branch FIR. In their plea, petitioners Feroz and Rizwan, who had each provided accommodation to four women Tablighi attendees, have contended that shelter was given to them as they had nowhere to go during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-was-there-a-ban-on-indians-housing-tablighis/articleshow/88131800.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Yadadri temple getting ready for inaugural||HYDERABAD: The Yadadri main temple complex is inching closer towards inauguration with the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) planning to set up a comprehensive sewerage network at Yadadri temple town and Yadagirigutta municipality. The government plans to inaugurate main temple complex in March 2022. Sources said the water board had floated tenders to prepare the detailed project report (DPR). “A Hyderabad-based infra firm has bagged it. Board senior officials had a meeting with the infra firm representatives and asked them to complete the DPR within a month,” sources said. The sewerage network includes building mini sewerage treatment plants (STPs), underground drainage, laying trunk sewer mains, storm-water drains and distribution lines, inlets and outlets. “The estimated cost of the sewerage system will be known after the DPR is filed,” said the sources. Senior officials said it could take at least a couple of years to get the comprehensive sewerage network in place. A proposal for laying the sewerage network covering the temple complex and Yadagirigutta municipality came after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced that Yadadri temple would be reopened for darshan from March. The water board, which deals with 7,000-km length of sewerage network in Greater Hyderabad and peripheral areas, is hoping to complete the work as soon as possible. “The state government has allotted the major infra work of implementing the sewerage network for the temple town which is prestigious,” a senior official said. Yadadri temple is going to be one of the country’s most expensive temples once it is fully refurbished. The Telangana government has already spent nearly Rs1,000 crore on giving a facelift to the centuries old temple complex built on a 14-acre land on the hilltop and building other structures. Yadagirigutta Temple Development Authority (YTDA), which has taken over the responsibility of giving a makeover to the entire temple complex, has also developed a temple city on 850 acres on a separate hillock called ‘Peddagutta’. While 250 acres is utilised for building cottages under the donors’ scheme, in the remaining 600 acres, three helipads, villas, kalyana mandapams, high-end cottages, foodcourts, solar energy power centre, STP, water reservoir, bus terminal, central parking facility to accommodate 7,000 cars and commercial complexes are coming up, said YTDA officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/yadadri-getting-ready-for-inaugural/articleshow/88131790.cms||Sunil Mungara

For the first time ever, overloading of trucks has attracted such huge fines, officials said. While in one case, overloading of 2 tonnes attracted Rs 52,000 in fines and 90 days of cancellation of licence by Latur RTO, in another case the fine was the highest so far at Rs 68,000 for a truck caught at the state borders. Now, for overloading, driver and truck owners have to pay Rs 20,000 each, the highest-ever fine for this offence in Maharashtra.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt set to increase security at Cliff House||Thiruvananthapuram: The state government is all set to fortify the security for chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his official residence, on the basis of a proposal from the state police. On Monday, the additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) informed state police chief Anil Kant that the government will constitute an interdisciplinary panel of officials headed by DIG security and would also consider creating a post of DCP exclusively to deal with the security matters of the chief minister. “I am directed to inform you that the government hereby agrees to the suggestion of constituting a committee of interdepartmental officials, headed by DIG security for overseeing and implementation of the recommendations of strengthening of security of Cliff House, as proposed. The proposal of having a post of DCP security in the city police to coordinate and oversee the security of the VVIP has been taken up with the general administration (AIS-C) - department,” the letter, accessed by TOI, said. A proposal was submitted by the police to the government in November last year when there were widespread protests against the government during the probe by central agencies into the Thirivananthapuram gold smuggling case. In the proposal, several measures were recommended for strengthening the security system in the Cliff House. The proposal was prepared by the police after a stock-taking of the Cliff House and the areas around, after some Youth Congress protestors reached till the gate of the Cliff House as part of protest against the chief minister. As per the proposal submitted then, the height of the compound wall of the Cliff House needs to be increased, and barbed concertina wires should be laid along the perimeter of the wall inside the compound so that any intruders who make it to the top of the wall would be trapped if he jumps inside. Since there are at least three highrises in the area from where there is a clear view of the inside area of the compound, view cutters should be erected, blocking the view. The guard room, which is at the main gate of the Cliff House, has been proposed to be advanced and a narrow lane from YMR Junction nearby to the Cliff House has been proposed to be blocked permanently. The police had proposed that there should be lighting along the perimeter of the compound wall, and the branches of the trees that have grown too close to the wall should be chopped off. Since there are no permanent block-and-proceed mechanisms in the main road leading to the Cliff House, boom barriers should be erected, and a reception centre should also be put in place for the visitors. The police had also proposed that a generator should be installed and an additional CCTV system should be installed at the Devaswom Board Junction, from where the road leads to the Cliff House. Similarly, inside the compound, a three to four feet wide walkway should be prepared along the full length of the compound wall for the guard on duty to use during night duty and a watch tower should also be erected that would give a proper aerial view of the area. Last year, the government had deployed the State Industrial Security Force (SISF) inside the secretariat in addition to the secretariat security to strengthen the secretariat security system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-set-to-increase-security-at-cliff-house/articleshow/88131801.cms||KP Saikiran

The cases involved one Amit Maheta, 49, of Mansa town of Gandhinagar district. He was first booked under Sections 66(1)(b) and 85(1)(3) of the Gujarat Prohibition Act and under provisions of the Gujarat Police Act for creating a public nuisance on March 14, 2015. Three months later, on June 12, Mansa police raided his house and arrested him while drunk, and booked him under the same provisions. A magisterial court in Mansa conducted the trials and on April 7, 2018 held Maheta guilty of drinking liquor under Section 66(1)(b) on both occasions. The trial court acquitted him of other charges. In both cases, he was sentenced to six months in jail and a Rs 1,000 fine. The law stipulates a maximum of six months in jail and fine of Rs 1,000 when caught drunk for the first time, and for a second offence the punishment may go up to two years in jail and the fine up to Rs 2,000. Maheta challenged his conviction before the sessions court and claimed innocence. The sessions court upheld the trial court’s decision to hold Maheta guilty of breach of prohibition laws in both cases. When it came to the quantum of punishment, the court felt six months’ imprisonment is “a quite long period and the accused is required to be put behind the bar for a just and reasonable time”. After observing that rigorous imprisonment of six months is too high, the court said that Maheta did not have any criminal antecedents and reduced his jail term to 15 days for the first offence and 10 days for the second. It said that the reduced terms are “reasonable and just to penalise the accused for consuming alcohol and at the same time he should not be put into custody for a long time where he can get knowledge of commission of serious and heinous crimes from habitual offenders”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/six-months-jail-too-much-for-drinking-court-reduces-tipplers-sentence/articleshow/88131795.cms||---

Raut confirmed to TOI he would meet with Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi. Raut’s meeting is seen as significant considering that this past week, Banerjee had met him and Shiv Sena’s Aaditya Thackeray and then NCP chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai. After meeting Pawar, Banerjee had said there was no UPA anymore. Raut had defended the Congress and hit out at TMC. The Shiv Sena said only time will tell who will lead the UPA but said it was important to first create an alternative to the BJP. In an editorial in Saamna, the party defended Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, saying despite facing political ridicule, they were fighting it out.  Meanwhile, Sena secretary and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s personal aide Milind Narvekar courted controversy on Monday after he tweeted a photo of Shiv Sainiks who took part in demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. “Thousands of tributes to the sacrifice made by Shiv Sainiks for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya,” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-mamatas-no-upa-remark-raut-to-meet-gandhis/articleshow/88132533.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Sources said the camp will be organised in Hyderabad and all the 108 elected members will be at the camp. Though the BJP has not fielded a candidate, the party is keeping a close watch as it is exploring the possibility of supporting independent candidate Sardar Ravinder Singh, who is close to Huzurabad MLA and former health minister Eatala Rajender. The party’s top brass, including Telangana BJP affairs in-charge Tarun Chug, discussed the strategy and decided to closely monitor the emerging political situation in Karimnagar. The BJP’s strategy was to make all seven independents to work in favour of Ravinder Singh. However, there is a section within the BJP which is divided over extending support to Ravinder Singh for the Karimnagar MLC seat. They raised the issue with the party high command, following which three senior observers from the state party were dispatched to the district on Monday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mlc-polls-bjp-to-hold-camp-in-hyd/articleshow/88131796.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||NIA chargesheet in Antilia explosives scare case silent on Param Bir Singh-Sachin Waze nexus||MUMBAI: The city police’s chargesheet in the extortion case speaks about the nexus between suspended IPS officer Param Bir Singh and dismissed cop Sachin Waze, but the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) chargesheet in the Antilia explosives planting case is silent on their proximity.Waze, who was assistant police inspector before his dismissal, is the central character in both cases. In the extortion case, Singh, then Mumbai police commissioner is a co-accused, and the chargesheet speaks about Waze extorting money from bookies and restaurant owners for him. In February, when the Antilia explosives case came to light, Waze, who was part of the crime intelligence unit, reported to Singh against the norms. On February 25, an SUV with 20 gelatin sticks was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence, Antilia, and on March 4, the body of the SUV owner, Mansukh Hiran, was found in Kalwa creek. The NIA probe had also found that before and after the murder of Hiran, Singh had held meetings with Waze and former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, also a co-accused in the murder conspiracy. The NIA had recorded Singh’s statements as part of its probe. One of the witness, a cyber expert, in his statement had mentioned about an attempt by Singh to show the explosives planting as part of a terror threat, which reportedly had its origin in Tihar jail. According to the witness, Singh offered him Rs 5 lakh to make a report on these lines. The cyber expert had further said that he was asked to mention that Jaish-ul-Hind used Telegram, a messaging platform, to communicate in the explosives case and the blast that took place near the Israel embassy in Delhi in January. The special cell of Delhi Police, probing the terror threat, had found that the Telegram channel used to claim the responsibility for planting of explosives was created from inside Tihar jail. The NIA also found that Singh had spoken to some of the arrested accused using a FaceTime ID ‘Balaji Kurkure’ in April after he was transferred to Home Guards. NIA’s chargesheet talks about two motives—first that Waze wanted to regain his clout as the ace detective/encounter specialist and hence, he conspired with others to place the vehicle with gelatin sticks and a threat note outside Antilia, and second “demand ransom from Ambani family to avoid dire consequences which clearly depicts the motive of Waze for huge monetary gains from the entire conspiracy”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-chargesheet-in-antilia-explosives-scare-case-silent-on-singh-waze-nexus/articleshow/88132909.cms||Ahmed Ali

Thrissur Corporation is the only local body in state that has the independent right to distribute power in areas under it and the protesters – mainly pro-Congress factions – allege that if a company is formed, the corporation will lose the control over power distribution. John Daniel, leader of the pro-Congress trade union in the electricity wing and chairman of the development standing committee at the corporation, alleged that the formation of such a company will eventually lead to privatization. The priority of the company will always be profit and not providing service to the people. It is a sheer hypocrisy that CPM is often seen campaigning against privatization in the power sector, but the LDF-ruled corporation is taking initiative in the opposite direction, he alleged. But, mayor MK Varghese denied the allegation and said he had only prepared a preliminary draft on the measures to be taken to strengthen the electricity wing of the corporation when KSEB itself has become a company. It is not a decision, not even a formal proposal, and no decision will be taken without wide consultations with all stakeholders, he said. The mayor said if the electricity wing of the corporation becomes a company, it will be possible to buy power from different sources and not just KSEB. This is particularly important because there is a significant difference in the price of power generated by different companies. He said the draft proposal moots the formation of a public limited company and not a private one. There will be no denial of benefits to employees or consumers, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/thrissur-corporations-power-firm-idea-sparks-row/articleshow/88131813.cms||---

The defence said that the ED officers were acting like script writers. Opposing his plea, ED had earlier said that Hrishikesh, with the help of Delhi-based shell companies, assisted his father in laundering tainted money and projected it as untainted by showing it as donations received by the family-owned Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha. The defence, however, denied the allegations. Defence advocate Vikram Chaudhri called the case malicious. During arguments on the plea on Saturday, the defence had contended that since former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh was granted relief by the Supreme Court, Hrishikesh who, it said, was an innocent citizen could also be granted protection from arrest. The hearing on the plea will resume on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukh-son-denies-charges-in-pre-arrest-bail-petition/articleshow/88132936.cms||---

The accused has vividly described the manner in which he had sodomised children and shared their photos. The accused was found to be unsuccessful in his attempt to sodomise a child. As the matter is at preliminary stage, the accused cannot be released on bail,” the court held. The court observed that, “The offences under the Protection Of Children From Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) are very serious and merely because they are punishable with a sentence of less than five years in the instant case, the court cannot be liberal in granting bail to the accused at least until the victim is examined. Here the sexual harassment complained of is depraving in nature that would shock the mind of a young boy”. The accused was found transmitting obscene material depicting children in sexually explicit acts. “I have noted that the electronic records produced by the prosecution corroborate this fact, prima facie. The learned special public prosecutor has stated that the accused is a paedophile and there is every probability that if he is released on bail he will commit similar offences in future. The accusation of paedophilia is corroborated by the report of AIIMS produced along with the chargesheet,” the court stated. The accused was taken into custody by the CBI on June 24 from his residence at Bhiwandi, Thane and after his father filed a habeas corpus writ petition before the Bombay high court on July 3, the accused was taken to Panaji and was arrested on July 5, 2021. The court noted that the CBI kept changing its stand. “It is pertinent to note that the respondent CBI has kept on changing its stand right from day 1, i.e. registration of the FIR u/s 14 of the Pocso Act, 2012 along with 67-B of the Information Technology Act in addition to section 14 of Pocso Act and 67-B of I.T Act at the time of requesting remand/custody of the applicant before this court in their remand application and finally section 12 and 15 of the Pocso Act, 2012 along with 67-B of the Information Technology Act at the time of filing of chargesheet,” the court noted. Counsel for the accused submitted that the offence refers to 2013 and 2014 and that there was nothing on record to show that the offence continued till date. Similarly at the same time there Was nothing on record to show that the offence was committed by the applicant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panaji-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-accused-in-child-pornography-case/articleshow/88132584.cms||---

Three accused — Pradeep Kumar and Afghan nationals Saeed Mohammed and Fardeen Ameri — were produced before the special judge by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and its prosecutor Amit Nair requested 15-day custodial interrogation of them. He submitted that the trio was first arrested by the Delhi DRI in connection with the smuggling of 1,000kg of heroin in June. Their alleged involvement in the smuggling came to light after DRI seized 2,988kg of heroin and began its investigation. During the investigation of the drug haul at Mundra, DRI sleuths came to know about 1,000kg of heroin smuggled into India. The contraband was stocked at a godown in Alipur in Delhi and dispatched after purifying it. DRI arrested these three accused persons from Delhi. DRI officials could recover only 16kg of heroin and the rest had been distributed across India and to other countries. After the Mundra drug haul case was transferred to the NIA on October 6, the Delhi case was also handed over to the NIA on October 25. The NIA obtained a production warrant for the three accused for interrogation in the Mundra case. The reason for investigating the trio in the Mundra case is that the probe agency found that the importers and exporters of both consignments were the same. The probe agency wanted to find out the channels of payment, distribution channels and who bought the stock as only 16kg was recovered. Earlier, the NIA obtained custodial interrogation of four persons — the owners of Aashi Trading Company, Machvaram Sudhakar and Govnd Raju Durga Kurna Vaishali and Rajkumar P. The fourth accused to be arrested and sent to remand was an Afghan national, Mohammed Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nia-gets-custody-of-3-more-for-mundra-drug-haul/articleshow/88131841.cms||---

Such gatherings could be super spreader events especially after the reports of the new Covid variant Omicron in Maharashtra, officials told TOI. ASI officials said that nearly 2,000-3,000 people have been visiting Janjira, a sea fort in Raigad district, at any point in time during weekends, and a similar number was reported to have visited Sinhagad fort in Pune on Sunday, without following Covid appropriate behaviour. Photographs shared by ASI officials showed a crowd at the entrance to Janjira fort and the boating area from where they take ferries to reach the fort on Sunday. They were without masks or physical distancing and the boats carried over 30-40 people at a time instead of the 10 or 12 allowed. A senior ASI official told TOI, “We have been having unruly crowds visiting the Janjira fort who do not listen even if told to wear masks and maintain physical distancing. There aren’t many ASI personnel to control the crowd at the fort. District authorities should provide additional manpower to check the numbers visiting the fort as well as their adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour.” Boats used to go to the fort are overloaded, the official said. “The last two to three weekends have been witnessing the maximum crowd. The private agency deployed for boating activity here has been taking in the maximum people onboard to offset losses during the Covid lockdown,” he said. Another ASI official said that the authorities of their apex body have spoken to the Raigad district authorities and sent emails to address the crowding, but no steps have been taken so far. On ASI’s role in controlling the crowds and capping the number of tickets sold at Janjira fort, the official said, “The crowd is so unruly that many gain entry to the monument without buying tickets. There are many more people than the tickets sold. There are fights when the limited ASI personnel at the ticket counter try to stop their entry,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/asi-alert-about-crowding-at-forts-lax-covid-norms/articleshow/88131840.cms||Neha Madaan

They gave a representation of their demands to the collector. “We have sought permission from the city police commissioner’s office to allow us to sit on a dharna at the AMC head office in Danilimda. We have been granted the permission to sit on a dharna inside the premises from Wednesday,” said Jagdish Shah, a multi-purpose health worker (MPHW) who is one of the 1,100 medical and paramedical staff sacked by the civic body. On December 3, protesting health workers were detained for entire day when they tried to organize a protest at Satyagrah Chhavni in Sector 6 of Gandhinagar. “The paramedical staff recruited for Mohalla Clinics were on 11-month contract and were paid Rs 10,000 per month salary. Their salaries were paid from Emergency Covid Response Plan grant which was stopped from June. The Union government in June had asked state governments to not renew such contracts if the Covid situation is under control. We continued their services so far but a recent letter from the National Health Mission asked us clearly to end the contract,” said an AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sacked-amc-health-workers-hold-silent-protest/articleshow/88131849.cms||---

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will conduct it in association with Bajaj FinServ Ltd. Using its corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, the company donated around one lakh Covishield doses to the civic body on Monday. According to the PMC officials, around 8-10 lakh beneficiaries, who had taken their first jab in September, would be eligible for the second dose in December. The mega vaccination drive will offer them convenient slots across 180 vaccination sites. PMC’s chief immunisation officer Suryakant Devkar told TOI, “We received around one lakh doses from Bajaj group on Monday. So, we shall be starting our vaccination drive from Tuesday. It will continue until we exhaust our stock of these one lakh doses, after which another one lakh doses would be provided by the Bajaj group.” Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said citizens should come forward and get vaccinated at the earliest, after six Omicron patients were detected in the civic limits.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has kept the College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) jumbo hospital ready. A delegation of civic administration recently visited the facility to review the hospital’s preparedness. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) too has kept the Magar hospital on standby mode. “The infrastructure is ready. If needed, the facility can be opened for admission within 24 hours. The civic body has asked the operators to complete the facility’s fire and electricity audits,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official, who is coordinating the upkeep of the facility. He said other facilities such as the Covid centre in Baner and Naidu hospital were currently available for the patients. Nearly 50 patients were using these facilities. Muthe said that the oxygen supply system, security facilities and ambulance service had been kept ready. PMC had given the agency’s contract an extension in August for the CoEP facility. As per the proposal, around Rs2 crore per month would be spent on the facility. PMC officials said the structural audit was conducted recently, following which the decision for extension was taken. According PMC officials, the demand for oxgen beds and ventilators had gone down in July. So, the empty facility was closed down. “The civic facilities will be kept ready as a precautionary measure. The jumbo hospital will be kept on standby mode. If needed, it will be made opertational,” said Rajesh Patil, the PCMC commissioner.

This is meant to ease the chaos at the Covid-19 testing counters and to reduce waiting time for people arriving from countries exposed to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and for whom testing is mandatory. “The number of passengers pre-booking the Covid tests on arrival has been going up every day. In addition to this, more and more passengers are opting for Rapid PCR test over the regular RT-PCR tests,” said Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, CEO, Delhi International Airport Limited. “Keeping this in mind, we have installed 120 Rapid PCR test machines and provided 20 dedicated counters for passengers who have pre-booked their tests.” IGIA also plans to hire additional staff for the 60 registration desks for Covid tests it will set up, up from 40 right now, to speed up the process and cater to additional countries likely to be added to the at-risk category. Jaipuriar also claimed that the test results were being provided quickly to minimise waiting time. “The current time taken from sample collection to providing reports stands at 60 minutes for Rapid PCR test and five hours for RT-PCR tests,” he said. “We are also working closely with the immigration authorities to facilitate swift movement of passengers. For those waiting for their test results, seating arrangements have been vastly expanded and food counters have been made available in the waiting area.” Besides the 120 machines for Rapid PCR that take the hourly capacity for Covid tests to 500-600, there also are four sets of fully automated RT-PCR setups with a capacity to carry out approximately 450 tests per hour. “In addition to the 120 Rapid PCR machines, we are also planning to place 30 others in Terminal 3 in order to save an additional time of 30 minutes spent on moving test samples to the main lab at the T3 multilevel parking,” said Chetan Kohli, COO of Genestrings Diagnostics Centre, which is operating the testing facility at IGIA. In recent days, with Omicron leading to compulsory testing for passengers arriving from listed countries, there have been complaints about crowding, inadequate facilities and inordinate delays related to the tests. Amid rumours about passengers cancelling tickets because of the long hours of waiting for test results, TOI got some data on the passenger load at the airport in the last few days. According to the figures received from the airport, on December 1, 2, 3 and 4, the total passengers at the airport, respectively, was approximately 1.54 lakh, 1.55 lakh, 1.6 lakh and 1.7 lakh. The airport staff said the passenger load has remained around the same since then. At the testing facility for departing passengers, TOI spoke to a few people. Deepak Jain was flying to Dubai and said he faced not problems, having paid Rs 3,500 for the Rapid PCR test. However, passengers like Paulomi who had opted for the RT-PCR test available at Rs 500, appeared aggrieved at the long wait for the results.

The doctors said the symptoms of the Omicron variant were mostly different from that of the Delta variant, which dominated the second wave of Covid-19. The doctors claimed that the criticality is much less in Omicron than in the Delta variant. "All nine patients are stable. While some of them are asymptomatic, others have mild symptoms. They do not have complications and are on the path of recovery," Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal, and controller of SMS medical college, told TOI. The doctors are conducting their tests, including HRCT and other tests such as D-dimer, but none of them reported any complications. In Omicron-positive patients, involvement of lungs has not been found yet, which was quite common among Delta patients. "None of the nine patients have lost their taste or smell. This is unlike the Delta variant. Also, none of them has any difficulty in breathing and they do not require any oxygen," said Dr Bhandari, who added that they are constantly monitoring the situation in South Africa, where the Omicron variant is taking a toll on the health of the people. "In South Africa, out of 1,000 patients, only 4.9% required ICU beds. The criticality is less in the case of Omicron, but manifold transmissibility and infectivity is a concern," said Dr Bhandari. Since omicron has entered the state, Dr Bhandari said two doses of vaccination is important as those who are doubly vaccinated have very mild symptoms. The doctor also urged residents to follow Covid appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/omicron-has-mild-symptoms-no-loss-of-taste-smell-docs/articleshow/88143697.cms||---

In Omicron-positive patients, involvement of lungs has not been found yet, which was quite common among Delta patients. "None of the nine patients have lost their taste or smell. This is unlike the Delta variant. Also, none of them has any difficulty in breathing and they do not require any oxygen," said Dr Bhandari, who added that they are constantly monitoring the situation in South Africa, where the Omicron variant is taking a toll on the health of the people. "In South Africa, out of 1,000 patients, only 4.9% required ICU beds. The criticality is less in the case of Omicron, but manifold transmissibility and infectivity is a concern," said Dr Bhandari. Since omicron has entered the state, Dr Bhandari said two doses of vaccination is important as those who are doubly vaccinated have very mild symptoms. The doctor also urged residents to follow Covid appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/omicron-has-mild-symptoms-no-loss-of-taste-smell-docs/articleshow/88131854.cms||---

These may be early days but some hotels have started witnessing booking cancellations even though the numbers are small as of now.Surendra Singh Shahpura, executive member of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Rajasthan (HRAR) said, “We don’t expect much disruption in December as the weddings that have been booked are going to happen. In the second half of the month, there will be new year rush which so far remains unaffected. But what is going to happen in January will all depend on how the new variant behaves.”Representatives of the hospitality industry said that the some weddings booked for January and February have been cancelled, but currently the numbers are small. However, those who had already booked are renegotiating details in the event of a government advisory or full-blown third wave.Ranvijay Singh, another executive member of HRAR, said, “Nobody wants to lose in a situation where they don’t have any control. If the variant spreads fast and government imposes restrictions again to control it, the size and manner in which the weddings have been planned will change. In a worst case, weddings may not happen at all. No one wants to take a chance and enter into disputes. That’s why they are willing to renegotiate keeping in kind various situations.” He said that some weddings have been cancelled even though the numbers are small. In the past couple of months, the industry had returned to normalcy. The tariffs, which had fallen to rock-bottom levels, had risen to pre-Covid days. The city hotels generally become first of the lot to feel the heat when the pandemic spreads. But promoters of resorts on the outskirts of the city said there is no cancellations as of now.Sunil Mehta, promoter of resorts, said, “We are going full house and our tariffs have increased by 10-15% compared to the pre-Covid levels. As of now, the business is doing pretty good. We have not witnessed any cancellations.” Because of the uncertainty of the pandemic, most hotels are offering refunds against cancellations. Some are giving credit notes which they can utilise later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/variant-pushes-people-to-renegotiate-with-hotels-over-wedding-bookings/articleshow/88131865.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The five-day programme was to help teachers understand and participate in the process leading up to implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. “NITI Aayog is presently in the process of understanding the challenges which are likely to be faced by the teachers in NEP implementation by conducting webinars and seminars. Through this programme, the teacher’s perspectives and challenges were documented and can be submitted to NITI Aayog for better planning the implementation,” said G Shriniwas, the assistant regional director of the Panaji centre of IGNOU, who was coordinator for the faculty development programme. The areas covered at the programme were teacher training for NEP implementation, effective teaching, research-oriented approach in teaching, futuristic education initiatives in NEP and multidisciplinary thinking. Another area of focus of the faculty development programme was also to highlight for teachers NEP’s recommendations to practice education which is based on Indian ethos. Kameshwari Moorty, regional director, IGNOU, was the main organizer of the programme. “The larger goal of the programme was to understand the challenges and difficulties in implementing NEP with a teacher’s perspective which puts forth a completely new arena to the existing conservative approach to education. The programme was planned as a two-way interaction and was group discussion based to understand and document the challenges and the role of the teacher in implementation of NEP,” the organisers said. With NEP, the government’s intention is to double the gross enrolment ratio to 50% by 2035 at the higher education level. Under the policy, higher education institutes will have only one umbrella regulatory body called the higher education commission, which will have more teeth and it will govern academic standards with penal powers. This is expected to help in streamlining the higher education sector to a large extent. The policy encourages a multidisciplinary approach at the higher education level and will not rigidly compartmentalise streams like at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/200-teachers-get-lesson-on-effective-teaching-futuristic-edu/articleshow/88132601.cms||---

According to Banjara Hills police, Rohit and Suman first attended a party in a bar near Durgam Cheruvu, which they left around 8pm. From there, the two went to another bar on Road No. 45 in Jubilee Hills. “The accident happened around 1.20am when they were on their way to a hotel on Road No. 2 in Banjara Hills,” said Banjara Hills inspector P Shiva Chandra. After the accident, Rohit drove the car to Road No. 5 in Jubilee Hills and parked it in the cellar of an apartment where his friend lives. But a police team, which took photos of the damaged Porsche travelling in the wrong direction, alerted the night duty SI after hearing an alert about the accident at Banjara Hills, leading to their arrest.

---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh asked for my help, his claims ‘mischievous’: Maharashtra DGP to SC||MUMBAI: Director general of police (DGP) of Maharashtra Sanjay Pandey, in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court, denied as “false and mischievous” the allegation that he had advised former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh not to fight the system. Pandey said it was Singh who had reached out to him and pleaded for help, and said he was in no position to comm-unicate with the state. “I bona fide suggested that I could try and convey to the state on behalf of the petitioner [Singh] whatever he decided or wanted to do,” said Pandey, in a 29-page counter-affidavit filed by his lawyer Samrat Shinde. Pandey denied the allegations that he had offered to mediate between the state and Singh and that he had initiated the topic of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The DGP also denied that there was any quid pro quo whatsoever that was ever discussed and said that he received no instructions from the state with regard to the conversations between Singh and him. Pandey had been named as the officer for the preliminary enquiry ordered against Singh on April 1. Singh “represented to me that he was meeting me in my capacity as his senior officer and colleague…I did not volunteer or gratuitously offer any advice or intercede,” said the DGP, adding that Singh told him “he was in great tension” after writing a letter to the chief minister on March 20 and the fallout of his action. Singh, Pandey said, “regretted doing so and begged me for my guidance and for a solution to the predicament” he was in. Pandey said Singh “indulged in blatant falsehoods” wi-th regard to content and context in which certain conversations did take place between them on April 15 and 18. “It is apparent that the narrative of the petitioner [Singh] is a blatant concoction to suit his own false narrative with clear ulterior motives…of defeating and derailing the enquiries against him,” said Pandey seeking dismissal of Singh’s special leave petition against the Bombay high court order of September 16. The HC had dismissed Singh’s challenge to two preliminary enquiries for alleged violation of All India Service (Conduct) Rules following his letter to the CM alleging “corrupt malpractice” by Deshmukh. The HC had said Singh could approach the Central Administrative Tribunal with his grievances. Pandey had been appointed by the state to conduct the PEs, but had withdrawn when Singh filed his petition before the HC. Singh, in a letter to the CBI on April 19, alleged that on April 15, he had met Pandey for a “courtesy call” and was advised by him to withdraw his letter or face consequences as the state intended to take action. Singh had also said he had transcripts of the conversation. But Pandey said, “It is crucial to note that the so-called transcripts of recorded conversations have conveniently not been annexed to the petition [by Singh]” and he had “produced only extracts” even in the letter to CBI, which is annexed to the petition. Pandey denied Singh’s claims that he had said the state was contemplating to generate fictitious complaints against Singh, or that he would be in a position to seek relief for Singh from the state. Pandey said he was “not the punishing authority”, and hence Singh’s allegations of purported advice by him are “misleading”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/param-bir-asked-for-my-help-his-claims-mischievous-in-mumbai-dgp-to-sc/articleshow/88132950.cms||---

Thakor said more than 50 lakh youth in the state are unemployed even as the state government has been implementing the contract system of appointments. He added that the party will raise the issue of rising prices across the state in the coming days. The new LOP, Sukhram Rathwa, said the party will raise the issues of farmers both in the assembly and on the streets. “The Union government spoke of doubling the income of farmers, but their income has halved because of the BJP’s policies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/we-will-contest-assembly-polls-as-team-congress-thakor/articleshow/88131869.cms||---

To register protest for ignoring Gairsain as the venue for the assembly session, Congress has announced a protest in the summer capital on December 9. "We will also be going there to find out the Rs 25,000 crore package that had been announced by former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat for Gairsain. According to our information, no development has been carried out. BJP is quick to take credit for the works of the Congress but fails to deliver commitments made to the people," former CM Harish Rawat said at a press conference on Monday. Rawat attacked the BJP government for failing to conduct the two-day session at Gairsain. "Therefore, both state chief Ganesh Godiyal and I are going to Gairsain to check whether it is cold there or not. It is shameful that fearing the cold weather conditions, the BJP government has changed the venue of the winter session that was slated as the summer capital," he added. Rawat also strongly criticised the gherao and attack on former minister Yashpal Arya and his son Sanjeev. "Casteist slurs were hurled at the Congress leader and it is shameful. Rather than taking action against those responsible, the BJP government is more keen on proving that the attack was done by Congress itself," said the former CM. Meanwhile, Jai Hind Jai Bharat Party has extended its support to the Congress in Uttarakhand for next year's assembly polls. The members of the political outfit claimed that they have supported the Congress in Uttar Pradesh as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/congress-to-stage-protest-for-ignoring-gairsain-as-venue-for-assembly-session/articleshow/88131162.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Goa||Contempt plea filed in SC in Tamnar matter||Panaji: Goa Foundation, an environment NGO, has filed a contempt plea in the Supreme Court of India seeking action be taken against the South Goa Collector, senior officials of the forest department, chief secretary and former secretary to the chief minister, Krishnamurti and Tamnar officials “for deliberate violation of the court's orders forbidding conversion certificates for any land in excess of one hectare and having a tree density of more than 10 percent”. The order dated February 4, 2015 was passed in an appeal filed by Goa Foundation against an order issued by the national green tribunal, Pune bench. The petitioner has stated that the Tamnar 400 kV HTL project promoters purchased over 10 ha of land in Sangod from private persons in 2018 where the plot contained more than 2,849 trees, 90% of which were forest species. Goa Foundation alleged that Tamnar was required to apply for forest clearance but did not do so, and further alleged that together with forest officials a file was created to get the 2,849 trees felled under the Goa Preservation of Trees Act, 1984. When the request was denied by the deputy conservator of forests (DCF) on the ground that the Act doesn’t permit felling of more than 1 ha at a time and not more than 2 ha per year, to bypass this requirement, the forest department raised a rule to exempt the entire plot from the purview of the Goa preservation of Trees Act, 1984 where the file was not signed by the CM who was ailing at the time, but by his principal secretary who signed on his behalf without having authority in law to do so. After the government granted the exemption, the forest department issued the licence to fell the 2,849 trees to enable Tamnar authorities to apply for conversion, thus bypassing the Supreme Court’s order of February 4, 2015, the petitioner claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/contempt-plea-filed-in-sc-in-tamnar-matter/articleshow/88132615.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A senior citizen Noel Dias Sapeco in 2014 complained that “the forcible and deliberate closure” of the underground parking of the building premises of Edcon Towers at Menezes Braganza Road in Panaji violated his basic human rights. In 2014, in a complaint to the mayor of the corporation of the city of Panaji (CCP), he stated that as a result of the closure of the underground parking, he as a senior citizen who suffers from arthritis in both his legs has to hunt for parking outside the complex and hence approached the commission for action against Edcon Real estate Developers “for deprivation of human rights”. Edcon denied they had forcibly and deliberately closed the parking in the basement or that they had sold parking spaces.  In 2014, the deputy commissioner of CCP had ordered the builders to keep the access open for parking on both sides of the ramp. Advocate S Sapeco representing the complainant argued that forcible closure of the underground parking by the builder amounted to violation of the human rights of the complainant. On the other hand, advocate S Rivonkar representing Edcon, submitted that the sale deed under which the complainant purchased two premises in the building specifically states that the purchaser has not been allotted any car parking slot in the basement and the purchaser shall not use any slot in the basement for parking his vehicles. “In the facts of the present case, the Commission finds that the dispute raised by the complainant is a civil dispute between him and respondent No 3 (Edcon Real Estate Developers), in respect of he not being allowed the underground parking slots in the building. This is not a case where respondents 1 and 2 (member secretary NGPDA and commissioner of CCP) can be said to have violated any human rights of the complainant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parking-space-closure-not-violation-of-human-rights/articleshow/88132634.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Over the weekend, the Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICAI) stated the July exam that was postponed multiple times this year and then merged with the December attempt, would indeed be held from December 8 to 15, but only in 93 cities. The president said due to some glitch, the exam would not be held in four cities and they would be only partially offered in 11. Candidates from such cities would have to take the exam from January 3. “Nothing is in pen and paper today. We want to go global,” ICAI president P Raju Iyer. Ashwinkumar Dalwadi, a council member said, “We have decided that henceforth, our exams are going to be computer based. We have to progress. There could be anxiousness among students and we are ready to address them.” The June attempt of the bi-annual exam was pushed due to Covid. Both the CA institute and the CS institute, though, managed to take in-person exams. “There was no clear communication for months from the ICAI on when the exams would be held and there were so many dates floating around,” said an aspirant from Mumbai. “Students had a hard time because of complete lack of information. Suddenly, it was decided to merge the two attempts and the ICAI announced that exams would be held in December,” said Jinesh Shah, a faculty member. There were other troubles. The institute has not got enough centres to run the exam. In some cases, computers offered were old machines that were slow and not compatible with the exam software and certain centres were not available for the entire stretch of the exam week. “While this is a professional exam, we are not accustomed to solving problems on computer. This was a sudden decision to hold the computer-based exam and was not notified to us,” said another aspirant. Students had moved the Supreme Court seeking its direction to conduct all CMA exams offline. SC refused to intervene and said the decision by the institute will be final and binding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-from-now-cost-accounting-exam-on-pc-not-paper/articleshow/88132969.cms||Hemali Chhapia

At least 10 districts were reporting single-digit active cases. The state now has 6,853 active cases, lowest since April-end last year. Among the districts with less than 50 active cases are Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Jalgaon, Nandurbar, Dhule, Jalna, Parbhani, Hingoli, Nanded, Osmanabad, Amravati. On the other hand, districts such as Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur and Osmanabad were reporting triple digit active Covid cases nearly a month ago, when the state’s tally of active cases was nearly double at 14,714 cases. A public health department official told TOI, “Despite a few Covid cases of Omicron variant in Maharashtra, it should not be ignored that the infections continue to drop in the state with the second wave ebbing. There has been no rise in cases. We have been told to increase Covid testing in view of the Omicron variant. But daily detections continue to be low.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, told TOI, “The number of cases in districts as well as state continues to be low. The emergence of a new variant should not create a panic situation. Citizens must have faith in the health measures being undertaken by authorities, which seem to be working well. With the help of these measures, people infected by the Omicron variant are being identified and isolated at entry points, precluding the possibility of such cases slipping into the population.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coronavirus-caseload-below-50-in-22-districts/articleshow/88131871.cms||Neha Madaan

There are so many infirmities, discrepancies with regard to seizure memos, panchanamas and attachment of the pendrives, CDs etc,” the court held. Mohan Naik, while working as DySP crime branch, Dona Paula, received a complaint from Kashinath Shetye and 12 others in writing informing that the present accused, who worked as a police sub-inspector, was caught on camera selling drugs to foreign national girls. One of the girls was seen holding charas in the said camera footage, which was broadcast by media on local cable network news channel in Goa in January 2011. The case was subsequently transferred to CBI. The allegation was that Gudlar had demanded and accepted illegal gratification and valuables from Ayala Driham, sister of David Drihan alias Dudu who was caught for allegedly carrying drugs. The court found that the original recording of the sting operation remained in Neil’s camera, who went to Israel, and thereafter there was no contact with him by the investigating agency. “…therefore, such procedure followed by the investigation officer is clearly unacceptable for the purpose of proving electronic record/documents. No efforts were made to find out Neil’s whereabouts together with his camera in which allegedly the sting operation was recorded. “… Similarly, Ayala’s laptop, in which she allegedly transferred the video recording, is also not attached. The discrepancies are many and counting. Therefore, it is hard to believe the contention raised by the investigation officer with regard to the procedure adopted by him in conducting such investigation,” Justice B P Deshpande stated. The court found that the pendrives and CDs attached are copies made by different persons on different occasions by modifying earlier documents, and stated that unless such copies are attached with the certificate as provided under Section 65-B of Evidence Act, they have no evidential value. Counsel representing Gudlar, advocate G Telles submitted that the video clipping or audio clipping handed over to CBI cannot be looked into as evidence as it is not primary evidence and there is no certificate produced by the investigating agency under the Evidence Act proving it as secondary evidence. The court found that Driham‘s statements as far as the video clip is concerned, goes to show that it was “modified, tampered and the sub titles were added in it in order to air it on Israeli media. Such a clip cannot be considered as original electronic document as the witness admitted that these are copies made from time to time. There is absolutely no material on record to show why there are sub titles and titles in Israel language appearing in the said clip and who inserted it, the court found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panaji-court-slams-cbi-while-acquitting-former-anc-cop-gudlar-in-drugs-case/articleshow/88132624.cms||---

---||Pune||Private hospitals in Pune start logging travel history of patients||PUNE: Several private hospitals in the city have started recording travel history of people walking into the out-patient department (OPD), especially for the treatment of common seasonal ailments or flu-like illness, after seven Covid cases of Omicron variant were confirmed in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) on Sunday.  “The reported Omicron cases in India are sporadic and mainly related to travellers or their close contacts. There is no community spread as witnessed in South Africa and Botswana. Taking down travel history is a key measure, especially for hospitals and doctors. Patients should not unmask while talking,” Maharashtra Covid task force expert Shashank Joshi on Monday. “Lots of people are travelling to meet their near ones settled in the US and Europe and so are they visiting India to meet their relatives. The wedding season has further spurred the travellers' numbers. Taking down patients' travel history is a key measure,” he said. Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’ Hospital Board of India, said, “Many times, travellers or their close or secondary contacts reveal their history to neighbourhood doctors or general practitioners. But the doctors do not know how to report that case to the health officials.” Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said, “We are recording the travel history of patients visiting our OPD. We are not only taking down travel history to the at-risk countries but to any nation.” Vinod Sawantwadkar, CEO, Jehangir hospital said, “We have also started taking down travel history.” Chief intensivist Vilas Gundecha of Inlaks and Budhrani hospital said, “We are also doing the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-hospitals-start-logging-travel-history-of-patients/articleshow/88131899.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Doctors’ stir at top public hospitals cripples services||NEW DELHI: Patient services, including elective surgeries and trauma care, were severely affected at Delhi’s top public hospitals — Safdarjung, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML), Lady Hardinge and others — on Monday as resident doctors stayed away from work to protest against the delay in NEET-PG counselling. Services were also affected partially at Lok Nayak, Guru Teg Bahadur and other hospitals where resident doctors decided to boycott OPDs. “We will continue protesting until the government meets our demands. Till now, we have only got assurances,” said Dr Anuj Aggarwal, general secretary of Resident Doctors’ Association of Safdarjung Hospital. At RML, the resident doctors said their protest would continue on Tuesday. “Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya met us and appealed to call off the strike based on his verbal assurance to expedite the NEET-PG counselling. We informed him that the agitation would continue till a written assurance was given,” said an RDA member. Hundreds of patients who had come to seek treatment had to return or wait for hours to get medical attention. Some of them were critically ill. Virendra, a kidney patient, was writhing in pain outside Safdarjung Hospital even as his mother struggled to get him admitted. After hours of wait, he was advised to go to AIIMS. Uttam Kumar, a resident of Sultanpuri, had rushed his wife to the emergency unit of Safdarjung Hospital as she was facing breathing difficulty. But she couldn’t be admitted. Dr Sunil Kumar, director general of health services, appealed to the resident doctors in the evening to call off the strike. “Strike is not a solution. Rather, it is the problem as it accentuates a patient’s plight and harasses them beyond imagination. It’s the most avoidable method of agitation,” he added. The protests have been going on since last month. “We had met the Union health minister in November and he had assured action, but nothing happened. On Saturday again, we again intimated the authorities about our planned strike, but to no avail,” said a doctor at GTB Hospital. In a letter to Mandaviya, Federation of Resident Doctors' Association had on Saturday said healthcare institutions across the country were running short of workforce with no admissions done in the current academic year. “With the Covid-19 pandemic waves looming large, the situation will be disastrous for the healthcare sector and the country’s population,” it added. “There seems to be no initiative or measure taken yet for expediting the (NEET-PG) counselling. Therefore, we have decided to escalate our agitation further and withdraw all services (routine and emergency) in healthcare institutions from Monday,” stated the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/docs-stir-at-top-public-hospitals-cripples-services/articleshow/88131906.cms||---

While digital assets are virtual assets, such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and related technologies, ‘Web 3.0’ refers to a decentralised internet that draws on blockchain technology. “We believe that the bulk of this $1.1 trillion in economic growth for India over these 11 years would be derived from ancillary digital asset-related businesses that are yet to be invented. Digital assets have tremendous potential based on just what we know today – they are able to power more frictionless global financial services and foster financial inclusion by lowering barriers to entry,” the report titled ‘India’s $1.1 trillion digital asset opportunity,’ explained. It pointed out that blockchain technology has the potential to contribute to government projects, the digital identity segment as well as payments & remittances sector. While government-related blockchain projects’ contribution to GDP is expected to increase from $0.1 billion in 2021 to $5.1 billion in 2032, the digital identity segment would contribute $8.2 billion to GDP in 2032. Similarly, the payments and remittances sector will contribute nearly $21.7 billion to the country's GDP in 2032. The report highlighted that investors too are betting big on the digital assets economy as $270 million of corporate funding has been invested in the digital asset sector and around $6.6 billion has been invested by over 15 million retail investors. Interestingly, 75% of digital asset investors in India are aged between 18 to 35 years. Commenting on the report, Kapil Rathi, co-founder and CEO of CrossTower, said, “…With Web 3.0, India has the opportunity to harness its core resources -- its tech savvy youth -- to be a global leader in digital assets and Web 3.0. With the right policies and regulatory framework, India's regulators can bring safety, combined with hope and prosperity to India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/blockchain-web-3-0-to-power-indias-digital-asset-economy-says-report/articleshow/88131890.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Hyderabad||Indian wild hares related to Burmese, Hainan ones: Study||HYDERABAD: The Laboratory for the Conservation of Endangered Species (LaCONES) — Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), has found that the Indian wild hare is closely related to Burmese hare and Hainan hare of China. The laboratory is conducting genetic studies of Indian wild hare as part of conservation measures. According to LaCONES scientists, wild hares adapt to diverse environments and their position in the food chain makes them an integral part of the ecosystem. “Being an important prey, they are crucial for the survival of bigger predators and for maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. The species is subjected to various threats like habitat fragmentation, predation, intensive hunting, competition with livestock and human-induced fires and is a potential model to study various zoonotic diseases and climate change,” said LaCONES scientists. There is a vast information gap for the species with no available genetic data. The study was conducted by senior scientist Ajay Gaur and his team to assess the phylogenetic position of the Indian wild hare and to evaluate its evolutionary affinities with other species of genus Lepus using DNA markers.  The preliminary analysis revealed that Indian wild hares have close evolutionary relationships with Burmese and Hainan hares. “Efforts are being made to sequence the complete mitogenome of Indian wild hare. The study will help bridge the information gap and lay a foundation for future genetic studies related to this species and the genus Lepus,” LaCONES said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indian-wild-hares-related-to-burmese-hainan-ones-study/articleshow/88131901.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Panchayat member Laxman Kavlekar, who led the group of residents, said, “The people in office should take responsibility for the mess created by his department. The common man is being harassed and we are not able to understand how the department can charge such high fees for using water.” Protesting residents presented the bills calculated for three months ranging from Rs 4,000 to even Rs 18,000. Widows and senior citizens said that they could hardly manage to run their houses and such harassment by the government was like a punishment to them. The protesting people refused to move out of the cabin of assistant engineer Nilesh Paigunkar, untill their water bills were changed. Later, Vasco police had to intervene to handle the situation. Paigunkar said it was the PWD which had hiked the charges and that they have been charged accordingly. “The bills are high in a few cases as the users might have used that much water or there must be leakages in their pipeline,” he said. The agitated locals said that they would visit the office again and asked Paigunkar to make the necessary changes in their bills. Protesting locals presented the bills calculated for three months ranging from Rs 4,000 to even Rs 18,000.

---||Goa||Ponda villagers unhappy with tardy pace of work on sewerage pipeline||Ponda: Haphazard system of road digging by sewerage project contractors for the past six years has caused resentment among Ponda locals. The work of road digging to lay the sewerage pipeline had commenced in 2016. The area that covers Ponda town and part of Kavlem village panchayat is nearly 20 sqkm with a 114-km pipeline network. The Sewerage and Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa (SIDCGL) had engaged around six contractors, who have been working for the past six years, to lay the pipeline network, yet a small stretch from Ponda civil court to Kavlem Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) is pending. A corporation official said that the work of the stretch has been delayed as they have hit a hard basaltic rock at Daag Ponda. Work of drilling inside the rock is presently undergoing. Ponda citizens group alleged that the haphazard digging of roads has led to many health problems, including spondylitis and respiratory diseases due to dust particles. Sunil Desai, one of the members of the group, said that the unplanned and haphazard road digging has created hardship to Ponda citizens. “The sewerage corporation could have dug up one road at a time so that people could have used another road. However, the corporation has dug several roads at a time and none of these are fully tarred. The areas that were dug by them have been covered with rubble which creates an unstable, rumbling experience for motorists passing over the rubble stones. Moreover, the dust particles have caused problems to many citizens,” Desai has alleged. Stating that an assistant engineer of SIDCGL has said that the road digging and pipeline network laying work would complete by January, next year, Uday Dangui, another group member, has questioned when would they complete asphalting of all roads. The corporation has also claimed that the 95% work of the plant has already been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-villagers-unhappy-with-tardy-pace-of-work-on-sewerage-pipeline/articleshow/88132627.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: Plea to secondary contacts to get themselves tested for Covid-19||PUNE: Citizens coming in contact with individuals with an international travel history and experiencing flu-like illness should come forward and undergo an RT-PCR test for Covid irrespective of vaccination status, experts said. Health officials have intensified surveillance in the wake of the confirmation of seven Covid cases of Omicron variant in the city. A total of 676 travellers who have returned to the Pune district since November 1 are currently being tracked and tested for Covid-19. Their close contacts are also being screened for Covid. A total of 435 such travellers arrived in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits. Of them, 341 were traced, 288 underwent RT-PCR test and one tested positive for the Omicron variant. In Pimpri Chinhwad civic limits, 138 such travellers arrived and 105 were tracked. As many as 90 were tested and a total of seven were Covid positive. Six of them were infected by the Omicorn variant. As many as 103 travellers landed in rural areas but none tested positive yet. Citizens who came in contact with any international travellers should come forward and get themselves tested on their own, besides following Covid-appropriate behaviour, officials stressed. “It is possible to track primary contacts of the travellers but tracking secondary contacts is an uphill task and not possible without public participation,” said public health expert Sanjeev Wavare, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at PMC. He said, “The infection from Omicron has been seen to be very mild. Hence, there is no need to panic. The main objective is to ensure cases do not spread as Omicron strain spreads faster.” The PMC’s health department has created a dedicated helpline number for international travellers and their close contacts: 020-25506800.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plea-to-secondary-contacts-to-get-themselves-tested/articleshow/88131902.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Police seized 430 gm gold, 1 kilo silver, Rs 20,000 cash, a two-wheeler and two cell phones, all worth Rs 24 lakh from their possession. The sleuths of commissioner’s task force, east and south zone teams along with Nallakunta and Marredpally police arrested three accused who committed 13 offences in Cyberabad, Kamareddy, Nizamabad of Telangana and Maharashtra since 2019. The accused are Shaik Mobin of Pahadishareef, Avinash Aman Jogdekar of Borabonda and Afatab Ahmad Shaik of Saidabad. Mobin and Avinash are burglars and they were involved in six offences at Kamareddy, Chandanagar and Nallakunta since 2019. “Shaik Mobin and Avinash were habitual offenders and were earlier involved in 14 burglaries at Yavatmal and Nagpur of Maharashtra,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said. The duo targeted locked houses near railway tracks to commit burglaries. The third offender, Ahmad Shaik, was involved in seven attention diversion and theft cases at Kamareddy, Nizamabad, Marredpally and Aurangabad in 2021. Since 2006, Ahmad Shaik has committed 41 offences in Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka. According to police, Shaik posed as a cook and by promising to secure a job at his workplace, he lured women to accompany him and asked them to remove their jewellery so that his employer would easily offer them a job. “When the victims would remove the jewellery and give it to Shaik for safe-keeping, the accused would divert their attention and escape with the jewellery,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/valuables-worth-rs-24l-seized-3-held/articleshow/88131904.cms||---

The government resolution (GR) issued on Monday stated, “Rs350 would be charged for samples given at collection centres instead of Rs500. For the same test at Covid care or quarantine centres, the charge would be Rs500 instead of Rs600 and labs would charge Rs700 instead of Rs800 to collect swabs from home. No private laboratory can charge more than the prescribed rates.” Senior public health officials stated that the RT-PCR test charges were slashed for the seventh time since April. At the onset of the pandemic, its price was Rs4,500. Officials stated that there were ample RT-PCR test kits and so the state government decided to bring down the prices of the Covid test. The state government has asked the districts to procure the S-gene test kits, which enables quick detection of the Omicron variant. Apart from Mumbai and Pune, most of the districts were facing shortage of this test kits, the official said. The S-gene test detects the absence of S-gene, which is an indicator of the presence of Omicron variant in a Covid positive patient. Formally known as S-gene Target Failure (SGTF) test, this proxy test can be used for early detection. Earlier, the focus was on conducting this test at airports for international travellers. With Omicron cases emerging in Maharashtra, the districts have been told to procure these kits. On November 30, additional chief secretary Pradeep Vyas wrote to the districts to run the SGTF test for “efficient detection for Omicron”. Instructions were issued to prioritise the SGTF specimens for genomic sequencing and confirmation of Omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-slashes-rt-pcr-test-rates-to-push-up-testing/articleshow/88131907.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner KV Rajendra confirmed that the college had been identified as a Covid Cluster. Nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Ashok H said, “We have effectively isolated the hostel. Those students who have tested positive for novel coronavirus have been quarantined at the hostel. All those who are infected are aged above 18. We have paid a visit to both the girls’ and boys’ hostels, and measures are being taken to prevent the transmission of the virus. So far, we have collected samples from 173 students whom we identified as being primary and secondary contacts of those confirmed infected. All the 173 samples have tested negative for Covid-19. However, all the primary contacts have also been quarantined, while food is being supplied to all those who have been isolated.” Of the nine cases reported at the para-medical college, three were reported on Saturday, while four students were confirmed infected on Sunday and two more were found positive for the novel coronavirus on Monday. “We will collect swab samples from the nine students and subject them to RT-PCR test again after a week’s time,” Dr Ashok said. The nodal officer recalled the outbreak of Covid infection at Navodaya Vidyalaya in Dakshina Kannada, where 16 people tested positive for the novel coronavirus between November 15 and 28. “The health department collected swabs from 231 primary contacts at the institution. As of now, there are three active cases at the educational institution,” he said. Dakshina Kannada district surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh said that the samples of the students who were infected had been sent to a laboratory for genome sequencing. Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) commissioner Akshy Sridhar said, “The students were tested at the behest of the MCC, since directions had been issued to subject all those who had returned to Dakshina Kannada from Kerala in the past 15 days.” DK, Udupi districts report two cases each Meanwhile, barring the two cases reported at the para-medical college, no other fresh Covid-19 case was reported across Dakshina Kannada district. The district recorded a positivity rate of 0.03, while the active caseload dropped to 138 following the discharge of nine patients.

---||Nagpur||In a 1st, tiger enters Karanja Sohol, another a house in Khamgaon city||Nagpur: On November 28, Karanja Sohol, Maharashtra’s second smallest wildlife sanctuary after Lonar, had a new guest — a roaring tiger. Six days later, on December 4, a tiger entered a house in the heart of Khamgaon city in Buldhana district.Both the incidents have perplexed the Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) officials, who are on their toes to find out from where these big cats came from. This is for the first time tigers have entered areas that they had never ventured into earlier.Karanja Sohol (18.32sqkm) notified in 2000 is a blackbuck sanctuary in Sohol village in Karanja in Washim and hence the name Karanja Sohol. On November 28 evening, a tiger was recorded here on camera traps springing a surprise.“The tiger is the new entrant in the sanctuary as its stripe pattern doesn’t match with any of the tigers from either Tipeshwar or Melghat from where we suspected it to have come,” said chief conservator of forests (CCF) & field director Jayoti Banerjee. “Secondly, the image of the Khamgaon tiger caught on CCTV on December 4 at 4.30 am, is blurred and unless we get a clear picture, we cannot identify the animal. We are also not sure whether there are two different tigers or the same tiger that was recorded in Karanja Sohol. The distance between the two spots is 90km as crow flies and it is possible there may be two tigers,” said Banerjee.“With two rapid response teams (RRTs) in place, we are on high alert, but the Khamgaon tiger has not been seen after November 5 evening. Camera traps have been installed and once we get images, the identification could be done. We hope the tiger enters nearby Dnyanganga sanctuary, a safe habitat,” said Akshay Gajbhiye, deputy conservator, Buldhana.Wildlife conservationist Kishor Rithe says, “There may be two tigers. The park managers should also cross-check about the new tiger with Bor and Kawal tiger reserves or the database of Muktai-Bhavani conservation reserve in Jalgaon. In India, due to shrinking habitats and growing numbers, tigers have been inhabiting a wide variety of habitats ranging from the high mountains, mangrove swamps, tall grasslands, zudpi jungles, and even power plants and mining areas. The dispersal of tigers calls for identifying corridors and dire need to strengthen connectivity.”As per the all India tiger estimation (AITE), the big cat numbers have increased from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,967 in 2018. In Maharashtra too, their numbers have gone up from 103 in 2006 to 312 in 2018, a threefold increase in 12 years.Earlier, in June 2019 and 2020, there were two long tiger dispersals from Tipeshwar sanctuary in Pandharkawda in search of mates and territory. T1-C1 aka Walker-I logged over 3,200km to reach Ajanta Hills in Aurangabad and back to Dnyanganga wildlife sanctuary near Khamgaon travelling through eight districts.The Walker-I trail was followed by another tiger T3-C1 aka Walker-II in 2020. The tiger reached Gautala Autramghat, 70km from Aurangabad, travelling over 2,100km. This was after 80 years any tiger had reached Gautala forest. The Karanja Sohol tiger is not among the both.“There have been several dispersals from source areas like Tipeshwar to sink. In September this year, a tiger reached Kinwat range in Nanded. There is regular dispersal to Kawal tiger reserve in Telangana and in Painganga sanctuary, 100km from Tipeshwar. The government should declare Painganga (400sqkm) and Tipeshwar (149sqkm) a combined tiger reserve for better prospects. This will bring good days for tigers,” says Yadav Tarte, state wildlife board member.Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientist Bilal Habib says tigers moving towards Nanded, Buldhana, Akola, Washim, and Aurangabad districts from Tipeshwar use narrow roads, canals, agriculture fields, and human settlements than forests. This has already been mapped with the help of tiger telemetry studies. “In a country with an increasing demand for land by an evergrowing population, conserving such large carnivores demands innovative approaches to land use planning that maintains connectivity between tiger source populations,” says Habib.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-1st-tiger-enters-karanja-sohol-another-a-house-in-khamgaon-city/articleshow/88131191.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra cuts rates for RT-PCR, antigen and antibody tests||MUMBAI: The state slashed rates for RT-PCR, rapid antigen and antibody tests further on Monday. Now, getting an RT-PCR test in a hospital or a laboratory in Maharashtra will cost Rs 500 and home collection Rs 700. The public health department issued a notification on the new rates which will be applicable at all centres, including the airport. This is the sixth time the government has reduced the price of Covid-19 tests since June 2020. From Rs 4,500 initially, the price of RT-PCR was lowered to Rs 1,600 in September, Rs 850 in December and now to Rs 500. The rate for bulk testing by government agencies has been fixed at Rs 350, a reduction from Rs 500.  Dr Sudhakar Shinde, CEO of the State Health Assurance Society who helped draft the government scheme to cap services during the Covid pandemic, said the latest revision has been carried out after almost nine months. “Availability of raw materials is better. Moreover, the volume of tests is likely to go up in the next few months. We felt these factors make it the ideal time for a rate revision,” he told TOI The price of CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) tests has also been cut from Rs 3,000 to Rs 1,200. CBNAAT tests can detect Covid in two hours. The state has also revised the rates for rapid antigen tests and the Covid-19 antibodies test using the ELISA or CLIA method. An antigen test will now cost Rs 100 if a person goes to a lab or a hospital. The same test would cost Rs 150 if carried out in a kiosk or a place of mass collection and home collection will cost Rs 250, down from Rs 300. A person going to a lab for an antibody test will have to pay Rs 200 and Rs 300 for ELISA and CLIA respectively. While home collection will cost Rs 350 and Rs 500 for ELISA and CLIA respectively. Regarding the other rapid test at the airport that detects Covid-19 in five minutes, an official said, “We have been told it is new technology. We are reviewing these methods and will decide on cost soon,’’ said the official. There has been public outcry over the cost difference between the regular RT-PCR tests, which give results in 4-6 hours, and the new rapid tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-cuts-rates-for-rt-pcr-antigen-and-antibody-tests/articleshow/88131945.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Delhi||Plasma therapy does not reduce death risk in covid patients: WHO||NEW DELHI: The World Health Organization has come out strongly against the use of convalescent plasma in Covid-19 patients without severe symptoms. It is also against the use of plasma therapy for the severely and critically ill patients, except in clinical trials. According to the UN health body, despite its initial promise, current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival chances or reduces the need for mechanical ventilation. During the huge spike in cases in April, May and June, hundreds of Covid patients were administered convalescent plasma in India. The process involved transfusing plasma retrieved from the blood of individuals who had recovered from Covid into a person suffering from the disease. It was claimed that plasma therapy helped kick-start the patient’s immune system and increased the chance of survival. WHO has debunked these claims. In its latest guidelines on drugs for Covid, WHO also noted that the therapy was costly and time-consuming to administer and, therefore, best avoided. The guideline, based on evidence from 16 trials involving 16,236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical Covid infection, was published in British Medical Journal. “As such, WHO makes a strong recommendation against the use of convalescent plasma in patients with non-severe illness and a recommendation against its use in patients with severe and critical illness, except in the context of a randomised controlled trial,” BMJ said in a statement on Monday. WHO’s Guideline Development Group said there was always a potential for harm with blood product transfusion. Instead, it said, IL-6 receptor blockers and systemic corticosteroids might continue to be used for patients with severe or critical infection. It gave a conditional recommendation on the use of neutralising monoclonal antibodies in selected patients. WHO also recommends against the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in Covid patients regardless of disease severity. Convalescent plasma isn’t the only therapy tried out during the pandemic that has failed to stand the test of time. In the last two years, since the pandemic began, dozens of drugs have been repurposed to treat the viral infection. While some like the steroids and IL-6 receptors have stood the test of time, others have not. WHO’s living guidelines respond to emerging evidence from randomised controlled trials on existing and new drug treatments for Covid.  Vaccines are linked to limiting hospitalisations, but it is unclear how long protection last following vaccination or natural infection or how this might alter with the emergence of new variants. Therefore, say WHO experts, the potential for drugs to treat people infected with Covid remains of interest and is the focus of this guideline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plasma-therapy-does-not-reduce-death-risk-in-covid-patients-who/articleshow/88131946.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Earlier this year, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had ordered Cidco to consider the proposal for grant of land to build a government hospital and medical college in Navi Mumbai. Cidco has written to NMMC stating that it is ready ot hand over the plot to it. As per the current market rate, the plot is valued at around Rs 107 crore. The NMMC said it has received Cidco’s letter, and necessary action has been initiated. The need for a government hospital and medical college was felt during the pandemic, when Covid patients were running from pillar to post to get affordable healthcare facilities. Cidco sources said that the plot comes under the NMMC’s draft development plan and is reserved for a park or a museum but can be used for other purposes such as healthcare facilities in the larger public interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-cidco-agrees-to-give-land-for-med-college/articleshow/88131962.cms||B B Nayak

A reply to the notice has been sought from the station manager of the airlines within 24 hours. The notice by Vasant Vihar sub-divisional magistrate stated the norm of random testing of 2% passengers was “not followed” in two flights of Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi that landed at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport on Sunday and Monday. “A sub-section (2% of the total flight passengers) will undergo post-arrival testing at random at the airport. The 2% of such travellers in each flight will be identified by the concerned airlines (preferably from different countries),” the notice stated. “It has come to notice that the above directions were not followed by you,” it said, citing the two flights from Abu Dhabi. If the station manager diesn’t reply, “it would be presumed that the station manager has nothing to say in the matter and action as deemed fit shall be initiated as per relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005; Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws,” the district authority’s notice stated. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/notice-issued-to-etihad-airways-over-covid-19-guidelines/articleshow/88131976.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s 1st Omicron cases: Man, fiancée back from South Africa & US test positive||MUMBAI: Two Mumbaikars have tested positive for Omicron, taking the tally of the new Covid variant in Maharashtra to 10, according to the state health update on Monday. BMC officials said the first patient in the city is a 37-yearold resident of the western suburbs who returned home from South Africa on November 25. His 36-year-old fiancée, who returned from the US on the same day, was among his high-risk contacts who were tested. Their Covid-positive samples, taken for genomic sequencing, showed the Omicron variant. Both are asymptomatic, vaccinated (with the Pfizer shot) and at present admitted in Seven Hills Hospital for observation, said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Five high-risk and 315 low-risk contacts of the couple have been traced and more are in the process of being traced, state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said. Ajit Pawar calls for strict rules on Covid for cities with int’l airportsThe emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa has led to surveillance on all international travellers from countries classified as high-risk. In Mumbai, Omicron suspects have now increased to 29 since the surveillance started on December 1. “We have found 20 travellers from high-risk countries who are positive. They include 16 males and four females. While tracing the contacts of these 20 patients, we found nine were positive,’’ said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare.  Samples of all these patients have been sent for whole genome sequencing. Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Monday that the government needs to take strict measures as Omicron is now infecting children. Four children—the daughter and nieces of a Pimpri-Chinchwad patient—are among 10 identified with the Omicron variant in Maharashtra. Pawar also said the Centre should come out with a policy on the booster dose. “In view of the growing crisis of Omicron, it is imperative that the health department of the central government announce and adopt a strict policy. Cities that have international airports should have a separate set of rules,” Pawar told mediapersons. In Mumbai, the public health machinery has already been tweaked to respond to the threat posed by Omicron, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. He said a quarantine policy is in place. “Our war rooms have been activated to trace contacts. We are carrying out a massive IEC (information, education and communication) programme on the need to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Kakani said, adding that the policy would be tweaked if cases rise. Giving out details of international passengers who have arrived at Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur airports since December 1, Dr Awate said all 6,263 travellers from high-risk countries so far have been subjected to Covid test; 11 tested positive. Their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing to check for the Omicron variant. Of the 28,437 who arrived from at-risk countries, 635 were tested and none were positive. The state government is also carrying out field surveillance checks on passengers who arrived from high-risk countries between November 1 and 30. “Totally, through airport and field surveillance, we have collected 34 Covid-positive samples that have been sent for genomic sequencing,” said Dr Awate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ajit-pawar-calls-for-strict-rules-on-covid-for-cities-with-intl-airports/articleshow/88131978.cms||---

The plea said that the defamatory imputations, remarks emanate out of sheer malice of the accused in tarnishing his reputation. In October, Bharatiya had filed a defamation case in the Mazgaon metropolitan magistrate’s court against Malik for allegedly defaming him by claiming that his brother-in-law, Rishabh Sachdev, was among the three persons detained and then released by the NCB in the cruise drug bust case. Bharatiya, in his plea, said that Malik used his power and position as a cabinet minister on national television to raise doubts and spread frivolous allegations over the release of his brother-in-law. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-neta-files-2nd-defamation-suit-against-nawab-malik/articleshow/88132680.cms||---

A tourist while walking along the path lost her balance and fell down as she stepped on a portion that caved in. The woman, who resides in Kottayam, came to visit the Kovalam beach on Sunday morning along with her husband. She was rescued by the employees of Coconut Grove restaurant. The woman suffered minor injuries. “We saw the tiles breaking and the woman falling into the pit. We rushed to the spot and rescued her,” said Shibin Stephan, a staff of the restaurant. Residents alleged that the walkway got damaged as it did not have a proper basement. The construction works of the footpath was completed a month ago and this happened due to improper construction, they said. The sea waves are also cited as a reason for the damage. The strong waves hitting the basement caused erosion and created a cavity. “The Hawa beach has been a favourite destination even among international tourists. But authorities have neglected it all these years without proper maintenance. Other necessary facilities, including lights and toilet, are also not working properly. Lifeguard officers are not allowing tourists to go to the sea shore and they are not giving any justifiable reasons for that. Necessary actions have to be taken to protect beach tourism,” said president of Kerala tourism protection and development council R Viswanathan. After the incident, a rope was tied to a building to warn people about the damaged tiles. Tourism director V R Krishna Teja Mylavarapu visited the spot on Monday evening and said that all these issues have been taken into consideration and further steps would be taken to resolve the issue. “The damage was caused due to the huge waves hitting the basement and not by improper construction,” Mylavarapu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/newly-laid-walkway-at-kovalam-beach-damaged/articleshow/88131252.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The injured, identified as Sunil Kumar alias Hebal Singh, Lalita Devi and Darpania Devi, were taken to the Khusrupur primary health centre from where two of them were referred to the Patna Medical College and Hospital for better treatment. According to sources, the incident took place at 11.30am when the MEMU train reached the Khusropur station that falls under the jurisdiction of Danapur division of the East Central Railway (ECR). “Three armed criminals entered the coach and open fire, creating panic among the passengers. The bullets hit one Sunil Kumar, who had boarded the train at Manjhauli Halt, and two women sitting behind him. Before the other passengers could react, the criminals ran away from the spot,” S Mayank, the chief security commissioner of Railway Protection Force under the ECR, told this reporter. Primary investigation revealed that the criminals had targetted Sunil (45) because of a land dispute. An FIR was lodged with the Khusropur Government Railway Police in this connection and the statements of the injured passengers were recorded. ECR’s CPRO Rajesh Kumar said, “The MEMU train, which was detained at the Khusropur station for a while, left at 11.43am. Another train was detained at the station after the incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-injured-as-criminals-open-fire-in-train-coach/articleshow/88131046.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Vegetable prices on the rise, hoteliers despair||MANGALURU: Hoteliers, restaurant owners and caterers are in despair as vegetable prices have only gone north over a fortnight. The rocketing prices started with the tomato but now the drumstick, too, is unsparing on the pocket. It cost Rs 225 a kilo on Saturday and rose to Rs 320 per kilo later. The curry cucumber is selling at Rs 80 per kilo. Before September, it seemed to be a much humbler vegetable at Rs 15-20 a kilo. If you don’t like the ivy gourd, now is the time to skip it because it’s Rs 110 a kilo. Looking at the price list, it’s not hard to imagine if someone wants to skip vegetables altogether. Sample this for dinner: double beans at Rs 90 a kilo, cowpea Rs 100, capsicum Rs 140, ridge gourd Rs 90, cauliflower and cabbage Rs 70 and carrot at Rs 100. If you want to be budget-wise, then pick the pumpkin. It’s at Rs 20 a kilo. Unseasonal, heavy rain across Karnataka has damaged vegetable production, causing a shortage in supply. Kudpi Jagadeesh Shenoy, the president of Dakshina Kannada Hotel Owners’ Association, said hotel and restaurants have lost out on their margins steadily. His restaurant increased the prices of coffee, tea and a couple of items on the menu by about Rs 5, citing the cooking fuel hike. “The vegetable prices are shocking,” he said. “We hope the situation returns to normal.” All hoteliers are in the same boat of uncertainty. A caterer in a popular vegetarian restaurant said his expenditure and income are now almost the same. “We are surviving because customers are coming back, which allows us to balance the revenue. We pray that Covid-19 does not flare up as restrictions have a more damaging effect than a temporary rise in vegetable prices,” the caterer said. Ravichandra Shetty, the secretary of the Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society Limited, said there will be no respite from the high prices till the unseasonal rain stops in Chikamagaluru and Hassan, from where vegetables are procured for local distribution. “The Kukke Subrahmanya Temple wants 400 kilos of ivy gourd at Rs 30 per kilo for the Shashti fest. We are at a loss on how to provide it because the procurement price is Rs 90 per kilo,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/vegetable-prices-on-the-rise-hoteliers-despair/articleshow/88130927.cms||Stanley Pinto
---||Kochi||Waste mgmt: Wrong data find place in NITI Aayog report||Thiruvananthapuram: While it was a matter of pride for the city being featured by NITI Aayog among the 28 cities across the country for best waste management practices, erroneous figures and findings in the report may have spoiled the party for the city corporation. In the report titled ‘Waste wise cities-Best practices in solid waste management’ a joint initiative of NITI Aayog and centre for science and environment Thiruvananthapuram was chosen along with two other cities under the area ‘Innovative models’. The report hails Thiruvananthapuram as an example of how a decentralized model of waste management could minimize the cost burden for urban local bodies. It gives special thrust on the economic sustainability and cost efficiency of the model. The economic success of this model is substantiated by presenting revenue figures from the sale of compost and biogas and refuse derived fuel (RDF) along with various other sources like user fee, penalties, chicken waste disposal fee and sale of recyclables. But, nowhere in the corporation could records be seen about sale of compost, biogas or refuse derived fuel. As per the NITI Aayog’s report, the corporation grosses nearly Rs 10 lakh per month from combined sale of compost, biogas and RDF. How does the corporation earn monthly from a sale that never happened is a question that puzzles even the officials. The monthly collection from penalty is pegged at Rs 1 lakh, which again is way below what actually the corporation earns from levying penalties. It further says that the corporation’s total expenditure in solid waste management per month is Rs 38 lakh, which is used for scientific disposal of inerts, rejects and making of RDF. The corporation is yet to roll out a scheme for making RDF in the city. Even regarding the expenditure, the figures do not match with the reality. Corporation spends around Rs 58.64 lakh per month to pay 388 temporary staff appointed to take care of composting units and material recovery facilities, while the report pegs the total expenditure at below Rs 40 lakh per month. The report mentions creation of Sanmathi park by converting a dump yard but does not indicate that the civic body handed over 2 lakh kilos of non-recyclable, non-reusable legacy waste to Clean Kerala Company from three dump yards at Putharikandom, Erumakuzhy and Attakulangara, spending Rs 24.32 lakh. As per the status report prepared by the city corporation in 2019, there is a large gap between total dry waste being generated and actual saleable quantity. For instance, the city generates 18.07 tonnes of plastic waste per day. However, the saleable quantity is just 10.84 tonnes.  The document carries a disclaimer “While care has been taken in the analysis of the data that was collected from the respective city corporations, NITI Aayog and CSE do not guarantee or warrant the accuracy, reliability or completeness of the information in this document”. NITI Aayog special secretary K Rajeswara Rao, however, states in the document differently that “In the process of developing this document, a series of consultations were held with selected ULBs, think-tanks, academia, private players, NGOs/CSOs, etc. In addition, the research teams also visited these 28 cities to capture granular details by witnessing on-ground operations”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/waste-mgmt-wrong-data-find-place-in-niti-aayog-report/articleshow/88131262.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The Centre’s panel on air quality, Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), has ordered closure of 111 units across Delhi-NCR for violations of pollution norms. Track the pollution level in your cityOf them, 30 are in Delhi, 43 in Uttar Pradesh, 23 in Haryana and 15 in Rajasthan. CAQM stated that till Sunday, its flying squads had inspected 576 sites across NCR. The 111 units or sites include 28 industrial sites, 42 construction & demolition sites and 41 diesel generator sets. Meanwhile, the wind speed was weaker on Monday morning, but reached up to 8kmph in the evening. The city also saw drizzling at 0.8mm towards the Sunday night, increasing the moisture. “The wind may get calmer around December 8-9 due to an approaching western disturbance,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of private weather forecasting centre Skymet. “There was slight rise in the minimum temperature due to clouding as it traps the heat. The mercury will start falling after December 9,” he said. According to the central forecasting agency, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI is likely to oscillate within the upper and lower ends of “very poor”. “For December 7, winds are likely to be moderate, increasing ventilation. Minimum temperatures are likely to drop gradually leading to more stable atmosphere. The net effect is that air quality remains within ‘upper end of poor’ or ‘lower end of very poor’. On December 8 and 9, winds are expected to be low and AQI is likely to remain ‘very poor’. Low mixing-layer height is preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,” stated SAFAR. The volume of PM2.5 oscillated between 123.4 and 155.3 micrograms per cubic metres, according to Central Pollution Control Board. This is less than Sunday’s, but still over the national safe limit of 60 units.

---||Kolkata||December showers sink city pockets that went down under in monsoon||KOLKATA: Untimely downpour returned to haunt citizens in large parts of the city with many waking up on Monday morning to find their neighbourhoods inundated after night-long rain. With the city receiving as much as 50mm rain by 6am, localities in low-lying pockets were the worst-affected. A high tide in the Hooghly didn't help matters as rainwater could not be drained out due to the closure of lock gates along the Hooghly. Belgachhia, Maniktala, Beliaghata, Chittaranjan Avenue, MG Road, Amherst Street, Camac Street, Alipore, Kidderpore, Behala, Jodhpur Park and large areas off EM Bypass remained waterlogged for several hours on Monday morning. Though stormwater started receding from the city core by late afternoon as the rain stopped, residents in some parts of Behala and EM Bypass had no respite from waterlogging till late in the evening. Patients, doctors and staffers in hospitals at Mukundapur to the east of Bypass were also reminded of the nightmare through monsoon when the access road was completely inundated. Residents in parts of Nayabad, Mukundapur and Patuli were stranded due to severe waterlogging in front of their homes. Subir Mukherjee, a resident of Nayabad, had to cancel an appointment with his dentist at a private hospital on Monday morning. “I tried to book an app cab for more than an hour but none agreed to come to the doorstep,” Mukherjee said. Residents of Thakurpukur in Behala had to wade through knee-deep water which remained stagnant till Monday night because of a poor drainage network. Similarly, residents of Muktarambabu Street had to stay indoors as they didn’t want to wade through knee-deep water as the entire street was waterlogged since early morning. According to a KMC drainage department official, stormwater took several hours to recede from many north and central Kolkata neighbourhoods due to the presence of a high tide in the early morning. Arvind Jaiswal, a resident of Muktarambabu Street, decided to skip office after large-scale flooding of the area. Kolkata Traffic Police had a tough outing on Monday with several arterial roads in the city reporting ankle-deep water. The worst-affected stretches included Diamond Harbour Road near CMRI Hospital and Park Circus seven-point crossing, along with Amherst street and Central Avenue where traffic slowed down considerably. Other roads that were waterlogged included MG Road, Eden Hospital, Lalbazar Street, Hyde Road, CGR Road, Park Circus connector, parts of EM Bypass, Rabindra Sarani and BB Ganguly Street. In Salt Lake, New Town and Rajarhat, residents had to bear with another round of waterlogging. Some of the worst areas included the stretch of Haldiram junction on VIP Road and the stretch leading towards Chinar Park in Rajarhat. A school bus got stuck in the stormwater for a couple of hours on VIP Road near Haldiram. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said they had operated additional pumps to flush out stormwater.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/december-showers-sink-city-pockets-that-went-down-under-in-monsoon/articleshow/88131259.cms||---

Shubham Bothale used to work in a private firm and had met with a road mishap on December 3 while riding a two wheeler. After initial treatment at the Yavatmal-based hospital, he was shifted to New Era Hospital in Nagpur the same day. Here, doctors tried their best, but Shubham’s head injury was so serious that he could not be saved. A team of expert doctors declared him brain dead on December 6. After initial counselling by Dr Ashwini Choudhry, Shubham’s father Umesh, his brother Prashant and other family members gave their consent to donate his kidneys and liver. Being a medico-legal case, the postmortem was also conducted. One of the Shubham’s kidneys gave a new life to a 12-year-old kidney failure patient in the city while the other was transplanted in a 63-year-old man. The New Era Hospital, where the patient was admitted and succumbed to head injuries, took the lead as the kidney and liver transplant was conducted there. One kidney was transported to Kingsway Hospital. A honour corridor was created by New Era Hospital to salute the organ donor’s family and their decision. “Awareness about the noble cause of organ donation can be seen in the rural population too which is a good thing. Now, the much awaited heart, lungs and pancreas transplants should also be done in Nagpur,” said Dr Vibhavari Dani, president of zonal transplant coordination centre (ZTCC) through which the entire organ transplant process was coordinated. GIVING LIFE IN DEATH * Donor: Shubham Bothale (20) * Consent given by father Umesh Bothale, brother Prashant and family * Liver donated to 56-yr-old man at New Era Hospital * 1 kidney transplanted into 63-yr-old man in New Era Hospital * Second kidney saved a 12-yr-old boy’s life at Kingsway Hospital * Pair of corneas donated to Madhav Netra Pedhi||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/farmer-from-village-in-yavatmal-consents-to-donate-sons-organs/articleshow/88132004.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Kochi||Excise to take custody of prime accused||Thiruvananthapuram: The excise enforcement squad that busted a rave party at a resort in Poovar will take the main accused into custody for further questioning. The squad suspect that a group based in north India had organized the party. The team had seized MDMA, crystal MDMA, pills, hashish oil and LSD stamp from the resort. One of the main accused, Akshay Mohan of Aryanad, had earlier been arrested by Cantonment police in 2017 for possession of LSD stamps, a type of synthetic drugs. The excise officers said that Mohan had always been associated with drug peddling. All of the accused had connection in Bengaluru, which may have helped them to source the drugs to the resort. Peter Shane of Kannanthura, another accused in the case, emerged as the last entrant with the aim of selling drugs in his possession, said an excise officer. The team, posing as tourists, set out for the operation based on a tip-off received They rented two boats and nearly mistook another resort as the target. However, the sources clarified the location and soon the squad was able to pin down the main accused. Some of the people who were taken into custody were found to have no direct link with the usage of drugs. They either turned up to attend the DJ party or were roped in to serve food, said the officer. Special enforcement squad circle inspector T Anikumar said that it was a major bust of a rave party in the Capital. Ashir of Chanthavila is the third person arrested on Sunday. Clarification:The headline of the report on Sunday’s excise raid that appeared on Page 2 of TOI on December 6 (Monday) read: ‘Rave party at Poovar island resort; 19 taken into custody’.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Temperature may dip to 15°C by next week||KOLKATA: The city was drenched by overnight showers that continued till Monday evening, leaving extensive areas across north, central and east, apart from parts of Behala, waterlogged. The downpour, though, lost intensity by late morning and the city received 10mm rain till 5.30pm. The mercury may start plunging gradually now as the skies start clearing up by Tuesday, said the Met office. The minimum temperature may drop to 15°C by December 13-14. The thick cloud cover narrowed down the difference between the day’s maximum and minimum temperatures to just two degrees on Monday. While the maximum temperature was 22.4°C, five degrees below normal, the minimum was 20.6°C, four notches above normal. The well-marked low pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts — a remnant of Cyclone Jawad — weakened further into a low-pressure area over the same region with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 4.5km above mean sea level, said a bulletin issued by the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). It is likely to weaken further and move towards Bangladesh. As it veered towards Bangladesh, districts adjoining the Bengal-Bangladesh border — Murshidabad, Nadia and North 24 Parganas — received heavy rain. “The minimum temperature may drop by a degree on Tuesday and the maximum will start pushing up. But the drop in temperature will not be significant till the cool northwesterly winds start flowing in. Conditions have started turning favourable for the revival of the northwesterly,” said RMC director GK Das. Snowfall across Jammu & Kashmir has triggered icy winds that have started travelling towards the southeast. “It could take around a week more for the chill to reach and settle down across north India, before it reaches Bengal, said weathermen. “It will travel across Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar-Jharkhand before reaching the state. We expect the mercury to drop to 15°C in a week from now,” added Das. He added that the gap between the maximum and minimum temperatures will now start widening. “The maximum will rise and the minimum will decline. Neither will be very sharp immediately,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/temperature-may-dip-to-15c-by-next-week/articleshow/88131263.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rain washes away pollutants, all AQI stations turn green||KOLKATA: The city’s air in early December hasn’t been this clean in decades courtesy of the untimely rain that cleansed the air, washing away pollutants or fine particulate matter. Throughout Monday, all the air quality monitoring stations in the city stayed dark green, indicating ‘good’ ambient air (AQI 0-50). Even the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) at Rabindra Bharati University off BT Road, which is usually either dark brown or red (poor to very poor air quality) consistently through the winter, was light green, indicating satisfactory air quality (AQI 51-100) on Monday morning. As the day progressed, the AQI level improved and, by 8pm, even the RBU CAAQMS AQI turned dark green. Prominent pollutants at the stations also changed. The dominant pollutants during winter are fine particulate matter, PM2.5 — diameter less than 2.5 micrometres that can travel straight into the bloodstream. However, the incessant rain has cleansed the air and, instead of PM2.5, the dominant pollutant for Ballygunge was NO2, for Bidhannagar it was SO2, for RBU it was PM10, and it was CO for Rabindra Sarobar. “This is the magic of meteorology. Apart from cleansing the ambient air, the rain prevented dust re-suspension effectively. Road dust resuspension contributes heavily to declining air quality,” said a West Bengal Pollution Control Board scientist. “It is a rare combination. You enjoy winter and yet breathe easy. In winter, with the increase of chill, the pollution level usually increases. A majority of city residents nowadays develop some breathing distress during this time,” said environment activist S M Ghosh. “The good air quality gives patients with respiratory distress a breathing period. Good air quality also heals the lungs, which we had experienced in 2020 when there was a lockdown. We were pleasantly surprised with the low turnout of asthma and COPD patients at our clinics. Since there is a forecast of chillier winter and heightened air pollution, this rain came as a blessing,” said senior pulmonologist Arup Halder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-washes-away-pollutants-all-aqi-stations-turn-green/articleshow/88131269.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Goa||Kadamba era sculptures lying damaged, neglected at Goa-Maharashtra border village||Keri: Archaeological remains having historical importance to Goa, dating back to the Kadamba era, have been found lying in a neglected state at Patye village on the Goa-Maharashtra border. The village of Patye was submerged when the Tillari reservoir was constructed at Dodamarg in Maharashtra. Residents of Patye had been rehabilitated at Sasoli in Dodamarg on the Goa-Maharashtra border. However, there were many archaeological remains from the era of Goa Kadamba rulers at Patye, which officials from both Goa and Maharashtra failed to shift safely. Before the submergence of Patye, in 2003, the sculptures were transported haphazardly, which led to many of the remains being damaged in the process. Since then, they have been lying outside the shrine of Bhutoba, facing vagaries of nature and in a totally neglected condition. The stone slab with the royal emblem of Goa Kadamba rulers, bears an artistically carved lion, depicted in advancing posture, with its right fore-paw raised, its neck erect, mouth wide open and the tail twirled. This slab lies broken now. Other sculptures depicting varied scenes from the epic Ramayana, including the Ram-Ravan battle, burning of Lanka by lord Hanuman, are unique. One of the temples in the village also has a panel showing Gajalaxmi. Some carvings also throw light on the social and cultural history of the Goa-Konkan region during the Kadamba era. One such carving shows a procession with musicians, dancers and two royal elephants, which have mahouts and a couple riding on their backs. “There is an urgent need to initiate conservation efforts by taking Patye villagers into confidence, as archaeological assets of the Goa Kadamba era run the risk of being lost. The royal lion emblem is lying in negligence,” Sanjay Natekar, a heritage lover from Dodamarg, told TOI. During the rule of Goa Kadamba ruler Shivachitta Permadideva, many Shiva temples were built in the Goa-Konkan region. Sanket Naik, a local teacher from Sal, Bicholim, said, “The sculptural wealth of Patye throws light on the rich history of Dodamarg taluka’s association with the Goa Kadamba era. The folk drama of Ranmale, performed during the festival of Shigmo, too, consolidates the historic linkages.” Sasoli shares borders with Hankhane in Ibrampur, Pernem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kadamba-era-sculptures-lying-damaged-neglected-at-goa-maharashtra-border-village/articleshow/88132700.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The police said that the accused were aware of the alleged sexual assault but they didn’t inform the cops or the girl’s parents. Crime branch officials said that had the institute management acted proactively and informed the police, the girl’s life could have been saved. “We have booked managing trustee Priti Shah, trustee Sanjeev Shah and employee Vaishnavi Taparia under IPC sections 114, 176 and 202. The trio will be questioned soon and action will be initiated against them,” the police said. Investigations revealed that the girl was pursuing a course in the institute for the last two years apart from working as a store manager there. “After she was allegedly raped at the Vaccine Institute Ground, the girl had informed the trustees and other girls in the institute. Had they informed the cops, we would have been able to gather evidence and nab the accused. Also, when investigations began, the trustees didn’t co-operate and were reluctant to furnish documentary evidence,” crime branch officials added. After the girl’s suicide, several complaints were made against the institute following which city police commissioner Shamsher Singh had ordered an inquiry against OASIS. The girl’s mother too had accused OASIS institute of causing the death of her daughter and sought action against the management. The girl, a resident of Navsari, was found dead in Gujarat Queen Express train at Valsad railway station on November 4. Police found a diary from her bag wherein she had written that she was sexually assaulted by two auto-drivers in Vaccine Institute Ground in Vadodara on October 29. The cops began investigations in the case and launched a hunt for tracking down the accused. But despite questioning hundreds of auto drivers and scanning CCTV footage, the police haven’t been able to get any clue of the accused yet.

---||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: NIA seeks urgent hearing of plea against Sudha Bharadwaj's bail||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday sought urgent listing of its plea before the Supreme Court, challenging the Bombay high court’s order of granting default bail to advocate-activist Sudha Bharadwaj, who was arrested and had been in jail for over two years in the Elgar Parishad case. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the NIA, mentioned the plea before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana to list the case for hearing on Tuesday. The Chief Justice of India said that he would see into listing the matter. The solicitor general said, “Order will come into effect on 8th [December], so I have to succeed or lose tomorrow.” On December 1, the high court had granted Bharadwaj default bail, saying, that the extension of time for investigation and detention under provisions of section 43D(2) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was not done by a court of competent jurisdiction. The high court, however, directed a Mumbai special NIA court to take up the case on December 8 and decide on the conditions of her bail and date of release. Bharadwaj was arrested in 2018. Bhardwaj, one of the several civil liberties activists in the Elgar Parishad case, has been booked under stringent provisions of the UAPA for an alleged conspiracy to topple the government. The high court said guarantee of personal liberty under Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution cannot be thwarted on technical grounds that her plea for default bail was premature. The high court had, however, denied bail to eight rights activists — Varavara Rao, Rona Wilson, Sudhir Dhawale, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira in the case. They are lodged at Taloja Central Jail. The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near Koregaon-Bhima war memorial on the city’s outskirts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-seeks-urgent-hearing-of-plea-against-bharadwaj-bail-in-mumbai/articleshow/88132698.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Depression floods South Bengal fields, may singe city vegetable markets||KOLKATA: The retail prices of vegetables in Kolkata remained under check, without much fluctuation, on Monday. However, from Tuesday, the scene is likely to change drastically. “First, there will be a dip in prices as farmers will make distress sale of the retrieved produce from inundated fields. Afterwards, there will be sharp spike of vegetable prices because of the demand-supply gap,” said Kamal De, president of the West Bengal Vegetable Vendors’ Association. The untimely rain has left vegetable fields across south Bengal inundated, causing widespread damage to standing crops. The winter vegetables are vulnerable to rotting. During winter, there are occasional rains. Even if it rains, it does not last more than a day, added De. Subal Saha, a vegetable vendor at Lake market, said: “Our assessment is that after a couple of days, vegetable prices are all set to rise 30% to 40 % as the demand would exceed supply. We have reports that vegetables like eggplants (brinjal), bitter gourd (ucche), cauliflower and cabbage were the worst-hit.” Burdwan, one of the biggest agricultural districts of Bengal, also reported a widespread loss of standing crops. Agriculture department officers and East Burdwan Zilla Parishad Sabhadhipati Sampa Dhara and local MLAs visited some blocks for initial assessment of crop damage. Blocks like Burdwan (I), Burdwan (II), Khandogosh, Raina (I), Raina (II) and Jamalpur received massive amounts of rainfall, leaving a vast tract of farmland under rain water. The farmers are staring at huge losses. East Burdwan agricultural department source said that 50,000 hectare paddy land, 36,000 hectare of potato land and 29,000 hectare of onion land were badly hit. Even though there was no fresh rain in Midnapore, water from the farmland refused to recede on Tuesday. The seeds sowed by farmers rotted in fields. “We are assessing the extent of loss in the farm sector,” said a district agriculture official. In Hooghly, a vast tract of land where mustard, cauliflower, cabbage and flat beans were sown, suffered a massive loss. The real assessment of crops can be ascertained on Thursday, said a district official. In fact, the vegetables from other states like peas (Punjab), capsicum (UP), tomato (Nasik), beans (Ranchi) and drumsticks (Gujarat) may cost less.

On December 4, the number of such persons had crossed 10,000 while the fine collected was Rs. 21.2 lakh. Last month, on the same date, a mere 4,000 people were fined. In a meeting held on November 27 to prepare for the new variant, the BMC chief had said, “Citizens not wearing masks and establishments not following Covid-appropriate behaviour will be fined, the number of marshals will be increased and a target of 25,000 fines per day will be maintained.” Deputy municipal commissioner Sangeeta Hasnale, in charge of the solid waste management department, said, “We have asked the marshals to be more vigilant. If there is a demand from wards, we do not mind increasing the number of marshals as well. The drive so far has been very effective in cleanup marshals acting against those not putting on their face masks. In case of complaints either from citizens or from the marshals, action is taken accordingly. In case of complaints against marshals, action includes blacklisting the agency itself. We are currently in the process of reappointing a new agency too.” Colaba corporator Makrand Narwekar, though, said the marshals have not been effective. “We regularly get complaints against the marshals, like them trying to extort money from the public, than comments that the drive is a good initiative.” On Monday, Sejal Desai, BJP corporator from Malad, took to social media over a civic staff member not wearing a face mask. She said, “...On one hand BMC is trying to take measures to curb the spread of the virus and unfortunately on another side their own staff as such is moving around setting a bad example.” Marine Drive’s Mahendra Hemdev said the marshals too face refusal to pay. “At such times the police along the road have to intervene as the public picks up a fight with the marshals. These marshals are never seen alone and at most times are moving in groups, probably fearing resistance from the public too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-mask-fines-double-over-weekend-from-nov/articleshow/88132011.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kolkata||On eve of 165th anniversary, call for site of first widow remarriage to be on heritage list||KOLKATA: On December 7, 1856, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar married off the first widow, much to the disgust and opposition of Hindu conservatives who practised child marriage and Sati. The event was held under strict police protection from fundamental Hindu Brahmins who were against such social reforms. The widow, Kalimati, the daughter of Palashdanga’s Brahmananda Mukherjee, was married to Shrishchandra Vidyaratna at the house of Raj Krishna Bandyopadhyay on 12, Sukeas Street, now 48, Kailash Bose Street. On Monday, the eve of the event’s 165th anniversary, heritage enthusiasts wondered why the house of such historical importance does not figure on the city’s official list of heritage buildings. The old building with plaster peeling off now stands divided in three. The rear section with its entrance on Jadunath Sen Lane owned by Sarba Bharatiya Sangeet-O-Sanskriti Parishad. The front now has two addresses — 48A, which is with the descendants of Raj Krishna Bandyopadhyay and 48B, that has changed hands. A marble plaque that commemorated the historic event has gone missing, pointed out local history enthusiast Ashok Tarafdar. West Bengal Heritage Commission chairman Suvaprasanna admits a building of such historical significance should have been a graded heritage building worth preservation and promised to check it out. However, he pointed out that owners often resisted the heritage tag due to the belief that it would hinder maintenance or sale. “People have a misconception that a heritage tag will lead to problems. That is not so,” he said. In 1856, Vidyasagar had invited around 800 people for the occasion, including well-known personalities like Kaliprasanna Singha and Pandit Premchandra Tarkabagish. The wedding took place barely four months after the Widow Remarriage Act was passed. Vidysagar incurred personal debt to get the marriage institutionalised. To practice what he preached, Vidysagar married off his son Narayanchandra to a widow, Bhava Sundari. Vidyasagar wrote to his brother: “Remarriage of widows is the noblest deed of my life. I don’t think I shall be able to accomplish a greater one, ever. I have sacrificed everything for this cause and won’t mind even laying down my life for it.” To fight the orthodox society, Vidyasagar beat his adversaries at their own game. In January and October, 1855, he wrote his two famous treatises on the Marriage of Hindu Widows, drawing upon the sutras (literary compositions) and the sastras (scriptures) to establish his logical argument that there was no prohibition on remarriage of widows in the sastras. “Women are at liberty to marry again if their husbands are insane, dead, have renounced the family or are impotent or outcasts,” his thesis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-eve-of-165th-anniv-call-for-site-of-first-widow-remarriage-to-be-on-heritage-list/articleshow/88131288.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Demanding action against those hospitals which exploited the pandemic situation for their advantage, the MP said, “During the Covid period, many hospitals took advantage of the helpless patients and minted money. Action should be taken against them, and the Covid treatment charges at private nursing homes and hospitals should be fixed for the future.” He, however, praised and thanked the medical staff, doctors, sanitation workers, police and the administration for serving the people during the pandemic. Rahman said the government should learn from the mistakes made during the last two waves and make arrangements to protect people from the deadly Covid virus. Meanwhile, condemning attacks on the Tablighi Jamaat and the Nizamuddin Markaz for “spreading” Covid, Rahman demanded guidelines for the media organisations to prevent them from spreading lies or targeting a particular community in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bsp-mp-demands-relief-for-families-of-covid-victims-who-died-due-to-lack-of-o2-supply/articleshow/88131302.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Police conducted a probe and were planning to write to South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) for the cancellation of the parking contract. Choudhary tweeted, “The parking at #HauzKhasVillage is fleecing people. Charging Rs 300/car. Also refused to give a receipt. It's public land & they can't cheat citizens. @dcp_southwest & @dtptraffic shd send decoys- if found correct they should move for cancellation of their licence by @OfficialSdmc.” According to Choudhary, his son went to Hauz Khas on Sunday for lunch with his friend. “While he was exiting the parking lot, he was forced to pay Rs 300 as parking fee by a man. The attendant refused to give him a payment slip and did not even show him the parking rate card,” he claimed. Choudhary said that “it is a non-cognisable offence and there does not seem to be any recourse for the citizens who get regularly overcharged for basic services.” A south corporation official said that the issue was also raised by the area councillor earlier. “We are planning to file a police complaint.” Delhi Police, meanwhile, conducted a spot inquiry and found that the parking staff were overcharging and behaving rudely with people. “A letter for cancellation, revocation of the parking contract is being sent to the department (SDMC) concerned. Preventive action against parking staff has been taken,” a senior officer said.

Revtubha Jadeja (50) has a contract to supply construction materials like bricks, sand and other items to Nayara Energy. On Monday afternoon, when Revtubha and his aide Juvansinh Jadeja were supervising the supply of construction material to the company, Jamnagar BJP MLA Dharmendrasinh Jadeja’s younger brother Rajbha Jadeja (56) and his men attacked the duo. In retaliation, Revtubha and his men also attacked the rival group with sticks and pipes. Rajbha, Revtubha and Juvansinh suffered injuries on their heads in the ensuing skirmish. While Rajbha has been admitted at a private hospital in Jamnagar, Revtubha and Juvansinh were first taken to Jamangar’s GG Hospital and later shifted to a private hospital in Rajkot. Revtubha later told media persons in Jamnagar that the MLA’s brother Rajbha was pressurizing him to give up the building material supply contract as he wanted to do business with the company. He further alleged that Rajbha had been threatening him for the last three years over the same issue. Police said that both the groups have lodged cross complaints against each other and further investigation in the matter was on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mlas-brother-among-three-injured-in-clash-over-biz-rivalry/articleshow/88131316.cms||---
---||Patna||PM Modi, Amit Shah, Priyanka Chopra ‘tested’ for Covid in Bihar's Arwal||PATNA: If the data entry of the state health department is to be believed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi besides cine-stars Priyanka Chopra and Akshay Kumar had recently been tested for Covid-19 in Arwal district of Bihar. In a classic case of forged Covid tests, apart from the senior leaders, even the names of other netas and film actors figure in the data for the RT-PCR tests conducted in Karpi block of Arwal district on October 27. (The list went viral on the social media)Even though none of these people live in Bihar or had stayed here in the past, their addresses have been mentioned at different villages in Arwal district. For instance, PM Modi’s name figures thrice on the list of people who had been tested. His address was mentioned at Puran, the village of former state Congress president Ram Jatan Sinha. Priyanka Chopra was repeated for the maximum six times in the data with her address at Jonha village in Karpi block of Arwal district. Akshay Kumar had been mentioned four times and Amit Shah twice. As per the data, swab samples of these people were collected on October 27 and sent for RT-PCR test the next day. None of them was found positive for Covid in the test reports. State health society executive director Sanjay Kumar Singh said two data operators have been dismissed and an FIR will be lodged in this case. Sanjay called it a mischief and said the investigation will be done to find out whose samples were collected, if any. While the two data operators alleged they had pressure from above, senior officials denied such allegations. This is not for the first time that such forgery had been detected in Covid-19 tests in the state. In February this year, the then Jamui civil surgeon and other officials were suspended for reporting fake Covid-19 tests. That time, zero was mentioned in the column of contact number of the people tested. Minor administered vax dose in JamuiIn another case of negligence on the part of the state health department, a 17-year-old girl, Mausam Kumari of Jamui, was reportedly administered Covid-19 vaccine. While talking to a digital media channel, Mausam said she had gone to Jamui Sadar PHC with her Aadhaar card on Saturday and health workers there administered her the vaccine dose. She felt uneasiness and was admitted to the Jamui Sadar hospital. However, Jamui civil surgeon said no such case was reported to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/modi-shah-priyanka-chopra-tested-for-covid-in-arwal/articleshow/88131075.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Mumbai||Bollywood art director held for sextortion from ex-lover||MUMBAI: A Bollywood art director was recently arrested for trying to extort money from his ex-girlfriend’s husband by threatening to circulate objectionable video clips of her. The woman also works in the film industry while her husband is a businessman. The accused, Krishna K (25), was nabbed from Delhi by an Aarey police team on Friday. According to the police, the 39-year-old woman was estranged from her husband a few years ago. She was in a live-in relationship with the accused in Patna at the time. During the lockdown, she mended her relationship with her husband and moved to Mumbai to live with him after breaking up with the accused. “To get back at the woman, the accused contacted her husband and shared intimate video clips of her. The videos had been shot while the two lived together in Patna. The accused then demanded Rs8 lakh from the husband if he wanted the videos to remain private,” said a police officer. Her husband approached the Aarey police and a case was lodged under the IPC for voyeurism and extortion, and under the IT Act. Police teams tracked down the accused’s location to Delhi and a team went to the national capital to nab him. He was brought to Mumbai and is presently in police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bollywood-art-director-held-for-sextortion-from-ex-lover/articleshow/88132057.cms||---

Satam’s advocate Pralhad Paranjpe, arguing the matter briefly before a bench of Justic-es A A Sayed and Abhay Ahuja, said encroachments in form of shanties and ‘methi farms’ breed “graver problems like drug peddling and prostitution” making the beach unsafe.

---||Nagpur||Now, rapid RT-PCR for flyers, result in 45 minutes||NAGPUR: The city airport has facilitated rapid RT-PCR facility for international flyers on Sharjah-Nagpur-Sharjah route. Samples of the flyers are being collected at the airport itself and results delivered in 45 minutes, for a premium. Amid revision in travel restrictions, international flyers have to carry Covid negative certificate even if they are fully vaccinated. The private lab assigned the task sets up its kiosk at the airport around 10pm to start collecting samples of those flying out of the country. Later, the same lab representatives are engaged in collecting swab samples of flyers arriving on the Sharjah-Nagpur flight. However, the arriving passengers have to wait for around two hours to get their RT-PCR test results. The rapid RT-PCR test costs Rs3,500, while the regular test fee for arriving passengers is Rs600. On Sunday when the first flight resumed after 10 months, the airport administration ensured the flyers gave their swab samples before immigration formalities. The lab staff collected 42 samples by 7am and immediately rushed the first lot in an ambulance for running the PCR test. The next lot of 39 followed in some time. The lab has two PCR kits — one having 45-minute delivery speed and other 1.06 hours. The sample extraction is automated and other process is completed within next few minutes. The result is delivered in one hour by the machine. “It takes 1.15-1.30 hours to issue the test results,” said the lab staff. “We don’t wait for all samples to be collected, but load them in lots to speed up the process,” they said. The airport has asked the lab to furnish the report within three hours for arriving passengers. The lab staff said they have sought ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) kits from Mumbai, but have been told to wait for 15 days. The lab director said, “Earlier, the RT-PCR test results would require at least 10 to 12 hours. This was because lab used to get a large number of samples. Now, there are hardly any workload compared to what labs were facing during the peak of the first and second waves. RT-PCR procedure depends on the kit. Some have 1.20 hours delivery time, some 1.40 hours and so on. So if only one sample is given, then a lab can deliver result in 1.05 hours also on any day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-rapid-rt-pcr-for-flyers-result-in-45-mins/articleshow/88132052.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Jaipur||Amit Shah misleading the public: Gehlot (inset added)||Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday expressed surprise over home minister Amit Shah’s statement at a BJP meet here where he blamed Gehlot government for failing to provide relief to people during Covid. Gehlot said it seems that either the state BJP did not tell him the truth or else Amit Shah was trying to mislead the public. The CM said that Rajasthan has been at the forefront when it came to provide relief to the public during Covid. He said the state government had spent Rs. 1,866 crore to provide financial assistance worth Rs. 5,500 to 33 lakh families during lockdown. Children orphaned due to Covid and divorcees were given special packages. He said an immediate relief of Rs. 1 lakh to orphaned children and Rs. 5 lakh on attaining 18 years besides Rs. 2,500 per month till the age of 18 years, Rs. 2,000 per year for school uniform were given by the state government. Similarly, for widows, an immediate relief of Rs. 1 lakh and Rs 1,500 per month pension was provided. Their children too were provided Rs. 1,000 per month. He said as per the special package announced for orphaned children and widows, Rs. 97 crore has been dispersed benefiting 167 orphaned children, 8,049 widows and 5,485 children of widows. He said the Modi government had not given any immediate relief to the orphaned children under its package and they will get them only after attaining the age of 18. On the charge that ventilators provided under PM Care were not used, Gehlot said that Amit Shah should answer where they procured the faulty ventilators from. On the charge of not reducing petrol and diesel prices he said the state government had reduced 2% VAT in January and reduced petrol and diesel prices by Rs. 4 and 5, respectively on November 16. He said the government had incurred a revenue loss burden of Rs. 6,300 crore because of reduced fuel prices. On the setting up of oxygen plants also the home minister is misleading the public, said Gehlot. The CM said that so far 51 plants have been set up in the state which was appreciated by Union urban development and housing secretary Durga Shanker Mishra.

He claimed that Shah did not even take the name of BJP state chief Satish Poonia during his rally. Kataria, who is the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, was not given a chance to address the rally, he added. Dotasra said all such events “clearly indicate” that Shekhawat will be BJP’s chief ministerial face in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amit-shah-misleading-the-public-gehlot-inset-added/articleshow/88132059.cms||---

I have asked the deputy CM to talk to the leaders of his party (BJP). I have spoken to the leaders of other political parties. We will convene an all-party meeting after he (deputy CM) talks to his party leaders and inform us. I do not think there is any possibility of disagreement among the political parties over the issue,” Nitish told the media after his weekly ‘Janata ke darbar mein mukhyamantri’ programme. The CM also said he wanted the leaders of all political parties to have a clear understanding over the issue. “Every political party should have a consensus over how to conduct the caste census. I am making all necessary preparations on how the headcount will be done, what will be the method and how it will be executed. When all political parties reach a consensus, we will finalize the method and process at the meeting and the state government will announced it,” Nitish said. The CM, who has been reiterating the demand of a nationwide caste-based headcount during Census-2021, further said thatit will benefit all social groups. “It is a very legitimate matter. We will make it in a proper manner so that no one would be missed out,” he said. Nitish also said, “During the headcount, many people will tell their sub-castes, and not their castes. The enumerators will be trained to look into the issues. I have briefed the officials about every small point. I will not reveal right now how to conduct it. I will explain everything when the all-party meeting is convened.” Earlier, on August 23, an 11-member delegation from Bihar led by CM Nitish called on PM Narendra Modi and demanded caste census across the country during Census-2021 itself. The long-pending demand was revived in July this year after the Union government informed in the Lok Sabha that it would not enumerate population caste-wise, except those of the SCs and STs. Replying to a written query in the Lok Sabha on July 20 this year, Union minister of state for home, Nityanand Rai, said the government of India has decided as a matter of policy not to enumerate caste population other than those of SCs and STs in the Census-2021. Earlier, Bihar assembly had unanimously passed a resolution on February 18, 2019 and again on February 27, 2020, demanding caste-wise enumeration of population. Both the resolutions were sent to the Union ministry of home affairs with a request to hold caste census along with the Census-2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-all-party-meeting-over-caste-census-after-bjps-nod/articleshow/88130980.cms||Madan Kumar

Appearing for 'Developers and Builders Forum', a body of more than 60 reputed builders in Delhi who claimed to use the latest construction technology for reducing dust pollution as per laid down norms, Singh sought urgent listing of the application seeking lifting of the ban on all construction activities, except non-polluting activities relating to construction such as the plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry. In contrast, Singh had appeared for petitioner Aditya Dubey and argued on November 29 before a bench headed by CJI N V Ramana that while the construction work at small projects are stopped to the the detriment of construction workers for the sake of right to life, which included right to clean air and environment, of residents of Delhi and NCR, "the construction of massive Central Vista Project is being carried on at full swing right under the nose of the Supreme Court. Is Central Vista work more important than the lives of crores of residents of Delhi and NCR?" The SC had sought response from the Centre on the measures taken to control dust pollution from the Central Vista project, but had asked the petitioner not to stay focussed on one project and derail the court's endeavour to address the larger issue of air pollution from all sources and devising means to control it round the year. On Monday, when Singh sought listing of the builders' application, CJI Ramana said, "On one side, you appear for petitioner and want the pollution to stop. On the other side, you appear for the builders and want construction activities to go on. Let the government take a call on this issue." Singh said that the government had passed an order banning construction activities on the basis of the orders passed by the apex court and that the industry is losing hundreds of crores daily. But, the SC refused to accede to Singhs demand for an urgent listing of the builders' plea. The builders' forum was seeking modification of the SC's November 24 order, which said “In the meantime, as an interim measure and until further orders, we re-impose the ban on the construction activities in the NCR subject to the following two conditions: (i) Non-polluting activities relating to construction such as the plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry are allowed to be continued; (ii) The States shall use the funds which have been collected as labour cess for the welfare of construction workers to provide them subsistence for the period during which construction activities are prohibited and pay wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act for the respective categories of workers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-appear-for-anti-pollution-steps-and-builders-sc-to-lawyer/articleshow/88132070.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government for the setback, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Nana Patole said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had made all efforts to provide reservation to the OBCs, but the BJP government was deliberately scuttling it since 2017 and succeeded. “We have issued an ordinance as per the apex court’s guidelines of keeping all reservations under 50% ceiling. It was issued after consultations with all parties and even the governor had approved it. The top court should not have interfered as the reservation is a state subject,” said Patole. Accusing the MVA government of miserably failing to provide OBC reservation, BJP general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the state government promulgated the ordinance knowing very well that it would not stand the Supreme Court scrutiny. “Some ministers in the MVA government did not want to grant tickets to poor OBC candidates. They want rich contestants in the local body polls. When the SC guidelines of March 4 are very clear that the government needs to constitute a commission, gather empirical data and submit a comprehensive report to it, the MVA government sat idle for these eight months,” he said. Blaming the BJP government at the Centre and home minister Amit Shah for not providing 2011 census and empirical data of OBCs despite repeated demands, Patole said the voters have already taught a befitting lesson to the saffron party in the recently-held zilla parishad bypolls and same results would be repeated in the forthcoming elections. “A probe should be conducted to find out who the petitioners are, who moved the Supreme Court against the ordinance, and from where they are getting funding to hire top lawyers. Even at the SC, the Election Commission’s lawyers reached for hearing before the state’s counsels. The BJP is shedding crocodile tears now by resorting to protest against the MVA government,” said Patole. Bawankule said had the MVA government acted quickly, it could have gathered the data within a month and reservation could have been restored. “Even now, the government can request the Election Commission to defer the polls for some time and collect the empirical data till then. However, there is no willingness on the part of MVA to grant the reservation. Their leaders are busy in rallies. They have treated the OBC community like a football, but BJP would not tolerate this injustice and launch statewide protests against the government’s failure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/obc-quota-fiasco-patole-says-shah-didnt-give-data/articleshow/88132058.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Jaipur||PM Modi will be face of party in assembly polls in 2023||Jaipur: Union home minister Amit Shah has said the organisation was more important than a person while addressing the party’s closed-door party’s executive working committee at JECC here on Sunday. “Those who walk with the organisation, their sun never sets,” said a senior party leader while quoting Shah. Shah addressed party workers on the second day of his two-day visit to Rajasthan. Stating that Team Rajasthan was doing well in the state, Shah said, “I have asked party general secretary (organisation) Chandrashekar about the organisational performance in the state and found that it was going well under the leadership of Satish Poonia.” The leaders are projecting the statement of Shah as expressing faith in the present party unit. Putting an end to the speculation of the party’s face for assembly polls, Shah said the party would contest the assembly polls under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi in 2023. “The face of BJP in the polls will be PM Modi and its symbol lotus,” said a source who attended the meet. The statement comes at a time when the state BJP is facing an internal fight over the leadership face in the state. Shah also asked the party leaders to “stand united and fight the ruling party collectively, strongly signalling that the party high command has zero-tolerance on the internal rift.” The meeting was attended by the core and working committee members. He asked the state leaders to work collectively for the assembly polls. Shah contended that Rajasthan is an important state for the party and winning the assembly polls by a two-third majority in 2023 is important for the party to secure an absolute majority in the general elections in 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pm-modi-will-be-face-of-party-in-assembly-polls-in-2023/articleshow/88132071.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Local body polls to go ahead sans OBC seats||MUMBAI: After Monday’s SC verdict, local body polls slated for 105 nagar panchayats and the zilla parishads of Bhandara and Gondia and their panchayat samitis slated on December 21 will go ahead, except in the seats which had been reserved for OBCs. “The polls will go ahead in open category seats and those reserved for SCs and STs which would constitute around 75-80% of the total seats,” said state election commissioner UPS Madan. “For seats which had been reserved for OBCs after the ordinance, we will await the final SC verdict since this is an interim order,” he added. The next hearing is on December 13. The court’s stay on the 27% political reservation for OBCs in local body polls following an ordinance issued by the government in September has come has a major setback to the ruling parties. The opposition BJP accused the government of “fooling” the OBC community and said it will not allow the local body elections to go ahead without the quota. “The SC had asked for empirical data on OBCs to be collected. Instead of ensuring this, the government brought out an ordinance that did not stick,” said state BJP president Chandrakant Patil. Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who belongs to the OBC community, said the government had tried its best. “We asked the Centre for empirical data. Then we set up a Backward Class commission to gather empirical data,” said Bhujbal. State OBC affairs minister Vijay Wadettiwar said, “There is a conspiracy which is working against the OBC community getting the reservation.” In March, SC had quashed the 27% reservation for OBCs in Maharashtra’s local bodies on the grounds that the reservations, combined with those for SCs and STs, exceeded the 50% quota limit. The OBC quota could only be permitted after empirical data on the community was collected and if the 50% quota limit was not crossed, SC had said. In September, the state had issued an ordinance allowing for the OBC quota in rural bodies with the rider that once combined with the SC and ST reservations, the combined quota will not cross the 50% limit. Also, that the OBC quota would not cross 27% of the seats, in keeping with the existing state legislation. The SC ruling overrides the ordinance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-local-body-polls-to-go-ahead-sans-obc-seats/articleshow/88132067.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Nagpur||Setback to Congress as BSP decides to abstain in MLC polls||NAGPUR: In a setback to the Congress, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has decided to abstain from voting in the forthcoming MLC elections for local authority constituency. The Mayawati-led outfit has 10 corporators in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and is usually an ally of the grand old party in civic body politics. BSP state chief Sandeep Tajne made an announcement in this regard on Monday while accusing the Congress leadership of importing a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) backed candidate for contesting the December 10 polls. “The Congress and BJP are two sides of the same coin. By importing a RSS candidate from BJP, Congress has indicated that it was liking the Sangh’s ideology. In fact, the party went a step further from BJP to please the RSS. With a view to distance ourselves from both parties, we will not cast our vote,” he said. Tajne, also a lawyer, added both national parties were against thoughts propagated by Mahatma Jyotiba Fule, Shahu Maharaj, and Babasaheb Ambedkar, and therefore the BSP would not favour any of them, in the absence of its own candidate. “The Congress has exposed itself badly by granting a ticket to RSS-backed BJP corporator Ravindra Bhoyar. It indirectly benefits the saffron party with such moves,” he said, adding that BSP would fight the next year’s NMC polls on its own. Unfazed by the BSP decision, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole told TOI that it would hardly matter, as his party would clinch victory with a comfortable margin. “Just wait and watch, till election day,” he said. On other hand, rival BJP was elated by the move and circulated the BSP’s decision on social media. Its leaders also celebrated the development in their own way, considering the fact that these 10 votes were actually going to the Congress kitty before Tajne’s declaration. “BSP’s move proves that no one believes in the Congress party now, and it has lost trust. It would not have much effect on our prospects of winning the polls as we are way ahead of all our rivals’ combined strength. The BJP would secure a minimum of 400 votes out of 547 votes, after excluding 10 BSP votes. We are not overconfident of our victory but are saying this on the basis of our hard work throughout our tenure in NMC and other local bodies,” BJP city chief Pravin Datke told TOI. The Congress and BJP have already reached consensus on four MLC seats in other parts of Maharashtra, except at Nagpur, and their candidates would be elected unopposed. In Akola-Washim-Buldhana constituency former friends-turned-foes BJP and Shiv Sena candidates are pitted against each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/setback-to-cong-as-bsp-decides-to-abstain-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/88132062.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Chandigarh||Despite claims, Chandigarh municipal corporation fails to put trash in its place||CHANDIGARH: Despite Chandigarh scoring rank 66 in the recent Swachh Survekshan, worst since the rankings started in 2016, disposal of garbage and sanitation remain major issues. While all political parties claimed to have made efforts in this direction, there is nothing to show for it on the ground. Garbage has been illegally dumped in multiple points around the city as the municipal corporation, run by the BJP, has failed to improve the garbage lifting and disposal process. In many places, particularly in colonies and villages, garbage is not being lifted for days, much to the chagrin of residents. Although use of motorised vehicles has improved garbage collection in most areas, its disposal remains a challenge. Around 80% to 90% of the garbage collected in the city goes to the dumping ground without being processed. The municipal corporation has started the process of hiring a competent agency to upgrade the processing capacity of the existing garbage processing plant with the help of technical and environmental experts but it will take at least six to eight months to yield results. The general house of the municipal corporation recently selected Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and request for proposal (RFP) for upgradation, operations and maintenance of the Daddumajra-based garbage processing plant for Rs 26.77 lakh and related GST. The institute has given a detailed report to the civic body authority, outlining scope of the work for both DPR and RFP, based on decided technology. The civic body authority asked three institutes; IIT Ropar, Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala to send their quotes for preparing DPR and RFP for plant upgradation but only two, IIT Ropar and PEC, responded. Box: Shortstaffed dept struggles Proper cleanliness and sanitation are major issues in the city. Though the MC has started night sweeping in a few areas, proper lifting of garbage and related waste leaves much room for improvement. Availability of sanitation employees remains a major issue. Recently, MC issued notices to 82 sanitation employees. The civic body allotted entire sanitation and related work to a private company for southern areas around four years back, but the sanitation condition has not improved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-claims-mc-fails-to-put-trash-in-its-place/articleshow/88131320.cms||Deepak Yadav

As part of this drive, the South Kolkata collectorate has closed a liquor shop of a leading retail chain at a Central Kolkata mall for overpricing. A top official of excise collectorate said it has started carrying out investigations at off-shops and have requested bar-cum-restaurants to reduce prices. “We are sending teams to different shops,” the official said. According to sources, apart from one closed for seven days for investigation, other liquor outlets of this retail chain are also under scanner. “We shall go to liquor shops of this chain. There was evidence of overpricing in at least three brands in new stocks and we will investigate other brands too. But it is not suspension. It is seven days’ closure for further enquiry,” the official said. It was also learnt that, informally, the excise department has requested bars to give benefit of the price drop to customers as soon as they can. “We are telling them whenever they get new stocks, they should immediately pass on the benefits,” said an official. Prices of IMFL, beer, bottled in origin liquor, overseas spirits bottled in India, and wine came down by 20%-30%. For beer, the fall was marginal (5%-6%) but for some IMFL registered prices with excise, the fall was even 30%. Prices of some leading premium and semi-premium whisky brands have been slashed by 30%. For deluxe whisky brands, the fall was 25%-26%; in case of popular rum brands, the fall was 15%-18%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/excise-dept-eye-on-liquor-retail-price/articleshow/88131324.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

There was a minor skirmish in which a few Bhim workers were detained by the police at Dadar’s Chaityabhoomi, Ambedkar’s cremation site. PM Narendra Modi tweeted, “Tributes to Bharat Ratna Babasaheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar on his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.” Commemorations were held at Chaityabhoomi, Bandra, Andheri and Thane. Six decades after his passing, the architect of the Indian Constitution continues to draw lakhs of followers who regard him as a messiah of the oppressed. A small altercation took place between the police and Ambedkar’s followers after a few of them tried to jump a queue. The situation was soon brought under control. “We have detained some people who created nuisance, and once the programme is over, we will decide what course of action can be taken,° said DCP (Zone 5) Pranay Ashok. RR Pandian, national president of the Bhim Sena, said, “Around 400 of our members had assembled to pay respects to Babasaheb. But police debarred public gatherings citing Covid protocol. We resented this order and forced our way in. When public transport has resumed, malls and temples have reopened, why should we be prevented on this one day?

The party claimed that this fact has been established under the recently released National Crimes Records Bureau. “Whether it is BJP in UP or the Congress in Rajasthan, the situation is quite similar,” alleged BSP leaders. All kinds of atrocities including Dalit bridegrooms being forced to alight from horses during marriage functions have become very common under the Congress rule, they said. Akash Anand, BSP national co-ordinator and nephew of party supremo Mayawati, attended the workers meet organised on the death anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar here on Monday. BSP leaders said the Congress cannot be the wellwisher of alits as it had put up candidates even against Ambedkar. The workers’ meeting was a major event by the BSP towards rebuilding the party after six of its MLAs defected to the Congress. The leaders said the was is focusing on the youth with 50% of them given representation in the party organisation. The ruling Congress was assiduously wooing Dalits and it had inducted several leaders from the community in the ministry to send out a message. However, Mayawati will not surrender her vote bank to the Congress easily as she was aggrieved over the defection of her party MLAs, engineered by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, even after her party extended unconditional support to the ruling party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/atrocities-against-dalits-on-rise-under-cong-bsp/articleshow/88132084.cms||---

The notification to this effect will be issued soon. This is being done to impose the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, which includes the registration of an FIR against those who don’t stick to their stated location during the quarantine period. Since December 1, 185 passengers from the 11 countries are being monitored by the civic body’s health staff in Ahmedabad. “There have been a few instances in which visitors from these countries mentioned their location as Ahmedabad but were found at some other place,” said a senior AMC official. “In one case, just one mobile phone number was provided for five members of a family and the phone was switched off when health officials tried to contact them”. To monitor these visitors effectively, the authorities have decided to take signed notes on locations. Any deviation from the information provided may invite penal provisions. District health officials at the airport mentioned instances in which NRI visitors arrived to participate in weddings the very next day when they are supposed to be in mandatory quarantine. “We have warned such individuals to stay away from functions or face action,” a district health official said. Health officials are facing issues from international passengers who land in Delhi or Mumbai and then travel to Ahmedabad via domestic flights. As for the monitoring part, the AMC has deployed Sanjeevani vans to keep tabs on the health condition of individuals who are in quarantine. Also on standby are 10 private hospitals which will have special beds for isolating Omicron cases. Three hotels have set up isolation rooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/location-declaration-must-for-at-risk-arrivals/articleshow/88131359.cms||---

The members resolved to keep Covid facilities ready and expand capacity threefold if needed. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA, said that as of Monday, Ahmedabad city has 2,150 beds for Covid-19 patients. “Of course, the majority of beds are currently being used to treat other patients. But they are equipped for critical care and have oxygen supply. At short notice, the number can be increased to 6,000. Almost all hospitals also have adequate trained human resources,” he said. City hospitals have, since the end of the second wave in early June, installed oxygen capacity either in the form of liquid oxygen tanks or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, AHNA members. Meanwhile, government hospitals have been told to create separate isolation wards for suspected Omicron variant patients. Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, said a ward of 12 beds has been earmarked for isolation purposes. “If needed, another ward of 12 beds is on stand-by in the 1,200-bed hospital. All infrastructure is ready along with an oxygen plant to tackle any possible increase in Covid cases,” he said. Sources close to the developments told TOI that three hotels and 10 private hospitals are under consideration by the civic authorities for isolation of asymptomatic patients who don’t need intensive care. As of Monday, 185 persons are in home isolation in Ahmedabad and are being monitored by Sanjeevani Raths. Senior state health department officials said that across the state, more than 100 beds are prepared for isolation of patients suspected to have the Omicron variant. “These wards are only for suspected cases.

---||Mumbai||You created problem, you face it: SC to state on OBC quota||New Delhi: The SC on Monday said the state government’s decision to reserve 27 % seats for OBCs in local bodies was violative of its March judgement in which it had held the government cannot justify the reservation for OBCs without fulfilling the ‘triple test’—(1) setting up a dedicated commission to conduct empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness qua local bodies (2) specifying the proportion of reservation required to be given and (3) in any case such reservation shall not exceed aggregate of 50% of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioners, contended that the ordinance was illegal, unconstitutional and not in conformity with SC’s ruling and sought immediate stay. Opposing the interim stay, senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, appearing for state, contended no one from the OBC community would be represented in local bodies if it is stayed. The bench, however, said, “You have to face the problem as you have created the problem. It amounts to undoing the judgement of the Constitution bench and three-judge bench in March... Your political compulsion cannot be the basis to undo our judgement.” The bench then directed the state election commission to not proceed with the polls for seats reserved for OBCs. It, however, clarified the election commission can conduct polls for the rest of seats reserved for SC and ST and unreserved seats as per the schedule fixed by it. The SC on March 4 had upheld validity of the Maharashtra law to reserve seats for backward classes in zilla parishad elections but said it cannot be implemented till the government meets the triple conditions fixed by its Constitution bench. Noting that even the first step of setting up of a commission remained a “mirage” and the state itself conceded that in case of some local bodies, quota has far exceeded 50%, SC quashed all notifications issued by the state for OBC reservation in election. Exactly 10 months after its verdict, SC again blocked the state move and said although the state appointed the panel, it moved ahead without waiting for the commission’s report. The court said the state passing an ordinance impinges its verdict and cannot be allowed. The state had brought an ordinance to amend two laws — Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayats—to ensure quota for OBCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/you-created-problem-you-face-it-sc-to-state-on-obc-quota/articleshow/88132099.cms||---

The second offence deals with such an assault being committed repeatedly. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment. “Only by the virtue of the already stated fact in charge sheet that accused is the Father of the church and offence was committed more than once that section 5 (f) and 5(l) is being added. Thus, no prejudice will be caused to the accused as both the parties will be at liberty to lead further evidence, if any,” the court said. The plea to alter the charges was moved by the prosecution.

Convalescent plasma showed some early promise when given intravenously to people sick with Covid-19. But in advice published in the British Medical Journal, the WHO now says that "current evidence shows that it does not improve survival nor reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, and it is costly and time-consuming to administer". It made a "strong recommendation" against the use of blood plasma in people who do not have serious Covid-19 symptoms and said that even for patients with severe and critical illness, the treatment should only be given as part of a clinical trial. Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood from a recovered Covid patient that contains antibodies produced by the body after being infected. It was one of the array of potential treatments investigated early in the pandemic, but has shown limited benefit in clinical trials. The WHO said its latest recommendations were based on evidence from 16 trials involving 16,236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical Covid-19 infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/who-advises-against-blood-plasma-treatment-for-covid-19/articleshow/88133525.cms||---

Following over a year of lull owing to the outbreak of the global pandemic in March last year, many guest houses and hotels in picturesque locales such as Netarhat, Betla, Dalma and the likes are already reporting advance bookings for Christmas and year end revelry. “We are full from December 20 to 31. Compared to normal days, we are receiving heavy footfalls on weekends. This weekend, hordes of tourists from Chhattisgarh, West Bengal visited and there is absolutely no fear or apprehensions among anyone,” said Abdul Wahab, manager of Prabhat Vihar hotel in Netarhat, one of the most visited destinations located in Latehar district. Prabhat Vihar hotel, a government-owned facility, has about 39 rooms and 12 swiss cottages. “All are currently booked from third week of December till the end of this month. We are flooded with queries to accommodate but are helpless,” he said. Agreed an official of Green Palace, a private hotel located near Netarhar dam, “The successive lockdowns have stressed everyone and people now want to simply unwind to break the monotony of battling negativity for so long.” Betla in Palamu Tiger Reserve in adjacent Palamu district is also receiving encouraging footfalls. A manager at hotel Van Vihar in Betla said that they are getting floating crowd more than those willing to spend night stay. “Those visit Netarhat come here to spend the day. But we have started receiving bookings for Christmas and New Year holidays,” he said.

The sight of migratory birds all over the lake just adds to the charm,” said Ramakant Mishra, who runs an eatery near the lake stating that this site draws crowd round the year irrespective of the seasons. Alok Kumar, general manager of Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation (JTDC), conceded about fresh concerns of the virus spread but said that the decision on any further curbs will have to be taken by the government. “From our end, we have ensured that all our staff and workers at tourist spots are vaccinated and follow all the prescribed protocols.

Teachers can convince the students better than anyone else and they can make the students as well as their parents understand the importance of vaccination.” Gumla DC Shishir Kumar Sinha said, “Our focus is to make sure every eligible adult is vaccinated and since schools and colleges have a major chunk of the 18+ population, we are encouraging all those who have not taken the jab yet or are yet to take the second dose to do so at the earliest.” In addition, the administration has divided blocks into clusters for better monitoring of the vaccination drive. “Around 10-12 villages have been grouped together and district-level authorities have been deputed as nodal officers there to effectively conduct and monitor the vaccination drive,” Satyarthi said. Gumla civil surgeon Raju Kachhap said, “A joint coordination team of medical officers from the community health centres and BDOs have been engaged in those blocks where the vaccination rate is below 50% and we have pressed our all medical personnel to complete the vaccination target at the earliest.” The district has to inoculate 7,48,309 persons throughout Gumla and till now, 4,41,487 have taken their first dose while 2,28,870 have taken both the doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gumla-admin-targets-educational-institutes-to-boost-vax-coverage/articleshow/88132168.cms||K A Gupta

Last week, senior party workers and former spokesperson Alok Dubey, Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo and Rajesh Kumar Gupta had jointly supported JPSC countering opposition BJP’s demand for a CBI probe or an investigation by a sitting judge into the exams which were held in September this year citing anomalies in the PT results. Several JPSC aspirants too have been protesting against it demanding cancellation of the exams. Reacting to the controversy on the sidelines of a news meet at his residence in the afternoon, Tirkey said, “If questions are raised on JPSC, it must be open to probe. A genuine investigation is must to restore confidence about JPSC and its examination conducting process among aspirants and public at large.” He, however, didn’t wish to comment on his party members’ stand (views) on the issue stating he hadn’t heard or read about it. Congress president Rajesh Thakur too had refused to comment on the issue while talking to reporters at party office late last week stating that the JPSC is an independent and autonomous body and is competent enough to take its own decisions. He had also said that it would be inappropriate to make any comments after Governor Ramesh Bais’s intervention into the matter who had summoned JPSC chairman to Raj Bhavan to take stock of the situation. Unperturbed by the protests and questions over the process, JPSC has decided to go ahead with holding the mains exam (written) of seventh to 10th civil services from December 28. Upset over it, the unsuccessful candidates have decided to take out ‘Rajyapal Nyay Guhar Yatra’ from Morhabadi ground to Raj Bhawan on December 7 to press for cancellation of PT results and thorough probe. The results stoked controversy after many candidates with serialwise roll numbers in a few handful of examination centre allegedly cleared the exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-leader-tirkey-suggests-probe-into-jpsc-exam-row/articleshow/88131974.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The survey has put the sex ratio at 899 girl children against every 1,000 male children in the last five years. This ratio was slightly better at 919:1000 in NFHS-4 survey carried out in 2015-16. It was even better at 1022 girl children for every 1000 male child in NFHS-3 carried out in 2005-06. Despite this decline in the ratio of girl children at birth, the gender ratio of overall population is indicating an improvement. The NFHS-5 claims population gender ratio of 1050 women for every 1000 men which is better than NFHS-4 indicator of 1002 women in Jharkhand for every 1000 men. Earlier in 2005-06 (NFHS-3), the gender ratio was 1022 women for every 1000 men. Social policy officer at Unicef Jharkhand, Onkar Tripathy, explains this paradox saying the mortality rate of male children upto the age of five years is more than girl children. “There can be a difference in the gender ratio at birth and gender ratio of overall population because it has been a common observation that the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) among male children is more and further the longevity of women is more than their male counterparts which also leads to changes in the overall gender ratio,” he said. The district-wise figure of gender ratio in Jharkhand also catches attention. While in Charta, the gender ratio at birth is as poor as 764 girl child against every 1000 male children, there are as many as 1028 girl children over every 1000 male child in Gumla. However, the gender ratio of population in Chatra is far better at 1136 women per 1000 men than any other district of the state. For comparison’s sake, the gender ratio of population in Gumla is 1024 women for every 1000 men. Raj Kumar Gope, team leader of Ekjut, a not-for-profit organisation working in the field of health and nutrition, says that there could be some issue with data collection. “I have analysed the NFHS -5 data in detail and was surprised to note some of the paradoxes. The survey was conducted in two phases. There were 22 states and UTs in the first phase survey which ensued prior to Covid between October17, 2019 and February 2, 2020 while the survey was carried out in the remaining states and UTs in two phases — January 20, 2020 to March 21, 2020 and December 5, 2020 to April 18, 2021 — which included post-lockdown phase,” he said. Gope said pre-Covid states have not showed any improvement in nutritional standards like stunting, wasting and underweight whereas phase II states surveyed after lockdown, when Anganwadi centres, schools were closed, improvements on nutritional parameters can be seen. Secretary, Women and Child Development, government of Jharkhand, A Dodde, believes that NFHS is a sample survey in which the sample size is small. “It gives us indicators and from the indicators we can understand that the number of girl child is decreasing but as far as population gender ratio is concerned, we must wait for the decadal census report to get real figures,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-of-girl-children-in-jkhand-down-but-gender-ratio-improves-says-health-study/articleshow/88131994.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

JNAC special officer Krishna Kumar on Monday issued letters to the hotel industry to make sure the machine is installed within the timeline or face action. “From January 2022, the sanitary personnel of JNAC will not collect the wet organic waste from the hotels hence they have to arrange for the compost machine,” said Kumar. The hotels that produce wet waste more than 50 kg daily have been asked to install composter in the first phase. With over 100 plus hotels in the two adjoining towns of Jamshedpur and Adityapur, two dozen plus hotels produce wet waste in large quantity, industry insiders said. "We welcome the decision of the JNAC but have to see whether it is feasible to install the machine in such a short period of time," said hotelier and former president of Jamshedpur Hoteliers’ Association, Anil Khemka. Noting that the organic waste composter costs about Rs 5 lakh to Rs 50 lakh depending on the capacity and features of the machine, Khemka said hotel industry is battling the earning crisis borne out of Covid-19 curbs, sparing few lakhs on new initiative is difficult for a section of the hotels currently. The officials at JNAC, which is a local urban body (LUB) said that 300-350 tonnes of municipal waste is generated in the city daily, 20% of the waste comes from hotels and restaurants. The JNAC signaled that shortly meeting with the hotel industry representatives will be held in regarding the proposal. Hotelier Raja Singh said the hotels could contribute the LUB in producing compost fertilizer. JNAC is planning on a series of new ideas to improve municipal waste index after it was adjudged AIR 12 in the 10 lakh population category in the Swachh Survekshan 2021. It also earned Rs 5 crore prize money coming second in the safai mitr challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jsr-hotels-asked-to-set-up-organic-waste-compost-machines/articleshow/88132203.cms||B Sridhar

He, however, said the health department has activated its plans to be battle-ready to tackle exigencies arising out of the latest variant, which after its origin in South Africa over a week ago has spread to many countries, including India. Considering the ongoing marriage season, state government is in no mood to instill panic by re-introducing curbs on the gatherings. “The state government unlocked gradually only after a lot of assessment, keeping public safety in mind. The major unlock was done ahead of the festival season starting from October this year to respect public sentiments after cases of Covid-19 were contained effectively. The situation is under control in our state and we are vigilant. Further action will be taken after evaluating the situation,” he said. On taking pre-emptive steps in the light of Omicron, he said the state government has already brought in quarantine rule for international travellers. “Fourteen-day mandatory quarantine has been reintroduced for international passengers. First, seven-day quarantine is compulsory for all international returnees to state and after that even if they test negative again, they should be in another seven-day quarantine. Testing of incoming passengers at all transit points have been intensified and the districts have been asked to ramp up vaccination,” he said. While many are demanding reopening of schools for primary classes, the government is still to take any decision in this regard. On the health department’s preparedness, Gupta said Rims is readying a bedded facility for Covid patients in its multistoried building. “This apart, another 30-bed facility is being readied at trauma centre for those requiring critical care. All districts have been asked to reassess their bed strength, availability and further requirements at PICU, NICU and normal wards and send us the reports with their requirements for strengthening the infrastructure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/omicron-any-fresh-curb-only-after-evaluating-situation-banna/articleshow/88131845.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Candidates connect with voters via nukkad meets||CHANDIGARH: Instead of big rallies, candidates of all major parties, including BJP, Congress, AAP, SAD, BSP, along with independents are preferring nukkad meetings and door-to-door campaigns to connect with voters ahead of the municipal corporation elections. The former deputy mayor and Congress candidate from Ward 33 (Burail village) who has been holding small meetings and door-to-door campaign, said he is making one-to-one contact with residents of his ward. “The sitting councillor has neglected the ward in the last five years and failed to carry out developmental work.

Holding a door-to-door campaign for his wife Harpreet Kaur Babla, who is Congress candidate from Ward 10 (Sectors 27, 28 and 29), Babla said high prices of fuel and mustard oil has hit people from all sections. The municipal corporation during BJP’s regime imposed various taxes on public while it failed to solve the problem of sanitation, which is why the city slipped to 66th position in Swachhta rankings, said Babla, while seeking vote for his wife, on the development carried out by him in the ward in the last five years. Harpreet said she would carry forward the good work started by her husband in the ward and will plan future projects in the ward with the consultation of public. Congress have decided to corner the BJP over rising inflation, poor Swachh rankings, non-performance of the municipal corporation and sitting BJP councillors. Congress has already conveyed to its candidates to keep these points as main points of every speech, posters and campaigns, including those on the social media, to highlight failures of BJP in Chandigarh. Box: Cong exposing BJP’s lies: Lucky H S Lucky, former deputy mayor and Congress candidate from Ward 2 (Sectors 1 to 10), said BJP councillors were not approachable and missing from the scene whenever people needed them the most. Be it inflation, sanitation or roads, the BJP has miserably failed in all fronts not only at national level, but in Chandigarh as well, he said, adding that the rising inflation has hit every section of the society. In the recent months, the BJP-ruled MC tried to give a ‘cosmetic’ look to the city, which is merely an eyewash, Lucky said. Congress candidates are exposing BJP’s lies before the public during door-to-door campaign, Lucky added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/inflation-poor-swachhta-rank-congs-key-issues-against-bjp/articleshow/88132412.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
