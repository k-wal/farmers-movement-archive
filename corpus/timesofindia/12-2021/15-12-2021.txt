The deceased Chittaranjan Palei (27) had been working for Dasburma for the last few years. On Sunday, the family members of Palei lodged a complaint with Sadar police alleging that he had been missing since Saturday night. They told the police that he had gone to attend a party with some of his friends in Puri on Saturday evening. As they suspected that Palei might have been kidnapped, the police registered a case under section 364 (kidnapping for murder) of the IPC on Sunday. On Monday morning, Palei’s body was fished out from a river near Gadamrugashira village. Based on the complaint of his family, the police registered a murder case. “I strongly suspect the involvement of Sanjay Dasburma and one Jaga, who was my husband’s friend, in the murder. The police should interrogate them,” Palei’s wife Priyanka told media persons. The family members alleged that there was some personal dispute between Dasburma and Palei. The development comes close on the heels of the controversy surrounding BJD ministers Dibya Shankar Mishra and Pratap Jena in two separate murder cases. Dasburma denied the allegations. “I am deeply saddened by Palei’s death. His wife is like my daughter. A thorough inquiry will reveal the truth and ascertain the cause of his death. I am in no way linked with the death,” Dasburma told journalists. Puri superintendent of police Kanwar Vishal Singh has constituted a special investigation team (SIT) for expeditious investigation of the case. “Additional superintendent of police Purna Chandra Pradhan will head the SIT. Early detection of the case and collection of evidence will remain the top priority of the SIT,” Singh said. On Tuesday, the BJP demanded Dasburma's resignation from the post of the deputy chairman of the state planning board. Dasburma said the family members of the deceased met the Puri SP and demanded a Crime Branch inquiry into the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/now-senior-bjd-leader-sanjay-dasburma-gets-dragged-into-murder-row/articleshow/88285181.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Railway officials who later accessed the CCTV footage were horrified to see the wild cat moving near the circulating area of the station around 3.15am. KR officials confirmed the presence of the wild cat at the station but denied any face to face encounter with any passenger or staff as there were no trains scheduled to halt here at that time. “Very few long distance trains halt at Bhoke and there were no passengers at the station when the leopard was spotted except for few railway employees including the signal staff who were present in their respective offices,” said a senior KR official. The CCTV footage shows the leopard ascending the steps leading to the main circulating area and stealthily treading towards a canine and pouncing on him following which it slipped away in the darkness with its catch. The station is located a few kilometre away from Ratnagiri towards the Mumbai end and is surrounded by dense forests but the sighting of leopards at the station has been rare, said officials working on the section. Meanwhile, officials acquainted with the stretch said due to close proximity of jungles, the ground staff deployed here usually doesn’t venture out alone post-midnight and are known to keep office doors shut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/leopard-spotted-at-kr-station/articleshow/88285558.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||India||Rajnath Singh asks DRDO to fast develop hypersonic weapons||NEW DELHI: With China, Russia and the US actively building aerodynamically manoeuverable hypersonic weapons that fly over five times the speed of sound (Mach 5), defence minister Rajnath Singh has directed DRDO to move fast towards developing such arsenal to 'maintain' India’s minimum credible deterrence against adversaries. Towards this end, India is planning to conduct another test of its hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV), powered by a scramjet engine, by early next year, said sources. The HSTDV, which was successfully tested for the first time in September last year, will serve as a crucial building block in the development of long-range hypersonic weapons, which will take at least another four to five years to become a reality. A hypersonic weapon can either be a `glide vehicle’ launched from a rocket or a scramjet-powered `cruise missile’. Speaking at a DRDO event on Tuesday, the defence minister said ballistic missile defence systems are getting more and more robust with the passage of time. “In order to maintain a minimum credible deterrence, we have to immediately think about hypersonic cruise missile development. It will be a revolutionary step in our defence sector and we all have to put our efforts into it,” he said. Singh formally handed over an indigenous anti-drone system, smart anti-airfield weapon (SAAW), modular bridge and advanced chaff variants to the armed forces at the event. But his remarks on hypersonic weapons were significant, though he did not elaborate. They came in the backdrop of China’s test of a nuclear-capable missile carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle and warhead on July 27 this year, which stunned military experts around the world. China has stolen the march over the US, which has not yet developed hypersonic weapons with nuclear warheads. Russian President Vladimir Putin, on his part, claims his country is the global leader in developing hypersonic missiles. Deliveries of the latest Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles to the Russian Navy will begin in 2022, he recently said. India, of course, is nowhere close to developing hypersonic weapons that can defeat an enemy’s missile defence shields with the combination of high speed and manoeuverability. Last year’s test involved the `cruise vehicle’ or HSTDV being carried by the ‘launch vehicle’ powered by the solid rocket motor of an Agni-I ballistic missile to a 30-km altitude. The cruise vehicle then separated and auto-ignited its scramjet engine to fly on its own for 23 seconds at Mach 6 speed. The HSTDV tests in the coming years will require longer duration hypersonic flights to eventually pave the way for development of hypersonic weapons. The Indian Armed Forces already have the conventional ramjet-powered BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which fly at Mach 2.8 speed, developed jointly with Russia. Their strike range is being enhanced from the original 290-km to well over 400-km now. But while ramjet engines operate well at supersonic speeds around Mach 3, their efficiency drops at hypersonic speeds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajnath-singh-asks-drdo-to-fast-develop-hypersonic-weapons/articleshow/88285554.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||Mumbai||In custody for one offence, accused can get pre-arrest bail in another: Bombay HC||MUMBAI : An accused can be granted pre-arrest bail even if he is in custody in connection with another offence, Bombay High Court held on Tuesday. The verdict was delivered by Justice V G Bisht on an anticipatory bail application under section 438 CrPC by a Pune resident in an FIR lodged by the Deccan Police. Since the applicant is in custody in another offence, the additional session’s judge, Pune, dismissed it on the ground of maintainability citing a Rajasthan HC decision. Justice Bisht disagreed and referred to a Supreme Court verdict that ABA will not be maintainable in case a person is in custody in the same offence for which pre-arrest bail is sought. He noted that in the present case the applicant is in custody in the offence registered by Koregaon Park police and is yet to be arrested in the FIR by Deccan Police. Justice Bisht agreed with the applicant’s advocate Subodh Desai, that there was “no proper interpretation” of section 438 by the additional sessions judge.  “Accused has every right, even if he is arrested in a number of cases, to move (court ) in each of the offence registered against him irrespective of the fact that he is already in custody but for a different offence, for the reason that the application (s) will have to be heard and decided on merits independent of another crime in which he is already in custody,’’ said Justice Bisht. He added that “one cannot and must not venture, under the garb of interpretation," to substantiate its own meaning to the plain and simple words of the statute. Setting aside the order, he directed the additional sessions judge to hear the applicant’s ABA “on its own merit and in accordance with law expeditiously and preferably”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-custody-for-one-offence-accused-can-get-pre-arrest-bail-in-another-bombay-hc/articleshow/88285845.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mumbai||City may have to shift working hours towards morning or evening, says study||MUMBAI: City may have to shift the working hours towards morning or evening if the current pollution or carbon emission trends and subsequent warming continues. According to a study published by Duke university in an international journal 'Nature Communications' the current temperatures are showing a loss of about 4-5 minutes per hour due to hot and humid weather in Mumbai. This means a loss of an hour during 12 working hours. With the rise of global warming with one degree each, the same may double to 10 minutes each hour, paper warns. The loss of per hour work hours is around 12 minutes in Ahmedabad while Chennai and Hyderabad are close to Mumbai. The current temperature starts rising above 26 degree at 12 noon onwards. Thus every extra degree of global warming will cause greater and greater labour losses, and moving heavy labour to the cooler hours of the day will become less effective as the world warms, paper reveals. "There are physiological limits to the heat/humidity combinations that humans can tolerate. On larger grounds the world currently loses ~280-311 billion USD per year due to workers struggling in hot, humid conditions, and if the world gets 2°C hotter than now (about 3°C above pre-industrial levels) those losses would rise to 1.6 trillion USD," study points out. Global warming will cause labour losses most acutely in the tropics and subtropics but also increasingly impacting mid-latitudes, the paper says. Each degree of warming leads to exponential, not linear, losses in labour productivity. For example, the number of hours lost in the 12-hour workday increases from ~101 billion hours per °C in the last 42 years to 197 billion hours per °C (+/-11 billion hours) with an additional 2°C of global warming, suggests the study. This is the first study at the global scale assessing how effective it is to move heavy work to the cooler parts of the day as an adaptation to climate change. Currently, moving labour out of the hottest 3 hours of the day can recoup about 30% of productivity losses. However, this may cause other issues, for example due to poor sleep during increasingly hot, humid weather. The possibility to adapt to climate change by moving some work to cooler hours reduces by about 2% with each extra degree of warming. Under an additional 2°C of future warming (total about 3°C above pre-industrial levels), more global labour would be lost in the coolest 12 hours of the day than is currently lost in the hottest 12 hours of the day. All of the findings are conservative, as they reflect conditions in the shade - conditions in full sun will be much worse. "In the present-day climate, an average summer day in a location like New Delhi, India or Doha, Qatar exposes workers in the shade to midday heat exposure that would cause productivity losses of ~15-20 minutes/hour of safe work time. By contrast, in the early morning hours there are less than 10 minutes/hour of productivity losses," study said. When labour losses per person are scaled up to the working age population involved in heavy outdoor labour, India experiences the largest heat exposure impacts on heavy labor (>101 billion hours lost/year) in the world Under future warming, India, China, Pakistan, and Indonesia experience the largest population-weighted labor and economic losses. Heat exposure could be causing chronic kidney disease in otherwise healthy, relatively young workers in Central America, Sri Lanka, India, and Egypt and other areas. 'Many workers are already stopping work in the afternoon because it's too hot. I thought the early morning would remain cool enough to comfortably work, but I was shocked at how quickly even the coolest hours of the day become too hot to work continuously' said Dr. Luke Parsons, Duke University. 'I was surprised to find that the ability of workers to adapt to warming is not only reduced, but is also reduced increasingly quickly with each degree of global warming' he added. 'With just two degrees of warming, more global labor will be lost in the coolest half of the day than is currently lost in the hottest half of the day.' Dr. Luke Parsons, Duke University.' Sadly, many of the countries and people most impacted by current and future labor losses are not responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions'||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/weather-update-mumbai-city-may-have-to-shift-working-hours-towards-morning-or-evening-says-study/articleshow/88285457.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Over 60 exotic turtles, marine pets abandoned in last six months, raising concern||MUMBAI: A shocking statistic that nearly 60 exotic turtles -- mainly the red-eared sliders -- have been callously abandoned by the pet owners in the last six months during the ongoing pandemic.  The wildlife NGO Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW) had rescued most of these abandoned marine pets from Navi Mumbai, Thane and Mumbai areas. Just this Sunday, a red-eared slider turtle was found at Juhu Beach, close to Ramada hotel, in Mumbai, informed advocate Anil Dsouza, who had visited the shore with his family. Honorary wildlife wardenand founder of RAWW, Pawan Sharma, said: ``Just recently, two red-eared sliders were rescued from Airoli creek (on December 2) and a waterbody in Ghansoli (on November 21). Pet owners who are not able to take care of these exotic pets during the pandemic are cruelly releasing such marine species in ponds, lakes and even beaches. However, since these foreign breeds cannot survive for long, they have to be rescued.'' Sharma added that besides rescues in Navi Mumbai and Thane areas, the exotic turtles and even species of Indian star tortoise have been rescued within Mumbai at CST, Dadar, Andheri, Chembur, Powai , Santacruz, Kanjurmarg , Mulund among other areas earlier this year. ``Some of the turtles were also abandoned in gardens or dumped inside dustbins. It is better to hand over the exotic pets to a responsible animal NGO, if the pet owners are unable to afford their maintenance costs,'' he added. The red-eared sliders are originally from south America and Mexico; but because of their attractive looks, they are smuggled all over the world to be sold as pets. ``It is harmful and illegal to release exotic marine animals in local Indian environment as it can lead to an inter-species tussle with the indigenous turtles and tortoises. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau has in the past take action against the smuggling of exotic turtles and other wild species,'' added Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-60-exotic-turtles-marine-pets-abandoned-in-last-six-months-raising-concern/articleshow/88285991.cms||Vijay Singh
---||India||SC cites national security, allows Char Dham project||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed widening of major portions of the strategic Char Dham road project in Uttarakhand to enable speedy deployment of men, machinery and armament by the armed forces on the India-China borders, given the recent Chinese build-up, but struck a delicate balance on green concerns by ordering strict implementation of environment protection measures. Except for the road leading from Rishikesh to Yamunotri, which the ministry of defence (MoD) had not sought permission to widen, a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath gave MoD and ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) permission for double lane paved shoulder (DLPS) highways linking Rishikesh to Mana (beyond Badrinath), Rishikesh to Gangotri and Tanakpur to Pithoragarh. This will provide an additional two-metre width to strategic roads for easy and rapid transportation of men and defence equipment. In doing so, the bench modified the court’s September 8, 2020 order, passed by a bench headed by Justice RF Nariman, declining permission to widen the strategic roads as per the requirement of the armed forces. While the SC’s 2020 order was based on MoRTH notification of 2018, Tuesday’s judgment allowed double-lane carriageway with paved shoulders as provided in the 2020 MoRTH circular. The extra width is typically marked at the sides of the carriageways. Writing the 83-page judgment that weighed the national security concerns and requirement of armed forces and the indisputable need to protect the environment, Justice Chandrachud said the SC-constituted high-powered committee’s (HPC) recommendations for preservation of environment and remedial measures in carrying out the Chardham project must be implemented in letter and spirit. This is aimed at preserving transfer of inter-generational environmental capital. Justices Chandrachud, Kant and Nath unanimously felt that the national highways provide vital connections to the establishments of the armed forces along the Nelong Axis, Mana Pass, Rimkhim Pass, Niti Pass and Lipulekh Pass (all of it along the Indo-China border). “We find that the need for the development of national highways of a DLPS standard is proportionate to the object of fulfilling the security concerns of the nation as assessed by the MoD. This is reinforced by the fact that the roads beyond the highways in the project, beyond Gangotri, Mana and Pithoragarh are being developed by the MoD as double-laned highways,” the bench said. The previously appointed high powered committee on the project could not have evaluated the security aspect, they held. The three-judge bench set up an oversight committee headed by former SC judge A K Sikri, and comprising a representative each from National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI and Forest Research Institute, to ensure implementation of the HPC-recommended environment protection measures for Chardham project. However, the Justice Chanrachud-led bench clarified that the objective of the committee is “not to undertake an environmental analysis of the project afresh but to assess the implementation of the recommendations already provided by the HPC”. The SC directed all authorities concerned, including MoD and MoRTH, to place a monthly report on compliance of environmental safeguards before the committee, which in turn will file a report before the SC every four months. It said the HPC “shall continue with its work on overseeing the implementation of its recommendations for the project, except for the national highways from Rishikesh to Mana, Rishikesh to Gangotri, and Tanakpur to Pithoragarh, which shall now fall under the purview of the Oversight Committee”. The bench said a statement made to the media by then Army chief Bipan Rawat that existing roads were good enough for the needs of the Army cannot be cited as a ground to deny widening of roads. “The appellants (NGO Citizens for Green Doon) have referred to a statement made...in 2019 in a media interview... The recent past has thrown up serious challenges to national security. The Armed Forces cannot be held down to a statement made during a media interaction in 2019 as if it were a decree written in stone.... This Court, in its exercise of judicial review, cannot second-guess the infrastructural needs of the Armed Forces... The submission of the appellants requires the Court to interrogate the policy choice of the establishment which is entrusted by law with the defence of the nation. This is impermissible.” A controversy had emerged with the HPC report on the Char Dham project. While the overwhelming majority approved the project, the chairman of the HPC had authored a dissent note citing environmental catastrophe that could be triggered by the project on a young mountain range like the Himalayas. Justice Chandrachud said the HPC may be competent to assess the environmental impact of the project on Himalayas but was certainly not qualified to assess the security needs of the country, given the recent developments on the northern borders due to amassing of troops and positioning of armaments by China. “The competing interests that the HPC had to evaluate were environmental concerns as against infrastructural development, the primary reason of which in this project was focused on increasing tourism, providing an impetus to the economy, and ease of transportation for undertaking the Char Dham pilgrimage. Balancing the interests of defence as against environmental considerations was outside the ambit of the HPC,” the bench said. Extracting the environmental concerns and mitigation measures suggested by HPC for Char Dham project, the bench said, “We direct that the MoRTH and MoD can proceed with the project subject to the condition that it addresses all the concerns which have been raised by the HPC and enumerated by this court in this judgment...” “The considerations for development of national highways in plains and in hilly and mountainous regions are not identical. Similarly, the considerations governing the construction of highways that are strategic roads from a defence perspective, and may be used by the armed forces of the nation, cannot be the same as those for other roads in hilly and mountainous regions. We must therefore arrive at a delicate balance of environmental considerations such that they do not impede infrastructural development, specifically in areas of strategic importance crucial to the security of the nation,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-cites-national-security-allows-char-dham-project/articleshow/88286163.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Business||On Nooyi path: Unilever HR head Leena Nair is Chanel global CEO||MUMBAI: French luxury group Chanel has named Leena Nair, the chief human resource officer (CHRO) of Unilever, as its global CEO. This makes Nair, born and brought up in Kolhapur, the second Indian-origin woman to take over as a global CEO after Indra Nooyi (PepsiCo). Incidentally, Nooyi happens to be Nair’s mentor. Nair’s appointment is not only a big leg-up for aspiring women leaders, it’s also a major thrust to the HR function, to bring CHROs to the forefront of leadership candidature. A Chanel statement said Alain Wertheimer (the owner) will move to the role of global executive chairman and Nair, 52, will assume the role of global CEO based in London, UK. The new partnership “will further ensure long-term success as a private company, believing in the freedom of creation, cultivating human potential and acting to have a positive impact in the world”, it added. The $10-billion Chanel competes with global luxury firms such as $50-billion LVMH (Louis Vuitton), Hermes, Gucci, L’Oreal, Michael Kors, among others. “I am humbled and honoured to be appointed the Global Chief Executive Officer of Chanel, an iconic and admired company. I am so inspired by what Chanel stands for. It is a company that believes in the freedom of creation, in cultivating human potential and in acting to have a positive impact in the world,” Nair said in a post on LinkedIn. “I am grateful for my long career at Unilever, a place that has been my home for 30 years. It has given me so many opportunities to learn, grow and contribute to a truly purpose-driven organisation. I will always be a proud advocate of Unilever and its ambition to make sustainable living commonplace,” she added. In a statement announcing Nair’s decision to leave the company in January 2022, Unilever CEO Alan Jope said: “Leena has been a pioneer throughout her career at Unilever, but no more so than in her role as CHRO, where she has been a driving force on our equity, diversity and inclusion agenda, on the transformation of our leadership development, and on our preparedness for the future of work. She has played a critical role in building our purpose-led, future-fit organisation, which is now the employer of choice in over 50 countries globally. I am also especially grateful for her leadership over the last two years, and how our HR teams have helped Unilever manage through the many challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic with great care, compassion and professionalism.” Under Nair’s leadership, Unilever moved the needle to attain a gender-balanced workforce. Although it’s rare to find a CHRO taking over as CEO, the announcement opens up such avenues for HR leaders, given the rapid shifts taking place after the pandemic. People management and thus HR now is central to organisations. HR leaders, by the nature of their function, would embody some of the emerging traits required in a CEO today — empathy being the key trait that is gaining traction. A gold medallist from XLRI Jamshedpur, Nair is a much-celebrated HR leader globally. Recently, in a post on LinkedIn, Nair said: “I always tell HR people they need to walk with swagger... HR is no longer a backroom department, it’s a vital part of running any successful business. If you want to support your people, you need to understand how the business works, and you need to be visible within the business.” Commenting on her appointment, Keki Dadiseth, who was the chairman of Hindustan Unilever when Nair was a rising star, told TOI: “She was always very competent and very ambitious and, most importantly, did better with increased responsibility. She richly deserves her success.” In past interactions with TOI, Nair had mentioned how she proactively went up to her former managers and leaders like Dadiseth to get guidance on her career. She highlights this quality as one of the reasons behind her success. Nair, who studied at Holy Cross Convent School in Kolhapur and passed out as an engineer in electronics and telecommunications from Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli, opted to pursue HR, much to the dismay of her father (an industrialist from Kolhapur). That was a major turning point for Nair, who decided to follow her heart. After joining HUL as a management trainee in 1992, Nair worked in various roles in factories, sales and the corporate headquarters in HUL. She brought about several changes and rose through the ranks to become executive director HR. In 2016, she went on to become the first woman as well as Asian and the youngest-ever CHRO of Unilever and member of the Unilever Leadership Executive, with responsibility for the company’s 150,000 people across more than 100 countries globally. Nair’s career trajectory provides a perspective on why doing what one is passionate about is important. She often speaks about her purpose being “to ignite the human spark to build a better business and a better world”. This year, Nair also figured on Fortune India’s Most Powerful Women List. Nair is breaking several stereotypes not just with respect to gender but leadership traits as well. While the world has mostly seen and preferred the command and control kind of leaders, Nair, on the other hand, is vocal about traits such as humility and empathy. Recently, she even said how leaders would not become weak if they revealed their vulnerable side, or by admitting to making mistakes. Nair is also a non-executive member of BT plc, a member of the board of the Leverhulme Trust, and was a non-executive director in the UK’s department of business, energy and industrial strategy. Nair is married with two sons, and her interests include reading, running, and Bollywood dancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/on-nooyi-path-unilever-hr-head-leena-nair-is-chanel-global-ceo/articleshow/88286278.cms||Namrata Singh

A bench of Justices L N Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna in its order said, “The Centre, states and UTs as well as other authorities are directed to commence issuance of ration cards and voter i-cards immediately to sex workers, list of which is maintained by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). The authorities can take assistance of State AIDS Control authorities”. The seven states going to poll next year are UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. Amicus Curiae Pijush K Roy submitted a compilation of affidavits on sex workers filed by some states. Roy said most states have commenced giving dry ration to sex workers on the direction of the SC, which had passed the order last year. He said only Haryana hasn’t given any dry ration yet and promises to start from January. Amicus Curiae and advocate Jayant Bhushan said it is not clear from the affidavits of the state governments whether the dry ration is being provided without a break or was it stopped after making provision for the same for one or two months during the pandemic. The bench said, “There is no reason why a direction of the apex court, passed a decade ago, has not been implemented till now”. It asked the states and UTs to file compliance affidavit in four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/issue-voter-ids-ration-cards-to-sex-workers-immediately-sc/articleshow/88286415.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Opposing a plea of the Maharashtra government, which is seeking direction to the Centre to disclose the raw data on the number of OBCs, collected under the SECC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar that there could not be any objection to OBC reservation but the data collected in the 2011 case census are unreliable and unusable for any purpose, including for granting quota in jobs, admissions to educational institutions or elections. As the apex court recently stayed OBC reservation in local body elections in Maharashtra for not passing the 'triple test' on several counts, including for want of OBC data, the state is seeking the SC's direction to Centre for getting the 2011 census data which could be used for deciding the quota for OBCs. The top court had referred to the triple condition noted in the Constitution bench verdict of 2010. The conditions included - to specify the proportion of reservation required to be provisioned local body-wise in light of the recommendations of the commission so as not to fall foul of overbreadth and in any case such reservation shall not exceed an aggregate of 50% of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/favour-obc-quota-in-local-polls-but-not-on-basis-of-flawed-2011-census-centre/articleshow/88286466.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

In a written reply, junior home minister Nityanand Rai informed that Uttar Pradesh not only accounted for the highest arrests of those below 30 (931) under the anti-terror law in the past three years but also 70% of the total arrests made in the state under UAPA over this period were in the sub-30 age group. The minister ruled out any plans to amend the UAPA in the light of recent evidence about a large number of acquittals and for preventing the harassment of innocent people due to alleged misuse of the law, saying the law had been amended in the past "keeping in view the requirements". As many as 2,501 of the total 4,390 people arrested under UAPA between 2018 and 2020 were aged less than 30 years. Of the 2,501 under-30 arrested accused, maximum were in UP (931), followed by Manipur (499), J&K (366), Jharkhand (218) and Assam (122). The MHA said while 4,390 arrests were made under UAPA in the three years since 2018, 1,080 people got bail in the same period while 325 were acquitted and 149 convicted. Rai said no information regarding deaths of people in custody was maintained by NCRB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-57-of-those-held-under-uapa-in-2018-20-below-30-years/articleshow/88286640.cms||Bharti Jain

This was after he inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Dham project at a grand ceremony during the day. "Inspecting key development works in Kashi. It is our endeavour to create the best possible infrastructure for this sacred city," he tweeted at 12.52am about his stroll with CM Yogi Adityanath. Before that, he had two rounds of meetings with 12 CMs and six deputy CMs from BJP-ruled states on a cruise following Ganga Aarti. The PM's nightly walk began on the Godowlia-Dashaswamedh road that has been turned into a walkway for pilgrims and tourists. From Godowlia, Modi reached Kashi Vishwanath Dham and inspected the work done there. His next stop was the renovated Banaras railway station around 1am and he tweeted later that "We are working to enhance rail connectivity as well as ensure clean, modern and passenger friendly railway stations". Modi and Yogi inspected the new modern facilities introduced for passengers at the station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-varanasi-pm-goes-for-midnight-inspection-of-development-work/articleshow/88286687.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

NCP partriarch Sharad Pawar, CPM chief Sitaram Yechury, DMK veteran TR Baalu, Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah besides Rahul Gandhi and Congress senior Mallikarjun Kharge held detailed discussions on issues ranging from suspension of MPs from Rajya Sabha to efforts required to boost the opposition unity. Sources said Rahul Gandhi appreciated the get-together and suggested that it should happen more often. The meeting discussed in detail ways to bring about state-wise unity among the parties to take on BJP. What stood out in the meeting, according to sources, were the comments of Pawar and Yechury, in the light of the push by Mamata to emerge as the fulcrum of the anti-BJP axis. It is learnt that Pawar clarified the remarks attributed to him after Mamata met him in Mumbai and declared “there is no UPA now” on December 1. The NCP leader’s comments on the need to invite all the parties to join in, were seen as endorsement of the ‘Mamata line’. As the TMC issue was discussed, many see it as a message to the Bengal leader. “We did not mean it that way,” a senior leader said. Sources said the opposition will now wait for the TMC chief’s reaction, and it was felt that a conversation with her is required. TMC was not invited for the meeting. The gathering would have packed more power, but for the inability of Uddhav Thackeray to join in as he is indisposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-message-to-didi-sonia-gandhis-opposition-meet-shuns-tmc/articleshow/88286907.cms||Swati Mathur

The bills were passed in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday through a voice vote, amid a walkout by opposition members over the suspension of 12 MPs. The Lok Sabha had cleared the bills on December 9. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge (Cong) asked RS deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh to revoke the suspension and allow the 12 suspended members to participate in the debate. When this was not allowed, most of the opposition members walked out. Moving the bills for consideration, Singh justified the amendments saying that they set out the limit of the tenure replacing the earlier provision that stated "a minimum of two years" but did not specify the upper limit for the tenure of the directors of CBI and ED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parliament-passes-bills-to-extend-tenure-of-cbi-ed-chiefs/articleshow/88286982.cms||---
---||India||Will take up 50% representation of women in judiciary with Collegium: CJI||NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Tuesday told women lawyers that he would take up with his colleagues in the present judge-selecting-judge Collegium system for 50% representation of women in the constitutional courts. The Supreme Court has four women judges among 33 and the women HC judges constitute a mere 11.5% at present. Speaking at a function for felicitation of Justice Hima Kohli by a lawyer organization 'Women in Law and Litigation' (WILL), Justice Ramana admitted that being the CJI is unavoidably stressful but he has to deal with it. ON the demand for 50% representation of women as Judges in constitutional courts, the CJI said he had taken note of it and promised "to take up your demand with my Brothers (four most senior SC Judges) in the collegium". He said to get women judges, more girls must take up law for graduation. "This is why I had recommended last time for some form of uniform policy of reservation for girls for entry into law colleges across the country," he said and asked - "Whether increase in the number of women graduating from law schools would translate to higher representation of women in the legal profession?" CJI narrated his personal experience a few days ago at the convocation function of National Law University Delhi, where the number of women graduates was comparable to the number of men. "In fact, most of the medal winners were women. Unfortunately, the majority of them are not willing to come into the profession. Litigation is not their priority. Their preference is for law firms, civil services etc," he said. Justice Ramana said, "Women constitute on an average only around 30% of the judges in our lower judiciary. Some states have a good number of women judges, whereas in other states the representation is abysmal. In the High Courts, the percentage of women judges is merely 11.5. In the Supreme Court we have four sitting women judges, out of 33 in office. The situation of women lawyers in the country is not any better. Out of 1.7 million advocates registered, only 15% are women." He said there are many hurdles for women in joining the litigation after graduating in law. Apart from societal pressures, the lack of judicial infrastructure too proves a barrier for them to go to court complexes. "Small courtrooms which are crowded and cramped, absence of rest rooms, childcare facilities, etc. are all barriers. Nearly 22% of Courts in the country did not have washroom facilities," he said. "All these issues cannot be solved in a day. Many will take years, and even generations. But it needs to be done. There can be no denying that the inclusion of women as judges and lawyers in the country will substantially improve the justice delivery system. Women can bring a different perspective to the law which will enrich the legal field," he said, while assuring the women lawyers that they would have his support if they raised their voice for improving working conditions in judiciary to help increase their representation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-ramana-bats-for-50-of-judges-posts-for-women/articleshow/88287037.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said the visit starting Wednesday will strongly reinforce the "very, very strong bonds of friendship and cooperation" between the two countries. "I would completely dispel any perception that there is any unease in the relationship," said Shringla. The relationship is an extraordinary one,” said Shringla. Shringla also confirmed that Bangladesh had been the largest recipient of Indian vaccines and that, so far, it had received 2.18 crore doses of India-made vaccines, of which 33 lakh had been gifted and 1.5 crore extended on commercial basis. The remaining 35 lakh were provided under the Covax terms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-unease-in-ties-india-before-presidents-bangladesh-trip/articleshow/88287059.cms||---
---||Business||Renewable power cos’ dues surge 47% to Rs 21k cr in 1 year||NEW DELHI: Overdues of renewable power producers have swelled 47% to Rs 21,008 crore in December from Rs 14,259 crore a year ago because of continued payment default by state distribution utilities, marking a trend that could punch a hole in India’s climate commitment, which primarily hinges on rapid expansion of green energy capacity. The renewable energy overdues make up 21% of pending bills from all generation companies, including thermal power producers in the private and public sector, which is pegged at Rs 98,682 crore against Rs 97,334 crore a year ago. Given the trend, officials said the figure will top Rs 1 lakh crore by month-end. Thermal generation companies account for Rs 75,066 crore of the total overdues. While overdues of private power producers rose 38% to Rs 54,394 crore from Rs 39,152 crore in December 2020, they declined 55% to Rs 20,672 crore from Rs 46,969 crore for government generators. The ballooning of unpaid bills underlines the fact that bailout packages and turnaround plans have not been able to bring about the desired change in the system as far as improving revenue of generation companies. Continued overdues of private power producers, especially thermal companies , facing increased redundancy risks due to rising renewable capacity, perpetuate the threat of loans souring for lenders, which could dampen future lending. Delayed payments sends projects into a vicious cycle by raising cost of operation, prompting borrowings that in turn raises interest costs that can ultimately lead promoters to default. The rising dues of renewable energy companies may inhibit capacity building at a time when India needs huge investments for meeting the target of 450 GW (gigawatts) renewable capacity by 2030, which is at the core of its climate action and Net-Zero goals. The conundrum of thermal producers is aptly summed up by an industry executive, who said: “Public sector thermal generators can afford to regulate supply, encash LCs (letters of credit) with banks or adjust outstandings from the state’s funds with the RBI. Independent power producers, especially the smaller players, which have their plants in the state they supply to, cannot afford such a move for fear of retaliation or harassment by that state government,” an industry executive said, requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/renewable-power-cos-dues-surge-47-to-rs-21k-cr-in-1-year/articleshow/88287095.cms||Sanjay Dutta

The company said the investment plan will be a key element in the company’s strategic objective of becoming the largest bulk liquid storage and energy infrastructure solutions provider in the UK. The storage hub will deliver 300,000 cubic metres of capacity to support customers in delivering the UK’s net-zero transition goals. The Stanlow Manufacturing Complex and Tranmere Terminal, located within the Liverpool port, will allow customers to store, blend and distribute bio-fuels suitable for use in the energy transition as drop-in replacement transport fuels for road, aviation and marine consumption. Stanlow Terminals is the largest independent bulk liquid storage business in the UK, with three million cubic metres capacity. It is located on the Mersey Estuary within the Liverpool port, which has eight jetties and deepwater facilities, offering flexible and efficient import and export of bulk liquids, the company said in a statement. Stanlow Terminals already provides biofuels storage capacity for customers through dedicated supply and delivery infrastructure. This new customer-led investment will support the growth initiatives such as sustainable aviation fuel linked to Fulcrum’s Northpoint project, sustainable hydrotreated vegetable oil and will include waste-based feedstock import facilities, blending and capacity expansion for existing bio-ethanol and bio-methanol. The market for energy from renewable sources in the UK is expanding rapidly, driven by legislative obligations to encourage lower carbon fuels. Additional storage investment opportunities for low-carbon energy products, such as e-fuels, bio-LPG, bio-methane, hydrogen and ammonia are all progressing through feasibility studies. Stanlow Terminals earlier joined forces with parent company Essar and Fulcrum BioEnergy to develop a storage facility at Stanlow for sustainable aviation fuel manufactured from non-recyclable household waste. The project will support the aviation industry’s continued reduction of carbon emissions and will support the UK’s drive towards becoming a net-zero economy. Stanlow Terminals is also supporting the UK’s hydrogen economy and the HyNet Northwest project by developing storage and distribution facilities that will be required to provide a multi-modal hydrogen and carbon dioxide transport hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/essars-stanlow-to-build-uks-largest-biofuels-hub/articleshow/88287096.cms||---

This is when all the 140 sewage treatment plants work at full capacity, when they don't, a lot more untreated sewage is dumped into the rivers. Data for urban areas from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that Karnataka, on average, generates 4,458 million litres of sewage every day and has an installed treatment capacity for 2,712 million litres, leaving around 40% of the waste generated to flow into rivers untreated. This means that at least 6.3-lakh million litres of untreated sewage flows into rivers annually. This is affecting water bodies across the state leaving tens of habitations struggling with highly polluted water. Nationally, 72,368 million litres per day is generated against which a treatment capacity of 31,841 million litre is available. Magsaysay awardee Rajendra Singh, known as India's Waterman had earlier told TOI that there is no "foreseeable solution to the problem", while experts, blaming industries for most of this pollution, argue that successive governments have been short-sighted in letting factories come up close to rivers. K’taka’s 17 river stretches are highly polluted, shows studyA senior scientist from the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) pointed out that Karnataka was not the only state where river beds are not protected. "...There are no proper inspections and due diligence before granting of permissions," he said. In line with observation, the data shows that not even one state/UT in the country has a treatment capacity that matches the generation, while seven of them — Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Lakshadweep, Manipur, Meghalaya and Nagaland — have zero installed capacity. Singh, who has been visiting rivers across India, had said that in most states there are not enough sewage treatment plants and in many states even those available are not operated efficiently. Separate data from CPCB shows that Karnataka has 17 river stretches — Arkavathi, Lakshmantirtha, Malprbha, Tungabhadra, Bhadra, Cauvery, Kabini, Kagina, Kali, Krishna, Shimsha, AsangiNalla, Bhima, Kumardhara, Netravathi, Tunga, Yagachi — that are highly polluted. Comparatively, in 2017, the state had 15 such stretches. Comparatively, there are 351 polluted river stretches across the country, with most states failing in abatement of pollution. In 2017, there were 302 such stretches. The Jal Shakti ministry says that so far as conservation and rejuvenation of rivers go, it has been supplementing efforts of the states by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through centrally sponsored schemes. Aside from this, sewerage infrastructure is created under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/ktaka-dumps-1746m-litres-sewage-into-rivers-each-day/articleshow/88288042.cms||Chethan Kumar

Online news chronicler TechCrunch was the first to report the development on Monday. Maheshwari had moved to the US as senior director in August to manage fast-growing emerging markets. Maheshwari is starting an edtech firm, the report said. Maheshwari’s Bengaluru home is registered as the new startup’s office location, according to filings with the local regulator, TechCrunch said. An email to Twitter on Maheshwari's exit did not elicit a response till the time of going to press. Maheshwari joined Twitter in 2019 as general manager for India in charge of driving growth and business. His move to the US came weeks after a standoff with the Centre on the new IT rules. Twitter has had to face multiple police cases in India. Maheshwari was issued multiple notices by the Ghaziabad police in relation to a communally sensitive video of an assault of an elderly man that surfaced on social media. The Karnataka high court subsequently exempted Maheshwari from a personal appearance in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/former-twitter-india-md-quits/articleshow/88287387.cms||---

That was a 34% increase in deal volumes compared with the same period last year, but the total value was nearly half of the year-ago figure.“The absence of big-ticket transactions, partly due to non-disclosure of deal values in the majority of M&A transactions (74% of deals) could be the reason for lower deal values. Deal activity continued to be primarily in the technology sector including startup and e-commerce sectors. Better health of the banking system and supportive policy measures saw active deal-making in the financial sector, whereas resumption of economic activities and demand recovery benefitted consumer and retail sectors,” said Shanthi Vijetha, partner in Grant Thornton Bharat.The value of M&A transactions in November stood at $436 million across 50 deals.

The order said if Chaudhri and Maniar have any open position in any exchange-traded derivative contracts as on the date of the order, they can close out/square off such open positions within three months from the date of order or at the expiry of such contracts, whichever is earlier. Chaudhri was part of Infosys’s Vanguard deal and had access to the unpublished price-sensitive information which was apparently passed on to Keyur, his former colleague in Wipro, thereby aiding Keyur to trade in the scrip of Infosys while being in possession of the information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-passes-order-in-infy-insider-trading-case/articleshow/88287390.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Family of Bengaluru man, who died of Covid-19 eight months ago, gets ‘fully jabbed’ message||BENGALURU: The wife of a 77-year-old man from South Bengaluru was in for a shock when she received a message congratulating the latter for being fully vaccinated against Covid-19, eight months after his death. A message from Co-Win stated that he got fully jabbed on December 9. Sreekantaiah Seetharaman had taken his first dose on March 10. He was due for the second dose in May, as the interdose interval was 4-6 weeks for Covishield at that time. In between, he contracted Covid and died on April 8. “This could be a bogus entry done in my father’s name which is highly questionable,” his son Vishwanath S told TOI. “This is nothing but the government’s ways to inflate the vaccination coverage. To a man who died due to Covid, the government has sent a message saying he’s fully vaccinated against the disease! If it was a data entry error, how did it match his name and the registered phone number?” the family members questioned. Incidentally, Seetharaman’s 75-year-old wife had taken the first dose on March 1 and the second dose in August. The couple had used the same phone number for their Co-Win registration. She was not given any certificate during her second dose vaccination at an apartment saying there were technical issues. She also received a message from Co-Win on December 8 that she had taken the second dose on the day. “There is definitely a goof-up. While we hadn’t bothered much about her vaccination certificate when she took it in August, she has now got a message saying she was fully vaccinated on December 8,” the family members said. As per the vaccination certificates, the couple got their doses at a centre falling under the Kumarswamy Layout urban primary health centre. “There is a code mentioned in the certificate, which we don’t know if it was the same as the vaccination centre in an apartment where they got jabbed,” a family member said. TOI has a copy of the vaccination certificate and the messages received by Seetharaman’s family. Dr Arundhathi Chandrasekhar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka, said the matter will be investigated. “We will look into this,” she added. She said a similar case of a dead person getting a message about being fully vaccinated was reported in Tumakuru recently and when checked, it was found out to be a data entry error. “The error had crept in while typing a phone number. We also checked the number of doses administered by the nurse and it matched with the number of persons vaccinated. There was an error in the data entry, where there was a wrong entry of two digits. It was an entry against a wrong person’s name,” she added. Dr Chandrasekhar said currently, healthcare workers are visiting houses for vaccination. “At home or near home vaccination drives are going on. The workers note down the names, contact details of the beneficiaries and enter the details on the Co-Win portal when they return to their offices,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/family-of-man-who-died-of-covid-19-eight-months-ago-gets-fully-jabbed-message/articleshow/88287392.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Out-of-state passengers use Carmelaram railway station to bypass RT-PCR norm||BENGALURU: The rise in Covid cases in Bommanahalli and Mahadevapura zones has been keeping the health officials on their toes. Of the eight BBMP zones, the positivity rate was high in in Mahadevapura (0.52%) and Bommanahalli (0.47% )last week. Investigation by the civic authorities showed lack of screening at Carmelaram railway station, off Sarjapura Road, where a lot of people coming from Kerala and Tamil Nadu get off and move on without being screened as the main reason. In fact, a few Covid positive persons with recent travel history had claimed the tiny station had helped them save time as they did not have to go through the process of showing RT-PCR negative certificates. BBMP health officials have identified the station as a ‘loophole’ in their screening network. As per the government rules, travellers entering from Maharashtra and Kerala must carry a negative certificate. To avoid this, some passengers from Tamil Nadu and Kerala get down at Carmelaram station and take local bus routes to enter the city. Karunakar R, a techie who returned from Kerala on December 13, was carrying a negative report but was not stopped or checked at Carmelaram station. “My friends had told me to carry a negative certificate before entering the city but on reaching Carmelaram, there was no checking,” he said. Karunakar reached Bengaluru on December 13 at 7.30am and a few constables and railway officials sitting around the corner did not bother to check the report. Krishan Pal, a frequent traveller between Kochi and Bengaluru, said there are numerous ways in which RT-PCR norm can be flouted. “I travel between the two states every alternate day, it becomes challenging to keep getting the certificate each time. So, I usually book tickets till Carmelaram. Then from there, I book a ticket to Yeshwantpur and nobody asks for the certificate for inter-city travel. BBMP marshals and cops are enforcing mask usage rule but are not checking RT-PCR report or even temperature,” Pal said. Senior BBMP officials said it has become a challenge to monitor these violators. “We never know who has travelled from Kerala or Tamil Nadu, until they show symptoms and come to our PHCs for treatment. Then, we do contact tracing,” said an official in Bommanahalli. This problem exists in KR Puram, Banaswadi and Bengaluru East stations too. “With increasing cases, the number of containment zones in Bommanahalli (29) and Mahadevapura (16) are also on the rise,” said a health official.  “We have set up testing units at railways stations but we are not in charge of testing RT-PCR certificates. It is the state government’s responsibility. We cannot use our manpower to check at all odd hours,” said a senior bureaucrat from the health department. Randeep D, commissioner, Health and Family Welfare Services, said the BBMP and Bengaluru Urban administration need to deploy additional teams. “While stepping up vigil at airports, we need to follow the same across other domestic travel points too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/out-of-state-passengers-use-carmelaram-railway-station-to-bypass-rt-pcr-norm/articleshow/88287395.cms||Nithya Mandyam

He said the complainant is a third party and an activist, who should have told the magistrate about the happenings in the case as they are widely published on every date of hearing.The court was also told that the Kallahalli had withdrawn his complaint on March 7, 2021 itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/court-quashes-proceedings-against-top-cop-two-officers/articleshow/88287396.cms||---

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi on the other hand argued that the amendment legislation is manifestly arbitrary in nature and going by the latest Supreme Court decisions, the same can be a ground for challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/online-gaming-hearing-on-dec-22/articleshow/88287397.cms||---

Ours is a “welfare state” and not the East India Company of the bygone era. The public functions of a welfare government should generate confidence in the mind of right-thinking members of the citizenry; what bewilders this court is the reiteration of the same stand with the duplication of the text of the order, despite a direction issued by a co-ordinate bench,” Justice Krishna S Dixit observed in his order while allowing the petition filed by the Codava National Council.A compliance report has to be submitted to the Registrar General within three months, failing which heavy costs become awardable in the next level of legal battle, the judge further observed in his order while quashing both notifications that were under challenge.In 2010, the commission had advised for inclusion of Kodava and Kodavaru in 3A category. However, on October 14, 2015 and on September 30, 2021, in identical orders, the government had rejected the advice on the ground that the competent authority had not approved it. By virtue of this rejection, certain benefits of reservation which otherwise would have been available to the community, have been denied, the petitioner contended.The government argued that although the commission is a statutory body, its recommendations are not binding on the government and the very essence of “recommendation” or “advice” involves ‘discretion to disagree’ with it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-told-to-act-on-bc-panels-advice/articleshow/88287398.cms||---
---||Chennai||A few roads taken off repair list in Chennai||CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation plans to remove a few roads from its list of 1,010 roads for which tenders were called as some of these roads were laid only in the last three years, officials said. The civic body recently floated 118 tenders at 147 crore to relay 1,010 roads that were damaged due to the floods. The decision to remove roads from the list follows concerns from city-based NGO Arappor Iyakkam over the tenders. The NGO said stretches such as Nelson Manickam Road that have been included in the tenders were laid in 2019. All roads selected should be assessed, the NGO said. The corporation also plans to reduce work experience from 40% to 30% for contractors. For all tenders, the corporation sought 40% of work experience on a single project over the past five years, the NGO said. For instance, a project of 1 crore sought experience of 40 lakh in a single tender. “This may be expanded to at least 12 years so that experience over five years prior to the former government’s period is also counted,” said Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of the NGO. He added that there was no provision of penalty for poor road work, adding that a three-year defect liability period alone would not help. The condition to specifically use the 9m sensor paver could be removed. “We have seen in many stretches that these pavers were not used at all in the past. This meant that it was just a condition added to ensure specific contractors were awarded the tenders,” he said. Another concern was that of the road height. “The corporation needs to ensure that the road height doesn’t rise when these new roads are laid. In some areas, as per the tender conditions, the road height is bound to increase by 45mm despite milling. That needs to be checked,” the NGO said. A civic body official said they had taken note of these concerns and would issue a corrigendum. “We cannot eliminate the 9m sensor paver condition as they have to be used to improve the road quality. However, we will ensure that they are implemented. We will remove a few roads and do patch work there. Also, we will reduce work experience from 40% to 30%,” the official said. The official added that they would ensure that the roads that are laid would be of good quality and work would be monitored at every stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/a-few-roads-taken-off-repair-list/articleshow/88287399.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Chennai||Chennai: Stagnant sewage on NTR Street drains raises a stink||Chennai: The street which once housed N T Rama Rao during his short stay in Chennai now stinks with sewage in its storm water drains stagnant for more than a month. What’s worse is the sewage is now seeping into the sump of apartments on this Kodambakkam street, named after the former actor and Andhra Pradesh chief minister. Residents complained that the sewage ended up in the drains during the recent showers and has remained as such till present. Officials are yet to identify whether a block is preventing flow of water or if it is due to gradients. The prolonged exposure to sewage has also caused a tiny crack leading to seepage into the sump. This forced residents to purchase a 5,000 litre tank costing 40,000 including labor charges. “The sewage has remained stagnant since November 7 and the prolonged seepage has caused a minor crack in the adjoining sumps resulting in sewage intrusion. We have raised multiple complaints with the corporation but officials are yet to take action,” said S V Radhakrishnan, treasurer of Sakthi apartments. The seepage has also affected the borewell line and contaminated groundwater. “We are spending 500 a day to buy Metrowater. This is also not sufficient for the sixteen families. We can plug the seepage in our sump only if the corporation pumps out the sewage,” said Radhakrishnan. “The drains were laid haphazardly about 15 years back. Even a short hour-long spell causes water stagnation, but this time it has remained for almost 40 days,” said M Sathyamoorthy, secretary of Sakthi Flats Residents Association. Corporation officials said the stagnation was due to silt formation at various spots on the drain, but they had no answer when asked how sewage got mixed in. “We have a proposal to connect the drain from NTR Street, that goes through Rangarajapuram to Trust Puram Canal,” said an assistant engineer with division 134. Because of increased water levels nearby, sewage may have mixed in the drains, the assistant engineer said. “We will also identify the drain link spot and block it. In two days’ time, the stagnation will be cleared,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stagnant-sewage-on-ntr-street-drains-raises-a-stink/articleshow/88287401.cms||Omjasvin M D

The woman survived with injuries, but she delivered a still-born boy in the impact. She told police she decided to end her life as her boyfriend refused to marry her. The woman is now admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. She stays with her parents on Palayakaran Street in Kodambakkam and her father works in the film industry. On Monday, her parents suddenly questioned her weight gain. The woman blamed it on overeating while staying home over the pandemic and attending only online classes. Growing worried, she spoke to her boyfriend, a classmate and resident of Chengalpet, and reportedly suggested that they get married, an officer said. However, he gave evasive responses and the worried student decided to end her life. She jumped from the terrace around 8pm and sustained severe injuries to the stomach. She delivered a still-born child due to the shock. She also sustained multiple fractures to the hands, legs and head. The woman was taken to the maternity hospital in Egmore and later shifted to the RGGGH for treatment. The Kodambakkam police registered a case. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the woman befriended the man while in college and the two were in a relationship. Further probe is underway.(Assistance for those battling suicidal thoughts or depression is available on the state’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pregnant-student-injured-in-suicide-attempt-baby-dead/articleshow/88287402.cms||---

The 44-year-old, who works at a government school in Chengalpet, has moved beyond blackboards and books to teach children via song and dance. This not only keeps her students engaged but also ensures they never forget their lessons. Take a peek into one of her classrooms and you can find the sprightly Kavitha, who has been in service for 25 years and teaches students in Classes I to V, swaying to the beat as she sings Tamil Mei Ezhuthukkal (Tamil alphabet) to her students at Mamandur panchayat union school. She adopted this novel approach after parents raised concerns to her of their children forgetting the basics during the pandemic and their attention span shrinking. “Parents were worried that despite joining school, the children won’t be able to learn anything. So I decided to cheer them up through dance,” Kavitha says. While the country was in lockdown, Kavitha would go around the village looking for her students trying to ensure they remembered what they had learned so far. The dancing, however, is relatively new. In a viral video, Kavitha shakes a leg, borrowing steps from popular classical and cinema song, much to her students’ joy. “Students who usually take at least a week to memorize the alphabet, now learn it easily in a day easily through my moves,” laughs said Kavitha. “They don’t forget the dance nor the alphabet.” Kavitha even shoots her videos in different places to amp up the visuals.While taking lessons on rivers, lakes and forts, she enacted a drama along with the children to boost their understanding. This, she says, would make learning easier for them. “I always ensure that they carry some message back home and later spread to the society,” says Kavitha as she turns away to take yet another call from a parent appreciating her idea and efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/making-a-song-and-dance-of-it-govt-teacher-shows-way/articleshow/88287403.cms||Sindhu Kannan

Citing loss of precious academic time during the pandemic and the future of school-going children, the state government on Monday announced that schools will be allowed to resume normal physical classes for Classes VI to XII from January 3. “I welcome the announcement as it would improve learning standards. Teachers will have ample time to revise lessons taught online. Students have become lethargic while attending classes on alternate days,” said V Shanthi, headmistress of Vidyodaya Girls Higher Secondary School in T Nagar. Maintaining social distancing, however, will be difficult while conducting classes with full strength, teachers said. "Resuming classes in normal mode will help children to return to the regular routine of school life," said GJ Manohar, principal of MCC Higher Secondary School in Chetpet. "The academic routine of the children has changed due to the shift system. Unless we bring back the routine of coming regularly to school for students, the next academic year will be a struggle for us," he added. CBSE schools have also welcomed the move to allow schools to function in normal mode. "When school starts functioning in normal mode, children will start aligning themselves fully. It will also help to prepare ourselves for the next academic year properly by addressing learning gaps," said R Srinivasa Raghavan, principal of Bala Vidyamandir Senior Secondary School in Adyar. Government schools also welcomed the announcement. However, a teacher from a private matriculation school, said, a section of parents may not be comfortable to send their unvaccinated children if social distancing not maintained inside the schools. P Patric Raymond, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation asked the government to review the Covid-19 situation in December before allowing normal classes from January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/normal-classes-will-further-academic-continuity-schools/articleshow/88287406.cms||A Ragu Raman

DVAC searches found he had amassed wealth 370% more than his known sources of income. Mohammed Nazeer joined the police department in 1987 as a sub-inspector. According to the prosecution, the DVAC (Directorate of Vigilance and anti-corruption) received a complaint about Nazeer possessing disproportionate assets while he was an inspector with the Prohibition and enforcement wing in Tiruvallur district in 2009. DVAC verified his assets from 1999 to 2006 and found that he and his wife had amassed wealth to the extent of Rs 22 lakh but could not account for it satisfactorily. During the check period, Nazeer’s income was only about Rs 6 lakh, the prosecution submitted.His wife was a homemaker with no income and she abetted Nazeer in amassing the wealth by agreeing to register properties in her name, the prosecution stated. The prosecution submitted the final report before the court in 2012.In response, the inspector denied the charges and his counsel submitted that Nazeer and his wife were not in good terms and had been living separately. The property registered in her name was from the money given by her family members. After perusing documents submitted by both sides, the court noted that Nazeer could not submit anything to substantiate his contention that he separated from his wife within one year of marriage and noted that during cross-examination, his wife had said that had been living for 16 years as a couple. Based on the evidence, the former inspector was sentenced to three years imprisonment and his wife to one year imprisonment. The properties acquired are to be confiscated by the state, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/spl-court-sentences-inspector-to-three-year-ri-for-graft/articleshow/88287415.cms||---

The project has been carried out by the city corporation under Singara 2.0 through corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding at 1.75 lakh.  The clock in the tower had not been ticking since 2016. “When former chief minister J Jayalalithaa came here to file her nomination at RK Nagar constituency in 2016, it was repaired. But it again stopped,” said a zone-level Greater Chennai Corporation official.From a washed-out blue, the walls are now in bright yellow and sea blue. They also sport paintings of children helping a blind man walk, a woman carrying fruits, and a schoolgirl sitting with her mother, with popular Tamil sayings on women empowerment, education, tree-planting, and helping the elderly.While corporation officials say the clock was built between 1945 and 1947, some nonagenarians in the locality say it was built in the early 1940s. Historian Nivedita Louis, author of ‘Vada Chennai - Vazhalarum Vazhviyalum’ which tracks the history of North Chennai, told TOI there is little written about this specific tower. “For now, we just have information of what the local people there say,” she said. Called ‘Mani Gundu’ in the locality where the bus stand too is similarly named, the tower with its hourly reminders is a landmark in predominantly working-class neighbourhood. On the premises of the tower is a statue of former communist leader P Jeevanandam (1907-1963). In 2009, the premises were expanded and converted into a park by then deputy chief minister M K Stalin as the placard reads. The then DMK government named it ‘Jeeva Park’ in honour of the late communist leader. Louis said the civic body must make the park and tower more interactive by holding small events or gatherings that engage children and students. “Only through such activities will people feel connected with the historical structures and they can be preserved,” she said. Other famous clock towers in the city include those at Royapettah, Mint, which was recently painted by the corporation, Doveton, and||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/british-era-clock-in-tondiarpet-ticks-again/articleshow/88287416.cms||Omjasvin M D
---||Chennai||HC upholds Vanathi’s election; challenge ‘vague’, says court||Chennai: The election of BJP leader Vanathi Srinivasan from Coimbatore (South) assembly constituency in the recent assembly elections was upheld by the Madras high court on Tuesday.Justice V Bharathidasan, dismissing an election petition filed by K Rahul Gandhi of Hindustan Janata Party, observed that the plea had been filed on vague grounds. Vanathi was declared elected from the constituency with a thin margin of 1,728 votes.According to the petitioner, he contested the election from Coimbatore (south) constituency along with 21 other candidates, including Makkal Needhi Maiyam founder and actor Kamal Haasan.Though BJP’s candidate Vanathi Srinivasan, who secured 53,209 votes, was declared elected by the election commission, the petitioner alleged that the victory was doubtful since a majority of voters of the constituency were against the BJP. The fact was evident during my campaign, he claimed.“To my utmost shock and surprise, I was declared to have secured 73 votes in 26 rounds of counting and a few other Independent candidates were also declared to have secured very few votes. Since we were the local persons from the constituency, we would have got at least 1,000 votes each from our relatives, friends and well-wishers,” the petitioner said.“When we made inquiries, it transpired that gross irregularities have taken place in the counting process, particularly in the fag-end. We suspect that EVMs were hacked and our votes were counted as votes polled for BJP,” he alleged.In view of the situation, the petitioner made a representation to the district collector, who was the district returning officer, on May 3 highlighting the ‘irregularities and fraud’ committed during counting of votes.Since no action was taken on his representation, he has approached the high court seeking direction to the ECI to order recounting of votes polled in the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-upholds-vanathis-election-challenge-vague-says-court/articleshow/88287417.cms||---

But it is not without the necessary protocols -- 55% of the students expect protocols to prevent Covid-19 transmission once they are back on campus, while 45% expect a hybrid learning model. The survey was conducted by CollPoll, a mobile-first digital campus platform, across 23 campuses in 10 cities, with more than 1,300 students participating from all over the country. It was part of the ‘Back to Safe Campus’ initiative by CollPoll. The number of students wanting to return to campus in Bengaluru is higher than that in Jaipur (77%), Delhi NCR (70%) and even the national average (75%). However, students in Pune are showing the most eagerness to go back to campus (79%). Across the country, 49% of students said they miss in-person interaction with peers and lecturers. The survey also found that 45% of students prefer physical classrooms to online classes (56% in Bengaluru), as compared to 30% who want to continue attending classes online as they find it very effective. A quarter of the survey participants consider availability and support of professors the most crucial factor in the online learning experience. Around 5% have experienced a significant increase in their stress levels and severe deterioration in their emotions of anger, anxiety, loneliness, hopelessness, and happiness. Almost half the respondents expect strong protocols to prevent transmission once they return to campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/78-students-want-to-return-to-college/articleshow/88287394.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Colleges ask SC/ST engineering aspirants to pay full fees||BENGALURU: Raghu (name changed) is the son of a single woman, a daily wage worker in a printing press. When he cracked the Common Entrance Test and bagged a computer science engineering seat in a Bengaluru college in the second round of counselling under the SC reservation quota with annual income less than Rs 2.5 lakh, his family that includes two older sisters were full of hope. Raghu paid Rs 500 at the Karnataka Examination Authority and was told the rest of his fees would be taken care of by a government scholarship. But when he reported at the college, the authorities asked him to pay Rs 1.02 lakh. He was told he had to pay first and the government would reimburse it.“I’m just not able to pay that fee. The college says it will be reimbursed by the government in one years but we will be caught up in debt by then,” said Raghu. He was later told by KEA that he needs a freeship card from the social welfare department, which he doesn’t have. Despite repeated orders from the government, many colleges in the city continue to ask SC/ST students to pay fees. Many students who avail this scholarship are from rural areas and are unable to cough up the lump sum. “When my ward went to college, he was asked to pay Rs 1.02 lakh. When I followed up with the college, they said they haven’t got any such instruction. The college asked us to pay the fees first and the scholarship amount would be reimbursed directly to the account. My ward says he can manage a small amount like Rs 20,000. He’ll have to let go of the seat if he has to pay this huge amount,” said Bharath Anjanappa, local guardian for another candidate in Bengaluru. “These students also need a freeship card for this but many are not aware of it. By the time, they get the card, the last date for payment will be over. Many schemes for the benefit of such students dont reach them,” he added. “When I took admission, I paid Rs 43,000. I was told the government would reimburse it directly to my account,” said another student. “While the government told us not to collect any fees from general candidates, there is no clear instruction about SC/ST candidates. For the past two years, the process has been that students pay the fees and submit the receipt on the scholarship portal. The government directly reimburses that amount to the students’ accounts. There is no intimation of change in this process,” said the principal of a college where these students have applied. KEA, however, disagrees. “We have put up the circular on our website. Colleges cannot collect fees from SC/ST candidates now. They have to wait for the scholarship money to reach students. After that, they can collect it from them,” said S Ramya, executive director, KEA. “If students are facing issues, they can give us a written complaint,” she added. Other CET students said some colleges are charging over and above the skill fees they are supposed to pay. It is the first time that CET students have to pay fees at KEA instead of the college. The government has also capped skill lab fees that a college can charge students, which is payable at the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/colleges-ask-sc/st-engg-aspirants-to-pay-full-fees/articleshow/88287385.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

---||Bengaluru||BMTC to reintroduce QR-code ticketing in AC buses; new app by March||BENGALURU: To ensure cashless travel, BMTC has decided to reintroduce QR-code ticketing in all AC buses, including Vajra and Vayu Vajra. It will provide Paytm soundboxes (speakers) to conductors, which will give out an audio alert once the passenger makes payment. “We are planning to buy 500 speakers, mainly for AC buses. At present, 190 AC buses are plying in the city and this number is likely to be increased to 400 by March. Conductors will keep these speakers inside their bags,” said AV Surya Sen, BMTC director (information technology). In May 2020, BMTC had introduced UPI QR code-based travel facility in all buses. But this was discontinued after many conductors refused to accept cashless payment, complaining that the amount was not being credited. TOI carried an article on this on October 14. According to officials, Canara Bank has already provided laminated cards with QR code and they have been distributed to all conductors. Passengers can scan the code with their mobile phones to pay for the ticket using the likes of Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm. Each bus conductor will have a different QR code. Asked about non-AC buses, an official said: “Cashless facility is available in all buses, but we don’t have any plans to purchase speakers for non-AC ones. We have to pay Rs 49 a month per bus to the firm. This is a stop-gap arrangement.” BMTC to accept NCMC from MayWith Namma Metro, along with RBL Bank, all set to launch the national common mobility card (NCMC), commuters can use it aboard BMTC buses from May 2022. BMTC has decided to invite a tender for the implementation of the automated fare collection system by next week. “The selected firm will provide 12,000 Android-based electronic ticketing machines that could accept UPI QR-code, NCMC, closed-loop cards,” said an official. BMTC app by MarchBMTC officials said passengers will be able to track buses through a new app from March next year. Vehicle tracking units (VTUs) have been installed in 70 buses so far and the remaining are expected to be installed in another two months. A consortium of Manipal Group and Amnex Infotechnologies, at a cost of Rs 37.3 crore, is implementing the Intelligent Transportation System under the Nirbhaya project. The project includes fitting two cameras each in 5,000 buses, 5,000 VTUs, 500 passenger information system display boards, and a new app with women’s safety features. Adding to the fleetThe city transport utility plans to induct 565 environment-friendly BSVI Ashok Leyland buses by February 2022. “We have received 110 BSVI buses so far. This is the first time we are inducting BSVI buses to the fleet,” said an official. Under Smart City funds, BMTC is planning to induct 90 (9m) electric buses. “We will get 45 buses by the month-end and they will be operated mainly from Kengeri depot. Another 45 will be inducted by February 2022,” said an official. BMTC has also decided to scrap 800 buses that have crossed their lifespan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmtc-to-reintroduce-qr-code-ticketing-in-ac-buses-new-app-by-march/articleshow/88287384.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

It is home to one of the oldest pipe organs in the city (made in England in 1895). And its bell is supposed to be the second oldest in the city after the ones in St Mary’s Church.On Tuesday, the CSI Zion Church, Chintadripet, began its 175th-year celebrations, which, says Rev G Lawrence Jebadoss, the Presbyter in Charge, will continue till December 14, 2022. The church was built in 1847 by Reverend Myron Winslow and John Scudder, of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the first Christian missionary organisation from the US. In 1888, it was christened as Zion Church.In 1865, the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Mission presented Zion church to the Church Missionary Society for a sum of 10,000. The church finds mention in a book titled ‘Life in India: Or, Madras, the Neilgherries, and Calcutta’, written by John Welsh Dulles, and published in 1855. In a chapter on the Mission Church, Dulles, deputed as a minister in the Church, mentions how there was a preaching bungalow stationed right next door, “to attract persons passing along on the street who will not enter a church”. “The Sabbath was not a day of rest,” writes Dulles, who was the son-in-law of Winslow. “While the missionary is preaching, the creaking of the castor oil mill across the street is constantly in his ears.”“The church now has a 500-family strong congregation,” says Rev Jebadoss. The thanksgiving service on Tuesday was officiated by the Rt Rev George Stephen Jayaraj, Bishop of the Madras Diocese of the Church of South India (CSI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chintadripets-zion-church-begins-175th-year-celebrations/articleshow/88287478.cms||---

V C Ravichandran of Madurai in his complaint stated that he is a social worker and frequently raised voice against police atrocity. On December 16, 2014, he was allegedly assaulted by a person on the instigation of a local councillor to not send complaints against police and politicians. When he tried to file a complaint, the Teppakulam police did not accept the complaint after which he sent the complaint to senior officials by post. Later in the day, a team of police personnel visited his house and assaulted Ravichandran, according to his petition to the commission and he was taken to the police station, where the inspector and two of his subordinates assaulted him and threatened that false cases will be foisted on him if he continues sending complaints against police and politicians. The police personnel, in response, denied the allegations and maintained that a friend of the complainant had assaulted a person and both of them were enquired about the same. The commission after perusing all submissions held that there was human rights violation by the police personnel and directed monetary compensation of 1.5 lakh be paid to the complainant and his friend and also recommended disciplinary action against the cops concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/police-excess-pay-1-5-lakh-relief-to-2-shrc-directs-govt/articleshow/88287480.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu make quarters despite loss to Baroda||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu lost their last Vijay Hazare Trophy group league match to Baroda by 41 runs on Tuesday in Thiruvananthapuram. Yet, they qualified for the quarterfinals due to a superior Net Run Rate. Tamil Nadu (NRR 1.052) --- along with Karnataka (0.789), Bengal (-0.235) and Pondicherry (-1.360) --- finished on 12 points each but the Vijay Shankar-led side topped Elite Group B because of the big wins they had notched up earlier. Tamil Nadu will play their quarterfinal in Jaipur on December 21. On Tuesday though, in a low-scoring encounter on an extremely difficult pitch to bat on, Baroda were bowled out for 114 in 39 overs. But Tamil Nadu, in reply, fared far worse as they folded up for 73 in 20.2 overs. Tamil Nadu’s slow-ball bowlers --- M Siddharth (2-25), Washington Sundar (2-15) and Sanjay Yadav (2-13) --- were spot on with their lengths. Barring No. 3 Krunal Pandya (38, 3x4), the rest of the batting line-up failed to apply themselves as Baroda finished with a modest total on board. Tamil Nadu’s slide began when Krunal struck twice in his first over --- the sixth of the chase --- getting rid of N Jagadeesan (11) and B Indrajith (0). From being 24 for 3, Tamil Nadu slipped to 34 for 6 by the 12th over. A 21-run stand for the 7th wicket --- the highest of Tamil Nadu’s innings --- between M Shahrukh Khan (9) and Sanjay Yadav (19) revived the side’s hopes. However, once Shahrukh was trapped leg-before by left-arm spinner Bharghav Bhatt (3-27) in the 16th over --- Tamil Nadu’s fate in the match was more or less sealed. After registering comprehensive wins in their first three league matches against Mumbai, Karnataka and Bengal respectively, Tamil Nadu hit a rough patch by going down to Pondicherry and Baroda. The reversals in the last two games notwithstanding, Tamil Nadu coach M Venkataramana didn’t want to be too harsh on his boys. “It wasn’t the easiest of wickets to score runs but we could have restricted Baroda to less than 100. I am sure we will come back stronger (from the losses),” he said. Brief scores: Baroda 114 in 39 overs (Krunal Pandya 38; M Siddharth 2-25, Sandeep Warrier 2-20, Washington Sundar 2-15, Sanjay Yadav 2-13). Tamil Nadu 73 in 20.2 overs (Sanjay Yadav 19; Bhargav Bhatt 3-27).

Inaugurating a workshop on ‘Financial management in universities’, organised by the department of higher education at Secretariat conference hall here, the minister took a serious view of the universities not following the directives of the state government and working in an “arbitrary manner”. The universities were not furnishing the detailed information sought by the government from time to time. Referring to the recent development of a “cloudy atmosphere” in the field of state’s higher education, he said the vice-chancellors would have to maintain complete transparency in the functioning of universities. “The government has been spending Rs 4,000 crore annually on higher education and it would not tolerate misuse of this huge amount of public money. The universities must act in a manner that none could raise a finger on their working,” he said. The minister also expressed his concern at the ever-growing complaints of girl students received at CM’s Janata Darbar regarding non-payment of their incentive money under CM’s ‘Kanya Utthan Yojana’. He said the universities must dispose of all the pending cases of authentication of girl students’ claims without further delay so that the money could be paid to the beneficiaries. Chaudhary asked the VCs not to create unnecessary bottlenecks in opening of new colleges and granting affiliation to the newly established colleges. “If need be, the old, rigid rules may be made flexible so that more institutions of higher education could function in the state and the state’s gross enrolment ratio (GER) is enhanced from the existing 14.5% to 30%,” he said. The minister added he would convene a meeting of the VCs of all the universities in the state in the third week of January where they would be asked to present the compliance report of the various directives sent by the government. Education department’s additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said the workshop has been convened to apprise the university authorities of the sound financial management. “After attending this workshop, they would be in a position to ensure better financial management in their universities,” he said. Education secretary Asangba Chuba Ao, higher education director Rekha Kumari, State Higher Education Council vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha and representatives of the office of the accountant general attended the meeting. The VCs of different universities were connected through videoconference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-education-minister-asks-vcs-to-ensure-financial-discipline-in-varsities/articleshow/88284157.cms||B K Mishra

He said the government was not in a position increase wages and was looking for a way to resolve the issue of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Employees are insisting the government fulfill the pre-poll promise of removing CPS and bringing in the old pension scheme. With the report of the committee of secretaries on Pay Revision Commission (PRC) creating ripples among employees associations, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy held discussions with leaders of key associations on Tuesday. “There is nothing wrong in putting up your demands. You are part of the government but fine tune your demands taking the government’s hardships into consideration,” Sajjala told employees. He said the chief minister had never treated employees as separate from the government. However, the associations rejected the secretaries’ committee recommendations and demanded the government to be sympathetic towards their grievances. “We have made it clear that the recommendations of the secretaries committee are not acceptable. Advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy has promised to take all the issues raised to the notice of the chief minister,” said Secretariat Employees’ Association president K Venkatrami Reddy. He said they were hopeful of finding an amicable solution to the issues in the presence of the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tone-down-demands-sajjala-urges-assns/articleshow/88284473.cms||Samdani MN

---||Visakhapatnam||Bitter truth behind Anakapalle jaggery||Visakhapatnam: Anakapalle in Visakhapatnam district, the biggest producer of jaggery in the state, has been witnessing the rampant use of chemicals in jaggery production. Experts say white or light brown jaggery might be adulterated using chemicals and artificial colours. These include calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate. Calcium carbonate is added while processing jaggery to increase its weight, while sodium bicarbonate helps give a polished look. Speaking to TOI, principal scientist and university head (PFE) AICRP on PHET Centres at RARS, Anakapalle, PVK Jagannadha Rao said a majority of the units in Anakapalle are using chemicals such as sodium hydrosulphite (hydrose) and synthetic colours for light yellow and white jaggery, which has a high price in market yards for its polished look. Though jaggery is classified into grades based on the content of molasses, traders and consumers grade jaggery based on its colour . For example, the Bureau of Indian Standards specifies that sulphur dioxide levels in jaggery should be below 50 parts per million. This level, however, is higher in the region due to the indiscriminate use of hydrose. The use of hydrose in making jaggery weakens bone strength and the shelf life of jaggery, Jagannadha Rao added. “We have been creating awareness about natural clarifiants, but the use of chemicals continues,” he said. Traders at the Anakapalle jaggery market said consumers prefer jaggery that is white in colour and claim that the darker varieties contain impurities. Secretary of Anakapalle Jaggery Market Yard, B Ravi Kumar, said the market yard receives thousands of jaggery lumps a day from various parts of Anakapalle. However, there is no equipment in the yard to test the quality. Though Anakapalle jaggery is considered the best for its unique taste and aroma, there is a need to improve the quality. “We are chalking out plans to install some equipment in the yard to determine quality,” he added. “White jaggery sells like hot cakes within minutes of its arrival in the market yard while traditional jaggery, whose colour ranges from dark grey to golden yellow, is kept on hold, hence most makers use chemicals,” said V Demudu Babu, a jaggery maker in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/bitter-truth-behind-anakapalle-jaggery/articleshow/88284454.cms||Nalla.Babu

Once the statement was recorded under 164 CrPC there is no need to record his statement again by the court after he turned approver. As the court is about to record his statement again, they sought directions from the high court to prevent Kadapa court from doing so.

As things stand today, the commission has been able to appoint 28 assistant professors ever since it started interviewing the shortlisted applicants five months ago. In all probability, it will take at least one more year to complete all the appointments. The newly constituted commission had advertised as many as 4,638 vacant posts of assistant professors in altogether 52 subjects in September last year, with December 31 as the last date for submission of hard copies of applications. It took more than six months in screening the applications and matching the online copies of applications with their respective hard copies submitted by the applicants. According to a BSUSC member, the interview started on July 16 in which very few candidates had applied. As of now, notifications for the final selection of candidates have been made in as many as 10 subjects, including Angika, Puran, Bhojpuri, Russian, Arabic, Karmkand, Prakrit and Dharmashastra. Moreover, interviews for the appointment against 17 posts of assistant professors in statistics have already been held on December 2 and the shortlisted applicants for two posts in Gandhian Thought are likely to be interviewed on December 15. The list of 96 eligible applicants shortlisted for the interview in statistics has also been displayed on the commission’s website. BSUSC chairman Rajvardhan Azad told this newspaper that the interview process got delayed for several months due to Covid-19 pandemic. “The commission is also facing difficulties due to the shortage of staff,” Azad said and assured that the appointments would be made in the shortest possible time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/delay-likely-in-assistant-professors-appointment-in-bihar/articleshow/88285281.cms||B K Mishra

Named ‘Nyayasthanam to Devasthanam’, the ‘padayatra’ started on November 1 at Thullur and ended at the temple of Lord Venkateswara. The 400-km-long journey passed through Guntur, Prakasam, Nellore and Chittoor districts. On reaching the Garuda statue at Alipiri at the foot of the Tirumala hills, members turned emotional and chanted ‘Govinda Govinda’. Many of them prostrated and some knelt down on the ground as a mark of reverence. Some also broke coconuts at the spot, marking the end of the 44 days.

A lunch motion petition was moved on Tuesday requesting for hearing the matter on an urgent basis. The high court said it would hear the petition on Wednesday. The capital region farmers, who have been protesting against the state government’s three capitals proposal, had launched a ‘padayatra’ to Tirupati. The long march by the farmers is about to come to its conclusion as they reach Tirupati. On the occasion of the ‘padayatra’s’ successful completion, the farmers want to conduct a public meeting at Tirupati after visiting the Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala. The farmers had applied for permission to conduct a public meeting on December 17 but it was rejected by Tirupati Urban police on multiple occasions. Citing the high court judgement and Covid-19 guidelines, police said the high court had permitted the ‘padayatra’ but not given permission for public meetings. Permitting a public meeting would be in violation of the court’s orders, cops said. Challenging the decision of the police, farmers moved the high court seeking directions to permit a public meeting. Another petition has been filed by those who are in support of the three capitals’ proposal to hold a public meeting on the same day at Tirupati. The high court has said it will hear both matters together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-to-hear-ryots-plea-on-public-meet-today/articleshow/88284678.cms||---

The bank’s deputy MD Rajiv Anand said on Tuesday that there talks were on between some banks and the RBI to extend the due date. “We are not seeing the need to do that at this point of time,” Anand said. He also said that the bank was not in talks to acquire Spandana Spoorthy. The NBFC’s founder and ousted CEO Padmaja Reddy had alleged that Spandana Spoorthy’s key investor Kedaara Capital had plans to sell the company to Axis Bank. Anand said the bank was seeing growth come back across segments of the economy. “We are well-positioned in terms of the balance sheet, people, process and technology to capture growth opportunities,” he said. On asset quality, Anand said that over 90% of the bank’s portfolio is A- and better. “We are not seeing any meaningful slippage in the corporate sector or commercial banking and are extremely comfortable,” Anand said. He added that while the bank was targeting corporate customers by offering a stack of services across the Axis businesses, it was using technology to grow its SME business by getting more data and information about clients and improving timelines from weeks to hours for some services. Anand said the bank was seeing fairly strong capacity expansion in renewables, manufacturing under the production-linked incentive scheme, roads, ports, speciality chemicals and data centres. He said that there was capacity expansion in core sectors as well. However, they were not grabbing headlines as many are doing so using their internal accruals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dont-see-need-to-extend-deadline-for-covid-hit-cos-axis-bank/articleshow/88285644.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Lucknow||VHP celebrates ‘Gita Jayanti’ to mark Babri mosque demolition||Lucknow: A day after PM Narendra Modi inaugurated Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor in Varanasi, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), the religious arm of RSS, on Tuesday, heightened the Hindutva pitch by celebrating ‘Gita Jayanti’ to mark Babri demolition on December 6, 1992. The right-wing organization asked Bajrang Dal cadre to observe the day as ‘Shaurya Diwas’ as a mark of respect to kar sevaks, who razed the mosque 29 years ago. VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal said, when Babri mosque was brought down on December 6, 1992, the day happened to be Gita Jayanti. “It falls on different dates as per Hindu calendar and therefore we chose to observe ‘Shaurya Diwas’ on Gita Jayanti (Tuesday),” he said. Earlier, VHP had been observing ‘Shaurya Diwas’ on December 6. VHP, at the same time, chose the occasion to roll out a week-long campaign to reach out to people, who donated funds for the Ram temple in Ayodhya under ‘Nidhi Samarpan Abhiyan’. “Cadres have been asked to get them associated with VHP and its campaigns,” Bansal told TOI. The move assumes significance amid BJP’s aggressive public outreach to cement its foothold among the voting class in poll-bound states, including politically crucial UP. Sources said, Bajrang Dal activists have been asked to sport their traditional attire to mark a strong presence. The campaign attains pertinence in case of UP, where the clamour around the Ram Temple is expected to get shriller in the run-up to assembly elections early next year. CMs of 12 BJP ruled states, who attended the Kashi Vishwanath Dham inauguration on Monday, are scheduled to visit Ramjanmabhoomi on Wednesday. Political observers said, the right-wing organizations like VHP may seek to keep Hindu religious sentiments simmering while throwing its weight behind BJP, which seeks a second consecutive term in UP. “BJP is expected to bank on fulfilment of the promise of construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya in run-up to state polls,” an analyst said. Experts point out that chief minister Yogi Adityanath has already struck a chord by repeatedly raising the temple as an example of BJP fulfilling promises to the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vhp-celebrates-gita-jayanti-to-mark-babri-mosque-demolition/articleshow/88286877.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Business||Upskilling, tech will help cos thrive in hybrid world||By Manish BhatnagarThe lasting impact of the pandemic has taught us that the future of work is hybrid. This calls for adapting employees’ skills and roles to the post-pandemic ways of working to build operational resilience. Given the enormous advantages of a hybrid environment of improved productivity and increased happiness index, a growing number of organisations are moving to hybrid workforces. For companies to adapt to the new, hybrid working world, it’s crucial to focus on upskilling the existing workforce, transforming their talent strategy & employee experience, investing in new tools & technologies, and creating novel ways of learning to continue delivering value. Here are a few ways organisations can successfully manage the existing workforce in a hybrid environment: * Create a level playing field: One of the biggest challenges in a hybrid workspace environment will be to create a level playing field among employees so that everyone — whether operating from a physical office or virtually — is able to contribute and participate equally. This will be more difficult for manufacturing companies. It would obviously mean building a strong foundation for collaboration among teams with the right tools and technologies. Another way would be to develop clear ground rules that foster a culture where everybody feels included regardless of where they are located. * Upskilling the workforce: In the new working world, training and upskilling employees takes many different shapes. By linking the training and development goals with the organisation’s strategic priorities, companies can build stronger learning capabilities for their workforce. Importantly, creating a culture that focuses on employees’ skill enhancement is beneficial for both the employee and the organisation. Companies also need to design training on topics such as building resilience, effective communication, time management and diversity to drive behavioural change across broad segments of the workforce. * Boosting employee engagement: When it comes to driving employee engagement, companies need to look at designing the workplace of the future keeping in mind employee needs. The traditional ways of trying to engage and motivate employees simply no longer apply. To keep the team focused, engaged and energised, companies need to highlight employee contributions, wins and encourage managers & leadership to recognise the achievements of their teams for a job well done. This positive recognition not only builds loyalty and motivation but helps remote employees feel seen and valued. * Enabling two-way & real-time feedback: Feedback is often overlooked. Today, employees demand regular and real-time feedback to enable a quicker correction of issues. Similarly, seeking feedback from employees is a crucial way to build trust and create transparency within an organisation. In the face of rapid changes in the social and business climate, having regular dialogues with employees creates a sense of belonging and helps them be more engaged in tackling the challenges before them. There must be equal focus on developing social and emotional skills so that employees can support the ever-evolving business priorities. * Providing the right digital tools: Adapting to the hybrid working models requires new systems, processes, and collaboration tools. Organisations must focus on building holistic digital workspace platforms and find new ways to keep their workforce motivated, engaged, and productive. It must include introducing virtual onboarding, providing remote working environments and seamless access to applications & data, providing modern device management capabilities, addressing connectivity challenges and much more, including digital mental health tools for ensuring employees’ productivity and business success. To ensure productivity and optimal performance, organisations will have to support flexible user choices to deliver exceptional employee experiences like never before. * Improving overall EX: Employee experience (EX) includes everything a person feels as part of the company and covers all touchpoints — from recruitment and onboarding to stay as well as exit interview. Pre-Covid, these touchpoints were limited to a physical workplace. But, given the hybrid work environment, now it extends to the virtual environment too. So, whether employees are Gen X, Y or Z, a good EX can have a positive impact on the business growth. By fostering the right culture, and employee wellbeing, building people’s capability & opportunities for personal growth, and recognising the contributions where employees feel valued, companies will be able to create positive sentiment and strike a balance between the physical and virtual workforce. Modern workplace environment demands an innovative approach and flexible mindset.

While CLSA did not see any meaningful financial impact for Shriram Transport from the merger, analysts at JP Morgan wrote in a note that the merger results in slight dilution but removes a large overhang. However, a technical overhang of private equity investors selling out to remain post-merger. It was however maintaining its “overweight” recommendation on the stock. Analysts at Jeffries said any overhang of stock supply from non-promoters needs to be watched. Shriram group on Monday announced a consolidation exercise that will create India’s largest retail financing NBFC. The Chennai-headquartered group said that the boards of its group companies have cleared a restructuring process which will bring all finance businesses under one entity, spin off insurance business into a separate entity and thereby sharpen focus on businesses. Under the terms of restructuring, Shriram Capital, the holding company of the group which counts promoters, Piramal and TPG as shareholders and Shriram City Union Finance, the retail lending arm of the group, will be merged into Shriram Transport Finance. The merged Shriram Transport will be renamed as Shriram Finance. The insurance business will be hived off and all other businesses will be held separately outside the listed entity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/shriram-group-cos-shares-fall-on-bourses/articleshow/88286170.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

He was accompanied by local MLA T Nagi Reddy, 73rd ward corporator B Sujatha and zonal commissioner D Sridhar. They inspected cleanliness and sanitation at various streets and drains in the zone.  Sujatha requested the commissioner to construct a protection wall along the storm water drain in Sanath Nagar slum. She also appealed to the commissioner to construct new drains as the older sewer lines frequently get clogged.  During their visit to the Adarsa Ground in Vuda Colony, Nagi Reddy said the ground does not have electric lights, leading to antisocial activities during the nights. He asked the commissioner to set up a gate and provide lighting facility in the ground.  The commissioner directed the zonal commissioner to motivate the local youth to make them participate in a one-day cleanliness activity in the ground and inform him about the same so that he can also take part in the drive.

The average minimum temperature in the state was in the range of 9-11 degrees C on Tuesday. At 9.2 degrees C, the minimum temperature in Patna continued to plunge for the third consecutive day on Tuesday. According to Patna Meteorological Centre, Gaya was the coldest place in the state with a minimum temperature of 7.8 degrees C, two notches lower than the normal for the day. Maximum temperature has also plunged over the last few days. It was recorded at 24.2 degrees C at Patna and 23.8 degrees C at Gaya on Tuesday. Aarti Gupta, an official at Patna Meteorological Centre, said the maximum temperature in the state remained in the range of 24-26 degrees C. Since minimum temperatures invariably take a dip around the last week of December, people can brace for colder days and nights this fortnight. “A western disturbance is expected to hit western Himalayan region on the night of December 15. Though it is not expected to hit Bihar, the cold winds coming from it are likely to bring the temperature further down. Thus, the minimum temperature is expected to plunge by 2-3 notches from December 16,” said Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre. He said the prevailing sub-10 chills at Patna and several other places, particularly in south-west Bihar, are owing to cold north-westerly winds blowing in the region from last few days. “Places in south-west Bihar, such as Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas and Bhabhua are getting direct north-westerly winds leading to plunge in the mercury,” Sanjay said. Though mercury continues to plummet, the weathermen said extreme cold conditions, like cold wave or cold day, are still to be witnessed in the region. “As per long-term climate data, cold wave or cold day along with dense foggy conditions is normally witnessed in the region from the last week of December. Such extreme winter weather conditions are mostly result of direct impact of western disturbances,” Sanjay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-feels-the-chill-at-7-8-degrees-celsius/articleshow/88284216.cms||Piyush Tripathi

On Tuesday morning, over 9 crore doses had been administered and additional one crore will be inoculated in the next 15 days, Pandey said. He said the earlier target of six crore doses in six months were supposed to be met by December-end. “We have already achieved that target. Now we will cross the mark of 10 crore doses by the end of this month,” he said during a health department event to lay foundation stones and inaugurate various projects worth Rs1,919 crore by chief minister Nitish Kumar. Pandey said 7 crore doses had been administered by November 7 and it increased to 8 crore in less than a month, on November 28. “In the next 14 days, additional one crore Covid-19 vaccines were administered and the cumulative figures crossed the 9 crore-mark on December 14,” he said. He appreciated the efforts of his department and credited CM Nitish for his daily monitoring, which led to massive vaccination, as well as large number of Covid-19 tests being done daily in Bihar. “While in other states, the number of Covid-19 tests has dropped, in Bihar, it increased despite less cases. This is the reason why the state has managed it so well. Even if the number of tests drops on a day, CM personally inquires about it,” said Pandey. As per the data available on CoWIN portal, over 9.07 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in Bihar till Tuesday afternoon. These included a little over 5.61 crore first doses and 3.45 crore second doses. Bihar has total 5.90 crore beneficiaries, who are eligible to take Covid-19 vaccines. As per the data, 95% of them have taken their first dose and 59% were fully vaccinated.

The PMRC and JICA had several meetings in November on land acquirement for ISBT Patna Metro Rail Depot and other metro stations. A PMRC official said the JICA delegation were assured that hurdles in land acquisition had been cleared. “The company may submit the final report and issue the statement for providing loan of Rs8,019.4 crore after the next meeting this month. As soon as we get the funds, construction of metro stations and networks will begin,” the official said. A central government team led by Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), visited Patna on Friday and assured no delay in financial support to the Patna metro project. So far, the central government has given Rs424 crore for the project. The estimated cost of Patna metro project is Rs13,365.77 crore (excluding land acquisition cost to be borne by the state government). The state and Centre each will bear 20% of the cost and the remaining 60% will be taken as loan from JICA.  Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh has directed the district land acquisition officer to hear the claims and objection of land owners at Ranipur and Pahadi area in Ramachak Bairiya and settle the matter by December 23. The state government has sanctioned Rs1,000 crore for land acquisition. Talking about the status of priority corridor between Malahi Pakri and ISBT, the sources at urban development and housing department (UDHD) said around 274 working piles have been cast while 14 pile caps have been created. “Temporary encroachment from Malahi Pakri has been removed and the area has been barricaded for the elevated network of Corridor II. Work has been progressing between Malahi Pakri and Bypass road whereas construction has also begun from Rajendra Nagar to Khemnichak. Around 67 trees between Rajendra Nagar and Malahi Pakri will be translocated to give way for the project,” the sources said. The estimated cost of the priority corridor was around Rs552 crore. It is expected to complete in 30 months. In the first phase, the 6.1km stretch will come up, which include five elevated stations at New Patliputra ISBT, Zero Mile, Bhutnath, Khemnichak and Malahi Pakri. The Corridor I will be 17.9-km-long, from Danapur to Khemnichack via Meethapur (7.3km elevated and 10.5km underground). The Corridor II will be 14.5-km-long from Patna Junction to ISBT (7.9km underground and 6.6km elevated). Meanwhile, after Asian Development Bank, European Bank has also shown interest in providing funds for the construction of Patna metro rail project. The company has recently sent a proposal to extend financial support of more than Rs8,000 crore for the project. A PMRC official said the state has already signed the MoU with JICA for the construction of both the corridors. “We have told the ABD delegates to financially support the further extension of Patna metro networks. If the JICA further delays loan, the state government has options to get funds,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-metro-rail-project-awaits-funds-from-japan-agency/articleshow/88284432.cms||Faryal Rumi

Kotwali SHO Sunil Kumar Singh said the cartridges were packed in a plastic bag and dumped in the garbage. He said most of the cartridges were of .22 bore while some were of 8mm. He said both types of cartridges are used in regular rifles issued to civilians. Singh said a sanitation worker of Patna Municipal Corporation spotted the bag and informed the police. He said prima facie it seems someone had used the licenced firearms in celebratory firing and dumped there to escape any legal action. “Police are scanning the CCTV camera footage of the locality to trace the prson who dumped the bag there,” he said. Minor girl rescued from getting married: Police, with the help of social welfare department officials, rescued a 12-year-old girl who was forcibly being married to her elder cousin at Adalatganj under Kotwali police station area in the state capital. SHO Sunil Kumar Singh said the girl’s parents were brought to the police station to execute a bond that they won’t commit the crime again. He said a counselling session was also conducted for them. He said the girl’s mother had got the marriage fixed due to poverty. Singh said the girl’s mother had fixed the marriage with her sister’s son, who is 18-year-old. He said the marriage was going to be solemnised on Thursday. The SHO said both families belong to minority community and hail from Bettiah in West Champaran. Patna Sadar BDO Sooraj Kumar said he received a message from an unidentified phone number that a child marriage was going to take place at Adalatganj. He said the block statistical officer (BSO), Meena Kumari, an NGO and those from district child protection unit were sent to the spot with police for verification and necessary rescue action.

The district Covid care centre set up in Pataliputra Sports Complex with a capacity of 110 beds during the second wave of the pandemic will start functioning from Wednesday evening. It will be used as an isolation centre. The district administration has also set up a 24x7 Covid control room with phone numbers 0612-2219080 and 2249964. Officials will man the control room in three shifts for continuous monitoring of the pandemic status. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said it would be mandatory for the private labs to upload the status of Covid tests daily. Nine private labs in the district have been authorised to conduct Covid tests. The DM has also constituted a committee to monitor the functioning of these labs. “Carelessness on the part of the people can complicate the situation. We have activated the contact tracing cell and constituted five teams to make people aware of the bigger challenges ahead. It has been found that many people testing positive had attended marriage functions or other celebrations with large gathering. The mask-checking team raided many crowded places and market areas on Tuesday and reminded people to follow the Covid protocols,” the DM said. Altogether 52 primary health centres, community health centres and urban hospitals have facilities of Covid test in the district. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari said all government hospitals, including PMCH and NMCH, have been put on alert and asked to reserve beds in their Covid wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-care-centre-in-patna-to-restart-today-dm/articleshow/88284296.cms||VK Tripathi

Mishra told mediapersons that the Centre might not be considerate towards the demand for special category status to Bihar since it has ensured that the state continued to develop using the special package given by PM Modi. “The PM had first announced special package worth Rs 1.65 lakh crore for the state at an election rally held during the 2015 assembly election. It included Rs 1.25 lakh crore against various developmental schemes and another chunk of Rs 40,000 crore for the construction of national highways and bridges,” he said. Mishra added the PM would give special package to Bihar even in the future so that the state develops in tandem with developed states in the country. “Grant of special category status to Bihar will not make much of a difference,” he added. “As far as I know, special category status is not granted to a state that lies in the plains. At best, one can keep making pleas for the reconsideration of the demand for special status, but it will only be in the realm of academic discussion,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/special-status-not-for-states-that-lie-in-plains-bihar-bjp-minister/articleshow/88284254.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Business||Weak NBFCs set to face corrective action||MUMBAI: In a move that will bring regulation of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) closer to that of banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that it will impose restrictions on NBFCs whose capital position and bad loans worsen beyond certain levels. The move could slow down the growth of the industry as large non-bank lenders, whose non-performing assets (NPAs) are close to the threshold of above 6%, turn cautious. The RBI on Tuesday announced a prompt corrective action (PCA) framework for NBFCs on the lines of what it had introduced for banks almost two decades ago. The restrictions include those on dividends, issue of guarantees & taking fresh liabilities, branch expansion & costs and capital expenditure other than critical IT costs. “NBFCs have been growing in size and have substantial interconnectedness with other segments of the financial system. The PCA framework for NBFCs comes into effect from October 1, 2022 based on the financial position of NBFCs on or after March 2022,” the RBI said in a statement. The PCA will apply to all deposit-taking NBFCs (excluding those owned by the government). It will also include non-deposit-taking companies if they fall either in the middle, upper or top layer as segmented by the RBI for regulation. However, it will exclude NBFCs not intending to use public funds, government companies, primary dealers and housing finance companies. It will include investment and credit companies, core investment companies, infrastructure debt funds, infrastructure finance companies, and microfinance institutions. “The thresholds around total capital adequacy and tier-1 capital for classification of an NBFC in the PCA category are liberal. However, some entities could breach the net NPA criterion of more than 6%, if the asset quality does not improve,” said A M Karthik, VP and sector head of financial sector ratings at ICRA. “Among the large NBFCs (asset size more than Rs 25,000 crore), about three entities are in breach of the net NPA criterion as of September 2021. However, all these entities have an established parentage,” he said. Those who do not meet the prescribed limits currently will have to improve their NPA ratios either by improving provisions or effecting write-offs. “NBFCs have good pre-provision profits to absorb the same, without adversely impacting their capital profile. However, because of the regulatory changes, we expect the sectoral growth to be impacted in the near term as entities tighten their credit norms and as operational focus may shift towards collections,” said Karthik. Under the framework, the RBI can ask the promoters to bring in a new management or board, remove senior executives or directors, and appoint another director. “The objective of the PCA framework is to enable supervisory intervention at the appropriate time and requires the supervised entities to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner so as to restore their financial health,” the RBI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/weak-nbfcs-set-to-face-corrective-action/articleshow/88285638.cms||---

While one of them died, the other brother is under treatment at a private hospital in the city. The police suspect that the brothers took the extreme step due to pressure of performing well in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), but they are yet to ascertain the exact reason. According to the police, Rupen Patel and Rehan Patel, whose parents are teachers at a school in Anand, were science stream students at a school in Karelibaug. “The duo was preparing for NEET. One of their friends said that they were under pressure to score good marks. As of now, we believe that it may be the reason behind the suicide, but further investigation is on,” said R K Gosai, police sub-inspector, Laxmipura police that has filed a case of accidental death. Gosai said that Rupen and Rihan were studying in their room on Monday afternoon and their elder brother Maulik (19) was in the next room. “Rupen and Rehan took separate towels and hung themselves to the ceiling fan. While Rupen died on the spot, Rehan fell on the floor as the towel came off the fan,” Gosai told TOI. The incident came to light when their father Rajesh Patel came home from work at about 5.30 pm on Monday. He went into Rupen and Rehan’s room and raised alarm after seeing Rupen hanging from the fan. Rehan, who was unconscious, was rushed to the hospital. Sub-inspector Gosai said that the brothers haven’t left any suicide note or sent message to anyone before taking the extreme step. “We have questioned the parents too but they have no idea as to why their sons took the step. We will be able to get more details once Rehan’s condition stabilizes and he gives a statement,” Gosai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/17-year-old-twin-brothers-attempt-suicide-one-dies/articleshow/88284868.cms||---

Normally, Vizag fishing harbour, the biggest in the state, sees a peak in activity between November and March. But the harbour has been losing its sheen for the past few years due to a decrease in the catch of fish and prawn in the Bay of Bengal. “Diesel costs around Rs 90 a litre, including subsidy. We don’t know how to afford such high prices when we are getting a low catch. We are expecting most of the boats to go tosea from the first week of January as we have been incurring losses for the past few months,” said P C Appa Rao, president of AP Mechanised Boat Operators’ Welfare Association. Back-to-back cyclones over the Bay of Bengal in the past two months has hit fishing operations. Of the over 700 mechanised fishing boats in Vizag fishing harbour, more than 400 have been anchored at the jetty. Owners of the mechanised boats are not able to afford Rs 3 to Rs 4 lakh for each voyage with rising diesel and other prices, couple with the poor catch,” Appa Rao added. A mechanised fishing boat burns around 3,000 litres of diesel on a fishing trip that lasts 15 days. The trip costs at least Rs 4 lakh, higher by a quarter compared to last year. But there is no certainty about the catch. A boat can return with a catch worth Rs 3.5 lakh or as low as Rs 2 lakh. “Much depends on luck and sometimes we do not get a good price for the prawn, so owners incur losses,” said president of the Dolphin Boat Operators’ Welfare Association, Ch Satyanarayana Murthy. With low availability of popular varieties, prices of seer fish and silver pomfret have increased by 30 per cent. The price of silver pomfret ranges between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,200 while tiger prawn is being sold at Rs 800 and Rs 900, said Prabhakar K, a seafood lover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/high-fuel-price-and-low-catch-force-fisherfolk-to-drop-anchor/articleshow/88284514.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Vijayawada||Elderly pensioners to get Rs 2,500 from January 1 in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: The state government has decided to increase old age pension by Rs 250 per month from January 1, 2022. The enhanced pension amount of Rs 2,500 would be paid to beneficiaries on the first day of the New Year across the state. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy asked district collectors to ensure that village and ward volunteers pay the enhanced pension amount at the door step of beneficiaries. He told them to alert the volunteers about the hike who in turn should inform the aged beneficiaries about the pension hike. The CM took the decision during a video conference with district collectors and SPs on Spandana — the grievance redressal programme of the government — at his Tadepalli camp office. Old age pension in the state was increased from Rs 1,000 a month to Rs 2,000 by then chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu during the last days of his term that ended in 2019. His successor Jagan increased the amount to Rs 2,250 a few months after taking charge, and has now further hiked it to Rs 2,500. Jagan had promised to increase old age pension to Rs 3,000 a month during his poll campaign ahead of the 2019 general elections. The chief minister also announced the launch of ‘Jagananna Sampurna Bhu Hakku’ scheme on December 21, which aims to provide clear titles to beneficiaries of house sites and houses. This would follow payment of benefits under various schemes to leftover eligible persons on December 28. He also announced a financial benefit of Rs 15,000 per year to EBC women on January 9, 2022. He also wanted collectors to visit Jagananna housing colonies in their respective districts and monitor quality of work. Asking them to launch pending construction work of housing colonies by January 31, 2022, he said they should form groups with every 20 beneficiaries for effective monitoring of construction work where it has already begun. “Construct one godown in every colony to keep stocks of cement, sand, and iron. The government is procuring steel and cement at subsidised rates directly from the manufacturers to reduce construction cost,” the CM said. He also told them to explore the possibility of setting up temporary brick-making units closer to the colonies to avoid delay in procurement and transportation. He asked the collectors and municipal commissioners to hold review meetings with secretariat staff on the progress of work. On sand supply, the chief minister told district collectors and municipal commissioners to open sand reaches in their respective areas to ensure continued supply of sand for the housing programme. He also wanted them to create awareness among the beneficiaries of one-time settlement (OTS) programme. The beneficiaries would get clear titles for the houses which would enable them to avail bank loans for domestic financial requirements if they go for OTS. They would get an average benefit of Rs Rs 6,000 crore, while the state exchequer stands to lose over Rs Rs 10,000 crore towards tax and registration exemptions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/elderly-pensioners-to-get-rs-2500-from-jan-1/articleshow/88284620.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Hookah stays barred till Feb 12 but DC hears ‘secret gurgles’||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration on Tuesday extended the ban on local hookah bars till February 12. Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh issued these orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to contain Covid-19. The ban has continued since October 13 last year, while police have since booked many bar managers for violating this rule. The DC wrote in his orders that he knew that hookah bars were open secretly and serving flavoured tobacco molasses with a harmful level of nicotine. The administration suspects that these bars also spike this tobacco molasses with narcotic chemical drugs. The hookah is smoked through a shared bowl, pipe, hose, and mouthpiece, which exposes the smokers to infections that travel from mouth to mouth. It can even be a transmitter of Covid-19 in these pandemic times. The orders specify all these dangers of going to a hookah bar. The hotels, restaurants, taverns, and liquor bars also can’t serve hookah. This order is effective for 60 days from December 15. The violators will be punished under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with defying public orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hookah-stays-barred-till-feb-12-but-dc-hears-secret-gurgles/articleshow/88285489.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi claimed that mayor Amarjit Singh ‘Jeeti’ Sidhu had sanctioned Rs 27 lakh for the project. Bedi said: "It was an urgent and important need of the MC to recharge the groundwater. The rainwater that empties into the drains and runs off to the seasonal rivulets goes waste. The groundwater resource had been depleted and polluted. Harvesting will save this water from contamination and raise the groundwater level." The water will be lifted to the ground with pipes attached to the buildings, where a deep hole will be packed with sand, gravel, coal, and other materials that act as natural filter. Bedi said the mayor had called for storing rainwater on the MC properties. For this purpose, he proposed using the sites of the public health department, parks, community centres, and said "there will be no shortage of funds".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mc-to-harvest-rainwater-spend-rs27l/articleshow/88285501.cms||---

During the early stage of the pandemic, private lenders had pulled back on unsecured loans and said that it was cautious about this segment. “In the beginning of Covid, when we dealt with a lot of unknown unknowns, we wanted to see how the pandemic plays out. Now unsecured is a very centre-of-the-plate business for us. The unsecured part of our balance sheet is very light, which gives us huge headroom for growth. We are extremely bullish and doing several initiatives to grow both unsecured loans and unsecured credit cards,” said Kotak Mahindra Bank president (consumer assets) Ambuj Chandna. “We have 25 lakh cards, of which we issued more than a lakh in October alone,” said Chandna. He was speaking at the launch of a new co-branded credit card with Indigo. Chandna said that quarter-on-quarter growth for the three months ended September was around 13%. Speaking at the event, IndiGo chief commercial officer William Boulter said that domestic travel was back to 98% of the pre-pandemic level, while international travel was half of what it was earlier. “Although we are low-cost, we are not cheap. The launch of the credit card shows that we are trying to appeal to customers across the board and not just those who fly economy,” said Boulter. The partners have launched two new cards — the Kotak IndiGo Rewards 6E Ka-ching, and a premium variant of the same card. The base card has a fee of Rs 700 and which is more than covered if customers use the welcome offer of Rs 1,500 on an IndiGo ticket. The base cards generate 3 reward points for every Rs 100 spent on IndiGo while the premium version generates 6 reward points. The rewards can be used for airline tickets. The premium card has a Rs 2,500 fee (Rs 1,500 introductory offer) against which customers will get Rs 3,000 toward a welcome ticket. Chandna said that there are signs that the pandemic is trending toward endemic and the credit card business was likely to grow along the lines of air travel in India. “We believe that cards will go the aviation way. We believe that the credit card business is at that inflection point in India,” said Chandna. The bank had earlier tied up with PVR for a co-branded card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kotak-bullish-on-credit-cards-unsecured-loans/articleshow/88285663.cms||Mayur Shetty

The airport became operational round the clock from December 1, but the passenger traffic has not picked up as expected. Though considering the Covid conditions, the traffic is fairly decent. However, the increase in the number of flights should have led to a rise in the number of passengers. The current traffic is more or less the same as it was when the airport was operational for 12 hours. However, we expect things to improve soon,” a source at the airport told TOI. Barring Sunday (December 12), which saw a little over 20,000 passengers (both arrivals and departures) at the Pune airport, the resumption of round-the-clock flight movements has not converted into high passenger traffic until now, said officials. Before December 1, the airport remained operational between 8am and 8pm for more than a year. After the second wave, the traffic started to improve and the total average daily passengers between August and November was between 15,000 and 19,000. “This was at a time when the total flight movements at the airport were between 100 and 120. After December 1, the daily flight movements have increased to around 140. With flights operating after 8pm now, the passenger traffic should have gone up, too,” another official said. Between 9pm and 8am, the airport currently witnesses around 28 departures and almost as many arrivals. “The number of arrivals and departures differ from day to day but more or less around 28 departures and 27-28 arrivals take place during the time,” the official pointed out. There is no civil flight operation between 9am and 11:30am on account of IAF practice session from Sunday till Friday. The runway remains closed between 11am and 5pm on Saturday for maintenance. Airline sources said that the number of passengers has dropped suddenly. “The Omicron threat has affected the travel plan of people and the number of flyers is less as compared to November or some months earlier” an airline representative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/round-the-clock-op-fails-to-boost-airport-traffic/articleshow/88285526.cms||Joy Sengupta

Family members of businessman Subramanyam realised how they were conned only after the offenders left the place and immediately alerted Gachibowli police. According to police, at around 1.30 pm, four persons entered flat number 110 in block-C of Jayabheri Orange County apartment complex in Nanakramguda. Subramanyam was not home when the offenders struck. The accused introduced themselves as CBI sleuths to Subramanyam’s wife Bhagya Lakshmi and asked her to cooperate when they went about searching the flat, Gachibowli inspector G Suresh said. The pseudo CBI sleuths took locker keys from Lakshmi and took away gold and cash from it. “The gang collected the gold along with cash and left the place within 20 minutes,” Madhapur DCP M Venkateshwarlu said. The fraudsters also took four cellphones from the house. After the accused let the flat, Lakshmi informed Subramanyam about the incident and he immediately rushed to the flat. The businessman gathered details from his wife and realised that the raid was conducted by fraudsters. A complaint was lodged with police at around 5 pm. Soon after the complaint was lodged, a police team rushed to the apartment and verified the CCTV footage to identify the accused.  “The accused wore formal dress and spoke in Telugu. All of them wore masks. They fled in a car towards the ORR. We suspect that the offenders could be known to the businessman’s family,” the DCP said. Two special police teams are on the lookout to nab the offenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/conmen-pose-as-cbi-dupe-realtors-kin-of-gold-cash/articleshow/88285515.cms||---

Next in line are trials on children in two to six year age group. Safety data has to be approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) to start the trials. There are a total of 128 children in this group at all sites. “There was no adverse event for the 12 years and 17 years of age group at our sites,” said Prof Madhu Gupta, principal investigator for the study in PGI. PGI is one of the trial centres for Covovax, which shall be phase 2/3 observer blind randomised control study to determine the safety and immunogenicity of Covovax in children aged between two and 17 years. The study, sponsored by the Serum Institute of India (SII), will have 100 participants. The children will be followed up for six months after being administered two shots of Covovax after a gap of 21 days. The SII has partnered with Novovax, which has been branded as Covovax in India. No Nasal vaccine trial for children is being conducted in the country. However, ZyCoV-D vaccine has received approval for restricted use in emergency setting by the national regulator--DCGI for the 12 years and above age group, based on interim clinical data of Phase III clinical trial conducted in the country. The interim phase II/III clinical trial data of Covaxin on healthy volunteers aged two to 18 years submitted by Bharat Biotech was deliberated on in the meeting of the subject expert committee.

Though multiple complaints have been reportedly made to the officials concerned, the officials have turned a blind eye to the issue and no work has been initiated to repair the road in the locality. Locals told TOI that road widening work is being carried out since almost 2 years now but a new road has still not been laid. Motorists travelling towards Hussaini Alam, Misri Gunj and other parts of Old City are facing inconvenience. “Almost two years ago, road widening work was taken up and due to this the road was broken. Motorists and pedestrians passing through this stretch face a lot of inconvenience, especially during the peak hours as the traffic flow is affected,” said Mohammed Mairaj, a resident of Himmatpura. A GHMC official told TOI that a new road will be laid only after the buildings are demolished. He said that of the targeted 170 buildings, 90 buildings have been demolished for road widening work on the Himmatpura to Fateh Darwaza stretch and the remaining buildings would be demolished in a phased manner. “The land acquisition process is also underway. The electric poles on the stretch are also being removed,” a GHMC official told TOI on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/himmatpura-fateh-darwaza-road-cries-for-repair/articleshow/88285524.cms||Omar bin Taher

Between December 4 and 11, 47 new cases of chikungunya and 37 new cases of dengue have been reported. The total number of chikungunya cases between January 1 to December 11 stood at 1,677, up 81.7% from 923 cases registered in 2020. Dengue cases in the city in the same period stood at 3,036, up 602% from 432 cases in 2020. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s health department data also showed that malaria cases in the city between Jan and December 11 stood at 981, up 58.7% from 618 in the whole of last year. In the same period, city hospitals recorded 134 cases of falciparum up 109% from 64 cases registered last year. “With the available manpower, it is almost impossible to carry out fogging in areas that we receive the most complaints from. We keep registering new cases even from areas that we have carried out fogging. It is because we have found most mosquito breeding on the terraces and basements of buildings. We have been asking citizens to keep their terraces and basements clean to avoid mosquito breeding,” a senior AMC health department official said. AMC registers most complaints for mosquito control from West, North-West, South and South-West zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-sees-47-chikungunya-37-dengue-cases-in-a-week/articleshow/88286898.cms||---

The farmers from the district are angry over several issues — mainly the rampant disconnections of power supply to recover power bill dues, the deduction in the hours of power supply to the agriculture connections from 12 hours to 8 hours and faulty power supply bills. Pratap Hogade, power expert and convenor of the protest march, said, “Across the district, rampant disconnection is going on. The farmers already facing debts due to pandemic and lost crops due to floods. In such situation, the extreme step taken by MSEDCL has forced farmers to stop the work.” He added, “Farming will cease to exist if the power supply remains disconnected. We want the bills to be corrected. Since the bills were finalised without visiting the fields, the amount is inflated.” The farmers need uninterrupted power supply for at least 12 hours to irrigate their fields. However, the MSEDCL decision to cut the supply hours from 12 hours to 8 hours only for agriculture connections has not gone down well. “The government has cited the shortage of coal and thereby the less production of electricity as the reason for cutting the supply hours for agriculture connections. Currently, the farmers require huge amount of water to save their crops and without continuous irrigation, it is not possible,” said Hogade. Last month, after the MSEDCL started the drive to snap the power supply, over 5,200 farmers from Kolhapur and Sangli districts paid power dues worth Rs 2.52 crore in just three days. The MSEDCL has launched a concession scheme for the farmers. They will get 50% amount waived if the dues are paid in a single installment till March 31 next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-farmers-to-protest-against-power-cuts-on-dec-20/articleshow/88284610.cms||---

Students reported the sighting of nearly 56 species of birds during a single birdwatching trip. Gajanan Shetye, a wildlifer, conducted the birdwatching trail along with Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade based at Keri, Sattari. Sanket Naik, the school teacher, said that this vast list of birds spotted during the trip will be compiled and submitted to the village’s biodiversity management committee to be included in Sal village’s People Biodiversity Register. “Students not only sighted commonly found birds like little egret, little cormorant, pond heron, Indian pea fowl, but also difficult to spot species like the emerald dove, vernal hanging parakeet, white bellied sea eagle, Malabar pied hornbill, mountain emerald pigeon and other varied and colourful birds. This has brought to the attention of students the richness of the avi-fauna diversity thriving in the riverine area of village like Sal,” said another teacher, Dhaktu Patil. A parent, Sanjay Sawant, who took part in the birdwatching, said there is a need to teach environment science subject, not within the four walls of the classroom, but by giving students exposure to nature by conducting such activities. The school’s managing committee president, Rutuja Gawas, said, “Not only the students, but we too gained knowledge of the biodiversity of the locality. This activity helped in understanding the role played by birds as pollinators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/students-spot-56-species-of-birds-on-single-trail-at-sal/articleshow/88286928.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Agra||Kappan, 7 activists' case transferred to NIA court in Lucknow||Agra: A local court in Mathura on Monday transferred the sedition and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) case against journalist Siddiqui Kappan and seven Popular Front of India (PFI) activists to a special national investigation agency (NIA) court in Lucknow. The journalist was booked along with three others after he attempted to visit the family of a 19-year-old Dalit rape and murder victim in Hathras last year. Four others were arrested subsequently. The court of additional district and sessions judge Anil Kumar Pandey ordered the transfer after accepting an application filed by a special task force (STF) of the UP police. The application stated that the government had constituted a special court in the state headquarters under section 22 of the NIA Act, according to an order issued on April 20. The next hearing of the matter is scheduled in January next year. The PFI activists' lawyer, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, said that he would be challenging the district court's order in the high court. He argued that the police did not follow due procedure under the NIA Act, which is why the special court in Lucknow did not have the jurisdiction to hear the case. He said UAPA offences are listed under the NIA Act and section 6 of the Act says that after an offence is registered, the station in-charge is supposed to file a report with the state government, which must inform the Centre. Within 15 days, the Centre has to take a call on whether the offence was scheduled or not, and also decide who will investigate the case. "The investigating agency was not chosen by the Centre, hence due procedure was not followed," Chaturvedi said. Initially, the Mathura police had arrested Siddique Kappan, Atiq-ur-Rahman, Masood Ahmad, and their driver Alam, while they were going to visit the family of the Hathras victim on October 5 last year. Later, Rauf Sherif, the general secretary of the Campus Front of India, which is the student wing of PFI, was arrested along with activists Asad Badruddin, Firoz Khan, and Mohammad Danish. All were accused of receiving funds from abroad to foment caste riots in Hathras. The five-member STF of the UP police had filed a 5,000-page charge-sheet in the case in April this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kappan-7-other-pfi-activists-case-transferred-to-nia-court-in-lucknow/articleshow/88284626.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Kolhapur too has got two foreign returnees who have tested positive for Covid. They have come in from Australia and Nigeria. Samples of all these travellers have been sent for genome sequencing to check if they are infected with the Omicron variant. As per the Government of India, South Africa, the UK and New Zealand are in the “at high risk” category. Therefore, the Satara health administration is ensuring that these travellers and their close contacts are isolated and their health status is monitored. Subhash Chavan, the Satara district civil surgeon, said, “Six travellers had arrived at Phaltan from South Africa, the UK and New Zealand. Of them, five tested positive. We have put them in isolation centres. No one is showing any symptoms. We expect the results of the genome sequencing in a day or two.” In Kolhapur, a family of four returned from Australia. Since Australia is not in the “at high risk category”, they were allowed to leave the airport, but were asked to isolate at home till the swabs got tested. The family is from Ramanmala in Kolhapur city. One of the family members tested positive, and the sample has been sent for genome sequencing. Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said the genome sequencing report is awaited. The patient’s treatment has started. The patient did show any symptom and is undergoing treatment at home.

---||Agra||No staff at newborn care unit of Etah medical College||Agra: The newborn care unit (SNCU) of Etah Medical College has been non-operational for the past six months due to lack of human resources, forcing parents to take their children born with ailments to private hospitals. According to the medical college records, there are sanctioned posts for three doctors and 22 supporting staff to run the facility, all of which are vacant at present. Vinod Kumar, a resident of Aliganj said, “My newborn daughter was suffering from jaundice and I had to borrow money to get her treated at a private hospital, as there is no arrangement for treating newborn children at the medical college. Authorities must take action to operate the facility as soon as possible.” According to the medical college administration, SNCU currently has 12 beds and the required equipment to treat newborn babies. Lack of staff is the only hurdle. There is a requirement of three doctors, 12 staff nurses, three ward attendants, three sanitation workers, three security guards and a computer operator. Chief medical superintendent Ashok Kumar said, “SNCU is non-operational as we don’t have the required number of doctors and supporting staff to run the facility. The matter has been brought to the notice of higher authorities and the process for appointment of pediatricians is in progress. We are making efforts to soon begin operations at SNCU.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-staff-at-newborn-care-unit-of-etah-medical-college/articleshow/88284647.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Goa||Goa: Serve notice to govt authority for sand mining nod, says NGT||PANAJI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered that notices be served to the Goa State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (Goa-SEIAA) after a voluntary organisation challenged the permission granted by the authority permitting sand extraction in River Chapora. The Goa-SIEAA has been given time till February 9, 2022 to respond. “The impugned order (by Goa-SEIAA) did refer to the order of the Supreme Court of India in Deepak Kumar’s case as well as the orders passed by this tribunal and also the EIA Notification, 2006 (as amended till date) and, however, did not state anything as to the compliance of the said judgment and EIA notification appearance. In the light of the same, the tribunal is inclined to entertain this appeal,” the tribunal said. The Goa River Sand Protectors Network, functioning under the Goa Foundation, approached the tribunal against the Goa-SEIAA order stating that ‘there has been no due and proper application of mind before according environment clearance and hence prays for interference’. The Goa-SEIAA had approved sand mining in four stretches of River Chapora at its meeting held on October 5, 2021. The extraction in the four zones, where the activity has been approved, has to be carried out only the manual method, the Goa-SEIAA had said. To begin with, sand extraction in these four zones will be taken up only at 50% capacity for the first 3 years. The capacity, thereafter, will be decided after this three-year period ends, Goa-SEIAA had stated. Under the Goa Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1985, permissions for sand extractions were being granted on a yearly basis. But after the CRZ notification 2011 was issued, granting of permissions for sand extraction was stopped from 2011-12 onwards. Two different committees under the two district collectors were constituted by the state environment department to grant permissions for sand extractions. In August 2013, some stretches of the Mandovi, Chapora and Tiracol were identified for sand extraction. In 2017-18, 323 permits in North Goa and 11 in South Goa were either issued or renewed and were valid till May 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/serve-notice-to-govt-authority-for-sand-mining-nod-says-ngt/articleshow/88286389.cms||---

One of the accused, however, managed to flee. Rupesh Khedkar, RFO, said forest officials at Nagpur had received a tip-off that some people were planning to fix a deal to sell a leopard skin near Ambedkar Park at Mahadevpura in the main market of Wardha. A team of Nagpur officials reached Wardha and laid a trap along with local foresters near Ambedkar Park. At around 11pm, five people on bikes reached the spot. On seeing that they were carrying a leopard skin, the forest teams swung into action and nabbed four of them even as one managed to flee. Leopard skins fetch crores of rupees in the international market, say sources. Khedkar said, “We are interrogating the accused to find out from where they procured the leopard skin and who the buyer was.” The number of accused in the leopard skin smuggling case is likely to increase, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-skin-seized-at-wardha-4-held/articleshow/88300984.cms||Balwant Dhage
---||Kolkata||Rohit Bangladesh woman||Rohit Khnna and Sujoy Khanra Kolkata/Jhargram: A woman from Patuakhali, Bangladesh who accidentally crossed the border and entered India was rescued at Jhargram. The district administration has started the process to send the woman back to her country after getting permission from the authorities. Rajia Begum alias Rajia Howladar, a woman in her fifties went out of her home in Dhaka six months back. She was mentally unstable and lost her way on the road. Yet she kept on walking for days till she reached the Indo-Bangladesh border. “We are not sure how she managed to cross the border and entered India. She cannot recollect how she reached Jhargram,” said Ambarish Nag Biswas of West Bengal Radio Club. The woman was begging on the road when she fell ill. Locals alerted the district administration and she was taken to a hospital. “She was mentally unstable too. We got her treated for some time before she could start talking. But she could not recollect anything,” said Babulal Mahato, sub-divisional officer of Jhargram. When the nurses at the hospital asked her about whereabouts she asked everyone to see it in her passport. “She was not carrying any document with her but the nurses could figure out that she might be from Bangladesh. She talked about some address in Bangladesh and we tried to follow the lead,” Biswas said. The amateur radio partners in Bangladesh were informed and they started a search. Finally, they zeroed in on a family which had lost a member nearly six months back. Dipta Majumdar, another member of the radio club, got a photograph of her son Tarequl. She immediately recognized the person. She also recognized some other photographs of her family members. “We were sure that we had connected to the right family. We arranged for a video call with the woman,” Biswas recounted. “She could not recollect the entire journey and how she came to the hospital. At times she felt that her family members are with her,” Biswas said. The process to get the woman back to her home started after that. The radio operators connected with the Lohalia Union Parishad at Patuakhali in Bangladesh who started to help in the process. Jhargram SP Biswajit Ghosh said that the Bangladesh High Commission has already been apprised of the development. “We have intimated all concerned departments and are trying to get her back home,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rohit-bangladesh-woman/articleshow/88285547.cms||Rohit Khanna

Health officials said Diwali holidays and lethargic attitude among beneficiaries resulted in a dull response to the vaccination in November, while the Omicron concerns have given a push to the drive in December. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The vaccination has certainly picked up pace in the past two weeks. Thanks to ample stock of Covishield and Covaxin doses, the drive is back on track.” Deshmukh said though the sudden surge in the vaccination could be attributed to the Omicron variant concerns, the low mortality rate and shrinking Covid cases can also be attributed to the rise in the vaccination figures. On Tuesday, the district recorded vaccination of around 68,115 beneficiaries across its 669 government and private vaccination sites till 8pm. The district now has administered a total of 1.43 crore doses vaccines, of which 85.02 lakh are first doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/11l-inoculated-in-2-weeks-of-dec-higher-than-nov-tally/articleshow/88285542.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hubballi||Karnataka to get its first greenfield highway||KALABURAGI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has floated tenders for the development of a six-lane access controlled greenfield highway from Badadal village in Kalaburagi district, to Singnodi in Raichur district, a total distance of 177 km. This will be the first access controlled highway in the state, and first six-lane highway in North Karnataka. The Union government is spending about Rs 25 crore per km for this highway. However, Kalaburagi is not part of this highway network. As per documents available with TOI, Sandeep Agrawal, general manager (tech), NHAI, New Delhi, has finalised four packages of tenders for 203.1 km of highways from Akkalkot in Maharashtra to Singnodi in Raichur district. Out of 4 packages, three packages, 2, 3 and 4, covering a distance of 177 km, are in Kalaburagi, Yadgir and Raichur districts of Karnataka, while package-1 falls in Maharashtra. Sunil Kulkarni, president, Kalyana Karnataka Grahakara Vedike, termed it as a good development, as the fastest and shortest highway connects the Kalyana Karnataka region with Bengaluru and Mumbai. “It will also make Chennai, Surat, Tirupati, Pune and other cities closer to the region. The only setback is that Kalaburagi will not be a part of this highway network, which is a distance of about 35 km. However, we hope that this distance will be filled by the industrial corridor in the coming years,” he added. Terming the tender document a perfect one, he said that the NHAI has made it a model document for any mega project. “As per the document, this highway will get seven double trumpets in Karnataka at Ganagapur, Jewargi, Sirwal, Khanapur, Gugal, Deosugur and at the Telangana border. As it prohibits two-wheelers and unauthorised access, it’s expected to be on par with highways of the United States, or any other developed country of the world,” he said. Sources in the NHAI Bengaluru regional office said that the proposed highway is numbered as NH-150C, and its construction is expected to start in a year. “As the Bharatmala project is directly controlled by Delhi, we do not have much information about it,” they added. Tenders called currently* Badabal village till Maradagi S Andola in Kalaburagi District -71km, tenders called for Rs 1,769 crore (Km 26 to 97) * Maradgi S Andola till Baswantpur in Yadgir district- 65.5 km tenders called for Rs 1,606 crore (Km 97 to 162.5) * Baswantpur till Singnodi in Raichur district- 40.6 km tenders called for Rs 1,169 crore (Km 162.5 to 203.1) About Bharatmala PariyojanaBharatmala Pariyojana, India’s largest infrastructure programme, was envisioned in 2017, to develop 34,800 km of National Highway corridors, connecting more than 600 districts in the country. This programme signalled a paradigm shift to corridor approach of infrastructure development. It focuses on development of 24,800 km of dedicated expressways, access-controlled economic corridors, and associated feeder routes, coastal and port connectivity and border and international connectivity corridors. In addition, 10,000 km of ongoing NHDP projects are envisioned as part of the overall programme which will cover a length of 34,800 km. What is a greenfield highway?Greenfield Expressways are designed to avoid inhabited areas and go through new alignments, to bring development to new areas, and to reduce land acquisition costs and construction timelines.

The hoof prints were traced on Tuesday morning in the farms of Peth Vadgaon, indicating that the animal was moving towards the Kini village located along the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway. By noon, the bison was traced to Bhadole and finally the Latavde village riverside area near the Peth Vadgaon to Ashta Road. Forest ranger Satappa Jadhav said, “The bison has been traced. On Tuesday evening, the animal was seen resting in a field near the river at the Latawde village, some 24km from Kolhapur city. On Tuesday morning, the animal had started moving from the Peth Vadgaon are towards Wathar, and then Kini. From there, the bison moved towards the Bhadole village and finally reached the Latawde village. There doesn't seem to be any need to tranquilise the animal as the bison has been calmly walking back towards its natural habitat without disturbing anyone. We are following the bison and informing people to not to chase the animal or create chaos. That might cause an untoward incident like the one that took place in the Bhuyewadi village.” Sunil Limaye, the principal chief conservator of forest of Nagpur who was in Kolhapur for a department meeting, addressed the media. Limaye said, “We have asked Kolhapur district collector Rahul Rekhawar to impose Section 144, if required, if the wild animal enters the urban area. This will prevent chaos and the animal will be able to get free passage back to its habitat. If animals like bisons come into the urban areas, they should be allowed to go back to their habitats on their own. Bison is a silent animal, and doesn't attack unless it feels threatened. The compensation amount for damages caused to crops, buildings and other property by bisons are given immediately by the department. Therefore, people should not risk their lives to stop the animal from entering their farmlands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/foresters-track-bison-as-it-walks-back-calmly-towards-its-habitat/articleshow/88284652.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

NMC officials said there are still 1.39 lakh beneficiaries who are yet to take their first dose, and more than 1.34 lakh who have not taken their second doses. We want to complete vaccination of all beneficiaries as soon as possible. The process to complete the first dose vaccination of all beneficiaries needs to be completed by December 31, said the NMC officials. Even though the number of cases of Covid-positive cases has reduced in the city, there still is a threat of the new variant — Omicron — that is highly infectious.

The alleged fraud came to light before the PMC could transfer any money in favour of the contractor. Senior inspector Anita More and her team from the Shivajinagar police arrested the contractor, Yogi Chandrashekhar More, from Sinhagad Road following a tip-off. Yogi is accused of having submitted the fake bills between February and October this year. The police are searching the electronic equipment which More used for preparing fake and fabricated documents, including the bills. Pralhad Darachand Pawar (35), an officer from the PMC, had lodged a complaint with the police on November 18 after the forgery and cheating attempt came to light. Sub-inspector Bhairavnath Shelke of the Shivajinagar police told TOI, “Yogi prepared fake documents of the tender process and work completion and forged signatures of various PMC authorities to get the bills cleared between February and October ,this year. However, one of the bill clearing desks in the PMC headquarters realised it and alerted the top authorities.” Shelke, citing investigations, said, “Yogi is in serious debt and came up with the idea of submitting fake bills to get money to repay them.

Their family rushed to their room to find the elder girl withering in pain and the younger one unconscious. “My elder daughter told us that our neighbour, Mursalim Ali had thrown something on their faces, causing an excessive burning sensation. We called the police and doctors immediately,” said the father of the girls. The incident took place at a village in Baghpat. Acid had been thrown on them allegedly by the son of their Urdu teacher who lives in the neighbourhood. Mursalim was taken into custody on the complaint of the girl's father. He has been booked under IPC section 458 (house-breaking by night after preparation for hurt, assault, or wrongful restrain), 307 (attempt to murder), 326-A (punishment for acid attacks), 380 (theft in dwelling house )and 506 (criminal intimidation ). The two sisters were taken to a nearby community healthcare centre (CHC) and were later, referred to Meerut Medical College, where the doctors claimed that the elder girl is critical as more than half of her face has been burnt. “The younger sister received 20% burns on the face but she is out of danger,” said Dr VD Pandey at Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College. Ram Niwas, SHO of Baleni police station, said, “Mursalim’s mother used to teach Urdu to both sisters. The duo used to go to her house for lessons every day. Mursalim fell in love with the elder girl but when the family got to know about his feelings, they had stopped sending their daughters for tuition. He felt rejected and, in a fit of rage, committed the crime.” Neeraj Jadaun , SP Baghpat, said the attack was allegedly intended for the older girl but the younger girl was also injured. Police took the samples of the liquid thrown on the faces of the girl from the stains which were clearly visible on the wall of the room where the attack took place. Further investigation is underway, said Jadaun. While few people at the village claimed that Mursalim is a minor, the police claimed that he hasn’t pleaded to be one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rejected-man-throws-acid-on-two-minor-sisters-in-baghpat/articleshow/88284677.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corporation to cancel trade license for non-compliance||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation has rejected the application for collection of parking fee by a shopping mall and has issued notice to another mall against collection of parking fee. It has been directed that trade license will be cancelled if the shopping malls continued to collect parking fee in areas allotted for parking as per the approved building plan. The corporation has filed a counter statement in the High Court citing the illegalities in the contention of shopping malls for the collection of parking fee. The application filed by a shopping mall for renewal of license to collect parking fee was rejected by the city corporation citing that the application did not have necessary documents like approved building plan, plan showing parking spaces, additional spaces beyond the allotted parking lot. The shopping malls paid a license fee of Rs 3,000 and made daily collection of parking fee on hourly basis from the shoppers. The civic body has now stopped issuing license for collection of parking fee unless the shopping mall owners’ specifically shows the areas other than the allotted parking spaces. The move follows a directive issued by corporation secretary last week citing the illegality in collection of fee for vehicles being parked in approved parking area as per the building rules. As per the directive, malls and commercial buildings ought to have mandatory parking facility. Collection of fees is illegal. The parking area has to be retained as part of additional facilities. In case there is additional parking area, license has to be obtained from the city corporation and this permit has to be displayed at the parking lot, the directive said. The legal counsel had earlier advised the corporation against intervening in the matter of levying of parking fee by private theatres and hospitals. KSFDC (Kerala state film development corporation) which stopped collection of parking fee on the premises later forwarded a letter to the city corporation expressing the willingness to remit an annual payment of Rs 3,000 for collecting parking fee. Even in the assembly the present LSG minister and former LSG ministers have sounded vague about the matter. Recently M V Govindan Master replied that the government was unaware about collection of parking fee in malls. He also said that there was no provision to collect parking fee in areas allotted for parking as per the building rules. While, former LSG minister K T Jaleel had told the assembly that the building rules do not have any provision that mandate that parking should be provided for free in shopping malls and rules only call for mandatory parking spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corporation-to-cancel-trade-license-for-non-compliance/articleshow/88285567.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Nashik municipal corporation officials said that builders, developers and citizens are seen chopping trees or trimming of tree branches while going for construction of the building projects. The decision of imposing fine up to Rs 1.5 lakh has been taken in a bid to curb such illegal activities of chopping of trees in the city. In 2019, the civic body had conducted a tree census in the city and found 47.95 lakh trees across six divisions in the city. The highlight of the census was that the tree population in two of its six divisions—Nashik East and Nashik West—located in the heart of the city, were abysmally poor. Almost 97.15% trees were in Panchavati, Cidco, Nashik Road and Satpur divisions of the municipal corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/soon-hefty-fine-for-illegal-felling-of-trees-in-nashik/articleshow/88284691.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Lucknow||Kashi Dham: A Tale of Change & Transformation||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the ethereal Kashi Vishwanath Dham, he marked the end of thousands of years of cruelty the temple was subjected to by the Mughals. Kashi Vishwanath Dham is more than a symbol. It is a tale of change and transformation and embodies India’s spiritual and cultural values. It is the start of a new era where Hindus will find their pride and faith rejuvenated as the temple now is directly visible and connected with the holy river Ganga. Kashi Vishwanath Dham offers Hindus a rare sense of continuity and rootedness. The temple was originally built by Maratha ruler Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore in 1780. In 1836, Maharaja Ranjit Singh built a golden umbrella for it but the temple was destroyed by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb who instead raised the Gyanvapi Mosque, which co-exists on an adjacent site. Kashi Vishwanath Dham is uniquely sacrosanct for Hindus as it consists of one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, also known as Jyotirlingams. Kashi Vishwanath temple has a seal or Lord Avimukteshwara dating back to 9-10 century BCE. It was discovered in the excavations at Raj Ghat. The temple is also mentioned in the Skanda Purana. The book by Chinese traveller Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang), who visited Varanasi in 635 CE, also mentions it. Prime Minister Modi has with his radical vision infused new life in the oldest living city by reinventing the Kashi Vishwanath Dham. Meanwhile, chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘Reform, Perform and Transform’ mantra has truly decongested and transformed the temple complex. The Dham is being developed on a 50,200 square metre area at a cost of Rs 339 crore. In the grand Anand Van, 24 buildings such as security centre, museum, facilitation centre, gallery and mumukshu bhawan are being constructed. Baba Vishwanath will now have a wonderful view of the Ganga from the viewing gallery of Mandir Chowk. The Dham will bring devotees to the fold through wall art and inscriptions about the history of the temple. Furthermore, there will be an emporium on the first floor of Mandir Chowk and shops of handicraft and souvenirs in sync with ‘go vocal for local’ clarion call of the Prime Minister. The second floor of the building houses the offices of the temple trust employees and their board rooms. Already lakhs of devotees from across the country and globally visit the cultural hotspot of Varanasi. Now, with Kashi Vishwanath Dham, the tourist influx will further increase in both Varanasi and at the Buddhist pilgrimage site of Sarnath. The Dham is a perfect example of juxtaposition of both modern and traditional architecture. To retain the heritage look of Mandir Chowk, pink stone of Baleshwar in Rajasthan has been installed on the walls. These will help the temperature inside the temple to be at optimum. Previously, older citizens like me had to face a lot of inconvenience in reaching the temple as we had to traverse through a difficult and congested route. Now I can easily reach the temple without any difficulty or inconvenience. More than 50,000 people can visit the temple after a holy bath in the Ganga. Furthermore, for the convenience of the elderly and disabled, there are elevators. People of Kashi will imbibe the three resolutions given by PM Modi: creation, cleanliness and constant efforts towards self-reliant (atmanirbhar) India. In addition to its role as a place of worship, the Dham will be a valuable resource for the whole community. Just how Vishwanath or Vishweshwara means the ‘lord of the universe’ or the ‘keeper of the universe’, similarly PM Modi and CM Yogi are the ‘keepers of people’s faith’.

Of the seven, one person — a 37-year-old man with travel history to Tanzania — has been discharged after testing negative for the viral infection, doctors at Lok Nayak hospital said. Lok Nayak has been designated as a facility for isolation and treatment of Covid patients with history to travel to nations at risk for Omicron variant. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of the hospital, also confirmed the development. “We now have six Omicron patients admitted in the hospital. All of them are in stable condition,” he said. According to sources, the four new Omicron cases include a person with travel history to South Africa. Three others are contacts of people who tested positive for Omicron earlier, said a source. One of them had travelled to Rajasthan recently, she added. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said that the Omicron variant had not spread in the community so far and the situation was under control. “So far, 74 travellers have been sent from the airport to the hospital, where a special ward has been set up for isolating and treating suspected cases of Omicron. Thirty-six of them have been discharged and 38 are admitted to the hospital,” he added. In the last 13 days, Delhi has recorded an average of over 60 Covid-19 cases daily. This is the highest in the last four months. In August, September, October and November, Delhi recorded an average of 48,37, 32 and 35 cases daily respectively. The number of active cases in the city, data shows, has also increased significantly, from 348 active cases in October-end to 407 on December 14. “Till about a month ago, we weren’t getting any Covid cases. Now, for the past few days, I am getting one to two requests for consultation from patients suffering from the viral infection daily,” Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine at Max hospital, said. He added that it would be too early to blame the new variant for the increase in cases, but precautionary measures must be stepped up. “Most of the Covid patients I am seeing now are fully vaccinated. But they are still getting the infection. Thankfully, they have mild symptoms,” Dr Tickoo explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/focus-on-vax-as-omicron-threat-looms-large/articleshow/88286442.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Congress claims ‘moral victory’ in Khammam loss||HYDERABAD: Though the Congress lost the Khammam MLC seat, party leaders said cross voting took place with disgruntled TRS local representatives giving their preference vote to Congress candidate R Nageswara Rao. The Congress had only 98 votes on its side but polled 242 votes which meant that a large number of TRS local elected representatives could have given their vote to Nageswara Rao. The ruling party shifted its voters to a camp at an undisclosed location and brought them back only on the polling day on December 10 to avoid poaching. TRS candidate T Madhusudhan won the MLC seat with 482 votes followed by Nageswara Rao getting 242. Two independent candidates Kondapalli Srinivas Rao polled four votes while Kondru Sudha Rani scored a duck. “This is a moral victory for the Congress as the cross voting has reflected the growing discontent against the TRS government even among the local elected representatives of the ruling party,” said Nageswara Rao. The Congress leader said people should realise the true colours of the CPI and CPM which claim to be fighting against the TRS and the BJP governments in the state and at the Centre respectively. “While the CPI discreetly supported and its elected representatives voted for the ruling TRS, the CPM stayed away from polling which indirectly helped the TRS,” Nageswara Rao said. However, the talk in political circles is that while the CPI mainly supported the TRS, some of its local elected representatives in Wyra, Sathupalli, Kothagudem and Bhadradri voted in favour of the Congress as per ‘local understanding’. The CPM’s decision not to participate in the polling was being viewed as a strategy to indirectly help the TRS. The TDP had eight votes and most of it were polled by the Congress candidate.  Congress Khammam town president Mohammed Javed said that they were able to prevent poaching of Congress voters by the TRS and would have won had the party been allowed to meet and explain the failures of TRS government to the elected representatives of the ruling party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/congress-claims-moral-victory-in-khammam-loss/articleshow/88285587.cms||Roushan Ali

Students who were appearing for the special examinations that commenced last week were inconvenienced due to the clash with other examinations, and the students had requested MU to make necessary changes in the special examination time-table. P L Dharma, registrar evaluation, said that principals had complained that there were students appearing for special examinations, where some of them had two exams scheduled on the same day. “For those who have been inconvenienced, we will conduct examinations after December 23. Meanwhile, special examinations for sixth semester students will be held from January,” said Dharma. Dharma blamed college principals for the confusion and said, “Before finalising the exam time-table, we had sent a draft to all college principals to check if there are any changes to be made. When we received no response, it was automatically considered that the time-table is good to go. We went ahead with the exams, but they flagged issues after the examination commenced.” 33 colleges report error in results: VC Yadapadithaya Mangalore University vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya said that a total of 33 colleges have reported error in results announced recently. “Currently, the examination department is cross-checking each result of these colleges, to rectify them,” he said. Meanwhile, a committee that is constituted to look into examination result errors will table its findings during the syndicate meeting scheduled on December 20. “The decision on in-house software will be taken after the meeting,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/clash-in-schedule-mu-to-hold-separate-exams/articleshow/88284696.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Pune||Activists point fingers at neglect of Covid centre||Pimpri Chinchwad: Activists here have drawn attention to the alleged neglect of medical equipment at the closed Gharkul Covid care centre (CCC), which had provided healthcare to Covid positive patients for over 18 months. The Gharkul Covid care centre had been shut due to significant drop in patients. There are several medical equipment lying at the centre without any security cover. Activist Maruti Bhapkar said that the medical equipment could prove useful for the civic body’s hospitals and should be immediately transferred to them and the security at the centre tightened. “It is the civic body’s duty to take care of the Gharkul Covid care centres, which do not have any patients now. They need to make sure that the medical equipment across other major medical facilities, such as jumbo units and auto clusters, are safe as well,” he said, adding that the civic body needs to upgrade its hospitals with the equipment, which could prove useful in day-to-day medical operations. Additional commissioner Vikas Dhakane said that the equipment would be taken care of and a final call taken on the Gharkul Covid care centre’s future. “We are going to lodge a police complaint if incidents of possible theft or trespassing are observed. We have asked the authorities to visit the place and take appropriate action,” he said. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that two units were operational across Chkihali-based Gharkul CCC. The complaint pertains to one of the closed units. “We will look into it. I have asked for a report on the current situation at the said place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-point-fingers-at-neglect-of-covid-centre/articleshow/88285603.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||BJP’s plan to support independent backfired||Hyderabad: After tasting success in the Dubbak, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and Huzurabad polls, the BJP suffered a loss in the Karimnagar MLC elections for local bodies. The party backed independent candidate Ravinder Singh at the last minute. Though defeat in the election was predicted due to a lack of numbers, the party’s top brass said they will review their choice to back Singh at the last minute. Despite receiving 232 votes on second priority votes, including those from the BJP and the Congress, independent candidate Ravinder Singh was unable to win cross votes from TRS on first priority. According to sources, the party was split on whether to endorse him or not, but at the last minute urged the elected representatives to vote for him. The outcome may have no immediate political impact on the party, but it will undoubtedly revisit the party’s future political equations. Much of the onus comes on former health minister and Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender who initiated the move and some people supported him. “This will be analysed at the national level as well. Many in the party believe that the BJP should have fully abstained from the poll, even if just indirectly,” a party leader told TOI. Many members of the party also felt that backing the same candidate as the Congress sent a wrong message, given that the BJP has already established itself as the main opposition to the ruling TRS and has big hopes for the next assembly election. The party even held camps at the last minute, but only a few of the elected representatives crossed over to the TRS camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjps-plan-to-support-independent-backfired/articleshow/88285602.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||Over 2.4 crore doses given as Delhi races to bring all in vaccination net||New Delhi: Amid growing concerns over Omicron, Covid vaccination is going on at full steam in the capital. A total of 2.44 crore vaccine doses have been administered in Delhi so far. These include 1.45 crore first doses and 98.8 lakh second shots. Over 1.5 crore people are eligible for Covid vaccination in the capital. Delhi government has said that it is prepared for tackling any situation in the wake of the Omicron threat and, as part of the preparations, it has put stress on increasing the vaccination coverage. The share of male beneficiaries is higher than females in the Covid vaccination drive. An age-wise analysis shows that 1.6 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the 18-44 age group, 54.5 lakh doses in the 45-60 age group and 26.2 lakh doses among people who are 60 years old or above. An official said that the government had enough vaccines available and 1509 sites – 1,379 government and 130 private – were inoculating people. “The vaccination is going on in full throttle and, every day, over 1 lakh vaccine doses are being administered across all sites,” an official stated. Data on total district-wise population eligible for vaccine is not available, but highest number of doses — 28,76,009 — have been administered in North West and the lowest — 16,93,837 — in the Shahdara district. As many as 28,45,801 doses have been administered in South West, 26,33,143 in West, 23,76,400 in South East, 22,07,093 in South, 22,01,579 in North, 21,59,286 in Central, 19,42,657 in East, 17,40,706 in New Delhi and 1721427 doses have been given in North East district. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to all eligible people to get vaccinated at the earliest and those whose second doses are due to get them on time. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority has asked the district authorities to increase the coverage by reaching out to the unvaccinated and those who have not yet taken their second dose. A district official said one of the reasons behind a lower second dose coverage was that many people who had taken the first dose didn’t turn up for the second. “It was largely due to ignorance and because some people, especially those less aware, did not turn up to get the second dose. A large number of eligible people have not come to get the jab due to unknown reasons,” said an official. Different districts have conducted special vaccination drives for homeless people, the differently abled, those staying in old age homes, etc. In the wake of the fresh Covid concerns, different districts have started a survey to identify people who are not yet vaccinated. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority is considering a proposal to ban the entry of people who have not taken even the first dose of the Covid vaccine into Delhi Metro and buses, cinema halls, malls, religious places, restaurants, monuments, public parks, and government offices and other public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-2-4-crore-doses-given-as-delhi-races-to-bring-all-in-vaccination-net/articleshow/88286447.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Residents slam move to convert EB connection into commercial||COIMBATORE: The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has started issuing notices to the office-bearers of resident welfare associations, asking them to convert the domestic electricity connection that is used for common facilities into commercial connection. The move comes after Tangedco officials found that the residential flats/apartments were using electricity lines meant for domestic purposes for reserve osmosis water treatment, fire hydrant system and sewage water treatment plants during their recent round of inspections. There are around 100 flats/apartments in the district, housing thousands of families. Converting the electricity connection into commercial category would hurt them financially. Representatives of apartments said as per the new plan they would be charged commercial tariff for common facilities other than water pumps and lifts. “It was only recently that Tangedco had brought common facilities such as libraries, amphitheatres and sports facilities under the commercial connection.” Office-bearers of resident welfare associations said they would have to invest anywhere between Rs50,000 and Rs3 lakh to get a new connection and change the existing wiring. Individuals residing in an apartment would have to spend an additional Rs50-Rs100. K Senthil Kumar, secretary, Federation of Coimbatore Apartments Association, said it was the duty of the local bodies to take care of sewage water and provide potable water. “Apartments have shared the responsibility with the local bodies by installing the facilities, but now they are forced to pay for the same. There are around 70 apartments with our federation, which was created recently to address their woes. We have advised our members to raise their objection.” He said they were planning to take up the issue with the state government. “We are also preparing to present our grievances before the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulation Commission (TNERC).” K Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said there was no logic in converting the common facilities at the residential flats under the commercial tariff, as commercial activities were not taking place there. “It may not be a problem for the new apartments. But residents are facing difficulties every time common facilities are converted into commercial tariff. TNERC should intervene and direct Tangedco not to enforce the new rules. It can be put on hold until the next tariff order is finalized.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/residents-slam-move-to-convert-eb-connection-into-commercial/articleshow/88286443.cms||V Devanathan

The special drive titled Operation Trojan has been launched by Deputy Inspector General of Thiruvananthapuram, K Sanjaykumar Gurudin. The special drive has mainly two objectives – action against anti-social elements and action against drug peddlers. As part of action against anti-social elements, all police personnel at local stations are directed to update the database with the present contact details and latest photos of habitual offenders. Their present activity, source of income, details regarding their close associates and even family and the vehicles they use have to be collected. Lists on goondas, history-sheeters, accused in bodily offenses and warrantees have to be prepared and updated. Steps must be taken to execute arrest warrants. Similar steps have to be followed in action against drug peddlers too. Details of known drug peddlers have to be updated with jurisdiction of each police station. Special check posts should be placed at all inter-state and inter-district border points and checking of vehicles must be intensified to detect contraband substances, including drugs, arms and currency. District Anti-Narcotics Special Action Force (DANSAF) are directed to conduct surprise checking of long distance transport vehicles, especially buses coming from Idukki, Coimbatore, Goa, Odisha etc. All station house officers, deputy superintendents and even district police chief are directed to submit daily reports before the DIG before 10 am along with all the details .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/operation-trojan-to-check-criminal-activities/articleshow/88285647.cms||---

Responding to the charges by Alok Kumar Verma, the KRDCL MD said that Systra, the consultant for SilerLine project, has not given any preliminary feasibility report as is being claimed by the former railways official. “Several lines, including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad, Delhi-Meerut, Delhi-Varanasi, Chennai-Mysore, etc, are being envisaged as standard gauge projects. It was because trains at this speed cannot be operated on broad gauges,” he said. He added that Verma was part of Systra only for the initial few months, and he had recommended an alignment through the coastal area. “It was found that the coastal route would hit CRZ issues, and a larger population would be affected,” said Ajith Kumar. He said that the project is being envisaged as a futuristic one, and it is not the coastal areas, but the mid-lands that are being developed. “We finally decided to follow an alignment that was suggested by DMRC. The decision was taken on the basis of extensive deliberations,” he said. Regarding the allegations that no proper survey has been undertaken, Ajith Kumar said that the survey was conducted as a Lidar survey, spread over a period of one-and-a-half years. “The survey method that we followed would give an accuracy up to 5cm,” he said. He said that the feasibility report of the project is the final outcome of internal discussions and several communications between the consultant Systra and KRDCL, that could have discussed multiple options.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/trains-cant-run-over-160kmph-on-broad-gauge-k-rail-md/articleshow/88286453.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Pune||Major festival organisers weigh options as capacity restrictions remain||Pune: Major outdoor festival organisers in the city are assessing the prevailing capacity restrictions due to the pandemic as some mull postponement while others plan to go ahead with necessary curbs in place. The local administration has retained a 25% cap on audience in outdoor settings, which, organisers said, does not augur well in terms of logistics or the importance of the festival. The Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal, which organises the Sawai Gandharv Bhimsen Mahotsav, said they would decide on holding the festival, in the birth centenary year of Bhimsen Joshi, based on the ease of restrictions. “It does not appear to be possible in the current situation as the state government has permitted on-ground programmes with 25% capacity. If this is increased to at least 50%, then we can think of organising this iconic festival. Considering the overall nature of the Sawai Gandharv Bhimsen Mahotsav, a lot of time is required for creating the required infrastructure, checking the availability of artists, and planning their travel plans,” said Shrinivas Joshi, executive president, Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal. Organisers of other classical music events said that they plan to go ahead, despite restrictions, due to the importance of in-person events to Indian classical music. “Last year, we waited for the restrictions to be ease, however, they have still remained, and now the new variant has also come. Both musicians and listeners are missing out on a crucial aspect of Indian classical music, which involves two-way communication,” said Rajas Upadhye, a violinist and organiser of Swara Jhankaar, and co-organiser of Vasantotsav,” Upadhye said. The current restrictions are certainly not comfortable for us, but we plan to go ahead with the events in January because 25% is better than nothing. We are trying to figure out the best utilisation of facilities, and we might go for a bigger venue,” Organisers of the multi-city NH7 Weekender festival are also planning stripped-down versions of their upcoming events. At each of their three-city stop tour, including Pune, the organisers plan to feature Indian artists over a two-day programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/major-festival-organisers-weigh-options-as-capacity-restrictions-remain/articleshow/88285640.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The civic body has sent his samples for genome sequencing to the Pune-based NIV lab to check if it is a case of Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. The civic officials said that a three-member team from Mali had reached Nashik city on Sunday for some official work and was put up in a hotel. The NMC team had collected the swab samples of the trio on Monday and one of them eventually tested positive for Covid. NMC officials said the patient is asymptomatic and has been admitted to the Bytco Hospital. “We are expecting the reports of the genome sequencing in the next four-five days. The other two foreign nationals have tested negative and they have been quarantined at the same hotel for seven days,” the civic officials said. Officials said they found around 12 hotel staff as high risk contacts as they had came in contact with the traveller who has tested Covid positive. Their swab samples have been sent to the NMC-managed RT-PCR lab at the new Bytco hospital in the city. All the 12 hotel staff have been isolated at their homes until the receipt of their report. Their RT-PCR reports are expected by Wednesday evening. So far, 776 international travellers have come to Nashik city during the last few days. The Nashik Municipal Corporation is receiving the list of international travellers from the state government. NMC had sent swab samples of 253 and 252 of them had been tested negative for Covid.

Police resorted to use of water cannons to disperse the protesters after they tried to break the police barricades. Some Youth Congress workers complained of getting injured in the water cannon and sought medical treatment. The protesters later blockaded the road, following which they were arrested and removed. They had taken out a protest march from the DCC office to the varsity but were blocked by the police near the main gate. The face-off between the police and protesters took place when the latter tried to dismantle the police barricades. DCC president Martin George inaugurated the march. Youth Congress district president Sudeep James, state vice-president Rijil Makkutty among others led the march. Meanwhile, the syndicate meeting of the varsity held in the afternoon did not take up the matter of Priya Varghese, wife of K K Ragesh, who is the private secretary of the CM, figuring in the rank list for associate professor in Malayalam department. The syndicate meeting on Tuesday approved the rank lists prepared for faculty appointments to Chemistry, Hindi, History and Physical Education departments. It is learnt that the varsity is going slow on approving the rank list for Malayalam assistant professor appointment as the matter has sparked off a big controversy. The varsity had sought legal opinion if Priya met the eligibility criteria for appointment as there was lack of clarity on whether the period in which she conducted research for her PhD under the faculty development programme (FDP) could be counted as duty or leave. The varsity has prepared a rank list after interviewing six shortlisted candidates, including Priya. The Save University Campaign Committee had alleged that Priya lacked the minimum eligibility for the post of associate professor that requires a research degree with eight years’ experience at the assistant professor level. UDF had earlier slammed the reappointment of Ravindran as vice-chancellor saying that it has been made in violation of the university norms which has fixed 60 years as maximum age for appointment as vice-chancellor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/youth-cong-protests-at-kannur-univ/articleshow/88285727.cms||---

The five hung onto hope for rescue breathing in around one foot of space between the bridge on National Highway 48, while water gushed down with high pressure. Water was released in the canal on Monday and it was down flowing with high pressure. The car got swept away in the rapid flow but luckily stuck below the bridge. Around a 150-metre portion of the canal is under the bridge and the car went almost 10 metres into the narrow space from one end of the canal. In a dramatic rescue operation, the stranded family was rescued by a team of Surat Fire and Emergency Services (SFES) along with the help of the police. Those rescued included Azim Khan (50), Sumaiya (42), Swetha (21), Aaliya (21) and Fahima (18), all residents of Silvassa in Union Territory of Diu-Daman-Dadra and Nagar Haveli who said they were returning home from Ankleshwar. Khan said he was driving the car on a service road near old Kadodara police chowki when the accident took place. “The car fell into the canal waters possibly after the driver lost control,” fire officer, SFES, Jagdish Patel told TOI. “They could not come out of the car as the doors were not opening. However, the front glass somehow broke and the family members could manage to wriggle out as water started pouring into the car. The car drowned within seconds,” said a SFES officer part of the rescue operation. After coming out of the car, the five clung on to the chassis shouting for help amid the crashing sound of water. “Their screams, however, got lost in the loud voices of vehicles passing on the highway. They then sent a WhatsApp message from the only one working mobile phone they had to a relative in Silvassa,” the officer added. However, the message was not answered and the trapped people then made a WhatsApp call as normal calls weren’t going through, the officer informed. Thankfully, the relative answered the call and immediately asked a person known to him in Surat city to arrange for help. The relative also reached Kadodara and informed cops in a nearby chowki who reached the spot and contacted SFES. “Initially police and some locals tried to enter into the water but as the flow of water was heavy and we did not have any specialized equipment with us, we could not do much,” said a GRD jawan. “The relatives of the family from Silvassa too reached the spot amid the rescue operation and based on that calculation we could estimate that the family must have stayed stuck under the bridge amid the thrashing water for nearly two hours,” the SFES officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/miraculous-escape-for-five-of-a-family-swept-away-in-canal/articleshow/88285482.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Mangaluru||3 years after Suvarna Thribhuja tragedy, kin await status of crew||Udupi: Three years after the Suvarna Thribhuja tragedy, the families of the victims are still awaiting an official confirmation regarding the status of their kin, who were on board the ill-fated fishing boat that went missing on December 15, 2018. They say that they were officially not informed whether their relatives who were on the boat have died or are missing. The Suvarna Thribhuja left on a fishing expedition with a crew of seven, including its owner, on December 13, 2018, from Malpe fisheries harbour, and was reported missing off the Goa coast under inexplicable circumstances. The fishermen who went missing include Chandrashekar Kotian, boat owner, Damodhar Salian, Laxman Harikanth, Ravi, Satish, Ramesh and Harish. The Indian Navy, in a tweet on May 2, 2019, had announced that INS Nireekshak had found the wreck of the fishing boat, 33 km west-south-west off the coast of Malvan in Maharashtra, on May 1, 2019. “The wreck was found through side scan sonar operations and confirmed today by naval divers undertaking saturation diving at a depth of 60 metres,” the tweet added. Ganesh Kotian, brother of Chandrashekar Kotian, told TOI that the families of the crew are still awaiting an official confirmation about the status of their kin. “Then defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman has helped the families, and we are hopeful that the central government provides more details of the tragedy. The spot of the fishing boat was identified, and video footage was also taken, but details were not disclosed to us. We have not received any document to believe that the seven crew have died or are missing. Adequate ex gratia has not been paid,” Ganesh said. The state government had given ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh to each to the next of kin of the seven fishermen on board the ill-fated fishing vessel, in November 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/3-years-after-suvarna-thribhuja-tragedy-kin-await-status-of-crew/articleshow/88284750.cms||---

The civic body will start three more such centres at Indira Gandhi, Zakir Hussain and Swami Samarth hospitals within the next few days. The civic body officials said that the objective is to complete the vaccination of all the beneficiaries, including the first and the second dose. “Our other vaccination centres are operational between 9am and 5pm on all days except Sunday. There is a section of people who work during the day and are unable to get vaccines due to the time restrictions. Hence, we have decided to start a 24x7 vaccination centre so that the people who are working during the day will be able to take vaccines during the night hours,” said NMC officials. On the very first day, three beneficiaries availed the facility at night. The NMC health department has appealed to the beneficiaries to avail the facility if they are unable to get vaccinated during the day. So far, three types of vaccines - Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V were available in the district. Now, Nashik is in the process of getting a fourth vaccine ZyCoV-D, which will be a needle-free vaccine. The civic body is expecting to get the vials of these vaccines within a week. This vaccine is to be administered to the beneficiaries above 18 years, who are yet to take even a first dose of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/24x7-vax-begins-at-new-bytco-hospital/articleshow/88284746.cms||Tushar Pawar

These students will be awarded the medals in the convocation. MD anesthesiology student Dr Akanksha Jain, who has won the Thakur Das Bhatia memorial gold medal for best performance in the course, went through mental as well as physical trauma in 2020. “My mother was diagnosed with cancer in March 2020. And after six months, I met with an accident while performing duty in the ICU and my knee ligaments ruptured,” recalled Dr Akanksha. “The injury was serious, and so I was bedridden for two months, but I continued my studies and learning. I used to study and then discussed topics with my friends, and found the discussions helped me a lot,” she added. Saharanpur resident Dr Arunima Saini, who will receive MD Postgraduates gold medal for best MD student in community medicine on convocation day, comes from rural background and had to face resistance for stepping out to study medicine after Class XII. “People in the village said to my parents: ‘Ladki hai, shaadi karke chali jayegi, kya karoge padha kar, doctor bana kar’ (She is a girl and will go away after getting married. You will gain nothing from her studies and by making her a doctor), but luckily, my father was firm on sending me to study for my MBBS,” she recalled. Later, the same people cheered for her when she went back to her village after becoming a doctor. “There were tears of happiness in the eyes of my father,” Dr Arunima reminisced. Later, Dr Arunima joined KGMU for MD in community medicine and will complete the course with the best student tag. “One should always be focused on a goal and should not postpone, or delay the set targets. I followed this dictum in my studies and have been successful. My father will be proud to see me getting a gold medal from heaven, as he passed away a few months ago,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmus-gold-winners-bask-in-sunshine-of-focus-resolve/articleshow/88286951.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Delhi||Experts looking into necessity of a booster dose, Centre tells Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday told the Delhi High Court that top experts are studying the necessity of a booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, but the current priority is to ensure full vaccination of the whole population. In a reply filed in court, it said that two expert bodies are examining scientific evidence related to dose schedule of Covid-19 vaccines as well as the need and justification of booster doses. A call is yet to be taken as the complete biological characteristics of the infectious disease are yet unknown. The Centre’s stand comes at a time when there is a raging debate on the need for a booster dose amid the latest Omicron variant of coronavirus. Giving details in the affidavit, the government said the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-l9 (NEGVAC) and the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) provide overall guidance and recommendations on all aspects of Covid vaccination to the ministry of health and family welfare. "The NTAGI and NEGVAC are deliberating upon and considering scientific evidence related to the dose schedule of Covid vaccines as well as the need and justification of booster doses. The current knowledge about duration of immunity offered by Covid vaccines in India is limited and will clearly be known over a period of time only," the affidavit said. The court had on November 25 asked Centre to file an affidavit on the aspects relating to the booster dose, and the timeline within which the same is proposed to be rolled out. Stressing upon the efficacy of booster dose for those who have been fully vaccinated, the bench noted that the medical view indicates a fall of immunity against the disease after some time. This creates the need for a booster dose for people, particularly the elderly and those suffering from other diseases, it had noted. “The current priority of the National Covid-19 Vaccination Program is to cover the entire eligible population with full vaccination (that is, two doses) and, at present, there are no guidelines regarding administration of booster doses from the two expert bodies,” the government added, in its response. The court had also sought to know the timeline within which the same is proposed to be rolled out on the Aarogya Setu application, if it is considered necessary. It is hearing various issues relating to the Covid crisis in the capital since the time of the second wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/experts-looking-into-necessity-of-a-booster-dose/articleshow/88286457.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Delhi||Delhi: Planning a getaway to usher in New Year? You may be too late||NEW DELHI: If you can find a room in any destination for the annual festive break that is a short drive or an airport’s hop from Delhi, count yourself lucky. Much of everything in sight has been booked, say industry insiders. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus hasn’t dampened spirits and as the Christmas and New Year breaks approach, the hospitality sector is bracing for literally a capital rush. Ankush Nijhawan, co-founder, Travel Boutique Online, said safari destinations, national parks, forts, havelis, homestays and hotel rooms were rapidly being taken by visitors. Daniel D’Souza, president & country head, SOTC Travel, added that with domestic tourism seeing a threefold hike in demand than in the winter of 2020, nearby drivable locations like Dehradun, Mussoorie, Shimla, Rishikesh, Neemrana, Lansdowne, Kasauli, and Nainital are in for a windfall. And while beach destinations in Kerala, Andamans and Goa are a perennial favourite, there are many keen to explore offbeat places, pointed out D’Souza. He counted among these the living root bridges and canoeing on the Dawki Lake in Meghalaya, white water rafting on the Subansiri of Arunachal Pradesh, rock climbing in the Satpura range and skiing, snowboarding, ski mountaineering, ice hockey, and ice skating in Auli and Gulmarg. Ritu Mehrotra, regional manager, Booking.com, said that based on bookings for December 15-31, the top trending domestic destinations include leisure destinations like Goa, Manali, Jaipur, Udaipur, Pondicherry and Shimla. Health and security, flexibility in cancellation and attractive prices were key considerations for travellers. Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are seeing the demand peak. Syed Junaid Altaf, managing director, Skyview by Empyrean at Patnitop, said, “We have already managed 50% occupancy in the first month of launching luxury stays and are looking at 70-80% with footfall of over 400 per day.” Nazir Rah, managing director, Rah Hotels & Resorts, J&K, too reported, "The winter and spring tourist season looks promising in Kashmir. We have sold out the last week of December, with tourists keen to experience the snow and the Christmas and New Year periods.” Vinit Chhabra of The Khyber Himalayan Resort & Spa, Gulmarg, added, “The winter break is looking fabulous and we are almost sold out till March 2022.” Country Inn Hotels & Resorts in Bhimtal and Corbett National Park are popular with Delhi residents looking at fresh air and quietude. “Delhi-NCR has always been the key market for us and we have seen a spike in queries for the upcoming dates,” said Akhil Arora, COO, Espire Hospitality, which runs the properties. Vibhas Prasad, director, Leisure Group of Hotels, which has several establishments across Uttarakhand, affirmed the big demand for the New Year week. While Rajasthan remains a popular drive holiday, hotels chains said vacationers his year were demanding new experiences. Abhishek Sharma, general manager, Raffles Udaipur, said bespoke experiences such as dinner in the open overlooking the Aravalis was in high demand. Siddharth Yadav, vice-president, MRS Group of Hotels, added to this experiences such as Himalayan lunch and Lama’s walk at Mary Budden Estate in Uttarakhand, stunning White Nights of Rajputana at Narendra Bhawan, Bikaner and Dinner on the Dunes and Silk Route Exploration offered by Suryagarh Jaisalmer. The desire for limited interaction has also facilitated The Postcard Hotels’ properties, specially at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat and Netravali in Goa, being heavily booked, Akanksha Lamba, vice-president, operations, said, “The pull of the majestic Asiatic lion and the cultural experience of Gir and lure of the hidden ecosystem of Goa appear perfect attractions for those looking to escape from their busy city lives.” At ITC Hotels, while the beaches are the hotspots for winter vacations, CEO Anil Chadha said the hills are the flavour of the season. The group’s Welcomhotels in Shimla, Chail and Mussoorie are logging good numbers, while the Katra property is also a big draw. For the more circumspect Delhiites, checking into a city hotel is a big trend this year. “Our restaurants are being booked to capacity. With expatriate master chefs for Italian, Asian and Indian cuisine and with our mixologists, we are prepared to give our guests a superlative experience during the festive break,” assured Nitesh Gandhi, general manager, JW Marriott New Delhi. Meanwhile, Rajeev Kale of Thomas Cook (India) said the average duration of breaks is 7-15 days. He revealed a strong growth in demand for domestic cruises even at top rates between Rs 25,000 and Rs 1 lakh a night. Among international destinations, Kale said Dubai-Abu Dhabi remained favourites, with the former providing the added allure of Expo 2020 and its shopping festival. Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Egypt and Turkey are also popular while luxury travellers were considering winter experiences in Switzerland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/planning-a-getaway-to-usher-in-new-year-you-may-be-too-late/articleshow/88285672.cms||Amin Ali
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: BJP wins big in MLC polls, double whammy for MVA in Vidarbha||NAGPUR: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered its first major setback in Vidarbha since forming the government in Maharashtra in 2019. It lost both the Nagpur and Akola-Buldhana-Washim seats by crushing margins in the MLC local authority constituency biennial polls the results of which were announced on Tuesday. Earlier, the BJP had lost the graduates’ constituency and zilla parishad polls and bypolls to the three-party coalition of MVA. The BJP has won four out of six seats where elections were held on December 10. There were no polls for four seats after an unofficial pact between the rival factions. It included two seats in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) where BJP’s Rajhans Singh and Shiv Sen’s Sunil Shinde won. The Congress and BJP bagged one seat each at Kolhapur (minister of state Satej Patil) and Nandurbar-Dhule (Amrish Patel), respectively. Though it was an expected win for the saffron party’s Chandrashekhar Bawankule, in Akola-Buldhana-Washim constituency, it pulled a coup of sorts by defeating Shiv Sena’s Gopikishan Bajoria, a three-time MLC, by a margin of 109 votes even though MVA constituents had over 400 out of the 822 voters. As reported by TOI on December 12, Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) played a key role in ensuring BJP’s Vasant Khandelwal’s victory along with some independents. While Khandelwal secured 443 votes, Bajoria polled 334 out of the 808 valid votes. This means that the BJP bagged a big number of 157 votes from the other parties that probably included 86 of VBA, 77 independents and a few from MVA constituents – Sena, NCP and Congress. In Nagpur too, BJP received 44 votes from the three coalition partners and other parties in addition to its own tally of 318. The MVA backed independent Mangesh Deshmukh received 186 votes, while five were declared invalid. Former Congress candidate Ravindra Bhoyar, who was brought from the BJP, managed to get just one vote. On Friday, Bhoyar had told TOI that he toed the party line and voted for Deshmukh. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis hailed the twin victories of Bawankule and Khandewal stating that it was a ‘tight slap’ on the MVA partners’ faces. “Both these victories are special. It’s the result of the hard work of every karyakarta. With these victories by huge margins, once again, the BJP has proved its mettle in these MLC elections,” he tweeted. Fadnavis was in the city to greet Bawankule and joined party workers in the celebrations. “Political arithmetic does not mean MVA’s three parties coming together to secure victories. In fact, it’s the political chemistry which worked for us,” he told the media. Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole blamed BJP for “horse-trading” in the polls to secure wins. “They resorted to undemocratic tactics to win the polls which is their modus operandi. We, however, welcome the people’s mandate,” he said. Bawankule, a three-time MLA who was denied a ticket for the 2019 assembly polls, thanked the party’s central and state parliamentary boards for reposing the faith in him. “It is indeed a big victory and I thank party leaders and workers, who supported me throughout. Even in Akola, the Shiv Sena won since last three terms just because they had the support of BJP. Now, after withdrawing from the saffron alliance, the voters there taught a befitting lesson to them.” Denying speculations about him being upset over denial of ticket to him earlier, the former energy minister in Fadnavis cabinet added party had given him everything and never ditched him. “I was heading Vidarbha and Marathwada. For some reason, the party wanted me to work at the ground level and I obliged. No one is above party. Even if declined a ticket, the leaders should always follow party’s orders,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mlc-elections-double-whammy-for-mva-as-bjp-registers-crushing-wins/articleshow/88285659.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Agri scientists should make organic farming beneficial: Governor||Gandhinagar: Governor Acharya Devvrat on Tuesday called on agricultural scientists to work on inventions to make farming easier and help farmers turn to natural ways of cultivation. He said this while inaugurating a three-day pre-Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) event on agro and food processing at Anand Agricultural University on Tuesday. The event also witnessed the signing of MoUs proposing an investment of Rs 2,359 crore in the agriculture sector, including setting up of two ethanol plants with 650 kilo litre per day capacity as well as an agri-green e-commerce project. The governor said nature had been severely damaged due to the heavy use of chemicals in agriculture. “If we turn to organic farming, we will be able to protect nature and maintain good health. This is an urgent time to avoid the ill-effects of chemicals,” the governor was quoted as saying in an official release. Stressing that there was need for more research in the field of agriculture, he asked scientists for inventions that make farming easier and also help farmers turn to natural ways of cultivation. On the occasion, the governor and other dignitaries, including Union minister Parshottam Rupala, dedicated virtually an agriculture college in Porbandar, a fisheries college building in Navsari and launched a website on natural farming. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will virtually address the valedictory function of the event.

The junior doctors are to be paid a fixed monthly salary of Rs 63,000 which is inclusive of all entitlements, the notification says.Among others, 12 junior doctors were appointed in the paediatrics department and 16 in the anaesthesiology department at Civil Hospital on Tuesday. The resident doctors of Gujarat, who joined the recent nationwide protests over the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling, have been demanding medical officers to assist them till the new batch joins. NEET-PG exams for MD/MS admissions are usually held in January, but due to Covid they were conducted in September. While counselling was to commence on October 25, petitions challenging a central government notification has stalled the process. Senior resident doctors (final-year students from the 2018 batch) were relieved a few months ago. As a result, hospitals have been managing with only two batches, instead of three.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bj-medical-college-gets-157-junior-resident-docs/articleshow/88285674.cms||---

The criminals had beaten up the watchman, threatened him and stolen parts of bronze statues that were being made at the workshop. The dacoits had brought a truck along to take the statues. Apart from the Satpur police, the crime branch unit-1 personnel were also investigating the case. During the course of investigation, API Mahesh Kulkarni of the crime branch unit got information that the criminals involved were from Ambivali in Thane district.

---||Kochi||Poor upkeep takes the sheen off walkway in memory of People’s Prez||Kochi: The APJ Abdul Kalam Marg walkway along the Vembanad estuary was envisaged on the lines of the famous Mumbai’s promenade at Marine Drive. But today it has become a huge let down for Kochiites and tourists who visit the place, as authorities have failed to provide any basic amenities here.  Plastic waste is littered across the walkway and even choking the mangroves along the banks of the backwaters. The walkway was reopened 10 months ago after completing renovation works by the Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML) at a cost of Rs 7.1 crore. The land is owned by the Greater Cochin development authority (GCDA) and the nodal agency had handed over the land to CSML for renovation works and maintenance for a period of one year, but it has become an ill-maintained tourist destination.  Bottles are littered on the lawns, benches and under the trees. Plastic covers and food packets are clogging the mangroves as they are thrown into the lake by visitors without any compunction, partly because there are only a few garbage collection bins. The 750-m-long northern end of the stretch has only two waste bins and the result is plastic is thrown into the waterbody. Former Ernakulam district collector and founding chairman of GCDA Dr S Krishnakumar said that there should be a provision in the budget to maintain the assets of government organizations. “When we opened the walkway everybody lauded it. We maintained it properly. There was sufficient funds for the works. There should be sufficient provision for the maintenance of the project and should be evaluated properly. When the project is formulated, it should also include maintenance provisions and cost for it. Otherwise, the very purpose of the project will suffer,” he said.  With the onset of tourist season and with the scare of the Covid pandemic on the decline, there has been a huge rush to catch a glimpse of the beautiful sunset from the promenade, especially during the weekend. “Authorities have not even provided a toilet facility there which had been our demand. It is a shame that a spot that should have become the pride of Kochi is such a pathetic state,’’ says environmentalist Renjith Thampy who has been consistently taking up the issue of backwater pollution and lack of amenities in the walkway. Agrees P Thomas, who visits the walkway daily, points out that the waste bins kept here were inadequate. CSML officials said they have apprised the waste dumping issue with the Kochi corporation, but the latter was not taking any proactive measures. “We cannot ask the contractor to collect and manage the plastic waste as it is not coming under his purview. He has been asked to maintain the walkway. The corporation said they would collect waste from the walkway. CSML will procure 30 to 40 waste bins and install it there. For pruning the lawn, we will ask the contractor to do it. We will also install surveillance cameras in the walkway,” said the official. GCDA officials said they were planning to conduct a joint inspection in the walkway soon to chart out a solution. “Though GCDA is the custodian of the walkway, we have reached an agreement with CSML for renovation and maintenance for a period of one year. They should have done it now,’’ a GCDA official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/poor-upkeep-takes-the-sheen-off-walkway-in-memory-of-peoples-prez/articleshow/88284765.cms||T C Sreemol

Residents immediately informed the Coimbatore forest range frontline staff, who rushed to the spot and started a drive to chase away the elephant into the reserve forest. The wild tusker had been frequenting the area during the night hours. The elephant came out of the forest and crossed the Thadagam-Anaikatti road near Ragavendra Nagar. Subsequently, it entered the residential areas. Residents and motorists alerted the Coimbatore forest range officer R Arun Kumar. The frontline staff burst crackers to drive away the elephant towards the reserve forest. However, the elephant entered a maize field around 9.30 pm, according to the last report received before the paper was sent to press. Officials said that the wild elephant did not run away fearing crackers. More than 10 frontline staff were stationed in the locality to drive away the elephant.

The petitioner stated that he was married to a woman 15 years ago and has two children. He stated that his wife and children went missing from the house on November 1, and he had lodged a police complaint in this regard. Since their whereabouts were not known yet, he moved the HC Madurai bench seeking relief.However, the additional public prosecutor submitted that the pursuant to an earlier complaint of the petitioner in September, the police registered a community service register. Both the petitioner and his wife appeared before the inquiry officer. On inquiry it was found that the petitioner’s wife was not missing as alleged in the complaint. However, she had left to her maternal home due to difference of opinion between the couple.The petitioner as well as his wife had given a letter independently stating that they will work out the remedy through judicial process and will not disturb each other. However, by suppressing the facts about the earlier inquiry and the undertaking given before the police, the present petition is filed by making a false claim that his wife and children are missing.A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran observed that the conduct of the petitioner suppressing the earlier complaint and his undertaking to the police that he will not disturb his wife is deprecated. The present petition is filed with intention to disturb her with all falsehood and suppression of fact.The judges observed that the jurisdiction of habeas corpus is highly misused by miscreants like the petitioner and therefore, such conduct should be reprimanded by imposing exemplary cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-imposes-rs-25k-cost-on-petitioner-for-suppressing-facts/articleshow/88286462.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rectify answer key of physics question: NEET Hindi aspirants||Kota: Thousands of Hindi language aspirants of NEET, (UG)-2021 who are preparing in Kota for admission in medical colleges, have formed ‘NEET (UG) 2021 Hindi Madhyam Pariksharthi Sangarsh Morcha’ to raise their voice for rectification of Hindi version of a question in physics in the answer key released by National Testing Agency (NTA) that held the NEET (UG)–2021 examination on September 9, 2021. Around two lakh Hindi language aspirants of NEET (UG)-2021 have reportedly suffered due to faulty Hindi version of the question and some of them have missed their chance for admission in government medical college. The affected students carried out a protest on Monday at camp office of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla at Kota and demanded to rectify the answer to the question. Hindi medium students claimed that NEET (UG)-2021 paper carried a question in Physics from topic Alternating Current and alleged that Hindi translation of the question was done poorly that adversely affected the Hindi medium students with a setback of 5 marks which matter a lot when there is cut-throat competition at the national level. They claimed that English version of question on ‘Amplitude of current’ mentioned the amplitude of current in the question while the same was translated in Hindi only as ‘dhara (Current) and ‘amplitude’ was dropped in Hindi version of the question. Consequently, Hindi students were naturally prompted to solve it by considering the standard value as ‘root mean square (RMS) value of current’. The particular question is correct and perfect in both the mediums but has entirely different meanings as far as language of the question is concerned, claimed the faculties of Physics in Kota. Hundreds of affected students, immediately after the release of the OMR sheet, filed a complaint to NTA for correction in the answer key, but the agency did not entertain it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rectify-answer-key-of-physics-question-neet-hindi-aspirants/articleshow/88286470.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Muslim League turning highly communal: CM||Kochi: The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is turning highly communal and the party is ‘throwing’ its workers into the hands of extremist political groups, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan while speaking at the CPM Ernakulam district conference here on Tuesday. He said that Muslim League is known for its soft stand towards religious extremist groups and it has now gone to another level by joining hands with groups like the Jamaat-e-Islami. Vijayan said that the League even insults its senior leaders who oppose this stand. The party and its workers would realise their mistake soon. Vijayan said that the Congress, BJP and League have been facing various difficulties since the last elections. Since they are not able to gain the support of the people with their ‘anti-people’ policies, they are trying to bring in a communal angle to every issue. They together are trying to create communal polarization in the state. “The League is leaning toward communalism in a big way. This is part of their efforts to get the support of the people. The Sangh Parivar and Islamic extremists are trying to destroy the secular foundation of the state by creating communal divides. The new media have become a platform for this. The posts and videos on these platforms aim at communal polarization and creation of communal violence. The UDF is supporting these attempts by making secret alliance with communal organisation with the hope of making gains,” Vijayan said. The recent rally organised by the League and their stand on the Waqf board issues have taken the soft stand taken by the League towards religious extremist organisation to next level. They tied up with the Jamaat-e-Islami Popular Front of India for political gains during the polls. The Muslim League is now adopting the slogans and perspectives of Muslim extremists. When those people and leaders, who seek peace, oppose this, the League takes a strong stand against them. “The country has seen how Congress lost its leaders and workers when they tried to appease Hindutva politics. The League will face the same issue when they try to appease communalists and religious extremists,” Vijayan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/muslim-league-turning-highly-communal-cm/articleshow/88286489.cms||---
---||Goa||No Goan has paid attention to use of the term liberation: Mauzo||Panaji: “Ninety nine percent of Goans do not know the history or geography of Goa. Though we celebrate 60 years since Liberation, no Goan has paid attention to the reason behind the term ‘liberation’ which is used instead of calling it an independence,” Konkani novelist Damodar Mauzo said on Monday.  The 57th Jnanpith awardee was speaking at the Goa@60 philatelic event organised by the Goa division of posts. A permanent pictorial cancellation on the Reis Magos Fort and Tambdi Surla was released as part of the event. Mauzo said that one must visit Reis Magos fort in order to understand the struggle of freedom fighters. “To visualise the dark days that Goa’s freedom fighters have endured, one must visit the area on the ground floor where hot oil was poured on them, as a form of punishment. Goans must know what Goa is, else tourists will not know either. There must not be any wrong notions or visions of Goa. The youth must therefore preserve and promote Goa,” he said. He also stressed on the need for youth to visit historically significant locations of the state. Mauzo also recalled the significant role played by the postal department in his love life. In an era of sepia-toned photographs and technologically primitive communication, the postal service served as a medium for him to send love letters to his wife prior to their matrimony, he said. “I have a personal relationship with the postal department because I would use its service to mail love letters to my wife who was stationed outside Goa,” he said. Unfortunately though, the literary treasure trove was lost. “Soon after we were married, she packed her things to move to Goa. The bag that contained the letters was stolen on the train. We wouldn’t have minded if all other things were lost, but losing the letters was very unfortunate,” he said. Mauzo said that the postal department has not only played a significant role in accumulating valuable literature over the centuries, but also served the masses of the country by helping people communicate through letters, postcards and other philatelic material. “India Posts has the largest system in the world for this very reason. It is the only government department that is more like a non-governmental organisation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-goan-has-paid-attention-to-use-of-the-term-liberation-mauzo/articleshow/88286983.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Coimbatore||TNPCB closes three illegal coir pith units||Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) closed three more illegal coir pith manufacturing units at Thimmaguthu village near Pollachi on Tuesday. The units - SMT Coirs 1 &2 and Palaniappa Coco Peat - were overexploiting groundwater and discharging effluent in nearby waterbodies. They were also causing air pollution, affecting the people in nearby areas. P Manimaran, district environment engineer, TNPCB, said the closure order was issued to the units a few days ago based on an order by the principal bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which took suo moto cognisance of the violations by the units. Subsequently, electricity connection to the three units were disconnected. Manimaran said they had taken action against the units under Section 33A of the Water (Preservation and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. According to officials, there are roughly 2,000 coir pith manufacturing units in the district. Six of them have been closed for violations so far. And three of them were closed in September this year based on the order from the NGT southern bench. In September, the principal bench of the NGT had issued a direction to crack down on the coir units polluting the air and water. It also had directed the Central Pollution Control Board to recategorize only the units that were in the white category. TNPCB had subsequently brought the coir pith units under orange category from the white last month, to make them follow stricter pollution control norms. Industries are colour coded red, orange, green and white based on their pollution emission levels, with whit being the least polluting category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tnpcb-closes-three-illegal-coir-pith-units/articleshow/88286465.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The judges directed the CBI to conduct a free and fair investigation into this case and file a final report as early as possible, without any inordinate delay.The court passed the order while hearing a petition filed by I Mohamed Razvi, a resident of Ramanathapuram district. The petitioner stated that lakhs of candidates appeared for the TNPSC group IV exam conducted in September 2019. He stated that after the results were published, the TNPSC filed a complaint before the CB-CID director general of police on a suspicion that 99 candidates who had appeared from the exam centres at Rameswaram and Keelakarai in Ramanathapuram district had indulged in malpractice to clear the exam.He stated that based on the complaint preferred by the CB-CID, special teams had been formed and several people had been arrested. Since several officials were involved in this scam, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench in 2020, to transfer the investigation in this case to the CBI, to ensure a free and fair investigation.It maybe recalled that during the previous hearing, the CB-CID in the status report stated that the offence was committed by a few individuals in connivance with two TNPSC staff - a record clerk and a typist.Explaining the modus operandi, the CB-CID stated that the main accused had given special pens with vanishing ink to the candidates to fill the OMR sheets. The objective of using the special pen was that the answers marked with it would vanish in two to three hours enabling the accused and his team to fill the answers later.The malpractice took place when the papers were on transit from Ramanathapuram to Chennai in a van under the supervision of two TNPSC staff members and a policeman. A total of 118 people, including 98 candidates (one candidate died), two TNPSC staff members, the driver of the van and the main accused in his team were arrested in this case. Investigation revealed that no other TNPSC officials were involved in this offence, stated the CB-CID.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-cbi-probe-in-tnpsc-group-iv-exam-scam/articleshow/88286464.cms||---
---||Agra||SIT makes first arrest in girl’s suicide in Mainpuri school||AGRA: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has arrested Sushma Sagar, former principal of a residential school in Mainpuri, in connection with the death of a 16-year-old student, who was allegedly raped and found hanging in a prayer room of the school in 2019. Sagar was remanded in judicial custody on Monday. Three months ago, when the high court asked the state government and UP police for a progress report within a month, a new 6-member SIT was formed. The court also directed the director general of police DGP to closely monitor the progress of the investigation, so that “it may be taken to its logical conclusion.” The victim’s family had approached the high court in August last year, alleging “threats from those probing the case”. The family also alleged that “they were not informed of the girl’s death and came to know of it only when the school authorities took her body to hospital, where it was spotted by one of their relatives who then called her parents.” An FIR was registered against the then school principal Sushma Sagar, the hostel warden and a fellow student under sections 376 (rape) and 302 (murder) of IPC and under POCSO Act, based on a complaint of the family. The girl’s mother, a homemaker, said, “Days before her death, my daughter mentioned that she knew some secrets of her school. I hope the main accused will also be arrested soon.” The girl’s father said, “Even after an FIR was filed against the former principal and others, police did not take any action. The arrest was made only after the court intervened in the matter.” In the latest court hearing on December 2, the state government submitted the DNA analysis report of all the suspects, stating that none of them matched with the samples found on the girl’s body. The court adjourned the matter till December 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sit-makes-first-arrest-in-girls-suicide-in-mainpuri-school/articleshow/88284763.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

One was a 75-year-old man from Churu and the other was an 80-year-old woman in Rajsamand. The hospitals where they had undergone treatment said they were fully vaccinated. The health department is conducting genome sequencing for identifying the variant of Covid, which caused the two mortalities. “The 75-year-old was fully vaccinated but was suffering from comorbidities. He had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he had also developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and secondary bacterial infection leading to his organ failure,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital. Churu’s health department official said the 75-year-old had a travel history. “He had a travel history as he visited Kolkata recently,” said Dr Manoj Kumar Sharma, chief medical health officer, Churu. The 80-year-old woman in Rajsamand was admitted to the district hospital three days ago with bilateral pneumonia. She underwent treatment at the hospital but despite efforts by doctors, she died on Monday. “She was diagnosed with Covid in the morning and died in the evening. A day after her admission, we conducted Covid test, but she tested negative. Since the report was indicating repeat test, we did it again where she tested positive,” said Dr Lalit Purohit, principal medical officer, Rajsamand district hospital. Dr Purohit said, “The woman was fully vaccinated against covid-19 as she had received both the doses.” Rajsamand’s chief medical health officer Dr Prakash Sharma said, “We have sent the samples of her for genome sequencing to find out the variant due to which she died. The woman was undergoing treatment in the ICU of the district hospital but she died.” Since July 31, the state has reported four Covid deaths and out of those, two were reported on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/genome-sequencing-of-two-covid-casualties-to-be-done/articleshow/88286463.cms||---

This is the highest number for transport vehicles registered in a month in the last 20 months in the Ernakulam RTO limit. Despite a high number of non-transport vehicles continuing to register every month once the lockdown restrictions were eased after both the first and second waves, registration of transport vehicles continue to remain sluggish. It has not crossed registration of even 150 transport vehicles in a month after April last year. In March last year, 246 transport vehicles were registered. The motor vehicles officials said the Covid-induced financial crisis backpedalled the registration of transport vehicles. The registration of transport vehicles has not reached the pre-Covid level yet, though it shows uptick. “The sector is now showing signs of revival after Covid and it is reflected in the registration of vehicles too,” said a MVD official in Ernakulam RTO office. Most of the transport vehicles registered this year in the Ernakulam office were small goods carriers. As many as 916 goods carriers were registered this year in Ernakulam RTO limit so far, followed by motor cabs and autorickshaws. While experts in the field of economy feel that the service sector has not picked up yet. “The service sector is still in poor growth. It is yet to reach pre-Covid level. It was the service sector which was growing highly before the pandemic struck us last year. As per the recent data released by the RBI, our economy is growing. Going by economics, growth in the primary sector, which is agriculture, will push the tertiary sector as well in later stages,” said Dhanuraj of centre for public policy research. Meanwhile, registration of non-transport vehicles, including light motor vehicles and private ones, slowed down in the current quarter in Ernakulam. Ernakulam RTO has registered 2,030 non-transport vehicles in January this year. But it came down again with the onset of the second wave and took a U-turn by July. In September, 2,013 vehicles were registered in the non-transport category and it came down again in the next two months. Those in the field say chip shortage led to slow down in auto sales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/uptick-in-regn-of-transport-vehicles-in-ekm/articleshow/88284782.cms||T C Sreemol

The arrested persons are Ganesh, 24, Chethan Kumar, 21, Keerthiraj, 23, Suvith, 20, and Pareekshith, 21. All the arrested hail from Bondanthila village in Mangaluru taluk. Seven to eight persons had waylaid Mohammed Riyaz, 40, when he was driving and assaulted him with a cricket bat, iron rod and beer bottles. City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said the arrested five knew the victim. They had clashes between them in the past as well. Based on the complaint filed by Abdul Rehman, the younger brother of Riyaz, a case under various sections of the IPC was registered in Mangaluru rural police station. The police had recovered a pair of ladies’ footwear from Riyaz’s car after he was assaulted. Riyaz has cases registered against him in five different police stations, including three under the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act, said the commissioner.

---||Delhi||NO2 not in the safe limit for even a year since 2013: Study||New Delhi: The capital hasn't experienced a single year between 2013 and 2020 where the annual average concentration of toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was within the safe limits, a new study has found. Pointing out that November 2021 had also seen NO2 at alarmingly high levels, the study stated that despite nationwide lockdowns in 2020, Delhi's annual NO2 average for the year remained at 61 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic metres) against a limit of 10 ug/m3. A toxic and highly reactive gas, nitrogen oxides are formed when fuel is burned at high temperatures. Industries and automobiles, especially trucks, and various non-road vehicles like construction equipment and others, are responsible for NOx emissions. “Industrial sources of NOx are essentially fossil-fuel based power plants, incineration plants, waste water treatment facilities, glass and cement production facilities and oil refineries. It is not only during combustion processes that nitrogen oxides are released, but also when working with nitric acid. Agriculture is becoming increasingly relevant too as a NOx emission source,” the study stated. The study by NCAP Tracker, an air pollution policy tracking platform, analysed the trends for NO2 across India and found Delhi to be among three states — UP and Rajasthan being the others — breaching CPCB's safety limits. “An analysis of the monthly average NO2 levels for all 40 monitoring sites in Delhi maintained by the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System establishes that 25 locations out of a total of 40 had NO2 greater than 80 ug/m3 in November 2021 for days ranging from 1 to 30. Meanwhile, 18 locations breached the annual average limit of 40 ug/m3. The data was calculated from December 20202 to November 2021 (365 days),” the report stated. It specifically highlighted Anand Vihar, which had an average NO2 of 131 ug/m3 in November this year. Other locations that recorded November averages for NO2 levels in triple digits in the capital were Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range (133 ug/m3), East Arjun Nagar (125), IGI Airport (111), Dilshad Garden (105), Jawaharlal Nehru University (109), Nehru Nagar (108) and Pusa Road (114). “NOx is showing an increasing trend in different cities of the country and, particularly, for Delhi-NCR, daily exceeding values for any particular period of time. The overall average levels in NCR indicate that NOx values are far greater than the annual safety limits prescribed by CPCB, leading to both short- and long-term exposure to people,” said prof S N Tripathi, civil engineering department, IIT Kanpur, and steering committee member, National Clean Air Programme, MoEFCC “NO2, as a gas, has not-so-serious effects on the health of the people, but its secondary effects through an increase in PM2.5 concentrations and augmentation of ozone formation are a matter of concern. The only way that NO2 levels can be controlled are by reduction at source, as fixation of NO2 in the air, along with SO2, is cause for acid rain,” said Dr Arun Sharma, director, National Institute for Implementation Research for Non-Communicable Diseases (an ICMR body).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no2-not-in-the-safe-limit-for-even-a-year-since-2013-study/articleshow/88285724.cms||---

The complainant stated that he is a social worker and used to send complaints to the higher officials against the erring politicians and police. On December 16, 2014, two people - Saravanan and Ganesan - had assaulted him and asked him not to send such complaints.He stated that when he went to the Teppakulam police station to file a complaint against them, the then inspector Mannavan and special sub-inspector Alagumuthu had refused to receive his complaint. So he sent a letter to the higher officials. When he was returning to his house, the officials took him to the station and assaulted him. They let him go on December 17.Denying the allegations, the police officials said that Saravanan had lodged a complaint stating that he was assaulted by Ravichandran and his associate Pookuliraja. Based on Saravanan’s complaint, a case was registered against them. They had arrested Pookuliraja on December 17, however Ravichandran had obtained anticipatory bail.SHRC member A Chittaranjan Mohandoss said that when Pookuliraja appeared before the commission, he stated that he was taken into custody and was assaulted by the police. He had also stated that subsequently, the police also brought Ravichandran to the police station and assaulted him.The commission said that it is clear from the statement of Pookuliraja, that he was detained and remanded without any substantial evidence. It is evident from the judicial magistrate’s remand order that Pookuliraja was injured in the assault. The magistrate had also recorded about the injuries in the remand order.The commission took note of the fact that the Madurai additional district and sessions court, in 2018, pronounced Ravichandran and Pookuliraja not guilty. Tthe commission recommended the government to pay Rs 50,000 to Ravichandran and Rs 1 lakh to Pookuliraja. After making the payment, the government shall recover Rs 75,000 each from Mannavan and Alagumuthu. The commission also recommended the state government to initiate disciplinary actions against Mannavan and Alagumuthu, in accordance with law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/police-excesses-pay-1-5-lakh-relief-to-two-shrc-tells-govt/articleshow/88286472.cms||---

Senior members of the association said they presented a memorandum at the district collectorate and said that the proposed amendment was illegal and unfair to advocates. Kailas Patil, the president of the Nashik District Notary Advocates Association, said there are about 300 notary advocates in the district and most of them have opposed the proposed amendment to the Act. He said as per the Notaries (Amendment) Bill, 2021, no application for renewal of certificate of practice of any notary shall be considered for more than two terms, which are of five years each, after the initial appointment of five years. The proposed amendment bill also emphasises on digitisation of notary work, said Patil. In the memorandum presented to senior officials of the district collectorate, the notary advocates have mentioned that if the amendment is passed, it will deliver a huge financial blow to the lawyers. They said if a lawyer’s notary certificate is cancelled at the age of 60, it will be difficult for the lawyer concerned to earn a living in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-notary-advocates-protest-against-proposed-amendment-to-act/articleshow/88284807.cms||---

We boycotted work in November and after assurance from the state government, we postponed our protest. We are now forced to give a call for an indefinite strike,” said Pradip Gangwar, president, KGMU Employees’ Council. Even employees deployed at emergency services at Trauma Centre and other departments could be stopped from working and that would cause major inconvenience to patients. There are roughly 9,000 staff at KGMU, including paramedics, technicians, nurses and the strike can hamper work at OPD, diagnostic facilities and even OTs. KGMU officials said they were trying to convince staff members not to go on strike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-staff-to-go-on-strike-from-friday/articleshow/88286962.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Rly postpones plan to operate Thiruchendur-Pollachi train||Coimbatore: The Southern Railway has postponed its decision to resume daily express train between Thiruchendur and Pollachi. The service was set to operate again from Wednesday. The decision was made on Monday, a week after Southern Railway announced that the express train, which was stopped after the Covid-19 outbreak, would resume. As soon as the railway made the announcement, rail users’ associations in Pollachi, Kinathukadavu, Coimbatore and Mettupalayam sent representations seeking extension of Tiruchendur to Pollachi train up to Mettupalayam via Coimbatore. While it could be one of the reasons to postpone the resumption of train service as changes need to be made in train timing and related logistics, a senior official with the Palakkad railway division said the exact reason for the postponement was yet to be communicated.  Pollachi Lok Sabha member K Shanmuga Sundaram had also made representation to Southern Railway general manager John Thomas last week seeking extension of the train service at least till Coimbatore. He had said there were no direct trains to Coimbatore from the southern districts in the Palani - Pollachi route. It will also help devotees from southern districts to visit Marudamalai, which is considered as one of the six abodes of lord Murugan. “While the train used to ply from Thiruchendur, which falls under Madurai division, to Pollachi in the Palakkad division, there are several factors including the timings, maintenance and the possible patronage that will be taken into consideration before operating a train service,” said the railway official. Earlier, there was a passenger train from Palakkad to Tiruchendur on the Pollachi-Palani-Madurai route. The railway had taken a policy decision not to operate long-distance passenger trains after the Covid pandemic. So, a passenger train was recently introduced from Palakkad to Pollachi and another train was to be operated between Pollachi - Tiruchendur as an express train.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rly-postpones-plan-to-operate-thiruchendur-pollachi-train/articleshow/88286474.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Madurai||YouTuber has same rights as journo: HC||Madurai: Quashing the FIR registered against YouTuber Maridhas for posting a controversial tweet, Madras high court observed that a YouTuber or any social media personality regularly commenting on public affairs would be entitled to the same rights accorded to journalists and the media under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees right to freedom of speech and expression.Justice G R Swaminathan said that according to petitioner Maridhas, the tragic demise of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and other officers in the chopper crash in Nilgiris on December 8 was greeted with glee by some. The petitioner identified them as those belonging to Dravidar Kazhagam and DMK. In his tweet, Maridhas raised a question as to whether Tamil Nadu under DMK rule was becoming another Kashmir.The judge observed that the petitioner’s tweet was never intended to subvert the government, but one which calls for strengthening its foundations. By no stretch of imagination can the petitioner be said to have harmed national interests. He had only drawn the government’s attention to certain nefarious tendencies brewing in the state. The judge observed that the petitioner wanted the security situation to be overhauled as there has been slackness and inaction on the part of those in charge of the government. Having merely vented out his anxiety, the tweet cannot be characterized as seditious.The judge observed that if, as alleged by the prosecution, the petitioner had the intent to cause breach of public peace, he would not have taken down the tweet in a couple of hours. It was only because of the complaint given by V Balakrishnan (DMK functionary) that the tweet garnered so much attention. In the present case, the petitioner appears to have made a naive tweet. Probably realizing it, he took it down. As to why the court entertained the petition at such an early stage, the judge said it is constitutionally bound to discharge its duty as laid down by Supreme Court when the petitioner has been deprived of his personal liberty. The judge said that none of the charges in the FIR stand against the petitioner in the present case. By registering the case and arresting the petitioner, the police had infringed upon his constitutionally guaranteed fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. During the course of hearing, additional advocate general Veera Kathiravan submitted that the petitioner has crossed legal boundaries and by the offending tweets he has clearly caused hatred towards a democratically elected government. Madurai city cyber crime police had registered a case and arrested Maridhas on December 9. He was booked under section 124 (A) (sedition) of IPC, Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of IPC, Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/youtuber-has-same-rights-as-journo-hc/articleshow/88286482.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Delhi||How Delhi's Dwarka Park is forcing animals onto roads||NEW DELHI: A grand plan to have an expanse of land in Dwarka turned into a park with eco-forest areas has ironically led to the dislocation of the area’s fauna. A recent video showed several Nilgai running desperately on the roads at Dwarka, leaving green activists aghast. Environment group Green Circle Dwarka had as far as in 2015 determined the area to be rich in biodiversity, recorded several species of animals there and even assisted in rejuvenating a water body there. It had been urging the local authorities to develop the expanse as an eco-sensitive zone. However, in 2019, Delhi Development Authority redeveloped it into the Bharat Vandana Park comprising several zones, including eco-forests, for adventure and amusement and with parking for over 1,600 four-wheelers. Demanding protection for the Nilgai — the antelope is Delhi’s state animal — and other species that appear to have moved out from the area, Diwan Singh, member of Green Circle Dwarka, asserted, “There used to be several Nilgai in the area. They have been forced out due to construction in a place that once was a mixture of grasslands, scrub forest and wetlands. We have determined that a flock of at least 27 Nilgai have lost their home. They run on roads, posing a threat not only to themselves but also motorists.” Singh said that the park area also used to be home to several other species, including turtles, hares and jackals. “Besides the Nilgai, we had earlier spotted and photographed around 100 peafowl, monitor lizards, flap shell turtle, hares and jackals,” he said. “A birding trek in 2019 at the same spot had noted 49 species, including red avadavat and peacocks. Now we hardly see any of these. The wildlife has been pushed to the roads.” According to eco activist captain S S Mann (retd), the green area was originally intended to be developed into an eco-sensitive zone and a biodiversity park. “In 2015, when we discussed the issue with officials, a DDA team sent professor C R Babu from Delhi to inspect the area. After the inspection, the professor recommended conversion of the area into a biodiversity zone,” claimed Mann. “However, DDA later came up with a multi-crore-rupee project with an amusement park, green space and parking for over 1,600 cars.” DDA officials responded that the park was in a development stage and would cater the needs of all. It would include a “dedicated area for biodiversity”. It was a very large project, they said, and different sections were being developed by building company NBCC keeping in mind the needs of society. Asked if any survey was carried out to determine the presence of wildlife in the area prior to implementing the recreation park, Kalpana Khurana, additional commissioner, landscape, DDA, said she was “unaware of the same in her capacity”. Other senior officials of DDA could not be reached for a response. No clear answer could be obtained from NBCC either when TOI reached out to its communication team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-dwarka-park-is-forcing-animals-onto-roads/articleshow/88286479.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Talking to TOI, Union minister of state for health and family welfare Dr Bharati Pawar said this wellness centre would be the first one in north Maharashtra. The wellness clinic will provide OPD medical services and medicines to central government pensioners. Moreover, any serving central government employee residing within a radius of 5 km from the centre can also avail of medical facilities. “There is no such centre in the entire north Maharashtra at present. There are several central government pensioners, who have to travel either to Mumbai or Pune to avail of these facilities. The project will be a boon for the beneficiaries of the region,” she added. According to an estimate, there are more than 1.20 lakh central government pensioners living in the region, the bulk of whom are in Nashik. There are several central government offices in north Maharashtra, especially in Nashik. “The details of the project are being worked out. The ministry will be establishing the wellness centre at an existing building, which is not in use at the moment. Although the locality is yet to be decided on, it could be in and around the Deolali Cantonment area,” Pawar said. According to the state CGHS authorities, all efforts are being made to set up the wellness centre by the end of this month. The central government pensioners, meanwhile, said they had been pursuing this issue for a long time. “It would be a huge relief for the pensioners once this wellness centre starts functioning. We have to travel to Pune or Mumbai and procure medicines for three months since it is not easy for us to travel to these cities frequently,” said M L Deore, assistant general secretary of All India Retired BSNL Executive Welfare Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/wellness-centre-for-union-govt-staff-planned-in-nashik/articleshow/88284833.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Initially, it was believed that the patient would need another negative RTPCR report within 24 hours for discharge. However, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) clarified that it was up to the treating physician as per state protocol and a second RTPCR report in 24 hours was not required.AIIMS officials said the patient will be discharged “on Wednesday morning and will be advised 7 days home quarantine as per protocol”. NMC will arrange an ambulance for him.On December 6, the man was admitted to AIIMS Nagpur’s special ward set up for Omicron patients. All through his stay he remained asymptomatic.“I was confident my report would be negative,” said the Dighori resident after sharing his RTPCR result with TOI.The man heaved a sigh of relief but was not keen on returning at night hours. “I will prefer to leave the hospital during the morning hours. Now it is too late. I have stayed here for nearly 8 days so one more day doesn’t matter,” he said.The 40-year-old had returned to the country on December 5 and then taken a connecting flight from Delhi to Nagpur. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials asked him to take a Covid test at the airport as a precautionary measure though West Africa wasn’t in the ‘at risk’ nations.“Three days of extensive travel didn’t exhaust me and immediately next day of coming home I was moved to the hospital. I don’t like to stay confined to one place. I like fresh air. The doctors were surprised that I didn’t even have cough. Some of the local patients here are coughing,” he said.Two UK flyers – a woman and her 9 year old – too had been tested for RT-PCR. The mother-daughter duo had tested negative for Omicron variant in genome sequencing a couple of days back. Their RT-PCR report wasn’t received till the filing of the this report.AIIMS officials said though they have tested negative for Omicron variant, as per existing protocol for flyers, Covid positive international travellers need to have a negative RTPCR of the 10th day.As per ICMR norms, Covid patients are declared recovered on the 10th day of infection and do not require a negative report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citys-only-omi-patient-tests-covid-ve-discharge-today/articleshow/88285714.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Ahmedabad||Why not recruit doctors with better perks, asks HC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday questioned the state government why it does not recruit specialist doctors by offering them higher perks. The court raised the question during the arguments on petitions filed by 452 post-graduate medical students who are practising now, but had approached the court after the state government threatened them with criminal action for not reporting on Covid duty during the second wave of the pandemic. They had offered to pay Rs 10 lakh bond amount, but the state government was unrelenting then. However, it changed its stance later and started accepting bond amount and freed 114 such petitioners from their bond because they paid in lieu of serving in rural areas for one year as part of their bond conditions. On shortage of doctors that led the government to pressurise the bonded doctors to take up Covid duty, the high court opined that the government can offer them better salaries to attract and retain them for rural services. To this, the government submitted that it has offered them salaries on par with private hospitals, but the specialist doctors were not ready to join the duty. Those who joined also left after few months. The HC completed hearing on the petitions filed by 452 bonded doctors and reserved its verdict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-not-recruit-doctors-with-better-perks-asks-hc/articleshow/88285717.cms||---

The minister soon bought a ball, signed on it and contacted the Chavara area committee to get the ball to Sreehari’s house. Soon SFI activists handed over the football to Sreehari at his house at Panmana. Sreehari has been bedridden since his birth.

The MP explained that traditional Sungudi sari is handmade without machines.Venkatesan said nearly 10,000 families from the minority Saurashtra community are engaged in making Sungudi saris. These low-cost saris are predominantly worn by women from the lower strata of the society, according to him. Tamil Nadu government exempted Sungudi saris from sales tax on August 22, 1955 as it falls under the cottage industry category. “In 2017, the government of India levied a 5% GST on Sungudi saris. This was a big blow to this cottage industry, turning it into a sick industry and pushing the poor weavers below poverty,” he said.The government of India in November increased the GST on Sungudi saris from 5% to 12%, virtually throwing the cottage industry out of gear, he said.Talking to TOI, Venkatesan quoted Nirmala Sitharaman as saying that the process of returns for GST was getting delayed earlier and that it has been expedited. “The minister said that revising the GST rates is the decision of the GST council and not the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-urges-union-minister-to-withdraw-gst-on-sungudi-sari/articleshow/88286503.cms||---

His blood and swab samples were sent to state public health laboratory in Chennai for genome testing. The passenger arrived at Coimbatore airport on December 2. He landed in Chennai and took a flight to Coimbatore from there. Meanwhile, health officers from Chennai notified about the passenger to the Coimbatore airport authorities. Upon arrival, his swab samples were collected and he tested negative for Covid -19. He was asked to remain in home quarantine. However, his swab samples collected at the end of home quarantine period tested positive for Covid. While three of his family members tested negative, officials have asked them to self-isolate themselves in their house. Health officials, however, said the passenger is unlikely to be infected with Omicron variant as ‘S’ gene was detected when his swab sample was tested through a Taqpath kit. Omicron variant cannot be detected as such with the Taqpath kit, but ‘S’ gene dropout in the sample is considered as an indication of either Delta or Omicron variant. Coimbatore deputy director of health services Dr P Aruna said ‘S’ gene was detected in the case of this passenger, but we will wait for the result of genome testing. Also there is no need to panic as Singapore has been removed from the list of ‘at risk’ countries a week ago, she said. 31 passengers have so far arrived from high risk countries to Coimbatore, she said. While none of them tested positive on the day of their arrival, this is the first such case to be tested positive after the completion of home quarantine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/passenger-from-singapore-tests-ve/articleshow/88286504.cms||---

A proposal has been tabled in the upcoming general body meeting on December 16. Under the works, the hospital electricity will be overhauled and the works related to the operation theatre, ventilators, and the appointment of new staff will be taken care of. The upgrade will also mean an effective easing of burden on the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH), the largest tertiary care hospital in the civic limits, as both the hospitals have a combined bed capacity of 300 oxygen support beds and around 50 ICU beds. Activist Maruti Bhapkar said that the civic hospitals need a thorough upgrade which will strengthen the medical services and overall community health. The need for ventilator and oxygen beds is huge in civic hospitals, which will eventually give YCMH a breather.  Rajendra Wabale, dean of YCMH, said that the ample availability of the beds and staff across other civic hospitals will eventually result in better medical services. “We can continue to offer non-Covid services without worrying about the Covid patients, who are being treated by civic hospitals like Jijamata hospital and New Bhosari hospital,” he added. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil, said both are prepared to take care of the Covid patients if the need arose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-spend-rs-5cr-on-upgrade-of-2-hospitals/articleshow/88285718.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Madurai||DMK lacks intellect to come out with new schemes: BJP||Tuticorin: BJP state president K Annamalai criticised the DMK government for lacking the intellectual ability to come out with new schemes for the people. He alleged that the state government was renaming the Centre’s schemes and taking credit for it.Interacting with reporters at the Tuticorin airport before heading to Tirunelveli to address party cadre, Annamalai said the Centre’s New Education Policy (NEP) had been introduced as ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ in Tamil Nadu and ‘Jan Oushad Kendra’ as ‘Malivu Vilai Marundhu’.He said chief minister M K Stalin was stealing the limelight by using schemes of the Centre and cited the latter visiting narikurava woman Aswini who was denied food at the temple with other devotees. The BJP leader said that Stalin had given her the Centre’s mudra loan meant for small vendors and street traders.Annamalai accused the state government of taking 20% commission for sanction of new projects and 4% to clear the bills. “All of these are going to the one family that is ruling the state,” he said.Stating that there was corruption in the state in the implementation of the Centre’s ambitious Jal Jeevan Scheme that is aimed at taking drinking water to the rural populace, he said it had been taken to the Union government’s notice and the ministers concerned. “They are looking into it and have assured of appropriate action,” he said.Tamil Nadu should be saved from the corrupt government that was also trying to silence its critics by unleashing its official powers, he said.Stating that now the business community and political circles even within their party had started talking about rampant corruption, he added that the common man would also start talking of it soon. He said there was difference in opinion among DMK ministers on the NEP as “one says it would not be implemented whereas another says that good aspects of the policy will be introduced in the state.”Addressing party workers in Tirunelveli, he asked them to prepare for the urban local body polls. Earlier in the day, he exchanged greetings with assembly speaker M Appavu at the Tuticorin airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dmk-lacks-intellect-to-come-out-with-new-schemes-bjp/articleshow/88286487.cms||---

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, total food grains worth Rs 34,456 crores have been distributed under PMGKAY so far, the state government said in a statement. The PMGKAY relief scheme was launched in 2020, initially for eight months, to the 80 crore beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) to provide relief from Covid-induced economic hardships. The first phase of the scheme was from April-June 2020, and the second from July-November 2020. The Centre had allocated a total 58.19 LMT of food grains for distribution in Phase-I and Phase-II. Later, during the second wave of Covid-19, the third phase of the scheme was launched from May-June 2021, which was extended to five more months as the fourth phase from July-November 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi later announced the fifth phase from December 2021 to March 2022, during which 29.43 LMT food grains would be distributed. “This scheme is a massive intervention by the government to support people during the ongoing pandemic,” said food commissioner Saurabh Babu. A high level of transparency has been maintained in the distribution of PDS even during the Covid-19 period, the state government claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rs-11k-cr-foodgrains-distributed-free-in-july-nov/articleshow/88286977.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana MLC elections: TRS polls more votes in Karimnagar, Nalgonda than strength||HYDERABAD: TRS MLC candidates have secured more votes than their voters’ strength in the elections to the legislative council elections from six local authority constituencies, especially Karimnagar and Nalgonda. As there were no official candidates for Congress in four constituencies and in all six constituencies for the BJP, their voters appeared to have voted for the ruling party candidates. Contrary to some districts like Nalgonda and Karimnagar, there was cross voting from TRS to Congress in Khammam. In Nalgonda constituency, the Congress did not field a candidate officially though it has 384 votes. Congress ZPTC member from Alair and former MLA K Nagesh contested in the election taking indirect support from the party. Against 384 Congress and 35 BJP votes, 13 CPM and another five CPI elected representatives in local bodies, Nagesh secured only 226 votes. The TRS secured a total of 917 votes against its original strength of 820 votes in the constituency. The TRS leaders claimed that the Congress and other parties too supported TRS candidate Koti Reddy. Nagesh alleged that some Congress leaders worked against him in the election. The BJP did not field official candidates from the two seats in Karimnagar. BJP MLA from Huzurabad Eatala Rajender supported TRS rebel candidate and former mayor Sardar Ravinder Singh. Minister Gangula Kamalakar said the two TRS candidates put together got 86 more votes than the TRS strength (voters) in the united Karimnagar district. “Congress and BJP have 324 votes in the local authority constituencies. The BJP itself got 105 votes. But Ravinder ended up getting 232 votes and TRS got 86 more votes than the party’s original strength of 986 votes,” Kamalakar said. In CM KCR’s Medak district, TRS and Congress claimed that they secured more votes than their voters’ strength. Minister T Harish Rao said TRS candidate Yadava Reddy secured 762 votes, which were eight votes more than the TRS voters’ strength of 754 in the constituency. TRS suffered a jolt in Khammam district though party candidate Tata Madhusudan won with 480 votes. Congress candidate R Nageswara Rao secured 242 votes. Party sources said some party MPTCs and ZPTCs supported the Congress candidate. In Adilabad district, party candidate Dande Vittal won the seat without any problem as independent candidate Penduru Pushparani secured only 75 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-polls-more-votes-than-its-strength/articleshow/88285720.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||2.69L beneficiaries in rural Pune unvaccinated, says ZP||Pune: Around 2.69 lakh people across 13 tehsils in rural Pune are yet to get the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, Pune Zilla Parishad officials said. Most of these non-vaccinated people are from Baramati, Daund, Indapur, Bhor, Haveli, Junnar, and Purandar talukas. Unwillingness and lack of awareness about the benefits of vaccination are among the main reasons for them not opting for jabs, said officials. Ayush Prasad, ZP CEO, said the gram panchayats have been told to identify unvaccinated people in their limits. “Many people have migrated to other cities for work. They might have been vaccinated wherever they are residing now. It is practically not feasible to check all the details immediately. Still, with the help of the gram panchayat and local leaders we are verifying their vaccination status in the district,” Prasad said. Dr Abhay Tidke, district immunisation officer, said, “We are verifying their details and finding out why they did not get vaccinated. We are the taking help from local resources to address this concern.” Tidke conceded that the misconception over vaccination in certain communities is also an issue in the district. He claimed that several efforts have been made to expedite the rate of vaccination in the district. “We are vaccinating as many as 80,000 people daily in the Pune Metropolitan Region. Two weeks ago, the number of daily vaccinations hovered between 50,000 and 60,000 in the region. With several ground-level efforts, we could achieve some progress,” Tidke added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-69l-beneficiaries-in-rural-pune-unvaccinated-says-zp/articleshow/88285726.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Surat||Pakistani food festival in Surat hotel sparks row||SURAT: An unsavoury dispute erupted in Surat city, famed for its lip-smacking non-vegetarian delicacies, after right-wing groups on Monday targeted a prominent restaurant for organizing a Pakistani Food Festival. The food festival was called off eventually following protest by members of the Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) over the use of the word ‘Pakistani’ by the restaurant owners. Members from the two right-wing organisations on Monday pulled down the hoarding announcing the food festival from the terrace of the building complex where the restaurant is located and then set it ablaze in the parking area of the building. They also submitted a complaint to the Khatodara police demanding action against the restaurant owners. The hoarding announcing the food festival was put up on the restaurant building complex on Saturday and it went viral on social media on Sunday triggering protest by the Bajrag Dal and VHP members on Monday. “No one objects to the use of the word Chinese in food items even as the neighbouring country is creating issues for India on the border,” said restaurant owner Sandeep Dawar. “The food festival had nothing to do with religion, it was only to showcase authentic Pakistani food, which is basically a Mughlai preparation,” he added. However, after the protest, the special food festival menu with dishes like Multani Dhingri, Peshawari Dal, Lahori Fish, Karachi Murgh Karahi to name a few have been taken down. “Almost all Pakistani dishes are popular in India and routinely available. Ours was an attempt to inform the customers about it,” Dawar told TOI. “If the protesters had just called and told us to remove the hoardings, we would have done that. There was no need for all this,” he added. South Gujarat in-charge of Bajrang Dal Deviprasad Dube said, “If they want to do business in India, they cannot use the name of Pakistan here. We have submitted a written complaint to the police as well.” Khatodara police station official confirmed receipt of a complaint against the restaurant by the Bajrang Dal. The police official said that there was no complaint against the protestors by the restaurant owner as of now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pakistani-food-festival-in-surat-hotel-sparks-row/articleshow/88264412.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

S Palanisamy, district president, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, which organized the protest, said the organic farmers in Kongu region would face problems, including that of transportation, if the department were to be shifted to the capital city. He said more than 2,000 farmers were into organic farming on 30,000 acres land in the western districts of the state. “The move will leave them high and dry. They have obtained certificates from the centre and using the same for exporting agricultural products to other countries. If shifted, farmers will find it difficult to get required support.” The protesters urged the district collector to take up the issue with the state government and explain the importance of the centre in this part of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dont-shift-organic-certification-centre-to-chennai-farmers/articleshow/88286508.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Put in extra 100 hours to combat learning loss: Govt to teachers||Ahmedabad: To combat the issue of pandemic-induced learning loss, teachers of government and self-financed schools of the state will contribute 100 additional hours of teaching for primary, secondary and higher secondary levels. The state education department has appealed to teachers to put in extra 100 hours of teaching from December 15 to April 15. For this, the teachers have to voluntarily teach for an extra hour every day after school or half an hour before school and half an hour after school, said sources in the department. In the case of informal schools, extra classes can be conducted on weekends or changes can be made in school schedule to extend the teaching hours, it said. Teachers can also consider the option of teaching students on Sundays. Schools after closing down for a long time due to Covid began re-opening from July in a staggered manner. Most of these schools had switched to online education which still continues as government has allowed re-opening with limited student capacity. The impact of learning loss can be seen in the vast difference in the results of recently held class tests that was held in pen-and-paper (offline) mode for Class 9-12 students. Many students who came out with flying colours in the online test have barely managed to scrape through in offline format. The state education department has initiated a survey to evaluate learning loss and find out measures to overcome these challenges. Several schools are grappling with the issue where the writing skills of students have deteriorated and academic performance dipped immensely in the last 18 months. From issues in reading and writing skills to lack of confidence and poor show in pen-and-paper exams, the impact of disruptions in education caused by the pandemic is seen in some of the leading schools of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/put-in-extra-100-hours-to-combat-learning-loss-govt-to-teachers/articleshow/88285725.cms||---

The couple –– Hashim, 42, and wife Habeeba, 37 –– were reported missing since April 6, 2017. Earlier, similar search operations were conducted in other similar water bodies in and around Thazhathangady in Kottayam. The pond is in ward 42 of Kottayam municipality in Muttom near Mariappally. The body of two persons were recovered from this quarry in the controversial Mahadevan murder case in 2014. The couple had left home in their new car to buy food for children on a hartal day at night. They did not carry their mobile phone or purse. Local Police failed to get any lead in the case and the investigation was handed over to the Crime Branch. Since the couple had gone missing along with the car it was suspected that the car had fallen into some water bodies. Search was held in all such possible water bodies in the district where there was a possibility for such an accident. Local residents say that the quarry in Muttom is around 45 feet deep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/search-on-for-couple-missing-since-2017/articleshow/88286510.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||India to get natural dye mark soon||Lucknow: The country will soon have its natural dye/ natural dyed product mark with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) setting up a committee to formulate the certification protocol for standardising the production process of natural dyes in the country. The committee is headed by Lucknow-based manufacturer of dyes and natural products Yawer Ali Shah, who has been named convener f the panel. Shah told TOI the process involves development of a natural dye mark on the lines of ECO mark, a certification developed by BIS to label environment friendly products. “The demand for natural dyes has increased tremendously over the past three decades. This has created need for standardisation as there is excess of players and products in the market. BIS recognised the need and set up a committee for this,” Shah said. The committee constituted in September includes Dr Henriques Bosco, Dr PS Vankar, Dr MS Parmar, Dr Sumit Gupta and Dr Sujata Saxena as members and is scheduled to submit its draft recommendation early next year. The official communique in this regard said: “The scheme should be so designed to cover both the ‘Natural Dye Powder’ as well as for ‘textile materials or products dyed with natural dyes’.” “Like the silk mark or Ecomark, the natural dyes mark will also be an insignia of authenticity. The BIS wants us to develop it on the lines of ECO mark,” he added. The ECO mark covers various product categories like soaps and detergents, paints, food items, lubricating oils, packing/ packaging materials, architectural paints and powder coatings, batteries, electrical and electronic goods, food additives, wood substitutes, cosmetics, aerosols and propellants, plastic products, textiles, fire extinguisher, leather and coir & coir products. The presence of ECO logo along with ISI Mark on a product indicates that it meets certain environmental criteria along with the quality requirements as specified in the relevant Indian Standard. Shah said the natural dyes mark will cover a range of items that use natural dyes like fabrics, colours, inks, denims etc. He also urged people to use natural-dyed products as besides being eco-friendly (as they consume less water and energy), they also help in eliminating waste and creating employment. Citing example from his own firm which exports products to international brands, he said: “One kilogramme peel of pomegranate provides 300 gram of raw material for extracting yellow colour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/india-to-get-natural-dye-mark-soon/articleshow/88286987.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||People should know what they’re eating, says Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Use of non-vegetarian ingredients and labelling them vegetarian would offend religious and cultural sentiments of strict vegetarians and interfere in their right to freely profess their religion, Delhi high court has observed. It underlined that everyone has a right to know what they are consuming and nothing can be offered to them on a platter by resorting to deceit and camouflage. The court also directed the Centre and FSSAI to ensure that there is full and complete disclosure of all the ingredients that go into the manufacture of any food articles, not only by their code names but also by disclosing if they originate from plant or animal source or whether they are manufactured in a laboratory, irrespective of their percentage in the food article. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said that failure of the authorities in checking such lapses is leading to not only non-compliance of the Food Safety and Standards Act and the Regulations, but also allowing deceit by such food business operators of the public at large, particularly those who wish to profess strict vegetarianism. “Even though their usage may constitute a miniscule percentage, the use of non-vegetarian ingredients would render such food articles non-vegetarian, and would offend the religious and cultural sensibilities/sentiments of strict vegetarians, and would interfere in their right to freely profess, practice and propagate their religion and belief. Every person has a right to know as to what he/she is consuming, and nothing can be offered to the person on a platter by resort to deceit, or camouflage,” the bench said. The court added that failure on the part of the food business operators to comply with the above requirements “would expose them to class action for violation of the fundamental rights of the consuming public and invite punitive damages, apart from prosecution.” The bench cited an example of a food additive often found in instant noodles, potato chips and a variety of other snacks and is coded in the trade, which is commercially prepared from meat or fish. “Many food articles that have ingredients sourced from animals are passed off as vegetarian by affixing the green dot,” it noted, ruling in favour of a petitioner organisation Ram Gau Raksha Dal — a trust working towards the welfare of cows — which claimed that there are certain “non-vegetarian” products that are unknowingly consumed by those professing vegetarianism due to absence of proper disclosures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/people-should-know-what-theyre-eating/articleshow/88286526.cms||---

---||Madurai||Paid Covid-19 vaccination dips in Madurai district||MADURAI: Private hospitals in Madurai have cut down Covid-19 vaccine procurement as most citizens now prefer to get vaccinated at government vaccination sites for free, which has affected the vaccination coverage of private hospitals considerably. At present, around 75% of the eligible population has taken the jab for the first dose and around 38% for the second dose in Madurai. In the district, currently only seven private hospitals are offering vaccination. “But very few people approach private hospitals to take the vaccine due to the cost involved. Sales of vaccines are also done only in bulk, so there is still stock left at many hospitals as intake is less. Further, if one vial is opened, it has to be completed,” said a hospital management consultant of private hospitals. Hospitals said that when the vaccination is free at government sites, the public don’t want to pay for it. “We are having only a bare minimum stock of Covid-19 vaccines. We were among the few hospitals to make Sputnik V vaccine available but it was not being preferred by the public as it is expensive. We had to stop stocking vaccines. As per government instructions, now the support we are providing is only through holding vaccination camps where the government allows free vaccination by buying from us,” said J Adel, general manager – operations, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre. Meanwhile, union health minister Bharati Pravin Pawar in his reply to the queries by Madurai MP Su Venkatesan and five other MPs stated that 96.3% of the vaccination across the country was done through government Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) and private health care service providers contributed to only 3.7%. As many as 108.55 crore doses were administered at government CVCs and 4.12 crore doses at private CVCs as on December 7. The MPs had inquired about the participation of government and private hospitals in administering Covid-19 vaccine, supply of vaccines to private hospitals, percentage of vaccines that remain unutilised in private hospitals, curtailing allocation to private hospitals due to non-utilisation, duplicate vaccine scandals. Responding to it, Bharati Pravin Pawar stated that 4.61 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines were procured by private hospitals and 49 lakh doses are left with them. Revised guidelines for implementation of national Covid-19 vaccination programme effective from June 21, allows domestic vaccine manufacturers to provide up to 25% of their monthly vaccine directly to private hospitals. “Any leftover vaccine is also procured by the Government of India,” the minister said. He said that instances of fake Covid-19 vaccination camps and fake vaccines from Maharashtra, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh have come to the notice of the government of India. The ministry of health and family welfare has formally directed the state governments to investigate these incidents and take stringent actions against the offenders. The minister said, “As an additional measure of caution all the states and union territories have been asked to increase vigilance within the supply chains and carefully authenticate the product and its physical condition before its use to guard against such unscrupulous activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/paid-vaccination-dips-in-madurai-district/articleshow/88286509.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata civic polls: Growth-zone TMC candidates take incumbency in stride||KOLKATA: Campaigning for the large areas located off EM Bypass poses a challenge even to incumbent councillors, who are aware of residents’ demands for better infrastructure and have been striving to redress their civic grievances. Unlike in wards located in proper city, candidates contesting the KMC elections from this area need to walk the extra mile to assure voters that their “underdeveloped” areas will improve once a new civic board is elected and gets functional. For Susanta Ghosh, Trinamool candidate from Ward 108, which spans from Madurdaha off E M Bypass right up to Bantala and Chowbhaga, it is a Herculean task to tackle the varying problems faced by his voters, belonging to all income groups, living in high-rises to shanties. Ward 108 happens to be the largest in Kolkata and the size makes Ghosh’s job even more difficult as his earlier area, Rajdanga in Ward 107, was at least three times smaller.“I have tried to touch every locality in my ward as far as practicable. The problems here vary from area to area. While I need to arrange for safe drinking water for residents of high-rises located beside EM Bypass, repair of battered roads, upgrade of a poor drainage network and making provision for drinking water are high on agenda for residents of remote places, such as Bantala and Chowbhaga, which share borders with panchayat areas under Sonarpur,” Ghosh said. Besides, he has to effectively guard several water bodies across the ward from land sharks. “This is a real challenge and I solicit cooperation from residents to protect the water bodies that provide pure oxygen to several neighbourhoods in my ward,” Ghosh added. Similarly, thousands of residents of Nayabad, Mukundapur and Panchasayar have their fingers crossed, hoping for respite from flooding that has become an annual ordeal every monsoon. Sitting KMC councillor Ananya Banerjee is well aware of the poor drainage network in several pockets of Nayabad, Panchasayar and Mukundapur and has managed to convince the KMC drainage department to take up some projects to stop waterlogging after heavy spells of showers. However, according to a KMC drainage department official, areas in Nayabad and Mukundapur will have to be connected to a comprehensive drainage upgrade project, funded by the Asian Development Bank. “Unless we connect these areas through an underground sewer network to the mainland, the residents here will continue to suffer in coming monsoons, too,” the civic official said. Trinamool candidate from Ward 101 Bappaditya Dasgupta has been striving hard to reach potable water to every household in some of the dry pockets of his Baisnabghata-Patuli belt for the past several years. In fact, Dasgupta is eagerly waiting for an augmentation of the Dhapa water treatment plant, which will ensure additional water to large areas of Patuli and Baisnabghata. The sitting Trinamool councillor has assured his voters of trying and ending waterlogging woes in some parts of his ward, a problem which has been taken care of partially. Creating more green cover and protecting the existing greenery and water bodies in the neighbourhoods off EM Bypass will be one of his prime tasks in the next five years, he has promised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/growth-zone-tmc-candidates-take-incumbency-in-stride/articleshow/88285729.cms||Saikat Ray

One month delay than usual would be helpful for students. Instead of having the exams around February end to start of March, they could be held by March end to start of April,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). “Completing the syllabus won’t be an issue, but it will be tough for students to face board exams if they are pressured to cover topics without proper revision, especially as they have never written any board exam, ” said the headmaster of a government HS school. S Shanthi, a Class XII Physics teacher, said that by announcing the time table for exams, teachers can plan better and students will also be more motivated to study.“If it is held in April or May, it would be good for students. We were able to start learning properly only when schools reopened,” said N Rashmi, a Class XII student. “This is the first time we are doing practicals so we need more time to learn. If practicals are conducted by February, there will be hardly enough time after that to revise the syllabus for main exams,” added another Class XII student, S Tamil Selvan. “If the exams are postponed to May, then students will be affected again next academic year,” said Senthilnathan M, president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-students-seek-clarity-on-exam/articleshow/88286514.cms||---

The AICA, an umbrella organization of 170 MSME associations, has requested the authorities to reduce prices of raw materials to the level of April 2020 prices. The association also sought fixing maximum retail prices for all raw materials. In a statement issued on Monday, the AICA also called for one-hour peaceful demonstration in front of the respective district magistrate office to press for the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue. “The prices of raw materials continue to rise for reasons unknown, impacting production of MSMEs” said president of the Coimbatore district small industries association (Codissia) M V Ramesh Babu in the statement. AICA has sent many representations to the Prime Minister and various Union ministers with a request to control raw material prices, he said. Members of the AICA said the cost of aluminum has increased 154% in the past 18 months. While the price of copper increased 118%, the mild steel plate price saw 82% hike during the same period. Members urged the government to ask all public sector and listed companies to revisit and renegotiate steel orders placed with MSMEs, considering the revised price in the market, and alter orders. Companies must accept cancellation of orders by MSMEs with no penalty or black listing, a member said. The government should allow import of all steel materials based on cost and quality requirements without imposing any import duty, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/aica-calls-for-strike-to-protest-price-rise/articleshow/88286516.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: R Bindu should step down, says V D Satheesa||KOCHI: Opposition leader V D Satheesan has demanded the resignation of higher education minister R Bindu who allegedly made out-of-theway interventions in the reappointment of Kannur University vice chancellor. The chief minister, who said that there had not been any interference on the part of the government in the reappointment of the vice chancellor, was misleading the public, Satheesan said. The two letters sent by the higher education minister prove the government’s intervention in the matter. It is at the behest of the minister that the governor took the wrong decision, Satheesan alleged. Governor, in his letter to the chief minister, had said that his decision to approve the minister’s request was wrong. It is an infringement upon the rights of the governor, Satheesan said. Ministers can act only as per law. Higher education minister who violated the oath office should resign, Satheesan demanded. Allegations are being levelled regarding appointments in all the universities in the state. The government is appointing relatives of party leaders to vacant posts. The chief minister, who said that it was the governor who made the reappointment of the vice chancellor, should apologize. Nepotism, corruption and violation of rules are rampant in the universities, he said. Satheesan also said that the government is misleading the public on the SilverLine project.

The accused — civic police volunteer Abhisek Malakar and assistant sub-inspector Sandip Pal — were remanded in 14-day judicial custody on Monday by a Salt Lake court. The woman, with the help of Kasba police, had lodged a complaint a few hours after the untoward incident that happened to her. The accused were later arrested. While the civic volunteer was sacked, the ASI was suspended. The two are currently in judicial remand till December 27. The officer said the woman would soon record her statement before the judicial magistrate at a Salt Lake court under section 164 of CRPC in this week. “We are yet to receive a confirmation on the date of the statement to be recorded. But we have appealed to the court to fix the date at the earliest,” said the officer. Speaking to TOI, the post graduate student of computer applications said she has been in a trauma ever since the incident on Saturday but she vowed to continue her fight for justice. “I am cooperating with the cops in whatever means possible. I am still in a state of shock and trauma, but I have replied to all the queries of the investigating officers and I believe that I shall get justice,” said the woman. Meanwhile, cops said they are scanning the CCTV footage of multiple traffic cameras placed in Salt Lake to locate the exact route that the two had followed while taking the woman on their bike. The cops are also recording the statements of witnesses at Karunamoyee bus stand, fellow policemen, motorists and shop owners near Mani Square on EM Bypass, where she was finally dropped. “We are corroborating her statement with those of witnesses as well as the available the CCTV footage. We are trying to wrap up our investigation at the earliest and submit a chargesheet in this case,” said another officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-molestation-woman-identifies-tormentors-at-ti-parade/articleshow/88285756.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

We don’t want to take any chances, so till the time the results of the tests are out we will continue to keep the building sealed,” said Vispute.

Both cubs were around 45-day-old females.” “We were not sure if their mother would come and it is difficult to keep cubs at one spot as they can change locations. So, we decided to make a paddock with the help of farmers using sugarcane and left the site, so that the mother feels safe to come,” he explained.

---||Delhi||Delhi buying more electric vehicles than before, govt plans infra push||NEW DELHI: While Delhi already had a much higher percentage of electric vehicles on the roads in September-November than across the country, the numbers might just rise higher. Delhi government is going to put up 600 more public EV charging points in the city by June next year. This will make nearly a thousand EV public charging points in Delhi. EVs accounted for 9%, or 9,540, of the vehicles sold in Delhi from September to November against the national average of 1.6%. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has set a target of 25% of vehicles sold in Delhi being EVs by 2024. Kejriwal said on Tuesday that the capital was doing everything possible to reduce pollution and the state government’s EV policy was geared to this. Surpassing CNG and diesel vehicles, EVs comprised the second-most bought type of vehicles after petrol cars in Delhi in the September-November quarter. In the past three months, EV sales are almost 9% of the total vehicle sales in the city. In September and November, EVs comprised 9.2% of sales and in October, it was 8.2%. Sales of CNG vehicles fell from 9.7% in September to 6.5% in November. “I'm glad Delhi is emerging as the EV capital of India,” the CM tweeted recently. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot characterised Delhi’s EV policy as being “a huge success”. He said, “Electric vehicles are gaining popularity by the day in Delhi.” In September-November, Delhiites bought 9,540 EVs, 2,873 in September, 3,275 in October and 3,392 in November. In the same period, 82,626 petrol vehicles were sold. The electric vehicles clearly surpassed the earlier popular choices of diesel and CNG vehicles by a significant margin. While 7,820 CNG vehicles were bought in the quarter, the figure for diesel cars was 2,688. In the hybrid category, 3,918 petrol+CNG vehicles were sold and 1,429 petrol plus other hybrid variants were sold. Delhi is the first Indian state to fully exempt road tax and registration fees for all EVs. Further, the eligibility criteria were simplified and made universal so that more people could benefit from the subsidy on EVs, a government official stated. In the past two years, over 380 charging points were set up across Delhi, the highest in any city across India. Another 600 public charging points will now be added by mid-2022. The government lately concluded the eight-week Switch Delhi campaign that has played a key role in increasing the awareness about the EV policy. As mandated in the EV policy, the government pays a subsidy for the first 1,000 EV cars. But other EVs continue to be exempted from road tax and registration fee. The subsidy on electric two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, rickshaws and freight vehicles is also available currently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-buying-more-evs-than-before-govt-plans-infra-push/articleshow/88285737.cms||AlokKNMishra

In Surgana, only 66% of the beneficiaries have taken the first dose, while in Nandgaon the vaccination rate is 73% and in Yeola, it is 77%. In the other districts, 90% of the beneficiaries have taken the first dose. While the first dose vaccination rate in Dindori and Sinnar is 88% and 85% respectively. Kailas Bhoye, the vaccination incharge and taluka health officer, said, “The vaccination is underway in concerned talukas. However, villagers of Surgana and Nandgaon have migrated to other districts for work. Also, vaccine hesitancy is seen among a section of people in Yeola. But we are putting in our best efforts to improve the vaccination in these talukas.” Bhoye said that the villagers from Nandgaon and Suragna generally return home during the festive period and leave for the daily wage jobs after Diwali. The health department is trying to find the places where these villagers have migrated and get them vaccinated at the place of their work if they are located within the district. Apart from this, the health department teams are continuously visiting the villages in these talukas to ensure that everyone takes the vaccine. Of the total 32.46 beneficiaries in the rural district, 6.28 lakh are yet to take the first dose. The health officials also added that the rate of vaccination will improve in the near future as a large number of people have now started visiting the vaccination centres after the outbreak of Omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vax-rate-still-low-in-3-talukas-of-rural-nashik/articleshow/88284844.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The MVA government has no such control. Therefore, it is obvious such (leaks) things happen,” he said, while speaking to reporters here. Thackeray added, “It is not the first time that such paper leak has taken place. Such incidents have been reported in the past also. These incidents repeat because those who are involved never get exposed.” While dust was yet to settle on alleged malpractices involving recruitment examination of the public health department, MHADA recently cancelled its examination after a bid to leak question paper. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief, who was on two-day tour to Aurangabad, however, said that ruling MVA government may not face any immediate danger of losing the power. “The three-party alliance has sufficient numbers to continue for at least some period,” he said. Thackeray, the cousin of late Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray, refused to divulge his strategy for 2024 assembly elections. “Strategies are not meant to be disclosed. We have been working on different options and things will unfold in future,” he said. When asked whether his visit to Aurangabad was a precursor to upcoming polls to the local civic body, he said, “Different elections keep taking place almost round-the-year. The elections to Aurangabad municipal corporation are already deferred. Moreover, polls for local self-governing body in Maharashtra are bound to get delayed due to issue over OBC reservation. The Centre and the state are only fighting over who should collect the data,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/raj-on-exam-paper-leak-mva-govt-has-no-control/articleshow/88283976.cms||---

---||Goa||Art synergy at Savoi Verem’s traditional Kalo||Keri: Devotees of the Shri Anant Devasthan at Savoi Verem were recently treated to a performance of a rare form of traditional folk drama called Kalo, based on mythological stories related to the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu. The performance was held to mark the annual celebration of the Sakhya Hari zatra. Interestingly, the performers essaying the various characters such as that of Brahma, Vishnu, Ganapati, Putana, Chimo as well as animal forms such as crow and antelope were seen using wooden masks. Sneha Gawas, a teacher from Keri, Sattari, who witnessed the performance said, “The traditional folk drama of Kalo not only shows the socio-cultural life of the bygone days, but also deep-rooted folk beliefs and practices related with the environment. If sincere efforts are made for the revival of the Kalo, it will attract audience even today.” The tradition of Kalo dates back to the pre-Portuguese era and was widely performed in the Goa-Konkan region with utmost devotion by local artistes. The book ‘Gomantakiy Dashavatari Kala’, edited by well-known folk researcher, professor Shyam Verenkar, and published in 2013 by the directorate of art and culture, traces the history of Kalo to the Vijayanagar-era. As per government records, in the past, around 350 temples performed Kalo on the occasion of the annual fair in Goa. “After the monsoon had receded and the paddy was harvested, most of the temples in Ponda and vicinity celebrated the zatra by performing the Kalo. Huge crowds would throng Savoi Verem to enjoy the varied glimpses of the annual performance,” said Madhu Gaonkar, a 67-year-old drama artist from Khandola, Ponda. Percussion instruments including the mrudang and pakhavaj along with zhanz are used, to create folk music. The artistes perform the role of different characters like Ganapati, Riddhi-Siddhi, Saraswati, Hardas, Mahadev, Parvati etc. By cracking jokes in vernacular languages, the characters of Mhabalubhat, Sankasur keep the audiences entertained. Over time, however, lack of patronage and growing apathy of passing generations has resulted in it verging on extinction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/art-synergy-at-savoi-verems-traditional-kalo/articleshow/88287043.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The employees and pensioners of the corporation had been fighting for this for a long time and had even staged protests. The move will incur an additional expenditure of Rs 150 crore and the roadways will request the state government to lend a helping hand in the matter, claimed officials. Apart from this, various other works were also discussed during the meeting and officials agreed in principle that fuel pumps, CNG pumps and electric vehicles charging points would be established at the corporation’s vacant plots. The corporation is facing a loss of approximately Rs 65 crore and various measures were discussed to overcome this. It was informed that due to efficient usage of diesel, the roadways had succeeded in saving around Rs 2 crore per month. Other issuses including filling of vacant posts were also discussed Earlier this month, transport minister Brijendra Ola had held a review meeting during which he touched upon measures to improve the existing facilities. The minister said after many months, on December 1, all roadways employees got their salaries on time.

In Mumbai, cases dropped by 98% from approximately 10,000 on April 14 — the height of the second wave — to 217 on Tuesday. The daily toll in Maharashtra climbed from five on Monday to 24 on Tuesday, while Mumbai registered only one death. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the weekly tally of cases in Mumbai had gone up marginally as compared to the previous week. “However, this could be due to more tests being conducted daily due to the Omicron threat,’’ he said. The city has increased its number of tests on most weekdays from 35,000 to over 40,000. “The daily test positive rate is the important ratio to consider and we are still around 0.5%, hence there is no cause for concern,’’ he added. State officials said testing has increased in most districts. The state which was conducting an average of 75000 tests per day a few days ago is now conducting nearly a lakh tests everyday. “ This is done to ensure that no cases are left undetected," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cases-in-city-drop-by-98-compared-to-height-of-second-wave-1-death-on-tues/articleshow/88285790.cms||---

This will also help the local police station take a prompt action. The senior officers of Kolkata Police launched the city’s first “Hotline kiosk” — a computerised grievance help desk beside a petrol pump opposite National Library and Alipore Zoo. The inauguration of the service came four days after a 25-year-old woman, stranded on a Salt Lake road with a drained-out cellphone, was allegedly molested by an ASI and a civic volunteer on Saturday night when she had approached them for help. The duo were later arrested but the woman is yet to come out of the trauma. “This is like a computerised complaint booth where women can walk in 24x7 and seek help over anything. This kiosk is connected to the Lalbazar police control room and Alipore police station while help would reach the woman within minutes,” said Akash Magharia, deputy commissioner (south) of Kolkata Police. The officer added that cops will be posted at the kiosks throughout the day and women can also lodge a complaint without going through the hassle of visiting a police station. According to police sources, more kiosks will come up at key locations in the city by the next few weeks. The kiosks have been planned, keeping in mind the safety of women so that they get in touch with the police control room directly. The basic technology used in the kiosk is internet video call using dual SIMs. A complainant can connect with the control room simply by pressing a button on an LCD screen in front of her. The officers on the other side will not only offer immediate help but also generate a formal complaint. The crux of the complaint along with its reference number will be sent to the complainant’s phone or email address. The kiosk was constructed with the money allocated for the Nirbhaya fund. The installation of each kiosk costs Rs 9 lakh. Cops, however, cautioned that actions would be taken against those making prank calls or lodging false complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kp-launches-smart-kiosk-at-alipore-for-women-in-distress-more-on-the-cards/articleshow/88285786.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The dogs are left in the same area about four or five days after the operation,” an official said. According to data available with them, about 50% of dogs in the GHMC area have already been sterilised.

Justice PV Kunhikrishnan also directed the government to frame a guideline for conversion therapy and produce it before the court within five months. The direction was issued by the court after considering a petition filed by Queerala, an organization for Malayali LGBTQI community, and by an alleged victim of forced conversion. It was alleged by the petitioners that forced conversion, which is harmful and is a widely discredited practice of trying to change an individual’s sexual orientation, is taking place in Kerala. In the order issued on December 10, the court said, “I considered the above contentions of the petitioners and the above report (by Indian Psychiatric Society deprecating the practice). It is an admitted fact that there is no guideline prescribed by the State Government for conversion therapy among the petitioner community. The Government Pleader says that there is no complaint received alleging forced conversion and on the other hand, the petitioners say that there is forced conversion. If there is forced conversion as alleged by the petitioners, stringent action should be taken. This is a matter to be looked into by the 1st respondent (state government).” “According to me, a guideline is necessary in this regard for conversion therapy, if medically it is possible. Therefore, the 1st respondent will look into this matter, and if necessary will constitute an expert committee to study this issue. Based on the study report, the 1st respondent will frame a guideline and produce the same before this Court within 5 months,” the high court added. A representative of the petitioner and the other stakeholders should be heard before finalizing the guidelines, the court directed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lgbtqi-hc-for-strict-action-against-forced-conversion/articleshow/88284855.cms||---

We were back to school for lab practice on Tuesday. We got no time to relax after a board exam,” said Sam J Anand, a pure science student at the school. Science students with computer science will finish their ISC first-semester on Wednesday and will start lab work on Thursday. Candidates with computer science and home science would get their lab sessions over the next few days before the winter break started, schools said. “We are calling students from Wednesday for practicals. Since our vacation will start from December 25, they will practise till December 24,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Ram Mohan Mission School. Pure science students of The Heritage School have their biology lab on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the other practicals till December 20. Another set of practice would start with reopening on January 3, said principal Seema Sapru. CISCE schools said one possible reason for the council to change the practical exam deadline from February 28, 2022 to January 31, 2022 was their plan to hold second-semester board exams after mid-February. There was no confirmation. With CBSE yet to announce any date for Class XII board practical exams, most schools in the city said lab practice would start only after campuses reopened in January. Most CBSE first-term exams will end on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/isc-students-back-in-lab-a-day-after-1st-sem-exams/articleshow/88285777.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The team comprising trekking experts, personnel from the State Disaster Response Force and the forest department started its journey from Rishikesh on October 25. The“walking route’ to the Char Dham shrines in the Himalayas according to local folklore, is 3,000 years old and was taken by the Pandavas. Prior to the 1940s, devotees used the old route to start their journey from Haridwar with a yatra guide and completed it in 14 days. The traditional route fell into disuse once motorable roads to the shrines were built. “Wading through flowing rivers, crossing the high mountain passes, climbing over the steep ascents, the team traversed through the hardest terrains, exploring the remotest villages,” said Additional Director Tourism, Poonam Chand. The team re-explored different ‘chattis’ established by the Baba Kali Kamli group to provide food and lodging to pilgrims in the old days. Most of the 80 ‘chattis’ were in ruins, she added. The team trekked through some high mountain passes, including Panwali Kantha, which is perched at a height of 11,500 ft in the Garhwal Himalayas. All the data would be given to the Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board to help remove and repair some of the obstructions on the route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-50-days-team-explores-24-tough-terrains-of-lost-char-dham-route/articleshow/88284857.cms||Kautilya Singh

In a month after opening the registrations, the tourism department has received proposals for as many as 213 caravans and 66 caravan parks. As many as 109 entrepreneurs have submitted proposals for 213 caravans, while 49 entrepreneurs have registered for 66 caravan parks with the tourism department. “The policy has evoked fair response among the various stakeholders in the sector. We have received proposals for launching close to 300 caravans and caravan parks across the state. These are expected to be operational from January next year,” tourism director V R Krishna Teja said. While the caravans are specially- built vehicles for travel, leisure and stay, caravan parks are designated places to park the vehicles and enable the visitors to spend a night or a day or station for an extended period to explore the destination. In its caravan policy, the government has incorporated all such norms to ensure that the concept does not have any flaws, and is environment-friendly. For example, one of the norms set for the vehicles being used as caravans is that they should comply with the BS-VI norms of emission. Also, unlike in many other states where the policy is already operational, the caravan policy framed by the state insists that there should be a sewage treatment plant (STP) or has connection to a proper sewage system along with constant power and water supply. In addition to the necessary facilities like café and a kitchen, dormitory and toilet facilities, the caravan parks should also have boundary walls with lockable gates, security guards and surveillance cameras to ensure the safety of the customers using the facility. Further, the parks should also ensure that the services of a doctor along with a well-defined mechanism to handle a medical emergency are available and the supervisory staff and the other workers should be trained in disaster management preparedness. The minimum features of a caravan must include a sofa-cum-bed for minimum two persons, kitchenette with refrigerator and a microwave oven, toilet cubicle with hand-shower and freshwater storage, communication facility between the driver and the passenger, air-conditioning, dining table, audio-video facility, internet connectivity, charging system and a GPS. After the government announced the new policy, the motor vehicles department had re-interpreted the laws to make camper-trucks and caravans legal, and the Kerala state industrial development corporation (KSIDC) has come forward to offer loans to entrepreneurs for launching caravans and caravan parks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/keravan-kerala-project-gets-213-proposals-so-far/articleshow/88284880.cms||KP Saikiran

The land was handed over to the state government to set up a 550-bed Covid hospital constructed by Tata Group. The government failed to provide alternate land as promised in lieu of the land relinquished by the board to construct the hospital. In a letter to Kasaragod district collector, CEO of Waqf board B M Jamal said that the board had issued orders to provide the Waqf land to the government to construct the hospital on the basis of the written agreement between the then Kasaragod district collector Dr D Sajith Babu and Waqf president Syed Mohammed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal on April 2020 that 1.6 hectare of alternate land would be provided to MIC. “But the MIC general secretary informed in September 2021 that even though the hospital has started operations, the promise given by the state government during the handing over of land has not been fulfilled,” the letter said. Waqf board has in the letter said that the board meeting held on December 7 had decided to take legal steps to get back the Waqf land provided to the government as it has not taken any steps to provide alternative land to the Waqf organization. “We would like to inform that the Waqf Board will be forced to take steps to get back the land if the state government does not immediately hand over the promised alternate land to the Waqf,” he said. Tata Group had handed over the 550-bed Covid hospital, which was the country’s first greenfield Covid hospital, built at a cost of Rs 60 crore at Thekkayil Village in September 2020. The hospital was built in five months using prefabricated shipping containers. The hospital had started admitting patients in October 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/waqf-board-warns-of-legal-action-over-land-given-up-for-covid-hospital/articleshow/88285843.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Tuesday, the Calcutta High Court also cleared the decks for interviewing the 33,000 candidates empanelled for over a year. These interviews will start after the SET. The litigation pertains to a 2018 advertisement by the state College Service Commission (CSC) against 2,200 vacancies. The recruitments started in 2020 and was completed in March 2021. A fresh advertisement was published in 2021 for previous year’s vacancies that could not be filled up. But by then the earlier panel’s one-year tenure lapsed, making the candidates ineligible and this prompted them to move court. Around 33,000 applicants had applied for the remaining posts. Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya while dismissing this plea on Tuesday said, “Cancelling the panel almost after one year from the date of the notification would prejudice a large number of candidates who have applied for the posts pursuant to the notification of December 2020.” “We are happy that the recruitment process will start again,” said Dipak Kar, chairperson, West Bengal CSC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/83000-to-appear-for-set-on-jan-9/articleshow/88285794.cms||---

Exchanging ideas with BJP CMs and DyCMs during two rounds of meetings with 12 BJP chief ministers and six deputy chief ministers in Varanasi on Monday evening and Tuesday morning, he also said that once this initiative gains currency in the states, they must also look at exporting their products overseas and creating a global market for the products.  The PM also emphasised the need for states to work for quality and brand creation for promoting exports of locally produced goods.  The PM called upon BJP chief ministers to carve a niche for themselves in some or the other sector of governance, telling them to “accord topmost priority to development and ‘ease of living’ for the betterment of the people.” The PM’s initial round of Mukhyamantri Parishad meeting had taken place on the same cruise on which they had gone to view the illumination at the ghats along river Ganga, laser show and Ganga Aarti on Monday evening following the grand opening of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. Besides the CMs and DyCMs, the meet was also attended by BJP national president JP Nadda and other top leaders of the party.  The deliberation focussed on sharing good governance practices for the betterment of the people. Chief ministers and deputy chief ministers made presentations and highlighted key welfare schemes of their respective states. They elaborated on innovative governance practices they have ushered in their states. Some of the best practices that were discussed included climate resilient infra projects, issuance of family identity cards, schemes for promotion of natural farming, rural livelihood programmes with self-help groups, etc., at its centre.  Reaffirming the principle of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’, the PM urged states to remove laws that have become archaic and reduce compliance burdens.  Highlighting the importance of technology in governance, PM Modi called for “governance to be data driven to ensure last mile delivery, speed and transparency”. PM Modi also spoke about the importance of youth development and women empowerment as priority sectors for every government. “There is a need to strengthen ‘Poshan Abhiyan’ and fight the menace of malnutrition,” he said, stressing on popularising a culture of sports and fitness among the youth.  In his opening remarks, Nadda lauded PM Modi’s success as he completes two decades as head of government. “BJP and good governance have become synonymous and BJP is the only party that seeks popular mandate on the basis of its performance,” Nadda said.  After the meeting, Nadda along with the BJP CMs and Deputy CMs also visited Gobardhan Project of Varanasi Development Authority, Deendayal Upadhyay Smriti Sthal and Sarnath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-exhorts-other-states-to-adopt-ups-one-dist-one-product-scheme/articleshow/88287031.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Mumbai||Malaria hits 3-year high in Mumbai, dengue cases up too||MUMBAI: Malaria cases have hit a three-year high in the city this year. Recent civic data shows that Mumbai has recorded 5,032 cases from January to December 12, up from 5,007 cases diagnosed in 2020 and 4,357 in 2019. Rajan Naringrekar, who heads the insecticide department, said at least 70% of the malaria cases can be linked to metro work. He said it was challenging to reach some of the pockets underground, where work is ongoing. The tracks and cavities on the retaining walls remain difficult spots for treatment. “Despite that, our teams have managed to treat breeding spots in some underground pockets, as well as elevated tracks which are perched on pillars,” he said.  The only silver lining is zero fatalities due to the mosquito-borne disease. The cases have mainly been reported from the island city’s wards: G-north, E and F-South. Suburbs, barring a few pockets in Kandivli, Borivli, Malad, have not reported many cases.  Another mosquito-borne disease that saw a rise this year was dengue: Compared to 129 cases previously, there have been 857 confirmed cases this year. The numbers have returned to pre-pandemic years, such as 2019, when 920 cases were reported. In the last three years, dengue has claimed three lives respectively. The BMC has not revealed the number of suspected cases, which are usually higher than confirmed cases.  Physician Dr Pratit Samdani said cases have finally started decreasing in the past few weeks, after a surge in September, October and November. After 106 cases were reported in November, it dropped to 21 till December 12.  Leptospirosis saw a significant drop in deaths, although cases remained consistent. Compared to 11 deaths in 2019, and eight in 2020, four deaths were reported this year. Gastroenteritis cases saw a significant drop for the second year in a row, with 2,818 cases reported till December 12, compared to 7,785 cases in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malaria-hits-3-yr-high-in-city-dengue-cases-up-too/articleshow/88285811.cms||---

This paves the way for junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish and other co-accused to also face attempt to murder charges. In further trouble for the accused, the court also agreed to the SIT's submission that section 35 of the Arms Act - which talks about criminal responsibility of persons in whose premises arms and ammunition are found - should be included in the FIR. This could particularly pose problems for Union minister Ajay Teni, in whose charred vehicle two empty .315 cartridges were recovered after the violence on October 3.  An SIT member told TOI, "Since it was evident during probe that it was a planned act, we requested the court to replace IPC Section 338 with that of 326 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code. Sections under the Arms Act have been added as we have recovered weapons from the accused." All the 13 accused in the case were brought to court on Tuesday. A counter-application was filed by Ashish's counsel. Providing details, senior prosecuting officer SP Yadav said, "Investigating officer Vidyaram Diwakar submitted an application in court in which it was said that the killing of farmers and a journalist was not an act of negligence, but was a deliberate planned act. The defence counsel filed a counter-application pointing out that Section 34 of IPC cannot go along with Section 149 ." The court, while agreeing to the SIT's submission, also agreed to the defence counsel's contention regarding Section 34 of IPC and ordered it to be dropped. "This development would mean all the accused will have to file fresh bail applications starting at lower court," Yadav said. Notably, the decision on the bail application of Ashish and others is pending in Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court. On October 3, four protesting farmers and a journalist were mowed down by the convoy of Ashish Mishra, following which three people in the convoy were lynched in retaliation. An FIR was registered under Sections 302 (murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 149 (offence committed in prosecution of common object), 279 (rash driving), 338 (causing grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly), 304a (causing death by negligence) and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of IPC, and 13 people, including Ashish, were arrested and sent to jail. "We are happy that the investigation is heading in the right direction. Now, we can expect that Ajay Mishra would be questioned as two cartridges were recovered from the Thar vehicle registered in his name," said Harjeet Singh, the counsel representing the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-junior-home-ministers-son-to-face-murder-attempt-charge/articleshow/88287561.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Coimbatore||City to get 500 more dumper bins||After the recent debacle in the Swachh Survekshan rankings, the civic body is all set to improve the city’s overall cleanliness by placing more bins and replacing the damaged ones with new bins to prevent residents from dumping garbage on the roadsides. That’s not all. The bins would be cleared regularly by deploying more compactor vehicles. It would, however, cost the city corporation Rs 4.45 crore, which would be used to procure 500 dumper bins and five compactor vehicles to carry waste to dump yards. Among the 48 cities with a population of more than 10 lakh, the city was placed 46th in the recent Swachh Survekshan rankings. The only time it performed comparatively well was in 2018, when it secured 18th position. Presently, the city’s performance in managing garbage is not up to the mark. While there isn’t enough number of bins in residential areas to handle the quantity of garbage being generated daily, a lion’s share of them is not in a good condition as well. As a result, garbage piling up on roadsides, next to overflowing bins, is a common sight in the city. Now, the civic body seems to be determined to manage the garbage issue more prudently and improve its cleanliness ranking. Officials said they were planning to address all the issues plaguing the garbage collection and disposal system one by one. Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara told TOI that they have sent a proposal to the commissionerate of municipal administration to purchase 500 bins and five compactors. “Procurement of equipment will begin as soon as we get the go ahead.” He, however, admitted that increasing the number of bins was not an ideal solution to improve the city’s cleanliness. “It is only a temporary solution. As per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, cities should bring down the number of bins by creating a robust door-to-door waste collection mechanism. It also calls for segregation of degradable and non-degradable waste at source.” The corporation commissioner said they would also slowly take steps to improve the door-to-door garbage collection and segregation of waste at source level. “Support from residents is very important to manage the waste collection and disposal properly.” He said while the parameters for the cleanliness rankings would not be the same every year, keeping the city clean and ensuring collection and segregation of waste were its basic responsibilities. Another corporation official said they were faring good in the waste disposal and collection front in most of the wards in the old city. “There are issues to be addressed in added wards. There are also issues with handling waste at Vellalore dump yard. Because of this, we could not handle the entire waste generated during festivals like Ayudha puja, Diwali and Pongal in a single day. We are closely looking into this issue as well.” Plaguing issues Lack of enough bins Damaged bins Irregular waste collection Officials’ take Overflowing bins are mostly found in added areas Door-to-door collection is effective in old city areas System in place More than 200 light commercial vehicles are used for door-to-door collection Around 2,100 bins are placed in city limits 11 compactor vehicles are used to to carry waste to dump yards What’s planned To buy 500 bins and 5 compactor vehicles at a cost of Rs 4.45 crore||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-to-get-500-more-dumper-bins/articleshow/88286569.cms||V Devanathan

The Delhi government and DMRC are opposing each other in SC on felling of trees for phase IV. The government is not agreeable to the submission that road side planted trees are not part of forest and submitted that they are forest as per the apex court's earlier order and forest clearance would be needed. In an affidavit filed in the apex court on construction on a stretch of 2.99 km between Keshopur to Mukarba Chowk being part of 28.920 km extension of line of MRTS project from Janakapuri West to R K Ashram of phase IV metro project, the government said that the corporation should have approached its forest department to resolve the issue. "It is submitted that if the DMRC had any issues with the aforesaid definition then the same is in the nature of a dispute and ought to have been raised before the state forest department for resolution. Further, the DMRC ought to have approached the regional office of MOEF... The DMRC without exhausting the alternative/efficacious remedies available to it, has directly approached this court," it said. "However, in the present case the DMRC submitted a written undertaking before the state forest department that it is already in the process of seeking forest clearance and on the other hand preferred the application before this court seeking a declaration. It is further submitted that the construction of metro should be in accordance with law. The DMRC is seeking to bypass the mandatory process under the Forest (Conservation) Act by directly approaching this court seeking a declaration which is impermissible and against the rule of law," it said.. Holding that construction of the metro project caused loss of vegetation as well as flora and fauna in Delhi, the Supreme Court had earlier directed the NCT government and DMRC to formulate a plan for plantation of trees and saplings to increase the green cover in the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ph-iv-dmrc-not-following-due-process-govt-tells-sc/articleshow/88286554.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Now, Kejriwal promises monthly Rs 1k to women if AAP voted to power in U'khand||Rudrapur: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday promised to pay monthly allowance of Rs 1,000 to all adult women in Uttarakhand if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is voted to power in Uttarakhand. He had a week ago made a similar announcement in Punjab, which is also going to the polls. He also vowed to address all issues to check migration from rural areas. Addressing hundreds of women in Kashipur town of Udham Singh Nagar district, he said, "In the past 20 years, you have given 10 years to BJP and as many years to Congress. Both these parties have failed to deliver on the promise of development. This time, vote for AAP. If you are not happy with our work after 5 years, vote us out." Kejriwal, who was on his fifth visit to the poll-bound state on Tuesday, had earlier promised 80 per cent job quota for people of Uttarakhand, monthly Rs 5,000 to all unemployed youths and 300 units of free electricity. Announcing that his party would carve out six new districts in the state, Kejriwal said the ‘Tirth Yatra Yojana’ – which the party started in Delhi -- will also be launched in the hill state. The Delhi CM said, "We'll facilitate free 'darshan' of Lord Ram in Ayodhya. For Muslims, we'll have the provision of free tour to Ajmer Sharif, and for Sikhs to Kartarpur Sahib.” Earlier, Kejriwal was felicitated by local party workers with a memento and a shawl. AAP's CM candidate Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd) too touched upon various issues concerning the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-kejriwal-promises-monthly-rs-1k-to-women-if-aap-voted-to-power-in-ukhand/articleshow/88284897.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Delhi||NGT: Most RWH systems are either not working or contaminating water||New Delhi: National Green Tribunal has observed that at many places where rainwater harvesting systems are installed, these are either not functional or causing contamination of groundwater. The situation needs to be remedied not only in Delhi but across India. The tribunal has directed a joint committee, comprising members from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Union ministry of Jal Shakti and Union ministry of urban development, to look into the issue. “The secretary, ministry of Jal Shakti, may call a meeting of stakeholders for further course of action in the light of above observations, followed by issuance of appropriate directions to all the states/UTs,” said the bench. The applicant in the tribunal claimed that he surveyed rainwater systems in 40 societies of Dwarka and found deficiencies. “The borewells are deeper, enabling polluted water to mix with the groundwater. This requires joint inspection of rainwater systems in all areas of Delhi to ensure proper functional design, level at which the borewell should be installed, use of gravel, coarse, sand in filter media. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has issued notice to seal the borewells of all the societies and to impose penalty, which is not justified. On surface areas of the societies, the water is wasted which should be taken to the waterbodies,” said the plea. Another joint committee constituted by NGT comprising CPCB, DJB and DPCC in its report dated November 23, 2021, said the contamination may occur in the societies due to mixing of the rainwater with the wastewater from different sources like waste washing area water with detergents having chemicals from balconies other than that of roof top rainwater and the wastewater from paved /parking areas of the societies. The joint committee said on testing of the 38 water samples taken from 31 societies, very partial contamination was observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ngt-most-rwh-systems-are-either-not-working-or-contaminating-water/articleshow/88285806.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||New national helpline to help check atrocities against SC/STs||Kochi: The ministry of social justice and empowerment has launched a national helpline against atrocities (NHAA) on SC/STs. Available as a toll-free number 14566 round the clock in English, Hindi and regional languages, the NHAA ensures proper implementation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Announcing the helpline, Union minister for social justice and empowerment Virendra Kumar said that NHAA will ensure registration of every complaint as an FIR. People can access by making a voice call either from a mobile or landline number of any telecom operator across the country. It is also available as a web-based self-service portal. The NHAA will generate informed awareness about the various provisions of the Prevention of Atrocities (PoA) Act, 1989 and the Protection of Civil Right (PCR) Act, 1955 that are aimed at ending discrimination and provide protection to all. It will ensure that every complaint is registered as FIRs, relief is provided, all registered complaints are investigated, and all chargesheets filed are prosecuted in the courts for decision, all within the given timelines in the Act. NGOs and experts working for the welfare of the downtrodden communities said that it was a welcome step. “We have to see how it gets implemented. For example, if one were to give a workplace complaint to the state commission for protection of SC/STs, we would be asked to come to the adalat at a prescribed time. However, there is also a clause that says that our complaint will be invalid if we were not there in time,” said Manjusha A K, director, School of Gandhian Thought and Development Studies, M G University. Thanks to Covid, there’s a phone in almost every home. So if the number is popularized and effective, it will work as a blessing for the victims and a deterrent to the crime. “If one were to look at the main cases like what happened to the tribal youth Madhu in Attapadi, we know that it was the social media that brought the incident to public eye. Similarly, in case of our university student Deepa, she had to bring it out in the open before action was taken. It was Deepa’s resolve that brought it out, while many are suffering silently,” said Manjusha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/new-national-helpline-to-help-check-atrocities-against-sc/sts/articleshow/88284899.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

She was rescued by firefighters with assistance from Vasco police. She is a daily wage worker for the Mormugao Municipal Council. A portion of the deserted well gave way when Gadekar climbed on it, causing her to fall in. PSI Swapnil Naik reached the site and tried to calm her. He extended a rope into the well for her to hold on to till help arrived. Firefighters then safely brought her out with a ladder.

---||Hyderabad||‘Flood-hit roads in Secunderabad Cantonment area to get makeover soon’||B Ajith Reddy, chief executive officer of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board answers queries from TOI readers on work being done to fix streetlights, remove illegal structures and improve quality of playgrounds in the area. While potholes in other parts of the city are getting fixed, the ones in SCB are getting deeper and more dangerous by the day. I do not think they will be able to withstand one more monsoon. Can these not be repaired in time?— EVSV SarmaThe SCB has been taking up re-carpeting of all main roads and internal roads periodically and a separate team has been engaged for filling potholes as and when detected. In this financial year alone the SCB has executed re-carpeting of 12 main roads. Some of the roads which were extensively damaged during monsoon and floods of October 2020 will be taken up soon. There are roads that are under management and maintenance of state government bodies like HRDCL, R&B and GHMC too which require immediate attention. There is a serious lack of fire safety mechanism in the SCB area. We need fire engines and trained firefighters to tackle accidents and unforeseen emergencies. I request you to please take up this as one of your top priorities. — Pola BalaswamyThe fire safety measures and mechanism are being supervised by the Telangana State Disaster Response & Fire Services. The buildings are fire audited by the department. The SCB has allotted prime land to the fire department at free of cost for establishing a fire station and the same is under construction. It will be commissioned soon. I live in Banjara Nagar Colony and the two issues that are common in this area, as well as the rest of SCB, are open drains/nalas and lack of streetlights. Please tell us what is being done to address these concerns. — Om Prakash ThallaThe specific location of the drain is not mentioned in the complaint. There are two or more Banjara Nagar Colonies in Secunderabad Cantonment. If the exact location is furnished, the matter can be taken up for further necessary action. With regard to streetlights, as per the agreement with EESL regular maintenance of streetlights is done by them and based on the requirement for installation of new streetlight poles or lighting fixtures, it is provided by SCB. For such requirements citizens can register through e-Chhawani and the complaints will be resolved/closed subsequently. I am a resident of West Marredpally where the colony layout was approved around 45 years ago. Yet, till date we do not have a proper drinking water facility. Are you doing anything to address water issues in the SCB belt? — Sandeep KalliamIn order to improve the piped drinking water network in the old layout, the concerned RWA can write to SCB for the laying of the new network. Accordingly, each household will need to deposit Rs 10,000 for water connection as development charges to lay a new drinking water pipeline. The dog menace in various parts of the Cantonment area is uncontrollable. There are no dedicated animal catching cells in cantonment like in GHMC areas where we can complain on these matters. Could you help? — Krishna VLike GHMC, there is a system to catch dogs, sterilise them and then release them in the same locality. On an average, 300 dogs are sterilised every month. Any complaint in this regard can be registered on the e-Chhawani portal or you can contact your area sanitary supervisor. School buildings, classrooms, playground and libraries are the most important aspect of school infrastructure. Spacious and well- ventilated classrooms are a must in schools. Properly planned school infrastructure is a key to effective teaching and learning, which is not there in the Cantonment. What are your thoughts? — Ravindra SankiSCB does not maintain any schools on its own. However, for any permission to establish schools, the above factors are taken into consideration. The SCB maintains libraries in its own buildings where there is definite scope for improvement. The Bowenpally playground has recently been brought into use and there are demands from other areas too to provide certain infrastructure for playgrounds and SCB is actively looking into it. Would like to know about road widening works which were earmarked almost a decade ago but have not been implemented. Why? Also, vehicles parked on the road outside wine shops, especially during the evening, are a nuisance. Can something be done about it? — Issac JohnThe road widening works involve transfer of defence land to state government agencies. The same is under process and wherever there is no defence land involved, road widening works are taken up by SCB. However, the issue of illegal parking shall be brought to the notice of the city traffic police. All buildings need to be measured for calculating property tax. I suggest the job be given to a third party to calculate the correct square feet so that residents pay honestly. It would also be good to involve public representatives. Do you agree? — Venkata ManojAny discrepancy in arriving at the calculation of property tax can be brought to my notice so that corrective measures can be taken. The methodology used to arrive at a certain amount of property tax is clearly elucidated on the website. Hiring a third party for measurements is a good suggestion and will be investigated. All through SCB there are permanent structures that have come up illegally alongside the roads. Can you tell us what your office is doing to address this? — Suresh BallaThis office is regularly taking action against illegal and unauthorised constructions. However, the exact location may be furnished for taking further necessary action. Bottlenecks at various places like the one at old Bowenpally near Spencer Mall, has not only led to traffic snarls but increased levels of air pollution across many parts of the SCB. What measures are being taken to address these problems? — T Narayan SwamyThe Cantonment limits ends at the Spencer Mall and the road leading towards old Bowenpally is under the jurisdiction of Kukatpally Municipality. Steps are being taken to clear bottle necks in the Secunderabad Cantonment belt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/flood-hit-roads-to-get-makeover-soon/articleshow/88285813.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Scheduled caste man hangs himself after decade of torment in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: A man chronicled the torture he faced for a decade because of his caste and ultimately he hanged himself with his widowed mother’s sari on December 10, the International Human Rights Day. His diary found by his family members has now been considered his suicide note on the basis of which police have named two persons for abetting his suicide. The victim was a resident of Indiranagar near Lambha village. The deceased, Dilip Solanki, 35, belonged to the Scheduled Caste Valimiki community. He lived with his mother Leela and was a daily wager. On the afternoon of December 10, Solanki came home and his mother told him to have lunch. But he said he would have his meal with her and she went for a bath. When she returned, she found him hanging from a ceiling fan with her sari tied around his neck. Aslali police had initially registered a case of accidental death. Solanki’s relatives, including his sister and her two daughters, arrived later for the funeral rituals. When the family members were checking his belongings, they found his diary but as most of them were illiterate, they did not understand the contents. Eventually, Solanki’s niece Ashwini began reading his diary and the pain that he had endured came alive for the family. The diary started recording his ordeal from February 2010 when one Vishal and his mother Hansa abused him with casteist slurs. “They abused me, they abused my mother, they abused my community and religion, and I could not do anything,” Solanki wrote. “Had I been Dilipsinh Darbar and not Dilip Solanki that I am, I would not have faced such consequences.” The diary noted that Vishal and Hansa used to abuse and thrash him and because he belonged to a particular section of society, he could not stop them, let alone retaliate. The diary said that the two had links with some powerful people which gave them impunity. They continually tormented him and his family. He also wrote about being beaten by the two and how helpless he was. On the basis of the diary, Aslali police on Monday charged the two for abetment to suicide. Meanwhile, they are trying to figure out Solanki’s connection to the mother-son duo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/scheduled-caste-man-hangs-himself-after-decade-of-torment-in-gujarat/articleshow/88284895.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Kolkata||Higher consumption in winter and Christmas cakes push up egg prices in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The production of Christmas cakes and more consumption of eggs in winter led to a yawning demand-supply gap, thus pushing the prices up. The retail price of eggs jumped to Rs 7 a piece from Rs 6.5 two days ago. The prices are likely to rise further with a skyrocketing demand. “The Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) usually requires 80 lakh to one crore poultry eggs a day. In December, the egg consumption surpassed that amount by 20-30 lakh a day. Since it is a tradition among Kolkatans to have home-baked cakes in the run-up to Christmas, we need to import eggs from neighbouring states to meet the demand,” said Madan Mohan Maity, secretary of West Bengal Poultry Federation. Moreover, egg is a pocket-friendly protein alternative for fish, which is costlier. “Both fish and mutton are now too expensive. Naturally, people tend to consume more eggs. The price of eggs jumps around this time of the year due to the demand-supply gap. The prices may plunge early next year as the production improves,” said Sujit Ghosh, a egg dealer. “Every year, egg prices tend to go north since Kali Puja. This year we managed to keep the retail price under Rs 6 a piece. After a long time, egg price rose this season,” said N C Pradhan, an egg retailer at Gariahat market. The consumption of eggs in Kolkata is pegged at around 1 crore per day — nearly a third of the statewide demand. While the organised hatcheries in the state produce 1 crore eggs a day, others produce another 1 crore eggs daily. The remaining 80 lakh is sourced from other states, mainly Andhra Pradesh. The state's consumption is around 2.8 crore eggs a day. Temperature fluctuations in late November and early December also caused substantial chicken mortality that also affected the egg production. If the temperature declines steadily, the production of eggs will increase, said a hatchery owner. Poultry business suffered a huge loss in 2020. “To revive the business, hatcheries are taking fresh loans and that is adding to their interest burden,” said Maity. He added that the supplies, which are down by 25%-30%, would be restored in the next couple of months as the chicken population increases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/higher-consumption-in-winter-and-christmas-cakes-push-up-egg-prices/articleshow/88285802.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said the fire broke out at the landfill site on Saturday and the committee has been directed to look into all possible reasons behind the fire and submit a detailed report within two days. He said based on this report, the environment department will take appropriate action to ensure such instances do not occur in future. Rai said, “The committee will be headed by senior environmental engineer DK Singh, with senior scientific officer Chetna and environmental engineer Rajiv Sharma as its other members.” The environment minister said, “We have also directed the department to take all necessary steps. It was discovered that due to the fire at the Bhalswa landfill site, piles of garbage were spilled everywhere around the site and the smoke made the air barely breathable for the people around. Reportedly, many such unfortunate instances of fires have taken place in the past, but North Delhi Municipal Corporation has not taken any action to prevent them.” He added, “Burning of garbage significantly contributes to the pollution levels, and the amount of smoke it generates is harmful enough to cause serious problems in even healthy individuals. Hence, a committee has been constituted by the Kejriwal government to investigate the matter.” A senior north corporation official, who wished not to be named, said, “When methane gas comes into contact with oxygen, it causes smoke. We controlled the smoke within five-seven minutes on Saturday. We have deployed machinery and staff in three shifts for 24 hours at Bhalswa landfill site to immediately control such incidents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-sets-up-3-member-panel-to-probe-bhalswa-landfill-fire/articleshow/88285825.cms||---

---||Kochi||‘Customised early warning system needed’||Kochi: Climate change and Kerala’s October landslides feature as the cover story in the latest edition of ‘Kerala Calling’— the official magazine of the public relations department. Titled ‘Harbinger of Kerala’s response to global warming’, it points out that flash floods and landslides are the realizations of an accelerating pattern of extreme weather in Kerala in response to global warming. The heavy rain received over a shorter period may lead to high runoff, erode soil and leach nutrients at a faster rate, says the article written by S Abhilash, P Vijay Kumar and Abhiram Nirmal CS of Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR), Cochin University. Stating that plenty of weather information is available from public, private and open-source data platforms, only an integration of the multi-level information and region-specific customization of the early warning system is the need of the hour. The authors point out that the onslaught of landslides induced by meso-scale ‘mini cloudburst’ events are proliferating in Kerala as is evident from back-to-back events during 2019, 2020 and 2021. An increase in rainfall intensity poses a rising probability for landslides in the high to mid-land slopes of Western Ghats in eastern Kerala during the monsoon seasons. It mentions that on Oct 13 this year there was presence of an “offshore vortex” embedded in the offshore trough in the Arabian Sea, which is normally active during the monsoon season. By Oct 16, this slow-moving low-pressure system crept east and entered central Kerala. When the system entered interior lands, scattered clusters of thunderclouds began to pop up along the Kottayam-Idduki borders as the local terrain provided extra push to move the moist air upwards. As a result, deep cumulonimbus clouds reaching as high as 15 km above surface were formed, extending from Peermade down to Thodupuzha along the Kottayam-Idukki borders across the Koottickal-Kokkayar region. Some valley sections in this region are very narrow strips with steep slopes. As evident from the satellite images, organized meso-scale deep cloud clusters covering 500-800 sq km area resulted in heavy downpours in just two hours. ‘Months’ worth of rainfall (during October) fell in 2-4 hours around the Kottayam-Idukki district borders resulting in severe flooding, leading to dozens of casualties and huge economic losses. At the time of this heavy rainfall event, soils were in part already saturated. Water spread across more than 1,000 sq km for a short duration caused the pre-saturated soils to slide down. Rainfall in the catchment areas of the Manimala river basin resulted in flash flood situations on the river banks running across Kottayam, Pathanamthitta to Alappuzha districts. Due to this flood water, Kuttanad region witnessed an increase in water levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customised-early-warning-system-needed/articleshow/88284931.cms||---

ITFoK, which was being organized annually by the Academy here, could not be held this year due to the Covid-19 regulations. The plays to be staged during the ‘Hope Fest’ will be linked by an overarching theme of pandemic theatre, the academy officials said. They said they had started the preparation for ITFoK early this year, but later it became clear that showcasing a full-fledged ITFoK would not be feasible this year considering the pandemic. The ‘Hope Fest’ will be organized in a hybrid mode with online and off-line presentations of the plays from India and abroad. However, the academy officials said the decision on how many plays will be live-streamed and how many will be off-line is yet to be finalized. They said the ‘Hope Fest’ will be held only for three days instead of the 10-day long ITFoK. The festival will begin on December 29 and will conclude on December 31. Altogether 19 plays will be presented during the event. The duration of the plays will also be scaled down. All the plays to be staged in the ‘Hop Fest’ will be less than 60 minutes of duration, whereas there were no such restrictions for the ITFoK plays. The entry to the festival will be free, and entry passes will be issued both online and off-line, the officials said. The audience will be permitted into the theatre complex only after ensuring compliance of Covid-19 restrictions. One of the additional programmes this year is an exhibition of rare photographs taken during the last 12 editions of ITFoK starting from 2008. The exhibition will start from December 25 and will continue till January 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hope-fest-to-replace-itfok-this-year/articleshow/88284936.cms||T Ramavarman

The HC bench of Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice SG Dige took on record the petitioner's contention that respondents have not taken steps for removal of the encroachment on the property which is now in possession of National Textile Corporation Limited, New Delhi. The petition has been filed by Board’s representative Sardar Manjeet Singh along with two others including president and superintendent have contended that if the central government fails to return the entire land or any portion of it to the Board, it should compensate the Board appropriately. The cost of land runs into multiple crores of rupees. Through their lawyer Ganesh Gadhe, the petitioners have contested that it was the duty of the central government as well as the department concerned to take care of the land, which is said to have witnessed encroachment. "However, they utterly failed in the performance of their duties. Since 1987, the leasehold land is in idle condition and there has been no utilization for the purpose it was given on lease. Despite several requests for release of the lease deed, no favourable response was given on technical ground," they said. The petition also contested that it was the duty of the respondents to ensure that such properties are not causing unnecessary loss to the government. The petition also states that earlier there have been multiple communications by the Board requesting to return land, but textile department replied stating that the land is vested to the central government and its approval is necessary for premature release of the land. It was on January 7, the general manager of Nanded textile mills requested for renewal of the lease deed for another 99 years and the request letter contended that the leasehold premises is vested absolutely with the central government under the sick textile undertaking (nationalization act, 1974). The land belonging to Gurdwara was give on lease in the year 1922.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-directs-notice-to-osman-shahi-textile-mill/articleshow/88284022.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Union home minister Amit Shah is likely to be the chief guest,” said SDMC standing committee chairman Col (retd) BK Oberoi. The site has 21 replicas of famous monuments. The civic body has combined soothing music with at least 200 shades of lights to amplify the beauty of each of these replicas. The monuments are constructed from abandoned vehicles and other waste material. These replicas included Charminar, Gateway of India, Konark Temple, Nalanda ruins, Mysore Palace, Meenakshi Temple, Hawa Mahal, Hampi ruins, Victoria Memorial, Sanchi Stupa, Gol Gumbaz, Ajanta and Ellora caves and Junagarh Fort. “Unlike the Waste to Wonder Park where static lights are used, here we are using dynamic (multiple shades) lights at each replica to highlight the delicate artwork,” said an official. The standing committee has, meanwhile, rejected the civic agency’s proposals to develop a Bollywood Park at an eight-acre site in Safdarjung Enclave and a Dinosaur Park at three-acre land at Sarai Kale Khan (on the Waste To Wonder Park campus) using the same concept. “The officials had proposed to develop the sites in the PPP mode. But we are against this. Since the land and material will be provided by us, why should a contractor share the revenue in the future, just for making these replicas?

It all began with the mass uprooting of avenue trees in 2012, for widening of the road to ease pressure on Diamond Harbour Road (DHR). The continuous digging for laying underground sewer line and water connections, under Kolkata Environment Improvement Project, and poor road restoration has turned the area into a dust bowl. This happens because of resuspension of the dust caused by the dry mud left on the road on either flank of James Long Sarani. Even ATMs along the road get frequently defunct. “The servers cannot tolerate so much dust,” said an employee of a bank situated on the road. The signs of mounting air pollution are ubiquitous. “Despite cleaning everyday, we can’t escape the thick layer of dust that accumulates again, though we live on the fourth floor,” said Abhishek Agarwal, a CA student. Serious breathing distress has been common among the residents. “We have become used to living with asthma, COPD, lower respiratory tract infection,” said S Mukherjee, a retired man staying near Purba Pally. Saviour and Friends of Environment (SAFE), who independently monitor air quality at different parts of the city said, “Just before the early December rain, we measured PM2.5 at an alarming level of 278-370 microgram per cubic meter of ambient air at Behala Chowrastain 24hr average. The safe limit is 60 microgram per cubic meter. It will be far worse on James Long Sarani,” said Sudipto Bhattacharya of SAFE. An average resident is inhaling almost 6-7 times higher pollutants. Biswanath Dutta, who lives close to James Long Sarani and Roy Bahadur Road crossing, said, “The road takes as much load as DHR, yet the surface is very poor compared to DHR. After laying pipelines the repair work was not done properly. We splash water thrice a day, but with little effect.” Numerous craters along James Long Sarani has made life troublesome for motorists. “Since I travel by two wheeler, I take extreme caution while navigating through James Long. The craters are death-traps,” said Saroj Giri, resident of Behala Janakalyan. “I bought a transparent plastic curtain to prevent dust from entering my shop. But we felt suffocation inside. So I had to take it off. In fact the dust is so thick that none of the articles we sell look new. It is affecting health and business,” said Shubhojyoti Adhikari, who runs a hardware shop. KMC has promised to look into the dust accumulation matter. “Any underground work causes inconvenience to people. Since the work is very challenging, we sometimes miss deadline. But we restore the road immediately. We will certainly look into this issue,” said a KMC engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relentless-digging-and-tree-felling-turn-james-long-into-dust-bowl-pushing-up-pollution-level/articleshow/88285835.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

In each ward, a night mobile team or a vaccination centre will be open from 6pm to 10pm. These mobile teams will work at railway stations, slums and similar settlements and construction sites. The night teams will focus on vaccinating labourers, late working employees, street-dwellers, hawkers, among other groups that cannot afford to take a day off from work for the shot. In Mumbai, with 60,370 jabs on Tuesday, 80.25% of 92.3 lakh people are fully vaccinated. “Till date 105% citizens have taken the first dose and 80% second. This means 20% citizens have not taken the second dose yet,’’ said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. He said the first day turnout was low as people were not aware of the service, expecting it to rise. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-starts-night-vaccination-to-boost-second-dose-uptake/articleshow/88285839.cms||---

He said that Rajasthan has emerged as a solar energy hub in the country. Bhati was addressing the award distribution function organised on National Energy Conservation Day at Vidyut Bhawan on Tuesday. The minister said there are favourable conditions for renewable energy due to the availability of sunlight for 325 days out of 365 days of the year. “Our weakness, the scorching desert and the dusty storms, have become our strength today. Investment is coming in the state and employment opportunities are increasing for the youth,” he said. Bhati said whether it is PM Kisan Yojana or renewable energy generation or energy efficiency or energy conservation, Rajasthan has become a leading state in all fields. The department has started the work of energy audit and have taken initiative to prevent wastage of power and ensure quality supply. Additional chief secretary (energy) Subodh Agrawal said that in the field of solar energy, this one year could be seen as the golden year of the state. A record 2,200 MW capacity solar power plants have been set up in 2021-22 this year. The bureau of energy efficiency of the central government has declared Rajasthan as the front-runner state, and the state has been rewarded for its remarkable achievements in the field of energy conservation at a function held in New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-top-choice-for-investors-in-the-field-of-solar-energy-min/articleshow/88286575.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||7 new Omicron cases in Mumbai, 1 in Vasai-Virar; all from 1 office||MUMBAI: Eight new cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant were reported from Maharashtra on Tuesday, taking the count of infections linked to the variant to 28 in the state. Seven of the cases from Mumbai and one from Vasai-Virar were part of one office cluster, officials confirmed. Civic health authorities said all the infected individuals were co-workers of a London returnee who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the first week of December. As part of contact tracing, the samples of his family members and co-workers were tested. The samples found positive for Covid-19 were sent for genome sequencing to NIV, Pune and Omicron was detected, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The index patient is hospitalised while the remaining seven are in home isolation. Kakani said they have carried out contact tracing of all the positive cases and none of their immediate families have tested positive. Their low-risk contacts are also being traced. The person considered the index case had returned from London on December 3 and had visited the office where he met the colleagues, Kakani said. “Offices have to be cautious that Covid protocols are followed,” he said, adding that the foreign returnee was vaccinated with both doses of Pfizer. State officials said three patients are completely asymptomatic and five have mild symptoms. Seven were fully vaccinated and one was unvaccinated, they added. All are in the 24-41 age bracket. The state officials said none had a history of foreign travel. While one had travelled to Bangalore and another to Delhi, the source is believed to be the man who returned from overseas. Importantly, seven of the eight have already tested negative for Covid after their initial positive reports. Allaying fears of community transmission, a state official said since they were all linked to a foreign traveller, these cannot be termed as cases of local transmission. Of the 28 cases in Maharashtra now, Mumbai has the highest (12), followed by Pimpri-Chinchwad (10) and Pune (2). Kalyan-Dombivli, Nagpur, Latur and Vasai-Virar have one case each. After Pimpri-Chinchwad, where 10 cases were from a family cluster, this is the second big cluster found in the state. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid taskforce, said these are sporadic and travel-related cases. “We shouldn’t panic. Instead, we should keep our guard high,” he said. He cautioned anyone with even the slightest of flu-like symptoms should isolate and get tested. Meanwhile, state officials tested 13,615 people returning from at-risk countries and found 30 positive. Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing. Five who have reached Satara—three each from South Africa, and one each from the UK and New Zealand —tested positive on Tuesday. Kolhapur too has got two positive foreign returnees. A 49-year-old man from Mali tested positive in Nashik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-7-new-omicron-cases-in-city-1-in-vasai-virar-all-from-1-office/articleshow/88285832.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Pune||IMD officials indicate mild winter; Maharashtra yet to feel chill||PUNE: This winter in all likelihood would be mild, especially with normal to higher than normal night temperatures in several regions of the country, senior IMD officials said on Tuesday. Barring some parts of central Maharashtra and parts of extreme north India (Ladakh), the minimums are likely to be normal to above normal in many parts of northwest India (Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand), most parts of south (parts of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Odisha) and northeast India, and some areas along the foothills of the Himalayas, a recent India Meteorological Department (IMD) winter outlook on temperatures during December 2021 to February 2022 stated. In contrast, below normal maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country, except over some parts of northwest India and most parts of northeast India, where normal to above normal maximum temperatures are most likely. Below normal maximums are likely over Maharashtra during winter, the outlook indicated. The IMD’s recent Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) forecast has also indicated La Niña conditions likely to strengthen and peak to moderate conditions during winter. D S Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “La Nina conditions generally cause below normal temperatures in India. However, La Nina is not expected to be very strong in the coming months and will continue to be weak to moderate in winter (January-February 2022 period). Moreover, we have strong easterly activity over peninsular India off late. This is causing above normal minimum temperatures to prevail over parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and South peninsular India, setting off any La Nina effect.” He said, “Low latitude tropical systems are stronger this winter, causing easterly dominance. This is also preventing cold northerly wind penetration further southward, restricting it to extreme north India. Even winter precipitation is likely to be below normal in most parts of northwest India this winter.” Senior IMD scientist and head of Surface Instruments Division (SID) at the Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune, K S Hosalikar, told TOI, “Even the extended range forecast shows below normal maximum temperatures in parts of Maharashtra during the next few days, but normal to above normal minimums.” He said, “Minimum temperature records of the last couple of days in regions such as Madhya Maharashtra and Vidarbha, are witnessing positive departures to the tune of 4-5ºC. Winte does not seem to have set in Maharashtra, including Pune, except some occasional windows of night temperature drop.” Though Tuesday's forecast did not indicate any significant changes in the temperatures in northwest and central India in the next 2-3 days, Hosalikar said, there could be a gradual drop in the minimum temperatures thereafter in north Maharashtra, adjoining Marathwada and parts of Vidarbha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/imd-officials-indicate-mild-winter-maha-yet-to-feel-chill/articleshow/88285840.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Ahmedabad||Public sector banks in Gujarat to stay shut on Thursday, Friday||AHMEDABAD: Public sector banks (PSBs) across Gujarat are expected to remain shut on Thursday and Friday, as bank officers and other employees are set to hold a strike to protest against the proposed privatization of PSBs. About 4,800 bank branches will remain shut across the state for two days, impacting transactions worth Rs 20,000 crore, suggest the estimates of Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA). “The shutdown of banks impacts businesses in a big way. Bankers may have genuine issues but keeping the banks shut does not help businesses,” said Pathik Patwari, senior vice-president of Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI). Patwari added: “Nationalized banks have a wide network in smaller towns and villages. Therefore, businesses there will also be adversely impacted due to the two consecutive days of shutdown.” Online transactions can be made but the formalities that require to be attended to at the banks will be possible only after the banks open. About 70,000 bank personnel and officers are expected to go on strike. They will join the nationwide stir of public sector banks. Janak Rawal, the general secretary of MGBEA, said: “Bank officers and other employees are against the Banking Regulation Act which proposes to privatize national banks.” Rawal added: “Government schemes are effectively implemented by public sector banks and instead of strengthening them, the government has pushed for shutting them.” Rawal said that public money is for public welfare and it should not be moved to private hands. “In fact, recruitment in the banking sector will also take a hit with the proposed privatization,” Rawal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/public-sector-banks-in-gujarat-to-stay-shut-on-thursday-friday/articleshow/88284938.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Realised my passion for food||By Shreya Mundra I have always loved to cook but with a full-time job, I could never pursue cooking. Fortunately, the lockdown happened. I had ample time on hand and that led to the beginning of my home kitchen named with the support of my mother and younger sister. I was clueless on how to handle those overwhelming responses as we did not hire any outside help but then my joint family came to my rescue. My entire family helped me when there were too many orders to dispatch. Not just procuring material was a task at that time but also hygiene had become a top priority. I had to ensure that quality could not be compromised at any cost as customers trusted us to deliver fresh home-cooked food with restaurant-like taste. We ensured that we use the best quality products and ensured three-layered packing with absolutely no contact delivery. In January 2021 I happened to enter a competition organised to support women entrepreneurs. Starting from 8000 entries to emerge as a winner at a national level was a great push for newcomers like me. Due to lack of finances, I could not open a cloud kitchen. However, on winning the competition I got financial help which helped me inch closer to my dream. Soon, people will be able to order their homely meal from my very own cloud kitchen. (The writer is a legal practitioner) ............................... Spent time with my computer By N Sourya Praharsha All of us had a similar experience during the lockdown period since we were all under home arrest. For many people, it was a boon as it helped them spend some quality time with their family – something they could not do earlier because they were very busy in their day-to-day work and did not have enough time. Many people with low incomes suffered a lot. Those who stayed at home learned new things, found out many things and explored new technologies. Even I, as a student, did the same. The main thing I learnt is how to use certain programmes on the computer, which I had a little knowledge of until now. Due to online classes and the continuous usage of the system I learnt how to type fast and complete my work faster. I also explored new technologies and updates in various mobile apps that I could not pursue before due to my schoolwork, tuition etc. I am happy that I have learnt something rather than wasting it. I am sure this will help me in the future. (The writer is a student of class 8) ………………….. Learnt to face my fears By Vyshnavi Konakalla Covid-19 was a blessing as well as a curse to me at the same time. It gave me moments that I cannot forget and will cherish forever with my family. I started doing yoga with the family and I also developed the habit of reading more and more books. This new interest in reading books helped me cope up with the emotional pain that I was feeling after my father’s death during the second wave of the pandemic. Life has thrown sticks and stones at me, but I turned those situations into opportunities that helped me become who I am today. Books taught me that at some point adversity hits everyone’s life. It usually comes unannounced and doesn’t arrive with flowers and candy. If my dad knew a day like this would come, he would want his little girl to be strong and overcome every hurdle that life throws at me. So, during this phase of my life – which was no less than a nightmare -- I also gathered the strength and courage to overcome my fears, faults and uncertainties. At 22, I decided to become an entrepreneur. Today I am the first woman from my family to be handling my family business which is 45-years young. I have strong business goals that I wish to achieve and evolve as a woman entrepreneur who embraces all challenges and inspires other people of my age to take bold steps towards their career.

---||Kolkata||Zoo, Victoria to stay shut on poll day||Kolkata: Places of tourist interest, including Victoria Memorial Hall, zoo and Birla Planetarium, will be shut on Sunday, the day KMC elections are scheduled. But Indian Museum, Science City and BITM, which also draw tourists in fair numbers, are yet to take a call. Sources said the State Election Commission had asked Victoria, zoo and planetarium to keep the places shut to avoid drawing too many people from outside the city. South 24 Parganas DM P Ulganathan, also the district electoral officer of KMC polls, discussed the closure of major tourist spots with 16 observers, nine deputy police commissioners and other officials at a meeting on Tuesday. The shutdown was suggested also to prevent traffic chaos. VMH curator Jayanta Sengupta told TOI the museum and the garden would be closed as per the Negotiable Instruments Act so that employees could cast their vote. But Indian Museum and Science City officials said a shutdown of central government establishments was not mandatory during civic elections. “We will decide on Wednesday whether to stay shut or open,” said the director of Indian Museum and National Council of Science Museums Arijit Datta Chowdhury. At the meeting, imposing of Sec 144 CrPC in the city a day before the polls was discussed. Vigil on pople’s movement will be increased and additional check points will be set up at the entry points to the city in coordination with cops in Howrah, Bidhannagar, Barrackpore, Baruipur and Diamond Harbour. The process of ferrying EVMs between the strong room and polling stations was discussed. The EVMs will be under CCTV monitoring. Police officers also discussed force deployment at the 16 EVM distribution and collection centres. The DM said two armed guards will be at single booths but at places with multiple booths, a sub-inspector will be deployed, besides an inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zoo-victoria-to-stay-shut-on-poll-day/articleshow/88285855.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Pune||People in merged areas seek water tax waiver||Pune: Residents and elected members of merged villages have demanded waiver of water tax from the property tax component of the Pune Municipal Corporation on the ground that they have not been getting adequate water after the merger. “It is an injustice for people in merged areas. They have to pay tax even when they are not getting water. The component of water tax should be removed from the property tax till the water supply is started on a regular basis,” said Ganesh Dhore, an elected member of the PMC. Proposal regarding the same has been tabled before the standing committee. “Even after the merger, the villages have to depend on tankers for water supply. Only big promises were made by the PMC about good water supply. But nothing has translated into action at the ground level,” said Sanjay Dimble, a resident of Yewalewadi. Residents of these areas have demanded charging of taxes at rates charged by the grampanchayats. “ The civic body cannot give waiver on these charges. The remaining charges, including water tax, go to the PMC’s kitty. The civic body can give a waiver, but approval of the standing committee and general body committee is needed for it,” said a senior PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/people-in-merged-areas-seek-water-tax-waiver/articleshow/88285851.cms||---
---||Mumbai||More than 80% of Mumbai residents fully vaxxed||MUMBAI: More than 80% people above the age of 18 years have taken two shots of the vaccine against Covid-19 in Mumbai, making it the first among major cities to reach the milestone. Even within Maharashtra, the city has achieved the highest full vaccination coverage. BMC commissioner IS Chahal told TOI that the target now is to vaccinate the entire eligible population of 92.3lakh by the end of January. According to CoWin, a total of 1.71crore doses have been administered in the city, fully immunizing nearly 74lakh people, while giving at least one shot to 97.79lakh (106%) since January. Among other major cities, Delhi has fully vaccinated 98.47lakh, or 65.6% of its eligible population, while Chennai has given two shots to 63%. Bengaluru urban was the first among major cities to reach 80% second dose coverage. Mumbai is much ahead of the state average, where 51% of the population have got both shots, while 85.3% have received at least one. Pune is a distant second having achieved 70% second dose coverage. According to Soumitra Ghosh, associate professor from Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management, TISS, education and awareness made a big difference as people tend to understand the benefits of vaccination. Measures such as linking entry to shopping malls, local train travel and public transport played a part in pushing people to get vaccinated, he added. Also, with the city being the financial capital, there was a lot of attention on Mumbai and the pace of vaccination here, said an official. Mumbai rapidly augmented its infrastructure, opening more centres and decentralising them. It also had the advantage of the private sector that administered over 60lakh doses, the highest in the country perhaps. Recent data from the state health department showed the city has more than 6lakh people who have completed the interval between two shots but haven’t yet the second dose. Achieving 100% coverage is daunting and hence the civic body must direct its efforts towards fully vaccinating the vulnerable and immunocompromised, said Dr Om Srivastava, an infectious disease expert and a member of the state Covid taskforce. “The last mile is always the most difficult and focus has to be put there,” he said. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said all ward war rooms have been engaged to contact people who haven’t taken the second shots and motivate them to take it. Dr Srivastava meanwhile emphasised that the corporation must study the immunity levels in the population, particularly T-cell immunity more than antibodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/more-than-80-of-mumbai-residents-doubly-vaxxed/articleshow/88285853.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Akhilesh, who was in Jaunpur to begin the fresh round of Vijay Yatra on Tuesday, tweeted: “I wish the PM a long life. Never wished the PM ill. When I said people go to Kashi in their final days, I meant the end of the BJP government. I am a proud Hindu but I don’t sell my religion for votes.” Replying to a query on PM’s visit to Varanasi, Akhilesh had on Monday said, “It is a good thing. He can stay there not for just one month, but for two or three months. It is a place to stay and people spend their last days in Banaras. The remark drew sharp reaction from various BJP leaders. Meanwhile, criticising Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for not taking a holy dip in the Ganga with Prime Minister Narendra Modi before entering Kashi Vishwanath Dham, he said the CM knew that the rivers in UP were not clean. “The CM is well aware that the water of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers is not clean, therefore, he did not take a bath in the Ganga when the PM was taking a holy dip.” “Nobody can take a dip in Yamuna if the water from Chambal does not fall into it. The condition of Gomti in Jaunpur is not hidden from anyone,” he said. Targeting BJP-led governments at the Centre and in states on the issues of inflation and farmers, Akhilesh said the double engine government had failed on all fronts. He said people are going to ensure victory of SP on 400 seats in coming assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/a-day-after-jibe-sp-chief-says-didnt-wish-pm-modi-ill/articleshow/88287056.cms||---

Police have not yet arrested anyone in the case. The 28-year-old victim lives with his family in Pitampura and has a business of paper lamination rolls. The incident took place near his house around 9.30 am. “I came out from my house and was walking towards my car when three youths waylaid me. One of the accused was carrying a pistol. At gunpoint, they snatched my bag, which contained over Rs 2 lakh cash, cancelled cheques and some official documents, and fled the spot on a bike,” the complainant told the cops. A case under sections 392 (punishment for robbery), 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of IPC was later registered at Mangolpuri police station.

---||Ahmedabad||HC: Don’t disturb natural or artificial waterbodies in Gujarat||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday granted interim relief in a PIL and restrained the state authorities from disturbing or changing the use of any natural or artificial ponds, check dams or other waterbodies in the state. While issuing interim directions to the state authorities and chief town planner, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta issued notices to the authorities concerned in response to the PIL filed by two NGOs — Paryavaran Mitra and Ahinsa Mahasangh — demanding a survey of all water bodies including check dams and artificial waterbodies in urban areas. The NGOs want the authorities to publish a complete list of waterbodies in the official gazette with details such as depth and location and sought court directions for their maintenance and preservation. The PIL filed through advocate N M Kapadia cited the case of a man-made waterbody in Vadodara, which faces encroachment due to a town planning scheme and asserted that there is no legal protection expressly provided to check dams and waterbodies on private land. There is no provision to ensure such waterbodies are not damaged under the guise of acquisition in a TP scheme. The petitioners have maintained that the TP authorities pick and choose in notifying waterbodies and do not notify waterbodies created for rainwater harvesting. The PIL also sought directions for proper implementation of a resolution of the chief town planner from 1999, for protection of such waterbodies while devising TP schemes. It has also demanded the formation of an expert committee to take concrete steps to increase the number of waterbodies and green cover. The PIL contended that Gujarat has just 2% of the country’s water resources with 5% of the country’s population. Total water availability in Gujarat is 50 billion cubic metres (BCM) with 38 BCM of surface water and 12 BCM of groundwater. In this situation, when there is heavy reliance on man-made waterbodies, strong emphasis must be laid on protecting them. There are various government schemes due to which thousands of check dams and lakes have been created in the last few years, which now need to be preserved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-dont-disturb-natural-or-artificial-waterbodies-in-gujarat/articleshow/88284959.cms||---

It is Vasanakand. Urged his excellency to sack the minister.

The police also conducted searches at the Pimpri residence of Pritish Deshmukh (33), director of G A Software Company that was tasked with setting the examination paper, and recovered four pen drives, a tablet and other electronic devices. “We found a list of the candidates who wanted to take up jobs during the recruitment of school teachers,” a police officer said. City police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “We have obtained more leads in the case revolving around Deshmukh and the coaching class operators. More arrests are expected soon”. Additional commissioner of police (Crime) Ramnath Pokale said, “Preliminary investigations revealed that the arrested men had planned to charge Rs10-12 lakh per candidate. We are still questioning them on this front.” On Saturday night, the Cyber police arrested Deshmukh ad his friends Ankush Rambhau Harkal and Santosh Laxman Harkal. The custody of Ajay Chavan and Krishna Jadhav, who are directors of Target Career Point and Shaksham Academy, respectively, and coaching class official Ankit Chankhore, who were already held in the health department exam case, was secured in the Mhada case after their links with Deshmukh and Harkals surfaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mhada-paper-leak-suspects-eyed-rs-10-12l-per-target-cops/articleshow/88285856.cms||---

Discussion or debate on subjects is the basis of democracy,” Pillai said, while delivering the keynote address at the seminar organised by the Indian Navy to mark 60 years of Goa’s Liberation. The governor also said that in a democratic set-up, every citizen has the right to criticise the government or a government functionary. “Democracy is the right to differ. A citizen has the right to criticise whoever is at the higher helm of things. You can criticise the governor, that’s the basis of democracy. But if discussion and debate are not there, then democracy may not succeed in its true spirit,” Pillai said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/democracy-is-the-right-to-differ-pillai/articleshow/88286589.cms||---

Pavan Singh, an HR coordinator at an MNC, said, “Since we have resumed working from office, secret Santa has been organised this year. This year, the game will be played across ranks, from the director to the agent level, so it is very exciting.” Seema Nair, who works for an e-commerce portal, noticed that her colleagues were opting for gifts that will not “end up in a landfill by the end of next year”. A campaign that allows people to be a secret Santa and spread some festive cheer among children is part of a toy donation drive throughout December. For the last couple of years, an anonymous donor has been playing secret Santa for animals in need at ResQ Charitable Trust. Sumedh Tarde, head of projects and communication at the NGO that works towards animal welfare and rescue operation, said, “Every donation made by any individual will be matched by a donor who will double the total amount of donations we get throughout the month of Decembe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/secret-santa-game-resumes-with-renewed-enthusiasm-this-year/articleshow/88285863.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Coimbatore||Now, door-to-door waste collection to be streamlined||The city corporation is all set to streamline the door-to-door garbage collection by redefining routes for the light commercial vehicles used for the same and ensuring daily collection process. The move comes after corporation officials, who recently tracked the movement of the vehicles with the help of GPS, found they were not following the routes assigned to them and not collecting the waste regularly. There are more than 200 light commercial vehicles involved in door-to-door garbage collection. “The vehicles have to stick to the route allotted to them and ensure door-to-door garbage collection daily. But they were collecting waste only on alternative days, while not following the route that was assigned to them,” a corporation official said. Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said the routes for each vehicle would be redefined, while ensuring that they follow the same without any fail. Pointing out that the vehicles were sent to commercial buildings on a priority basis to collect waste so far, he said now the priority would be to collect household garbage. “Men and machinery will be deployed to clear waste from commercial units only after completing the door-to-door waste collection from houses every morning. The residents needn’t have to carry waste and dump it in bins,” he said. A health official with the city corporation, meanwhile, said after ensuring compliance with segregation of degradable and non-degradable waste at source, they would also ensure segregation of wet and solid waste at source. The city corporation is also working on making all the micro composting centres functional. “While most of the centres proposed under the smart city scheme are ready, only a few of them have become operational so far. The micro composting centres will help us deal with the garbage locally and we needn’t have to take it all the way to Vellalore dump yard,” another official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/now-door-to-door-waste-collection-to-be-streamlined/articleshow/88286586.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||BJP moves HC over central forces||Kolkata: BJP on Tuesday moved before Calcutta High Court, seeking deployment of central forces during the KMC elections on December 19. The HC will hear the matter on Wednesday morning. BJP counsel S K Kapur pleaded before Justice Rajasekhar Mantha that four complaints of threats had been emailed to the Kolkata police commissioner and had apprehension about violence on poll day. Bengal advocate general S N Mookherjee referred to the division bench order on electronic surveillance in all polling booths while opposing a fresh BJP petition in the HC, urging for deployment of central forces in KMC polls. Mookherjee cited a 2013 judgment by a Calcutta HC division bench of Chief Justice Arun Mishra and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, who had said deployment of central forces was not for the court to decide. But the order mentioned it was the state election commission’s responsibility to hold free and fair polls. Justice Mantha said, “The state election commission, vested with the responsibility of conducting free and fair elections in the state, must be heard.” He will hear the SEC submissions on the BJP’s apprehensions on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-moves-hc-over-central-forces/articleshow/88285866.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Delhi||Delhi: Nursery admissions kick off today, proximity key factor||NEW DELHI: The registration process for the admissions to nursery/kindergarten/Class I of private schools will begin on Wednesday. In most schools, the process is online, but a few institutes are also providing offline forms. The highest eligibility point has been allotted by most schools to the distance — proximity to schools — criterion. A distance of 0-3km will earn the maximum points; in some cases, it can be 0-10km. For instance, MM Public School, Pitampura has allotted 65 points for those staying in the 0-6km radius, 55 points for those within 6-8km and 45 points for those beyond 8km. Some schools have allotted points for bus routes. At Tagore International School, under the neighbourhood criterion, 50 points will be given to those staying in the areas with school transport. Another common criterion is points for siblings and a parent being an alumnus. At Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, 25 points can be earned under the alumni yardstick. A child whose father has studied in any school under DPS Society will be given 10 points, and for the mother, another 10. If either of them has studied in the Vasant Kunj branch, there will be another 5 points. However, all schools don’t give alumni points. In The Indian School, the points are divided into neighbourhood (60), sibling (20) and firstborn (20). Under the sibling criterion, most schools require a child’s brother or sister to study in the same branch. Many criteria vary from school to school. While MM Public School is giving points for girl child (20) and firstborn (10), some schools are keeping points for the children of their staff. In some cases, points are allotted to single parents. If the number of applications having the same points exceeds the number of seats, a computerised draw of lots will be held. Like previous years, there is an upper-age criterion — 4 years for nursery, 5 years for KG and 6 years for Class I. The last day of filling the form is January 7 and the first list will be declared on February 4. For the 25% reserved category seats, the government is yet to make an announcement. The admission process for economically weaker section/disadvantaged group candidates and children with special needs is centralised and a draw of lots is conducted by the directorate of education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nursery-admissions-kick-off-today-proximity-key-factor/articleshow/88285871.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Delhi: Ashram mess gets bad from worse as burst water pipeline causes jams||NEW DELHI: Traffic moved at slower than usual pace from Lajpat Nagar towards Ashram after a water pipeline burst and caused the road to cave in on Monday morning. Though barricades were placed and the pipeline was covered with earth on Tuesday, it provided no respite for motorists. The disruption caused by the burst pipeline only added to the chaos at Ashram, which is already burdened by two simultaneous constructions under way, one of an underpass and the other of a flyover expansion. Vehicles going from Lajpat Nagar to Ashram were caught in jams during the peak office hours after barricades were erected to restrict vehicles on the spot of the cave in, which had been covered with earth. On Monday morning, the pipeline burst not only caused a cave in on the road from Lajpat to Ashram, but also deluged the road going towards Bhogal. The underpass that is under construction was also filled with water. This led to traffic being stopped on the road from Ashram to Bhogal and diverted from Ring Road to Sunlight Colony or toward the Barapullah elevated road. Those coming from the direction of Sarita Vihar were advised to take Ring Road. On Tuesday, even though the affected pipeline was covered with earth and barricades placed to prevent any vehicle driving over the affected patch, the traffic movement was painfully slow, especially during the peak hours. Meanwhile, the road near CGO Complex hadn’t yet been repaired with PWD officials pleading no work could be done due to the anti-pollution curbs on construction activities. The road there had caved in in the last week of November. “The pipeline whose bursting caused the collapse has been repaired, but due to the construction ban we haven’t been able to repair the damaged road,” said a PWD engineer. Only one lane is available for motorists at the spot, causing, therefore, a daily chicken neck for traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ashram-mess-gets-bad-from-worse-as-burst-water-pipeline-causes-jams/articleshow/88286629.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Just over 1 lakh expectant mothers in Maharashtra have taken 1 shot, 14,000 both||MUMBAI: A little over one lakh pregnant women have taken one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine in Maharashtra, data from the state health department has shown. An abysmally low 14,000 expectant mothers have taken both the shots. The low vaccination numbers are despite adequate evidence that pregnant women face a higher risk of severe Covid-19 and vaccination could curtail that to a great extent. Considering that Maharashtra has an estimated 20 lakh women in this category, this means just 5% have taken a single shot of the Covid vaccine. A closer look at the figures shows that some districts have failed to vaccinate even 100 women. Buldhana, Amravati and Jalna are some of the districts where less than 100 pregnant women have taken the vaccine. Some of the districts have contested the numbers saying they have not maintained a separate entry of pregnant women who were registered under general age categories. The data shows the response has been tepid even in big cities such as Mumbai and Pune, where just 2,100 and 469 women have got vaccinated respectively. Mumbai registers an estimated 1.5 lakh pregnancies annually. The state data also points to some interesting trends. In certain districts such as Kolhapur, there have been more vaccinations in peri-urban and rural areas compared to the corporation. The trend has been registered in Jalgaon, Sangli, Chandrapur, among others. Vaccination for pregnant women started in July. Of the 1,01,670 first dose vaccinations in pregnant women, 15,578 have been in corporation areas, while out of total 13,745 second dose vaccinations, 3,927 have been in corporation areas. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said the official numbers are not an accurate reflection of vaccination among pregnant women. “According to the feedback we have received from districts, more than 50% pregnant women are likely to have received vaccines,” he said. Dr Desai said Cowin didn’t have an option of recording pregnant women vaccinations in a separate column initially. “Hence several districts have either not kept records or clubbed them under the general category,” he said. Districts have now been asked to share their statistics so the state can have a realistic picture of vaccinated pregnant women. A civic official said it’s unlikely the official numbers are underreported. “There is a lot of hesitation and fear.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-just-over-1l-expectant-mothers-in-state-have-taken-1-shot-14k-both/articleshow/88285865.cms||---

Yasin’s blood-soaked body was found on the outskirts of Mansoorpur village the next morning. ADJ Sandeep Singh also slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on them. According to the complainant, the victim’s son, Dilshad, his stepmother Aamna had an illicit relationship with Arif, and the duo killed his father for money and property. Aamna in her statement recorded to police had stated that robbers had barged into her house and fled with valuables and cash, and took her husband along with them. At first, a case was registered against unidentified accused, but after an investigation, said police, it was found that the victim’s wife was behind the crime, and then both Aamna and Arif were booked under various IPC sections, including 302 (murder) at Mansoorpur police station and later sent to jail. Additional district government (ADG) counsel Amit Kumar Tyagi said, “During the hearing, the prosecution produced 21 witnesses. Based on the witnesses’ statements and produced evidence, the court convicted Aamna and her lover Arif, alias, Diwan, on Monday on the charges of murder and criminal conspiracy.” “On Tuesday, the court pronounced judgment, handing down life imprisonment to both accused. A fine of Rs 1 lakh each was also imposed on them,’ added Tyagi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-lover-get-life-term-for-murdering-her-husband/articleshow/88284962.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Pune||Despite India-leading numbers, industry bodies rue airport frailties||Pune: Industry captains in the region believe better air cargo facilities and more focus on agriculture exports will further unlock the export potential of the region and the district. Recent numbers from the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MC&I) showed the district leading in engineering goods exports. Between April and September 2021, the district exported US$ 3,582.83 million worth of engineering goods, the highest in the country, among 30 districts surveyed in the MC&I report, as part of its export hubs initiative. Others in Maharashtra included the Mumbai suburban district, which is one of the leading districts in terms of gems and jewellery exports. Industry experts said exports in engineering goods, including in auto and capital goods, generate multifold employment than in gems and jewellery or oil and gas because of its multi-layered supply chain and vendor networks. The report also highlighted Pune’s export potential in agro industries as well as electronics and pharmaceuticals. Industry groups, however, lamented the lack of progress in terms of a large passenger and cargo airport in Pune, the presence of which, they added, would catalyse further growth in the region. “What would catapult this progress further is the presence of a cargo airport in the region” said Prashant Girbane, the director-general of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/despite-india-leading-numbers-industry-bodies-rue-airport-frailties/articleshow/88285868.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Even while the speaker was yet to decide on Alemao’s application, the Benaulim MLA joined TMC at a public meeting in Benaulim. A senior official said that the speaker now has to decide on both Alemao’s and D’Souza’s applications. In D’Souza’s application, he stated that Alemao was elected as a member of Goa’s legislative assembly from Benaulim constituency for the years 2017-2022, and that Alemao claims that by a purported resolution, the NCP’s legislative wing agreed to merge with TMC. Alemao’s claim, according to D’Souza, is that he constituted the entire strength of “not less than two-thirds of members” of the NCP legislature party. However, the NCP has said that Alemao’s attempt to merge has incurred his disqualification under the provisions of the 10th schedule. In the Constitition’s 10th schedule, para 2 deals with disqualification on grounds of defection, and para 4 deals with disqualification on grounds of merger. The NCP has said that Alemao’s move falls foul of both paragraphs. “In fact, the act of Alemao spelt out through the letter and the resolution not only entails disqualification under para 2 of the 10th schedule, but also under para 3 of the said schedule, as his action reflected in the said letter amounts to joining another political party,” the NCP president said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ncp-moves-speaker-seeks-alemaos-disqualification/articleshow/88286590.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Manifestos skip green issues’||Kolkata: Environment issues had either been pushed down the list or kept completely out of the KMC election manifestoes of Trinamool, BJP and the Left, pointed out green activists and groups. This, when climate change was the most pressing problem faced by the world now, they said. “We had appealed to political parties to address environmental issues and had urged voters to also raise their concern as their very existence was directly affected. The poor air quality is reducing people’s life span. Most of us don’t know whether the water supply by KMC complies with the basic standard of Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS). The water quality specifications were never made public,” said Naba Dutta, general secretary Sabuj Mancha. Despite the appeals, activists said, none of the major political had included air pollution, tree felling, illegal construction, filling up of city’s outfall channels, flowing of waste water into East Kolkata Wetlands, EKW encroachment, or environment role in city planning in their manifestos. Dutta pointed out the importance of the civil society’s role in monitoring civic issues. “We have started an initiative called ‘Amra Najar Rakhchi’ under which civic issues will be closely monitored and their impact on the environment will be flagged,” he said. Environmentalists also want KMC to restart its audit of water bodies in all the 144 wards. “There are varying figures of water bodies—7,500 to 3,200. We want the new civic board to resume counting and we must improve from that number,” an activist said. Activists also demanded the resurrection of Adi Ganga, one of the most powerful storm water outfall channels of south Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/manifestos-skip-green-issues/articleshow/88285875.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Inaugurating the party area meeting at Marayoor on Tuesday, Mani said that Rajendran did not attend the local or area level meeting and his actions did not deserve any pardon. “As a member of the district committee, Rajendran’s absence from the party cannot be taken lightly. Whether the inquiry report will be in his favour or not, he would not be in the party. It is better that Rajendran looks out for some other party,” said Mani. “Rajendran was born into the family of estate workers and was a three-time MLA from Devikulam. The party provided him more opportunities in addition to the other party posts. He enjoyed all the post and will get pension throughout his life,” he added. Earlier, the CPM district secretariat had deputed a commission to look into the alleged lapses in election campaigning. CPM district secretariat members V M Mohanan and C V Varghese were part of the probe commission, and the report was submitted to the party recently. According to party sources, the report would be considered after the party district meeting in January first week.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rush for domestic year-end trips as Covid tests put off international travellers||MUMBAI: With time-bound Covid tests and re-tests in place for international travel, popular year-end hotspots such as London, Dubai and Singapore have fallen out of favour among Indian New Year revellers. That has meant a higher demand for domestic destinations as is apparent from the steep air fares for year-end travel. It is cheaper to fly from Mumbai to destinations such as Goa, Jaipur, Guwahati, Port Blair, Srinagar and Leh this week and next week than it is two weeks down the line. “While that is the general trend, this year, the fare difference is much higher on many routes,” said an official with a low-cost carrier. For instance: The cheapest return fare on Mumbai-Srinagar flights for travel this weekend begins at Rs 20,000 while for the December 31 weekend it is currently priced at Rs 28,000. But on some routes, such as Mumbai-Kochi, which sees sizable traffic during Christmas, fares are steeper for travel this week than for year-end. The Omicron variant did slow down forward bookings for year-end domestic travel early this month when the state government introduced RT-PCR tests for all domestic travellers entering Maharashtra, said the official. “People are cautious, but the bookings have restarted. We expect a spike in demand in the last two weeks of this month,” he added. But for Goa, airfares on other popular domestic holiday destinations have gone up, especially on non-stop flights scheduled at convenient hours. “With about 22 flights operated daily between Mumbai and Goa, the supply is high and so we expect fares to go up only from next week,” he added. What hikes the cost of air travel during peak season is the return trip. This time around the most popular date to return is January 2, a Sunday. “By opting to fly out on Monday instead, New Year revellers, especially those travelling in groups, can make a neat saving,” the official added. For instance, the cheapest fare on Srinagar-Mumbai flight for travel on January 2 begins at Rs 19,000, while that for a January 3 (Monday) flight begins at Rs 11,300. By comparison, mid-January fares drop by about 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rush-for-domestic-yr-end-trips-as-covid-tests-put-off-intl-travellers/articleshow/88285882.cms||---

The Indian Navy is well prepared to safeguard the nation’s interests and provide protection in the Indian Ocean Region and beyond, Singh said on Tuesday at a seminar organised by the Indian Navy to mark 60 years of Goa’s Liberation. “If the Indian nation aspires to be a five trillion economy, it shall certainly be based on the protection that is provided and the safeguarding of the nation’s interest that happens through the Indian Navy,” he said. The Vice Admiral is on his maiden visit to Goa and Karwar after taking over command of the western command. He said that Goa’s Liberation and subsequent progress is closely linked to the Indian Navy’s modernisation. “It may not be out of place for us to actually state that the growth of Goa and the Indian Navy have been almost synonymous, especially in this region. The rudimentary air strip, which was handed over by the Portuguese or taken from the Portuguese by the Indian Navy on Liberation coincided with the induction of INS Vikrant in the Indian Navy. With the commissioning of the aircraft carrier and the organic fixed wing aircraft came the requirement of having a full-fledged airfield and that’s how the Indian Navy put in a lot of effort and all its meagre resources that it had to create this great place by INS Hansa,” said Singh. He recalled the efforts of Goa’s freedom fighters and the sacrifices made by armed forces’ veterans who fought the war for the Liberation of Goa. He also met governor P S Sreedharan Pillai and briefed him about the role and assets of the Indian Navy and also the Indian Navy’s operations to enhance overall maritime security. “There is no doubt that the state of Goa will continue to grow, but the Indian Navy will also continue to grow because this is a very important base on the west coast of India,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/indias-5-trillion-economy-ambition-hinges-on-navy/articleshow/88286594.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Pune||Kalyaninagar residents miffed about ‘no parking’||Pune: Kalyaninagar residents have raised a complaint with the traffic department regarding lack of parking space, especially for four-wheelers, in the lanes and bylanes of the area. The residents said the traffic department has even marked “no-parking zones” in areas outside the residential buildings where people parked their vehicles because of lack of space within the society. The residents have written to the traffic department to spare some space from the no-parking zone. A Kalyaninagar resident, Anand Sarvade, said he had filed a Right to Information (RTI) petition to the traffic department regarding the public notice on imposing parking rules on Central Avenue of Kalyaninagar. “The RTI reply that I received was shocking. It stated that the then traffic in-charge, Manoj Patil, had issued the notice but the papers were lost in a fire that broke out in the Hadapsar traffic department storeroom. Hence, the paper cannot be made available,” Sarvade said. He added that it remains a riddle on how the department put “no parking” boards on the Central Avenue Road. “The Pune Municipal Corporation has not got any written instructions/permissions from the traffic police to put up ‘no parking’ boards on Central Avenue,” he said. Another resident, Sumer Bhanot, said, “Our society comprises single-building apartments and the parking space is very less. Many members park on the road but the traffic police has been issuing challans even to the residents. There are banks, temples and a market place in the area, thus, many outsiders come and park in the lane, which also limits our space.” Representing the Kalyaninagar residents’ group Rachana Agarwal has already met deputy commissioner Rahul Shrirame to discuss the traffic problem of Kalyaninagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kalyaninagar-residents-miffed-about-no-parking/articleshow/88285874.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Goa||Now, Cong accuses Rane, Naik of rigging recruitments||Panaji: Making fresh allegations of rigging in recruitment in the food and drug administration department, the river navigation department and the health department, Congress released a list of candidates who have been favoured for certain posts by BJP functionaries. State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that health minister Vishwajit Rane and river navigation minister Milind Naik have not only violated recruitment rules, but also manipulated the examinations to favour candidates who paid for the government posts or who have ties with BJP. “Rane has already selected candidates and has already given them the question paper and answer paper. I am going to release the names of the multi-tasking workers, data entry operators, drivers that have got the jobs,” Chodankar said. He claimed that the FDA conducted its own exams for vacant positions such as stenographer, driver, assistant chemists (drugs), assistant chemists (food), food safety officers, pharmacists and lower division clerks, which is a violation of recruitment rules. “The minister has given the list of candidates to FDA director Jyoti Sardesai of who has to be selected. Those who failed, their answer papers were changed. Some answer papers were destroyed by staff and those candidates were asked to rewrite the papers,” Chodankar said. He also claimed that the river navigation department bypassed the process of recruiting sailors posts by skipping the physical fitness and swimming endurance test. He also claimed that Naik has sought Rs 10 lakh for each post. Rane, however, refuted the allegations saying, “Some people like to simply sensationalise issues. Congress should work on the ground instead of making false allegations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-cong-accuses-rane-naik-of-rigging-recruitments/articleshow/88286618.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Road Rage: Car driver grievously injured in attack by four men in Pune||PUNE: A 23-year-old auto repair technician suffered a deep cut wound and a fracture to his shoulder in a sharp weapon attack by four men, riding on two bikes, who were agitated over the victim not giving them side to overtake his car along the Porwal Road in Lohegaon around 8pm on Sunday. The Airport police officers are since searching for the four men, who also damaged the windshield, bonnet and window glass of the car, which belonged to the customer of an auto garage where the victim Farhan Fajjan Khan works. The four men pulled Farhan out of the car, kicked and punched him before attacking him with a sharp weapon, police said. A case for offences under sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapon), 504 (intentional insult) and 34 (common intention), among others, of the IPC has been registered by the police. Farhan told TOI, “I was heading home with my friend, Sarik Ansari, when the bikers came from behind and stopped in front of my car. Before I could ask them anything, they started abusing me and damaged the bonnet, windshield and window glasses of the car. They pulled me out. They then kicked and punched me in the stomach before assaulting me with a sharp weapon.” Senior inspector Bharat Jadhav of the Airport police said, “The four men may have thought that the car driver was not allowing them to overtake his car, which was moving at a slow speed. After trailing behind for few minutes, the motorcycle riders managed to overtake and stop the car and went on to damage it, besides assaulting the driver.” Jadhav said, “The area does not have CCTV camera surveillance and police are trying to get footage from the CCTV cameras of the private establishments to identify the suspects involved in the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/road-rage-car-driver-grievously-injured-in-attack-by-four-men/articleshow/88285886.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Goa||Goa Forward Party urges poll panel to scrap government recruitments||PANAJI: There are glaring irregularities in the ongoing government recruitment process and the Chief Election Commissioner (CEO) needs to intervene and ensure that the recruitment process is scrapped, stated Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Tuesday. Alleging corruption to the tune of Rs 100 crore in the recruitment process by BJP, GFP has submitted a written plea to Goa CEO Kunal and asked him to act against the ongoing recruitment drive. In the letter, GFP has said that BJP Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate has himself levelled serious allegations against the government for dolling out jobs by charging bribes anywhere between Rs 20 lakh to Rs 35 lakh depending on the post. “The BJP government is treating recruitment of public jobs as private business and recruiting individuals upon receiving bribes and consequently completely compromising the efficiency of administration and depriving meritorious individuals of their public posts,” said GFP in its representation to election officials. GFP general secretary Durgadas Kamat said that party chief Vijai Sardesai had warned about bribes being taken in August and had asked youth not to fall prey to BJP’s job scam. “Today also many candidates contacted us saying money is being demanded for jobs. Even a BJP MLA has told me how jobs are sold. This is a very serious matter and hence EC should intervene,” he said. He also said that GFP will approach the high court as “BJP only understands the language of judiciary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-urges-poll-panel-to-scrap-govt-recruitments/articleshow/88286605.cms||---
---||Goa||CCP yet to submit reply on ‘recruitment scam’||Panaji: In its third ‘Urgent/Reminder-III’ to the Corporation of the City of Panaji, the department of urban development has sought an action taken report on a recruitment scam involving financial irregularities. The reminder pointed out that no reply has been submitted by the corporation till date in the matter. Complaints were filed with the department of urban development after TOI had reported in May this year that CCP flouted the state government’s recruitment norms while hiring six staff members including a ‘garden consultant’ who was paid Rs 60,000 per month. After the complaints, the department has been seeking queries and an action taken report from CCP, but the corporation hasn’t been replying. CCP did not obtain prior approval from the department and despite it rejecting one of the appointments, as there was “no sufficient justification for such an expenditure” for a garden consultant, CCP went ahead with the recruitment. The department had sought details from CCP regarding the recruitment process followed for the other staff members and sought reasons for not seeking prior approval. It has also advised CCP “not to resort to engagements without taking prior approval”. The department received complaints of financial irregularities and misappropriation of CCP municipal funds alleging a scam in appointing staff on contract basis illegally where these recruitments are setting CCP back by over Rs 20 lakh a year. Records show that despite the department issuing clear instructions in February 2019 to all civic bodies not to engage contract staff or daily wage workers, CCP went ahead with the recruitment. Some staff members were hired in November and December 2019 while interviews for posts were conducted later, in February 2020. The complaints filed with the department state that the salaries have been offered are exorbitant and do not in any way match the beginners pay scales of Goa government. “How could CCP’s accouonts administraion officer give the appointment letter to these staff without administrative and financial approval from directorate of municipal administration? How could the accounts and taxation officer release their salaries? These officers need to be questioned…” a citizen stated in his complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-yet-to-submit-reply-on-recruitment-scam/articleshow/88286638.cms||---

The officials of Zone D, who took action against the violators, said New BRS Nagar was part of the town planning scheme and designated only for residential properties. They said they had received complaints from residents about eight properties being used for commercial purposes, as some had even made godowns for construction material. The complainants had even approached the Punjab and Haryana high court. The officials claimed that they had issued warnings to these property-holders earlier, but they could not take action due to Covid. Now residents have again raised the issue and also filed a contempt of court plea, following which the officials had to seal the properties. ATP Madanjit Singh Bedi said, “We had asked the owners to vacate the properties, but they sought time, citing the pandemic. As the residents moved the high court, we have sealed the properties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/commercial-activities-in-residential-area-8-properties-sealed/articleshow/88284991.cms||---

These carts had been taken by the AMC in November as part of a drive against those selling non-vegetarian food. The association had approached the high court earlier, where the AMC submitted an undertaking saying it would release the seized carts in 24 hours if the vendors approached it, in accordance with the existing policy and law. “We submitted certified copies of the court order to the AMC’s estate and town planning committee chairman Devang Dani, AMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar, state chief secretary, additional secretary of state urban housing and urban development department 24 hours ago. On Monday, we went to claim our seized carts from the AMC’s New West Zone godown. There we were told to pay Rs 1,600 per cart as ‘administrative charges’ to get the carts,” said Rakesh Maheria, president of Gujarat Lari Galla Patharna Sangh. He said as vendors have been out of business after the AMC seized their carts, most cannot pay the fine. “We have decided to approach the court again on this issue,” Maheria said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-wants-fines-for-seized-carts/articleshow/88284988.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Steps afoot to tackle traffic chaos in Market Yard area||PUNE: Daily commuters can expect smoother traffic movement in the Gultekdi-Market Yard area as various measures are expected to be executed on the stretch in coming days to reduce daily traffic chaos. Issues pertaining to traffic movement and encroachment were discussed during a joint meeting held recently by local Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Madhuri Misal, officials of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and traffic police. Misal asked the authorities from APMC and the traffic department to deploy more security guards and traffic wardens on the roads in this area to manage traffic flow, while PMC and APMC authorities were told to act against illegal vendors and encroachment along the route. The entire locality witnesses significant movement of trucks and tempos due to the area’s wholesale markets of food grain, vegetable, fruit and flowers. Haphazard parking of bigger vehicles amid loading-unloading of items on the roads often leads to slowing of traffic. Misal told TOI, “A suggestion has been put forth to appoint security personnel on a permanent basis in the market area. This will help reduce traffic congestion in rush hours. The civic administration should conduct inspections against encroachments on a continuous basis. The APMC and traffic police should ensure that transport vehicles are parked only at designated places and not on the roadside.” Officials from APMC also said commission agents have been asked not to occupy additional spaces outside their shops. Flying squads have been deployed to check illegal stalls and vendors. Regular travelers have been demanding measures to keep the carriageways free of encroachment. Arun Satav, a frequent commuter here, said the extreme left lanes are often occupied by vendors and vehicles. “The authorities initiate action on some days. There is no steady watch. Lot of space in the market area that is vacant at present can be utilised effectively to reduce traffic congestion on the roads,” he suggested. A flyover has come up on Nehru Road recently and commuters are expecting the administration to construct a similar facility ahead of Market Yard towards Gangadham Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/steps-afoot-to-tackle-traffic-chaos-in-market-yard-area/articleshow/88285913.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Professors bat against online classes for regular courses||NEW DELHI: The draft national higher educational qualifications framework, which is currently being prepared by the Centre, states that the various undergraduate and post-graduate programmes courses to be devised under the National Education Policy can be offered in different modes, including offline, open and distance learning, online and hybrid. Several professors from across universities in Delhi said that while the pandemic has paved the way for online classes, implementing the same for regular courses might not have a good impact on the teaching-learning process. Stating that an online mode could still be viable for selective specialised courses, Sanjay Batra, professor at Sri Venkateswara College, said, “The hybrid model may be allowed for certain new courses for those who are unable to travel to different cities for education. However, it should not be pushed for regular courses because it will impact the quality of education that in turn will affect the employment opportunities of students. If one is to pursue an MSc in chemistry in the online mode, what expertise will the student gain? The proposed academic bank of credit will also lead to workload fluctuations.” A senior professor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, who did not wish to be named, further explained that courses requiring field work or practical work in laboratories have suffered immensely since the pandemic and hence, the online mode under the proposed education policy is not viable for such courses. “While it is good that we found online teaching as a result of the pandemic, it cannot be a long-term option. If a student of forest ecology is not taken to the field, how will the person be able to identify and understand the basic things? This only results in a lack of domain knowledge. Online teaching is certainly not possible for subjects requiring practical work,” the professor from the school of environmental sciences said. However, SP Aggarwal, principal of Ramanujan College, explained that despite issues of internet access persisting, the blended mode will increase the amount of material that students have access to. “Lectures will be recorded and uploaded on the portal. So once the modules are formulated, students will have access to a vast variety of study material. Those from the non-formal sector will also gain a lot,” Aggarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/profs-bat-against-online-classes-for-regular-courses/articleshow/88285933.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Pune||PMC back with property tax amnesty scheme||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will reintroduce the property tax amnesty scheme with a 75% waiver on the penalty to defaulters, if they pay under this initiative. “The PMC had received a good response to the earlier scheme. Hence, we decided to reintroduce it. The move is aimed at revenue generation and to reduce the pending dues,” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, said. The panel approved the initiative on Tuesday even though it was opposed by the opposition parties. The scheme will start from December 20 and will continue till January 26, 2022. Rasne said that the PMC has around 4.5 lakh property tax defaulters. Of these, nearly 1.5 lakh have cleared the dues. As many as three lakh defaulters can still avail the benefits of the scheme, if it is re-introduced. Dues amounting to Rs 2,500 crore have to be recovered. The civic body had earned Rs 485 crore from the amnesty scheme in the last fiscal. Nearly the same revenue is expected from this scheme, this fiscal. There are 12 lakh properties that have to pay the tax, in all. The PMC earns around Rs 1,400 crore to Rs 1,600 crore per year through this tax. A target of around Rs 2000 crore is set for the 2021-22 fiscal. The committee also decided to waive the general tax from the property tax owned by the citizens who died due to Covid. The civic body will not charge a transfer fee from the families of the deceased for changing the name of property owners. A decision was taken to give temporary pension to the civic staff until the formalities and documentation for regular pension is complete to give immediate relief to the retirees. It was also decided to start an English medium school in Bhavani Peth. The funds for procuring educational material in civic schools was also approved as was the renewal of the contract for night shelters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-back-with-property-tax-amnesty-scheme/articleshow/88285918.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Man attacked for filming gang robbing a truck||PUNE: A man, who used his smartphone video camera to film six men robbing the driver of a container truck, ended up with a fractured leg after being spotted, chased and assaulted by the goons late on Sunday night at Chikhali. The gang also robbed Rs1,800 in cash from the victim. Police said they arrested a 20-year-old gang member from Chikhali and a search is on for the other five. Victim Rohit Shinde of Rupinagar in Talawade got his left leg fractured as one of the suspects assaulted him with an iron rod. Shinde is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Chikhali. “After receiving his complaint on Monday, we arrested suspect Naushad Shah (20),” said police sub-inspector (PSI) SP Deshmukh of the Chikhali police. Deshmukh said around 11.15pm on Sunday night, Shinde and his friend Bibhishan Bandgar were on their way to a petrol pump to refill his motorcycle’s fuel tank. “On Dehu-Alandi Road, Shinde noticed that six youths had forcibly stopped a container truck, were abusing the driver and trying to rob him,” he told TOI. Shinde immediately took out his smartphone and started recording them. “One of the youths noticed this and alerted his accomplices. They then approached Shinde and tried to snatch his smartphone. When Shinde resisted, the suspects beat him with their hands and legs and robbed him,” the PSI said. To save himself, Shinde started running away, but the gang gave him chase. “One of them hit Shinde’s left leg with an iron rod and also beat his friend,” Deshmukh added. Police have ascertained the identities of all the suspects. A case under section 395 (dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered against them. “One of them is a criminal on police records. We will arrest them soon,” said Deshmukh.

A team of Intelligence Bureau (IB) and CBI officials took his custody after he landed at Delhi airport. Sources said the IB and central agencies will interrogate him for 24 hours and then he will be handed over to Mumbai Police. A team of Mumbai crime branch is already camping in Delhi to take his custody. Suresh Pujari, a footsoldier of gangster Ravi Pujari, who was deported two years ago from Senegal, was arrested on an Interpol notice by the Philippines fugitive cell on October 15. Mumbai and Thane police had issued a red-corner notice against him in 2017 and 2018, respectively after there was a rise in his extortion activities. The intelligence report was that he has at least eight passports with different names. His name was first heard in 2002, when Ravi Pujari orchestrated an attack on advocate Majeed Memon. Suresh Pujari was arrested and booked under the MCOCA. He had allegedly once threatened NCP minister Jitendra Awhad and Omie Kalani, son of Ulhasnagar strongman Pappu Kalani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-suresh-pujari-deported-to-india-from-philippines/articleshow/88285920.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC scraps Rs 569-cr trenching tenders as probe finds ‘rigging’||Mumbai: The BMC has scrapped tenders for utility trenching works worth Rs 569 crore after a vigilance department probe found circumstantial evidence that the tenders could have been rigged. New tenders for the seven utility trenching tenders will be floated soon. “We have decided to cancel the tenders based on circumstantial evidence. Cartelisation was not proven, but it could not be ruled out either,” confirmed P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects). In November, the BMC had put the tenders on hold till the vigilance department submitted a detailed inquiry report into the allegations of cartelisation by BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. He had alleged rigging of tenders for utility trenching that led to a loss of Rs 188 crore to the BMC. Mishra, in a letter to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal and mayor Kishori Pednekar, had named nine contractors who would get the contract for trenching to lay cables and pipes. The same contractors won the bids at the same rates he had forecast. Mishra alleged that asphalt and mastic ready-mix plant owners colluded with each other and rigged the bidding process. “Even before the financial bids were opened, it was decided whom the tenders were going to be bagged by and I had shared a list of the names with the BMC,” he said. “Due to the restrictive and arbitrary condition of getting an undertaking from asphalt and mastic plant owners, a cartel was formed by contractors. The BMC must not allow the contractors who were part of the cartel to bid in the new tenders and take action against officials who allowed this cartelisation.” “In August, the tender amount for the same work was Rs 380 crore and now it’s Rs 569 crore. The previous tenders were cancelled since companies had bid below cost estimates. The companies that had won the bids the first time, bagged tenders again at hiked prices,” said Mishra. “The vigilance department must check the bank accounts of all companies and their owners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-scraps-rs-569-cr-trenching-tenders-as-probe-finds-rigging/articleshow/88285929.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kozhikode||Maimed by trap, tiger turns cattle killer||Kozhikode: Even as the cattle-lifting tiger in Wayanad continues to evade dozens of forest staff and trackers, besides drones and cages (two highly trained kumki elephants joined the hunt on Tuesday), camera trap images recorded on Dec 13 revealed that the animal is seriously injured after getting caught in a snare trap. As people in settlements bordering the forest began to panic and demanded that the tiger be captured at the earliest, images from cameras installed by the forest department around Kurukkanmoola under the North Wayanad forest division show that the big cat has a deep wound around its neck. Forest officials said the injuries were serious in nature as the flesh around the neck has been exposed. "The tiger is actually a victim of extreme cruelty. It might have tried to break free from the snare trap that got encircled around the neck and resorted to cattle lifting after the injuries made it incapable of hunting in the wild," chief conservator of forest (North Zone), Kannur D K Vinod Kumar said. Snare traps -- made using clutch and brake cables of motorcycles to trap wild animals like pig, spotted deer and sambar deer -- have been turning fatal for tigers and leopards in Wayanad forests in recent years. The tiger had been straying into human habitations around Kurukkanmoola during the night from November 29 and has slayed 14 domestic animals so far. Forest officials said the tiger had been lifting smaller animals like goats and calves less than one-year old, possibly due to the neck injury. "If we are able to capture it, we will keep it in captivity and provide proper treatment. Driving it away to the forests in its current condition would tantamount to killing it," Vinod Kumar said. The forest department on Tuesday deployed two kumki elephants to help in tracking and capturing the tiger. Nearly 100 staff have been deployed for the operation besides drones, camera traps and setting up five cages. The district administration has also clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC in four divisions of Mananthavady municipality. However, as opposed to normal tiger behaviour, the animal has not been coming to the same site again to eat the remains of the carcass, rendering its capture difficult. Vinod Kumar said there should be a mass awareness campaign against laying snare traps in Wayanad, which houses the highest number of tigers in the state. According to forest officials, it is the third tiger to get caught in snares in Wayanad in the past 14 months. Two leopards were also killed in 2019 after getting ensnared in traps inside private plantations. The anti-snare drives taken so far had not been successful as the traps are easy to set up while it is difficult to find who laid them. "Apart from posing a fatal threat to endangered tigers, it also exacerbates the human wildlife conflict by turning the injured animals into cattle lifters. We will take strict action against land owners if snares are found on their lands," Vinod Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/maimed-by-trap-tiger-turns-cattle-killer/articleshow/88285923.cms||---

Crime branch cops claim to have seized 23.24g of mephedrone, worth Rs 2.32 lakh, from his possession. According to city crime branch officials, Shaikh was earning a livelihood selling shoes and slippers as a hawker in Karanj, but lost his business for around six months ago due to anti-encroachment drive of the civic body. After this, he contacted a resident of Dariapur, Tausif Shaikh, a drug peddler, and began working for them. Police officers said Altaf used to deliver the drugs to regular customers and kept a digital scale with him to weigh the drugs which he supplied in plastic pouches. Police officers said that apart from selling drugs in the Walled City, Altaf also sold mephedrone to buyers on Ashram Road in the Navrangpura area. The cops have begun inquiry into who were the suppliers of the drugs. Altaf has been booked under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act and an investigation is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-nabbed-for-selling-mephedrone/articleshow/88285008.cms||---

About Rs3.7 crore worth of tax is pending and the cantonment has sent notices to the defaulters in the last few months. “Apart from the levy of 1% interest per month on property tax dues, we have decided to attach the properties of the defaulters under the Cantonment Act, 2006,” said Haritwal. Dispute over property ownership, differences between owners and tenants are among the reasons behind the pendency, said the cantonment officials. “The financial condition of the cantonment is precarious. The board has not launched any development project in the last two-and-half years. It received financial assistance from the district administration to build the health infrastructure during the pandemic. If we don’t collect the tax, we will not be able to make salaries and pensions of the employees,” said an official.

Shubham Gosavi (15), his classmate, fractured both his legs in the mishap. Now, Chavan and Gosavi’s parents are worried they may not be able to attend their exams. Two other survivors, Abhishek Pawar (15) and his mother Sangita (42), are still in hospital for severe swelling on their legs due to the impact of the elevator’s crash from the 10th floor of the 16-storey Mahakali Darshan SRA building to the ground on Monday. Andheri police will summon the contractor in charge of elevator maintenance. All five injured are in two different hospitals in Andheri. Chavan’s mother Vandana told TOI: “I learnt about the incident when others from the building called my mobile phone. Tushar’s father Sunil was at his workplace then. My son has undergone a surgery on his left kneecap. We will meet his school teachers and the management for help as it will be difficult for my son to attend school till next year. Also, his Class 9 exam is approaching. The builder has promised to bear the hospital bills which may touch Rs 4 lakh. Shubham Gosavi, who has suffered a fracture on both legs, is in a similar condition. The five were rescued from the crashed elevator by breaking down the door. They were found piled on each other.”  One of the survivors, Sangita Pawar (42), told TOI: “Priyanka Panchal (50) who fractured her left leg fell unconscious immediately after the elevator crashed. I tried to give her water but she remained unconscious. Meanwhile, my son’s schoolmate Tushar was crying in pain after the switch panel fell on his leg and his kneecap broke. He immediately screamed ‘Kaki (aunty), I can’t get up’. My son and Gosavi somehow managed to fix the switch panel in the bracket to avoid a short-circuit as the wires were hanging out. They repeatedly banged the elevator doors with their legs in fear, without realising they had injured their legs. I just remembered the elevator zipped to the 10th floor after someone pressed the button. But the door did not open. Before we could realise what had happened, it had crashed and there was smoke inside.” Sangita, who works at a government office in Andheri, said after they were pulled out of the elevator, she was rushed to a hospital with her son, but she left it for her workplace. While travelling, though, she felt a sharp pain in her thighs. “I rushed back to the hospital. We all feared death till we all were rescued from the enclosed carriage. This mishap was major. The earlier crash was not severe,” she said.  Pritam Ganekar, a resident, alleged the builder has not addressed their problems related to maintenance and they live amid fear of stones and bricks from higher floors falling on them as the repair work is incomplete for a long time. Andheri police senior inspector Rajkumar Hasbe said they will question the elevator contractor before initiating action. They will first collect an inspection report from the technical expert to know the reason for the crash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/lift-crash-15-yr-old-gets-knee-op-2-boys-could-miss-exams/articleshow/88285932.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

---||Kochi||Priests opposed to new format||Thrissur: A section of the priests in the Irinjalakuda diocese on Tuesday reiterated their opposition against the latest directive of the Irinjalakuda bishop Pauly Kannokkadan to hold the holy mass only in the revised format by facing the faithful. They communicated their opposition when a delegation of the priests led by Fr John Kavalakkad met the bishop at the diocese headquarters at Irinjalakuda. They pointed out that the bishop had earlier communicated that the previous practice of conducting holy mass facing the faithful can be continued in the parishes and other church institutions. However, the bishop has changed his stance and has issued a circular two days ago directing that all the church institutions should conduct the holy mass in the revised format by facing the altar. The rebel priests alleged that the bishop has issued this new directive without consulting the priests. Some of the rebel priests said they would not cooperate with the activities of the diocese, if their demand to permit them to continue with the earlier practice of conducting the holy mass facing the faithful. The bishop, however, clarified that there was no difference between the diocese leadership and the priests. He said he has only directed the priests that they must abide by the directive of the Vatican and bishop’s synod to follow the new form of conducting the holy mass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/priests-opposed-to-new-format/articleshow/88285992.cms||---

Meanwhile, the state is all set to release a notification allowing sale of wine bottles through daily needs shops, departmental stores and bakeries. This is mainly because a majority of wines have very low content of pure spirits or alcohol as compared to other liquors. Also, a large number of restaurants and bakeries use wine for making delicacies. Since 2000, there has been no tax on wine to promote grape farmers market and domestic winemakers while tax was very minimal prior to that. Although the imposition of the new tax will only fetch a revenue of Rs 5 crore to the state, it will help the excise administration keep tabs on the amount of wine bottles sold in the market, said principal secretary excise Valsa Nair Singh. As per rough estimates, the current sale of 70 lakh litres per year in the state is expected to go up to 1 crore litres and beyond once the liberal policy is announced, sources pointed out. Excise department sources said the bars will be allowed to sell sealed wine bottles, and for wine bars, the norm of a minimum 200-metre distance between two bars will go away. Bars may even offer wine in growlers or cans for in and off consumption on the lines of beer as per the proposed policy, said sources. Officials told TOI that the new policy may be announced in a couple of days. It may be mentioned that the state excise recently took a major decision to reduce duty on imported liquor such as whisky to 150% from the earlier 300%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wine-to-get-pricier-as-govt-announces-rs-10/l-excise-tax/articleshow/88285936.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The corporation already has four vehicle-mounted fogging machines and 15 e-rickshaws, but the need to buy handheld fogging machines was felt to give a boost to the sanitation drive in the areas where there are narrow lanes and bylanes. “In a recent meeting of the corporation, it was decided to purchase more equipment such as handheld fogging machines and more e-rickshaws to give fillip to the cleanliness drive. There are 45 wards and we intend to provide at least one e-rickshaw to each ward and at least one fogging machine on every five wards,” deputy mayor Pushpa Singh Kushwaha told this newspaper. She added: “In the meeting, the tax collectors demanded a salary of Rs10,000 per month. At present, they get 4% commission of the tax they collect for the municipal corporation.

---||Rajkot||46,000sq km Kutch desert was once a verdant landscape, say geologists||Rajkot: The arid Kutch region, sprawling over nearly 46,000 sq km and the biggest district of India, was once blooming with verdant landscapes and lush green forests. This hard-to-believe fact about this desert region has been revealed in an exhaustive study carried out by the reputed Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and the department of geology of Kutch University. Geologists and PRL scientists studied the oldest sediments deposited in Bhukhi and Nirona rivers and found that abundant monsoon, not just in Kutch but across western India, had resulted in massive greenery in Kutch thousands of years ago. The study has been published in the internationally reputed The Journal of the International Union for Quaternary Research Then climate change effects struck and the entire region turned into a blazing desert with little or countable few pockets of oasis. The study has been published in the famed The fluvial sediments are an accurate indicator of water and strong monsoon phases and the same were studied in the basins of these two rivers. Researchers said in 20,000 years before 1,10,000 years to 90,000 years from the present day, Kutch was blessed with rain bounty. This study is a sedimentological, chronometric and geochemical analysis of fluvial terrace sequences of Nirona and Bhukhi river basins which was used to interpret south-west monsoon. Human civilizations over thousands years and ecosystems were dependent on this fluvial system. “Ephemeral fluvial systems in the dryland region of Kutch are susceptible to climatic fluctuations. An increase in Indian Summer Monsoon Intensity (ISM) is responsible for the aggradation of sediments as valley-fill deposits in the river basins. The sediments record indicates increased ISM precipitation from 110 thousand years to 90 thousand years which is the interstradial stage,” the study states. Subhash Bhandari, one of the authors of this paper and head of Kutch university’s archeology department, said “The strongest monsoon was for the 20,000 years between 1,10,000 years and 90,000 years from the present day in Kutch. After this period, the monsoon started weakening and gradually deteriorated.” Due to the arid climate, the sediments in the river basin got exposed and the dates were accurated by various geological studies. “Our findings clearly show that there was a lot of greenery and flourishing grasslands at that time and there was nothing like drought. The rivers were brimming and dumped a lot of sediments during that time which we got to study,” Bhandari explained. Talking about the significance of these findings, scientists say the data can be extrapolated to predict the future climate and its effect over the years. Bhandari said, “This data can be useful to predict long-term monsoon behaviour. It varies as a weak and strong monsoon and we have more data as far as monsoon conditions are behaving and based on that we can extrapolate our predictions for the future for the monsoonal conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/46000sq-km-kutch-desert-was-once-a-verdant-landscape-say-geologists/articleshow/88285353.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

According to sources, there are at least 27 points on the PG section where the locals cross railway tracks illegally in a hurry instead of using the manned level-crossing gates. A senior official told this reporter that the security personnel had been asked to launch an awareness campaign at all vulnerable places in the five divisions of the East Central Railway and convince the locals not to risk their lives by cross the tracks illegally. “The illegal railway crossings will soon be removed with the cooperation of the administration,” he said, adding that crossing the tracks at night or in foggy weather conditions could prove fatal. Meanwhile, with resumption of all long-distance as well as local trains in Danapur division, RPF men have been deployed near the Patna Junction amid heavy rush of passengers. “A quick reaction team of RPF men is always ready to deal with any emergency situation at the Patna Junction,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/say-no-to-illegal-level-crossings-railways/articleshow/88285250.cms||Kumod Verma

Both the leaders reportedly discussed about a possible realignment of non-BJP forces to fight against the BJP government at the Centre. Sources said that both KCR and Stalin were closeted for 45 minutes after a formal meeting of both the families. “They also decided to exchange views on fighting united against the Centre. This is only a preliminary meeting and another meeting will be held some time in near future,” a party leader informed. CM K Chandrasekhar Rao also invited Stalin for the inauguration of the Yadadri temple in February. KCR has been up in arms against the Centre, especially over the paddy procurement issue, and has been targeting the Narendra Modi-led government on various issues, including financial crisis post-pandemic, not utilising the resources and encroaching upon powers of the states. The Telangana chief minister, along with his family, reached Srirangam on Monday and undertook darshan in the temple.

This prompted the directorate of education (DoE) to call for fresh applications for a fresh draw of lots, which will be held on Friday. Out of the 25% of the total seats reserved as per Section 12(1)(C) of Right to Education Act 2009, 22% of them are for EWS/DG candidates and 3% for CWSN. For the CSWN category, DoE had sought fresh applications several times earlier too. The first draw of lots under these categories for the academic session 2021-22 took place on April 30. The latest one was held on December 3 for 5,500 seats. The submission of centralised applications for the next draw of lots ended on Monday. Out of the 45,000 reserved seats at the entry-level classes (nursery/KG/I), the draw of lots has been held for 33,000 seats this year. Out of these, 29,900 seats are in schools affiliated with DoE, while the others are in the institutes recognised by the municipal corporations. DoE initially said it won’t conduct any draw of lots as a private school association had moved court against a government directive asking schools to admit reserved category candidates despite no general-category admission. Due to Covid-19, several schools have argued, they couldn’t admit general-category students. The schools usually admit one EWS student for every three general-category admissions. This year, the schools built on government land claimed claimed 100% allotment for their EWS/DG/CWSN seats, while those built on private land said to have got 50% of their quota. “It seems fresh applications are only for the schools built on government land. We could not find our schools in the list. Many parents have been waiting to get their children admitted to private schools,” said Chandrakant Singh, principal of Radiant Public School and national general secretary of Private Land Public School Trust. A draw of lots is held after taking into consideration the previous year’s admission data, a senior DoE official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-draw-of-lots-for-6k-quota-seats-in-private-schools/articleshow/88285974.cms||Shradha Chettri

The minister said that four more Cath Labs across the state are being made available. These will come up at Adilabad, Warangal and Khammam in addition to the one at the Gandhi Hospital launched a few days back. He also asked hospital authorities to ensure that more patients can avail the Ayushman Bharat and Aarogyasri services. Reacting to a representation submitted by Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) on the issue of construction of new OGH building, the minister said that construction can only begin after the court case is settled. Another representation was submitted by lab technicians and pharmacists in the hospital premises asking for regularisation. With the new CT scan facility, the OGH now has a total of three such machines. Fifty ICU beds, new ventilators and a new mortuary (set up at the cost of Rs 5 crore) will also be operational at the hospital soon, said the minister. “We are upscaling facilities at all hospitals in the state. OGH being one of the primary tertiary care centres in the state gets thousands of patients from across the state. These new facilities launched today will be helpful for patients with heart diseases, who were earlier forced to avail these outside. We are arranging for better treatment across government hospitals in the state,” said the minister. The minister also directed hospital authorities to pay special attention on sanitation. He will inspect the hospital again on January 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-seek-nabh-accreditation-for-ogh-says-health-minister/articleshow/88285681.cms||---

Energy minister G Jagadish Reddy and finance minister T Harish Rao held a meeting with Telangana Genco, Transco and discoms officials on Tuesday over the proposed power tariff hike in the state. The state government is planning to increase power tariff and proposals are likely to be submitted to the TSERC soon. “At the time of creation of Telangana state, the accumulated losses of the discoms was Rs 12,185 crore. The policies of the Centre are pushing the state into deeper financial problems. In the name of green energy, the cess has been enhanced, as a result of which the burden on the state government is Rs 7,200 crore a year now,” Jagadish Reddy said. Apart from this, the (Narendra) Modi government had increased coal rates, which had caused Rs 725 crore burden a year as the Telangana discoms purchase 50,000 million units from the thermal power units, he said. While the state government was taking ‘pro-farmer’ and ‘pro-poor’ measures, the Centre has even increased coal freight charges by 40 per cent and renewable power purchase obligation policy, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/burden-on-discoms-up-due-to-central-policies/articleshow/88285541.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

When the opening ceremony was in progress on Monday, the local Muslims were offering namaz at the Gyanvapi mosque in a peaceful environment. “It is true that in the beginning of the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Dham, there were some apprehensions among us regarding the security of Gyanvapi mosque. But now all the doubts have gone away... there is no apprehension now and we are quite confident about the safety of the mosque,” SM Yaseen of the Anjuman Intezamiya Masajid, an administrative body of Gyanvapi mosque, told TOI on Tuesday. Before the construction of the corridor had started, Yaseen gave a statement in the media expressing fear about the safety of the mosque. “At that time the situation was quite different because we had no clear picture of the project. But our doubts started disappearing with the progress of the project in a transparent manner,” said Yaseen. “We wholeheartedly welcome the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Dham because the best thing that happened is that both Hindus and Muslims got convenience,” he said adding that earlier there were narrow lanes leading to the temple and devotees had to stand in the queues for hours. Now there will be no such problem. “There is a fixed time for offering namaz in the mosque. We used to feel very bad at that time when the temple going devotees were stopped and the Muslims were allowed to go to the mosque due to the only way existing there. In such a situation, the hearts of the devotees standing in the queue for hours must have been hurt. But now it will not happen,” he said, adding that the Muslims are equally happy with the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. Regarding the land dispute between the Gyanvapi mosque and Kashi Vishwanath temple, Yaseen said that it is not a matter of grave concern, as such things happen in the society. “The matter is in the court, and we are fighting the case. But it does not mean that it will spoil the unique communal harmony of Kashi,” he argued. Recently, the Allahabad high court on September 9 stayed a Varanasi court’s order dated April 8, 2021, which had directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to ‘conduct a comprehensive physical survey’ of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple (KVT)-Gyanvapi mosque complex and further proceedings of this case. The civil judge (senior division), fast-track court (FTC) of Varanasi on April 8, 2021, had directed the ASI to conduct a survey of KVT-Gyanvapi mosque complex in order to find out whether a temple was demolished to build the mosque that stands adjacent to the temple. In two separate petitions, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and Anjuman Intezamia Masjid, Varanasi had challenged the said order of the Varanasi court in the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kvd-opening-dispels-doubts-over-gyanvapi-mosques-security/articleshow/88285951.cms||Binay Singh

During a high-level review meeting, health minister T Harish Rao said that 21 lakh home isolation kits would be made available as a precautionary measure. He also urged people to be vigilant keeping in mind how quickly the Omicron variant has spread in South Africa, where it was first identified, and now the UK. A special committee is also being formed to monitor Omicron spread around the globe. Over 1,200 passengers have returned to Telangana over the last few weeks from the UK. Also, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh reported its first Omicron case on Sunday. “The impact and the spread of the new variant both across the world and within our country should be constantly monitored. We want to be ready in all possible ways to face the threat of a third wave in the form of a new variant,” said the minister. Harish Rao also instructed officials to keep 545 metric tonnes of oxygen facility ready. While 27,996 beds have already been equipped with oxygen supply, the same has to be done for another 25,826 beds as quickly as possible, he said. He also suggested that drug stocks be maintained in central dug stores. “In addition to government efforts, people are also expected to fulfil their responsibilities by wearing masks and adhering to Covid norms such as physical distancing, hand hygiene and taking double vaccine doses. Vaccination in the state has been further accelerated. Everyone is advised to get two doses of the vaccine,” he said, asking health authorities to pay special attention on the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-chalks-out-plan-to-tackle-omicron-threat/articleshow/88285652.cms||Amrita Didyala

While speaking on the topic, ‘In reverence: Sita Beyond boundaries’, he said Bihar has been a land of scholars and Mithila is known for scholars like Mandan Mishra, Bharti and others. “During the last few decades, there has been migration of knowledge from Bihar. The example is my native state Andhra Pradesh where many of the IAS officers belong to Bihar and half of them are from Mithila,” Madhav said. The RSS functionary said MLF has chosen an apt topic for discussion as Mithila is known and revered as the birthplace of Sita maiya. “In the Valmiki Ramayana, the personality of Sita has been depicted as equal to Lord Ram. In some context, she has been shown more dignified than Lord Ram. As a magnificent temple of Lord Rama is being constructed in Ayodhya, I request the Bihar government to develop the birthplace of Sita in Mithila on the same pattern,” he said. The high commissioner of Sri Lanka, Milind Morguda, said the MLF is like a bridge connecting India, Sri Lanka and Nepal with the relevance of Sita in the three countries. The mahant (seer) of Nepal-based Janki Temple, Roshan Das, said the character and virtues of Sita is worshipped in Nepal. “Due to Sita, the relation between India and Nepal continues to be very strong,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-should-build-sita-temple-in-mithila-ram-madhav/articleshow/88284181.cms||Binay Kumar Jha

The one behind the wheel was drunk and the resulting crash near Nagarjuna Circle resulted in the deaths of three persons, including nine-year-old Ramya. Ramya’s parents — Pammi Venkat Ramana and Radhika — and her sister Rishika are still reminded of the fateful day every time they take the Panjagutta flyover. In the last two weeks, at least seven people have died due to drunk drive accidents across Narsingi, Banjara Hills and Dundigal in Hyderabad leaving families devastated, children orphaned and wives widowed. Any time drunk driving claims a life in the city, Ramya’s incident is often recollected on social media as the tragedy still remains fresh in the minds of people as justice is yet to prevail for them. “I still get triggered when I am heading in that direction and try to immerse myself in my phone. I lost my father-in-law, daughter and brother-in-law in that accident and it still feels like yesterday,” Ramya’s mother Pammi Radhika, who herself suffered severe injuries in the mishap, told TOI. The grief also extends to the family of Ramana’s brother, Rajesh, who lost their sole breadwinner in the crash. Rajesh, who was the driving the car, was the first victim of the mishap. Ramya and her grandfather passed away in a span of 18 days. Radhika had to undergo multiple surgeries for multiple fractures to her ribs, hands, leg and back while also receiving treatment for her neurological problem. Ramya’s parents are still waiting for a trial date despite cops filing a charge sheet in the case way back in 2016. The main accused, R Shravil, along with his fellow students — Thota Ashwin Naidu, Nethi Surya, Gollakota Sai Ramana and Ch Alan Joseph are out on bail. “I didn’t attend any counselling after Ramya passed away because my second daughter Rishika stood by me and gave me purpose and strength to move forward. Even at six, she took responsibility of feeding me while I was despairing,” Radhika said with tears in her eyes. Ramya’s family say the system has failed them as neither the accused were punished nor did the government take measures to protect the victims. Despite the passing years, and delayed trials, Ramya’s family remains resilient in their demand of bringing about a ‘Ramya Act,’ a stringent law to protect victims of drunk driving incidents and mete stringent punishment to the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/five-yrs-on-pain-lingers-over-losing-daughter-kin-to-crash/articleshow/88285535.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

After giving birth to the girl, the minor dumped her at the plot.” “Since the mother is a minor, we are not lodging an FIR against her as she too is a victim. We have lodged an FIR against the man under sections 315 (act done with intent to prevent child being born alive or to cause it to die after birth) and 376 (rape) of the IPC and the POCSO Act. It is yet to be ascertained if the accused is a minor or an adult,” the inspector added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/day-old-baby-dies-after-14-yr-old-mother-dumps-her/articleshow/88285076.cms||---

The vehicle and weapons used in the crime were also recovered. Santosh Singh, SSP Bulandshahr, said, “We have arrested Nitish Bhati, Asif Ali and Deepak Nagar who were involved in the firing incident that took place in the city earlier this month. All these accused had a reward of Rs 25,000 each on their head. We have also recovered three pistols, one car and a few fake number plates from them.” Earlier, police had arrested Lakhan Singh, another sharpshooter who had been hit by retaliatory fire by the politician's guards from a hospital, Bike-borne assailants had fired indiscriminately at the convoy of Yunus who had a miraculous escape while five of his aides received bullet injuries. One of them later died in hospital. Police said over 40 bullets had hit the convoy of three cars. Yunus had alleged the involvement of four of his nephews and three others in the firing on his convoy. The attack was the result of a tug-of-war between Yunus and his late brother, Haji Aleem’s immediate family over the control of the latter’s business empire, including a meat processing plant in Aligarh. The genesis of the rivalry goes back to 2018 when Haji Aleem, a BSP leader, was found murdered at home. Both Yunus and Aleem’s sons had traded charges against each other for orchestrating the murder. Later, one of Aleem’s sons, Anas, was arrested and jailed for the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-more-sharpshooters-held-for-attack-on-ex-block-chief-yunus/articleshow/88285107.cms||Ishita Mishra

Shiva addressed the festival via a remote link from Dehradun, with the festival, the panel discussion, and the screenings happening entirely online, through a partnership with an events and ticket aggregator firm. Vandana urged stakeholders to focus on the nutritional and health values of crop yields, rather than volumes. “It is a myth that chemical farming produces more food. Research shows that organic farming produces more and we have trained more than a million farmers in organic farming techniques. Rather than focusing on the volume of a crop per acre, we should be measuring the health and nutrition per acre of a crop produced,” Vandana said during her address. She also remarked that the incidence of pandemics such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic lie in nature and are symptoms of violence against the “vasundhara” (earth), adding that the health of humanity and the earth depends on transforming food sources. “We must address the destruction of the natural world if we are to prevent future pandemics. What we have read in systems of medicine such as ayurveda, or the teachings of Hippocrates, on which the Western system of medicine bases its principles, is that immunity is affected by what we eat. Caring for the earth is caring for the life of mankind as well,” she said. It is a myth that chemical farming produces more food.

The mukhiya, Neeraj Kumar alias Sudhir Kumar (36), was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne criminals in front of his house around 9.30am. Neeraj was elected mukhiya from Rampur Faridpur panchayat on November 17. This is third incident of killing of elected panchayat representative in the district in the last 72 hours. Police said the irate villagers blocked Khagaul-Naubatpur road with the body. The blockade continued till late in the evening. City SP (west) Ashok Mishra and other senior officers rushed to the spot to pacify the irate villagers, but to no avail. At least four police personnel, including ASI Bharat Bhushan Kumar, were injured when locals attacked them to protest Neeraj’s murder. SHO of Janipur police station Uttam Kumar said the ASI received severe head injury and was rushed to a local hospital. “The locals started pelting stones targeting the police personnel who had gone to the village for investigation,” the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-cops-hurt-as-mukhiyas-murder-sparks-violence/articleshow/88285122.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SSC exams ahead, schools lag behind in syllabus completion||MUMBAI: The Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams are likely to begin from March, but schools are behind schedule in completion of class X curriculum. Most institutes still have to cover 20-25% of the truncated syllabus, said school heads. Though the syllabus was reduced by 25% due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schools have not met the mid-December deadline of finishing the curriculum and beginning revision and practice papers. Schools usually conduct preliminary exams in January. With schools closing for winter vacation from December 22, teachers are being told to complete the syllabus by the end of the month. Some institutes have begun conducting both offline and online classes for class X students. “We have begun teaching SSC students in the classroom for three hours in the mornings and conduct online classes for a few more hours in the evenings,” said a school principal. School heads have urged the state government to further reduce the syllabus and issue clear guidelines on the examination pattern. “We have to set question papers for the preliminary exams in January. There is no clarity as to whether the focus will be on objective or subjective questions,” said the principal of a Bandra school. Reopening of physical cla-sses in October and just three-four hours of daily schooling has delayed completion of class 10 syllabus, said school heads. “We have managed to complete 75% of the SSC portion. How much students have learned will be gauged when they appear for preliminary exams,” said the principal of a school in Andheri. Schools want to conduct more than one preliminary exam in January. Though online teaching began from June 15, schools found that students fared badly in subjects like mathematics and sciences. “The first semester exams in the offline mode in October was an eye-opener as a large number of students performed badly,” said a mathematics teacher from a Ghatkopar school. Schools used up several hours in brushing up what students had learned during online classes between June and October. With all class IX students making it to class X this year—usually few students are detained in class IX due to poor performance—teachers said they spend more hours focusing on students who need improvement. Last year, board exams were cancelled due to the pandemic and students were evaluated based on their internal performances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ssc-exams-ahead-schools-lag-behind-in-syllabus-completion/articleshow/88285976.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Delhi||A third of pvt school seats for poor not taken in Delhi in year gone by||New Delhi: The pandemic caused a slowdown in the admission of students from the economically weaker sections (EWS) and disadvantaged group (DG), for whom 25% of the seats are reserved in private schools across the country. While different states follow different admission timelines, a report released on Saturday said that in Delhi, 17,000 of such seats hadn’t been filled in 2020-21. The report, ‘Bright Spots: Report of Inclusion through the Lens of RTE Section 12 (1) (C)’, was published by NGO Indus Action. The section of the Right to Education referred to in the title is the clause mandating reservation of 25% of available seats in schools for EWS/DG students. In Delhi, this 25% comprises 22% for EWS/DG and 3% for children with special needs. While the reserved vacancies weren’t taken up in Delhi and Maharashtra (29,000 unfilled seats), in other states the number of applications showed a fall. In Karnataka applications dropped 38% in 2020-21 from a year earlier. This year too, there were only 8,980 applicants for 14,036 available seats. In Uttar Pradesh, the application process was postponed four times, despite the number of schools increasing from 19,962 to 20,929. Eventually, both the applications received and the students admitted were lower in 2020 than the previous year. In Tamil Nadu, only 86,000 applications were received for the 1,15,000 seats and it took several rounds of admissions to fill the vacancies. Madhya Pradesh did not conduct admissions in the pandemic year. “The admissions process was delayed by six to nine months in several states due to the pandemic. There were a few other challenges that the different stakeholders faced due to the lockdown and other Covid-related issues, like parents being unable to arrange the required documents on time, schools not receiving reimbursements on time, children being unable to attend online classes due to the lack of access and know-how of technology,” the report said. Perhaps because the number of seats on offer fell in almost all the states, the admission rate was higher than in pre-pandemic years. In Maharashtra against 1,16,809 seats in 2019-20, only 1,15,447 seats were available in 2020-21. In Delhi too, there were fewer seats on offer. In 2019-20, the admission rate was 56% in Delhi, 60% in Tamil Nadu and 67% in Maharashtra. In 2020-21, the rate rose to 74.7% in Maharashtra and 63.7% in Delhi. “Indus Action and partners have been working relentlessly at the grassroots level and we together hope to find innovative solutions to current challenges and reduce school dropouts,” said Tarun Cherukuri, CEO, of the NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-third-of-pvt-school-seats-for-poor-not-taken-in-delhi-in-year-gone-by/articleshow/88285990.cms||Shradha Chettri

About 10 days since the direction, the police have collected 29% of the nearly 18,000 licenced weapons in the city.Besides, the cops have also started nabbing the proclaimed offenders and those against whom non-bailable warrants were issued.Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Varinder Singh Brar said, “The city police are gearing up for the assembly elections, which are round the corner. We have started collecting the licenced weapons. So far, 29% of these have been submitted. We are working towards collecting the remaining as soon as possible.”Brar said the licence holders can submit their weapons either with the police station concerned or with the gunhouses.A drive has also been started to nab the proclaimed offenders. “In the past few days, we have nabbed 371 proclaimed offenders wanted in different cases. Also, the police have received a total of 82 non-bailable warrants, of which 73 have been executed and nine are pending,” he added.Brar said, “I recently joined as the DCP (investigation) and came to know about the recent case of a gunhouse owner selling cartridges illegally. Therefore, after submission of licenced weapons and cartridges, the city police will physically verify the records and facts to eliminate any discrepancies. We will also check the installation and the direction of CCTVs at gunhouses. In case of a mishap, usually the police are told that though the gunhouse has CCTVs, those are not installed in the right direction. Besides, all security arrangements will be made at the gunhouses too.”Those smuggling illegal weapons are also on police radar.Gunhouses await limit extension permissionA gunhouse owner said, “We have the authority to keep 25 weapons. Around elections, all the dealers apply for extension of limit to keep weapons. This time too, the city dealers have applied for it at the Ludhiana commissionerate licence unit. Usually, the police extend the limit three folds. For keeping a weapon, the gunhouses charge Rs 200 per month from the holders. Now, we are awaiting permission to our limit extension request.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/polices-pre-poll-focus-licenced-weapons-pos/articleshow/88285103.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Pune||No fresh curbs in Maharashtra ahead of Christmas, New Year: Rajesh Tope||PUNE: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday told TOI that the state had no plans to introduce any additional curbs in the run-up to the Christmas and New Year celebrations. “Local authorities have to ensure that there is no violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour. Measures have to be in place to increase vaccination against Covid. The previous order has all instructions. It is up to each district to properly implement the instructions,” he said. Maharashtra’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) dropped below 1% last week. The WPR in most districts is also below 2% now. Experts, however, are of the view that the real challenge will be to ensure a WPR below 0.5% in all districts. Tope said people ought to be more cautious and adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour following the emergence of the Omicron variant of the virus. Till Monday, India had reported 41 Omicron cases, including 20 in Maharashtra. On Monday, Maharashtra reported two more Omicron cases. Both the persons were fully vaccinated and had a travel history to Dubai. State health department revealed that nine Omicron patients have been discharged. Rajasthan has so far reported nine Omicron cases followed by Karnataka (3), Gujarat (4), Kerala (1) and Andhra Pradesh (1), Delhi (2) and Chandigarh (1). During a meeting with the Maharashtra task force on Monday, its members told Tope that the Omicron cases were sporadic till now but the state had to keep a close watch on any spike in any clusters. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “We are witnessing sporadic and travel-related (Omicron) cases. There’s no outbreak in clusters as yet. A tight vigil is a must, especially during the New Year and wedding seasons.” He said, “We still have the active Delta (variant) in circulation and the threat of Omicron around. Responsible behaviour, complete masking, proper air ventilation and complete vaccination will be important.” Public health expert and national task force member Dr Subhash Salunkhe said though the Omicron cases were sporadic, the way forward would be strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and full vaccination. “Senior citizens should be cautious ahead of the Christmas and New Year festivities. Respiratory infections are usually high during this period,” he told TOI. “Studies are on to find out the virulence of Omicron. If the variant is less virulent but more transmissible, it may not lead to a higher burden on the health system. But keeping in mind the situation in South Africa and Denmark, one should not take Omicron lightly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-fresh-curbs-in-state-ahead-of-christmas-new-year-tope/articleshow/88285986.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The former champions missed, who missed out on the title last season on the final match day, will take on defending champions Gokulam Kerala FC in their opening match at the Kalyani ground on December 26. Churchill were cruising for most part of the last edition with their attacking style of play under coach Fernando Varela. But injuries to key players like Lebanese centre-back Hamza Kheir meant they lost focus. They were tied on 29 points along with Gokulam Kerala, who had a superior goal difference and a better head-to-head record. Goa’s only club in the league are now determined to improve under Romanian head coach Petre Gigiu. The 67-year-old has returned for a second stint with the club. “We are all set and determined to top the prestigious national event as we began our preparations well in advance, under the supervision of our Romanian coach Petre Gigiu, who is well known in Goa as he had a brilliant stint with Churchill Bros in the past,” club CEO Valanka Alemao said on Wednesday. Churchill had released all their foreign players and rebuilt the side with four new foreigners. Brazilian midfielder Guilherme Santos, Nigerian striker Ikechukwu Kenneth, Guinea forward Sekkou Sylla and Lebanon defender Shadi Skaf will all have important roles to play. They have local talent in plenty as the club has maintained a separate squad for the Goa Professional League. They are leading the state league, and some have managed to catch the eye of the Romanian coach. “The team put up a sterling show last season in Kolkata and it was sheer bad luck that pushed us to the second place as we tallied the same number of points with the ultimate champions. We have done our homework well and the players are raring to go,” said Valanka. Churchill face Punjab FC in their second game on December 31, followed by Sudeva Delhi FC on January 5. Team: Goalkeepers: Debnath Mondal, Pratheesh Veettil, Shilton Paul; defenders: Joseph Clemente, Meldon D’Silva, Lamgoulen (Gogou), Asif Ali Molla, Nongmeikapam Suresh Meitei, Vanlal Duatsanga, Shadi Skaf (Lebanon); midfielders: Kapil Hoble, Kingslee Fernandes, Quan Gomes, Richard Costa, Shubert Pereira, Wendell Coelho, Bryce Miranda, Saurav Mandal, Vinil Poojary; forwards: Aaron Barreto, Afdal Varikkodan, Guilherme Santos (Brazil), Ikechukwu Kenneth (Nigeria), Sekou Sylla (Guinea).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-churchill-bros-raring-to-go-after-last-seasons-heartbreak/articleshow/88306738.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

---||Delhi||Most inquiry cases against cops relate to absenteeism, involvement in crimes||New Delhi: During a review of departmental inquiries against police personnel, Delhi Police has found that a majority of these cases are related to their absenteeism and criminal involvement. The deputy commissioners of police have been asked to clear these inquiries in a time-bound and systematic way. Police sources claimed that during a meeting held recently, it was found that more than 600 departmental inquiries were going on (till November 11). Over 30% of these were against policemen involved in crime. “Several complaints, including that of extortion, hurt, dowry, gambling or any other illegal activity, were received against policemen after which departmental inquiries were initiated. Proper action was taken in cases where the cops were found guilty,” an officer said. About 23.8% inquiry cases were related to absenteeism. “If a policeman regularly remains absent from duty without any proper reason, we initiate departmental inquiry against the cop,” another officer said. According to sources, 12.8% departmental inquiry cases were related to negligence in duty whereas more than 7% cases were related to corruption. About 2.7% inquiry cases were related to misbehaviour, 2.2% administrative lapse, 1.4% alcoholism, 1.1% sexual harassment and over 7% others. In another meeting, all districts, unit DCPs were directed to ensure that relevant details of the personnel, including disciplinary action, are entered in the personnel indexing system. “Progress done in respect of the disciplinary matters shall be reviewed,” a senior officer stated. An officer said that they follow a standing order to conduct an inquiry. “An inquiry officer conducts the whole process and he prepares the summary of allegations against the suspect. The suspect is given a chance for his defence. All statements are properly recorded and a fact-finding report is prepared and sent to the appellate authority for further action,” he explained. In a recent circular, Delhi Police has, however, directed senior officers to take no action on anonymous complaints received against any policeman or officer. “No action is required to be taken on that complaint against the policeman in which name and address of the complainant are mentioned but the address is not verified and the complainant does not respond to the notice issued by the inquiry officer for joining inquiry within 15 days of receipt of notice and another gap of 15 days after issue of reminder,” the circular read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/most-inquiry-cases-against-cops-relate-to-absenteeism-involvement-in-crimes/articleshow/88286010.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC quashes FIR over sharing post on Tariq||The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court recently quashed an FIR registered against a Gadchandur resident, Pawandeep Yadav, who had shared a Facebook post that allegedly hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community. The shared post pertained to a comment made by a third person about former NCP MP Tarik Anwar leaving the party. The court held that the post wasn’t intended to insult the entire Muslim community at large, but was restricted to only one person. Yadav was, however, asked to deposit Rs 20,000 with the police welfare fund. Yadav had moved the bench seeking to quash the FIR lodged against him for a post that he shared on Facebook. The said post was originally authored by someone else but Yadav had shared it on his profile. The post was singularly addressed to Anwar being a Muslim and it was not clearly not attributed to the community at large. “It is seen that there is a reference to the names of three persons [Narendra Modi, Sharad Pawar and Anwar]. The so-called statement alleged to have been attributed to the Muslim community at large cannot be made out from this post,” the bench said. The HC also considered the contention of Yadav that he “mistakenly” shared the post and didn’t intend to hurt the sentiments of Muslims as such. He even tendered an apology for the same. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-quashes-fir-over-sharing-post-on-tariq/articleshow/88286004.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Pall of gloom in MVA camp after loss in MLC polls||Nagpur: A pall of gloom hung over the Congress camp after the crushing defeat in the biennial MLC elections on Tuesday. Hardly any of its leaders were visible at the counting centre. A majority of them refused to speak, directing all calls to MPCC president Nana Patole and animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar. They said Patole and Kedar were responsible for the fiasco of granting ticket to former BJP corporator Ravindra Bhoyar, and later supporting independent Mangesh Deshmukh, just 12 hours before the polls. Bhoyar, who received just one vote, told the media he wanted to search for the elusive voter who voted for him. He had earlier told TOI that he would not vote for himself and would follow the party’s whip. Kedar refused to take TOI’s calls for comments. Patole, who accompanied Deshmukh, said despite having numbers, BJP took their public representatives on a sojourn, which shows they do not trust their own voters. “We already had fewer votes, still we fought courageously and unitedly. On the other hand, their voters were confined to unknown places, harassed and not allowed to speak to anyone. Instead of going gaga over the victory, the BJP should address issues like rising inflation, unemployment, and farmers’ problems on priority.” Accusing the saffron party of rigging the Nagpur and Akola-Buldhana-Washim elections, NCP chief national spokesperson Nawab Malik demanded that a law should be enacted to stop illegal practices of buying voters in legislative council. “When cross voting took place in Rajya Sabha, a legislation was brought into force to vote only as per the party’s whip. If the state government has the power, we will legislate. If it does not, then the central government should enact it in the Parliament so that all such polls are held in a transparent manner. We will make such a recommendation to the Centre.” Asserting that this victory was not a very big one for the BJP, city Congress chief Vikas Thakre reminded the opposition of its shock defeat in the graduates constituency elections last year. “The win is not a certificate that the general public has faith in the BJP. It was not a direct vote by the people, but just by 559 elected or nominated representatives. This is no big deal if the party managed to retain the seat, as they already had numbers on their side. Over a lakh educated voters of the graduates constituency from the region had already rejected the saffron party and the trend would continue in the civic elections next year.” Accepting the defeat, Congress chief spokesperson Atul Londhe pointed out that their candidate was poor, while the opposition candidate was financially very strong. “Despite having 90 more votes than MVA, they had to flee the city with their voters. They also rigged the polls, which is a moral defeat for them. They should not forget their string of defeats in the zilla parishad polls last year and recent bypolls from the grand old party. All MVA leaders and office bearers tried their best winning the seat. We will certainly introspect and come out stronger in future polls,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pall-of-gloom-in-mva-camp-after-loss-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/88286009.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

This will not only save huge money of the taxpayers, but also cut down the time taken for submission of the statement. The new change has been notified by the ministry of finance and it is in continuation with the recent exemption given to the taxpayers with a turnover up to Rs 2 crore from filing any kind of annual return. City businessmen, meanwhile, are upbeat over the change, but are demanding that the Centre also take notice of their other demands.Harish Kairpal, president of Ludhiana MSME association, said, “Doing away with the need of getting the GSTR-9C reconciliation statement certified from chartered accountants will benefit thousands of businessmen and save huge fees and time. It will end the hassle of waiting for attestation from a professional which is a time-consuming process. We urge the Centre to also consider our demand for rollback of its decision to increase the GST to 12% on the textile and garment sector from 5%.”Taxation expert NK Thamman said, “The taxpayers having turnover of more than Rs 5 crore during financial year 2020-21 are required to file annual return (GSTR-9) and a reconciliation statement in form GSTR-9C with the audited financial statement. Earlier this reconciliation statement was required to be certified from a chartered accountant, but now from financial year 2020-21, a relaxation has been given. Taxpayers can now self-certify this reconciliation statement.”Jaswinder Singh Thukral, president of Janta Nagar Small-Scale Manufacturers’ Association, said, “We appreciate the new change, but we also request the Centre to resolve other pending issues of the small-scale industry, including decreasing the number of returns and introducing amnesty schemes for late and non-filing of GST returns.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/relief-for-taxpayers-with-more-than-rs-5cr-turnover/articleshow/88285112.cms||Mohit Behl

The aircraft took off with the loader in the pressurised cargo hold and he was found—safe—on arrival in the UAE. He was sent back on the return flight of the aircraft. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing this lapse and some IndiGo personnel have been taken off duty pending the investigation. “On December 12, an IndiGo A320 aircraft was to operate as 6E-1835 from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi. After baggage loading was completed, one of the loaders relaxed in baggage compartment 1 and fell asleep behind the baggage. The cargo door was closed after the hold staff had marked the head count,” said a senior official, probing this lapse. “The loader woke up as the aircraft took off from Mumbai. It was detected at Abu Dhabi and medical examination of this loader was conducted by Abu Dhabi authorities. His physical condition was stable and normal. After getting the requisite clearances from the local authorities, he was sent back as a passenger to Mumbai on return flight,” the official added. Comments from IndiGo were awaited till the time of going to press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cargo-handler-sleeps-in-plane-reaches-uae/articleshow/88285994.cms||---
---||Pune||Experts bank on 2 new pills to fight Omicron variant||PUNE: Soon-to-be-introduced oral-antivirals molnupiravir and paxlovid may prove a game-changer in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants, such as Omicron, experts feel. The drugs will especially be useful in countries like India where a sizeable population is fully or partly vaccinated or have hybrid immunity — natural infection and recovery followed by vaccination. In the event of Omicron’s spread, most people, therefore, are likely to get only mild-to-moderate illness that can be easily treated at home with the new drugs. While molnupiravir is awaiting emergency use authorization in India, the process to get paxlovid commercially available is being fasttracked in western countries and will soon be made available in India. If these drugs get authorized in the coming weeks, they could prove key treatment options for people with Covid-19 amid the Omicron concern, infectious diseases experts said. “The ability to treat Covid-19 with an oral pill rather than an injection or infusion means more people can be treated faster,” said infectious diseases expert Dr Sanjay Pujari, member of the national Covid task force. Read AlsoPfizer says Covid-19 pill near 90% effective in final analysisThe US drugmaker last month said the oral medicine was around 89% effective in preventing hospitalizations or deaths when compared to placebo based on interim results in around 1,200 people. The data disclosed on Tuesday includes an additional 1,000 people.“Both the drugs have shown efficacy to reduce the risk of progression to severe disease or death amongst patients with mild illness and those with risk factors for progression,” he added. Molnupiravir is approved in the UK and the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) advisory panel voted closely (13 to 10) in its favour. Similarly, following promising preliminary results of paxlovid, approval is being sought for emergency use authorization for the oral pill from the USFDA. Although data on both the drugs’ effectiveness against Omicron is currently pending, both the antivirals are most likely to prove effective in treating infection from the new variant because of the mechanism they act on. Omicron live updatesMutations are more common in spike proteins. Omicron has a total of 32 mutations in the spike protein. “In laboratory studies, molnupiravir has been shown to be effective against other variants like Alpha and Delta,” Dr Pujari said. “Once authorized, these pills will allow patients to be treated earlier in the course of infection, at the point when antiviral drugs are more effective. By stopping the virus from growing in the body early on, the drugs can prevent the inflammation that causes severe Covid-19,” said Ahmedabad-based Dr Atul Patel, director (infectious diseases) at Vedanta Institute of Medical Sciences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-bank-on-2-new-oral-antivirals-to-treat-omicron/articleshow/88286000.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal had moved the proposal. “Kale, who was DCFO of Zone 6, has been found guilty of violating service conduct norms and all the charges against him were proved. The charges against him are grave in nature and as punishment, I seek your approval to dismiss him from municipal service,” Chahal stated in the proposal. “It was found that Kale deliberately and with a malafide intent misled the superiors and by that, he also misled the state government, the Governor’s office and the President.” Kale did not respond to TOI’s request for comment. –Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dismissal-of-fire-officer-approved/articleshow/88286018.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Pune||Three mucormycosis patients found in Pune district last week||PUNE: Covid-associated mucormycosis (CAM) or black fungus cases have gone down significantly, but fresh cases in small numbers have continued to surface. Last week alone, three new cases of CAM were reported in Pune district between December 2 and December 8. Five patients succumbed to complications last month. Besides, a total of 21 patients are currently undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the district, including state-run Sassoon General Hospital. Treating doctors have appealed to citizens not to delay seeking medical care if they face any complaints during or after Covid recovery. With this, the number of total CAM cases has gone up to 1,548 in the region in the last eight months. The detection of new cases has been slowly on the wane since the beginning of September. Of the total 1,548 patients, 1,298 have recovered from the invasive fungal infection — that mainly attacks the sinuses — and 229 have succumbed to complications so far. The most commonly known factor for contracting mucormycosis in recovering Covid patients is combination of uncontrolled diabetes and the use of steroids. “Most of the new patients are being referred to Pune from neighbouring districts, including Ahmednagar and Solapur. Quite a few of these cases have developed complications as they delayed seeking medical care in time,” said Sassoon hospital’s ENT surgeon, Samir Joshi. Blackish discoloration over the bridge of the nose or palate and blurred or double vision with pain have emerged as prominent red flags with one-side facial pain or numbness, toothache and sinusitis, experts said. Cases of mucormycosis, or black fungus, had increased significantly during the second wave (February-August) this year. However, the mucormycosis cases started declining after a drastic drop in the daily Covid cases across the state. “Earlier, we would see mucormycosis 20 to 40 cases every week. The weekly number has gone down to three to four cases now,” said additional district health official Abhay Tidke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-mucormycosis-patients-found-in-district-last-week/articleshow/88286014.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The projects included the laying of foundation for a medical college and hospital at Jamui worth Rs500 crore and inauguration of the health department’s command and control centre. The CM announced the construction of a superspeciality hospital for children in the state. He said the state government will construct a rest house near AIIMS-Patna for the attendants and provide land for the expansion of the hospital. Nitish appreciated the work being done in the field of health. He said earlier (before he came to power in 2005), the state had six government and two private medical college and hospitals. Now, there are 16 government and six private medical college and hospitals. He recalled the development in the health sector, be it increase in the footfall at primary health centres, from 39 in 2005 to 10,000 per month now, or medical aid through telemedicine and other upgraded technologies. He said the primary health centres which had six beds were now being upgraded to 30 bedded community health centre. “A lot has been done at IGIMS also, which will have 2500 beds soon,” he said and also listed the names of Jai Prakash Narain Hospital at Rajbanshi Nagar, Rajendra Nagar Eye Hospital and the upgradation of Gardiner Road Hospital. He said the Bal Hriday Yojana, started in February, has been of great help and 264 children have been provided treatment under the scheme so far. Nitish said all arrangements have been done to tackle any thord wave of Covid-19 and Bihar was testing more samples than the national average. Nine healthcare workers were given appointment letters in symbolic form on the occasion. Purnia, Saharsa, Gaya, Patna and Siwan districts were given appreciation certificates for administering the first Covid vaccine dose and Saharsa, Siwan, East Champaran and West Champaran for the second dose. Several officials and healthcare workers, including CM’s special secretary-cum-executive director of Ayush Samiti, Arvinder Singh, and state health society additional executive director Animesh Kumar Parashar, were honoured for their contribution in the field of health. State health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said the starting of e-office (command and control centre) at the health department will smoothen the work. As per a press statement, this is the first of its kind in the country to help in monitoring all the health centres, availability of equipment and maintenance of data. Amrit said Rs4 lakh each as monetary help was paid to the kin of over 9,000 Covid-19 victims. He said the department was ready to face any challenge. Culprits will not be spared: CM Chief minister Nitish Kumar said the investigation into the botched-up cataract surgery in Muzaffarpur has been conducted and culprits will not be spared. He also announced ‘some help’ for those who have lost their eyes, apart from their free treatment. “Those who have lost their eyes will no longer be able to see. We are discussing about some help for them,” said Nitish. He asked the private hospitals to ensure the safety of people. “I tell people what is the need to go to private hospitals when all arrangements have been made by the government,” he said, but also appreciated several private hospitals for “doing tremendous job”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-launches-health-dept-schemes-worth-rs1919cr/articleshow/88285192.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Pune||Urge civic bodies to approve boom barriers, wardens at BRTS corridors: PMPML||Pune: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has urged the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) to approve the boom barrier project without any delay and take steps to safeguard the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) corridors. Laxminarayan Mishra, chairman and managing director (CMD) of the transport body, said PMPML was working in coordination with commissioners of both the corporations on the issue. “A proposal has been sent to the corporations, but they are yet to approve it. We are in touch with both the commissioners and have requested them to approve the project, so that work on the same can be started,” the CMD told TOI. After the accident around midnight on Wednesday, which resulted in the death of two youths near Kharadi along the Pune-Ahmednagar Road, the need to secure the BRTS corridors was raised and the inaction of the PMPML and the civic bodies was questioned by many. Mishra added that until the barriers come up, there were plans to appoint a few guards on the BRTS corridors. “The process is on, and some guards will be deployed soon,” he added. “The PMC is serious about the project and we will approve it soon. Work on some of the corridors should be completed within the next two months,” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee of the PMC told TOI. The transport body said that the corridors prone to accidents would be selected. “Some studies have already taken place. The Nigdi-Dapodi and Sangvi Phata-Kivale corridors will be taken up in the first phase,” an official said. Both the PMC and PCMC areas have a total of seven corridors — Nigdi-Dapodi, Sangamwadi-Vishrantwadi, Nashik Phata-Wakad, Kalewadi-Spine Road, Sangvi-Kiwale, Yerawada-Wagholi and Swargate-Katraj. Activists have questioned the intent of the PMPML plans. “Every time there is a mishap, the officials talk about bringing the wardens back and the barrier project, but soon all is forgotten until another accident happens. The government must take serious note of the issue,” said PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/urge-civic-bodies-to-approve-boom-barriers-wardens-at-brts-corridors-pmpml/articleshow/88286022.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Firm bags MoD order for mountain foot bridge||Pune: City-based equipment manufacturer Worldwide Oilfield Machine has signed an Rs32 crore deal with the Ministry of Defence to manufacture and supply 30 lightweight Mountain Foot Bridge developed by premier DRDO lab Research and Development Establishment (Engineers) here. The R&DE (Enggrs) has given the licence to the firm to manufacture the bridges as part of a tech transfer deal. The bridge is to be inducted by the Indian Army and will be useful in high-altitude regions. It is made of high-strength aluminium alloys and capable of withstanding conditions prevailing in high-altitude regions like Siachen. Ajay Shinde, manager (projects and strategic products) of the firm, said, “The bridge will be made from Indian materials. As per the agreement, we will deliver the first bridge to the Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) on August 17, 2022. A total contract worth Rs32 crore has been signed with the ministry to complete the manufacturing of all 30 bridges.” He said, the bridge can also be used effectively in natural disasters like floods to safely rescue people from flood-affected areas. The bridge can be launched manually in 90 minutes with a crew of 15. It can carry in components with a maximum weight of each is 18 kg. “The trials of the bridge had carried out at Siachen glacier and in Arunachal Pradesh extensively. After achieving the desired results, the Army accepted the bridges. Now, we are in the process of developing its advanced version that can be suitable for vehicle carrying in the high altitude region,” said a senior official from the DRDO on condition of anonymity. The maximum length of the MFB is 34.5 meters with a walkway width of 0.8 meters. “The bridge can allow accumulation of fresh snow up to half a meter. This capability will enable the troops’ movement smoothly in tough regions, where covering even a meter’s distance is a big challenge,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/firm-bags-mod-order-for-mountain-foot-bridge/articleshow/88286033.cms||Sandip Dighe

The gang, which robbed Mangesh Vandre and his wife of valuables worth Rs80,000 at knife-point, used the stolen bikes to flee. Though the gang has remained elusive, police have recovered the three bikes, including the one which was abandoned during a chase by patrolling team of Beltarodi police. Police, who were informed about the dacoity, while investigating the matter found a house in the area open, but no one from the Hiwrale family present. When the police looked inside, they found empty packets of ready-to-eat Chinese food and sauce sachets in the kitchen, leading the cops to conclude it to be the handiwork of the miscreants. The police are also baffled as the ‘polite’ dacoits addressed Vandre as ‘Mangesh Bhau’ and demanded Rs6 lakh from him. Offering a blanket, they also urged Mangesh and his wife to ‘sleep peacefully’. While leaving the house, the dacoits were also heard talking among themselves about ‘teaching moti (fat women) a lesson’ referring to some unknown context. Though the latest dacoity had several similarities with that of the one at Dabha around two weeks ago, there are many issues which have kept the cops intrigued. At Dabha, the dacoits were conversing in Hindi, while some of the gang members at Chinchbhuvan were speaking in Marathi also, which hints at the involvement of locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dacoits-cooked-chinese-in-a-house-stole-3-bikes/articleshow/88286029.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Mumbai||Turf club fraternity rises to help racing survive in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Fighting a battle for its existence owing to the halted revenues induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, the end for the already cash-strapped Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) didn’t appear too far. But the racing fraternity rose to the occasion and joined hands to do something unprecedented in Indian history: initiating a donation drive to ensure the racing in the city stays afloat. The Mumbai Season, which gets underway from Thursday, December 16, will be organised almost entirely on the city fraternity’s charity. It all started with an initial contribution of nearly Rs 3 crore with everyone from the managing committee to ordinary members, horse owners, trainers, and even the club employees chipping in. The list of donors is available on the club’s website. The donation amount, which even helped racing survive in Pune last month, has kept on swelling with many owners coming forward to sponsor the prize money of races to be held at the Mahalaxmi racecourse in the coming months. Leading the helping hands are the Poonawalla brothers, Cyrus and Zavaray, the current chairman. Both have either donated or sponsored races to the tune of crores. “I could not have remained a silent spectator in these times of crisis,” Zavaray Poonawalla told TOI. “I had promised to save the sport and I have put my money where my mouth is. Am happy that I have managed to steady the ship and hope others will keep it afloat,” he added. “We did our best to cut down on expenses and reduce the workforce but thanks to our committed staff, we have managed to get things going,” said Surendra Sanas, a committee member. The trio of Zavaray Poonawalla, former chairman KN Dhunjibhoy, and an unnamed owner has promised to add nearly Rs 3 lakh to every race to be held during the Mumbai Season for top class and younger horses.“Owners love their horses and the sport. We will do and are doing all we need to, to ensure that the show goes on at Mahalaxmi,” said Shiven Surendranath, president of Western India Race Horse Owners’ Association. In all, the 22-day Mumbai Season 2021-22, which runs till end of April, will have prize money of nearly Rs 1 crore up for grabs every day. To drive home the point that Mumbai is the prime racing centre in the country, RWITC is organising the biggest racing action ever seen in the history of Indian racing in a single day with seven Group races including five Group 1 races on the Indian Turf Invitation day on December 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-turf-club-fraternity-rises-to-help-racing-survive-in-the-city/articleshow/88286044.cms||Shailendra Awasthi
---||Kochi||Siddiqui Kappan, PFI activists’ case moved to NIA court in Lucknow||AGRA: A local court in Mathura on Monday transferred the sedition and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) case against journalist Siddiqui Kappan and seven other Popular Front of India (PFI) activists to a special national investigation agency (NIA) court in Lucknow. The journalist was booked along with three others after he attempted to visit the family of a 19-year-old Dalit rape and murder victim in Hathras last year. Four others were arrested subsequently. The court of additional district and sessions judge Anil Kumar Pandey ordered the transfer after accepting an application filed by a special task force (STF) of the UP police. The application stated that the government had constituted a special court in the state headquarters under section 22 of the NIA Act, according to an order issued on April 20. The next hearing of the matter is scheduled in January next year. The PFI activists’ lawyer, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, said that he would be challenging the district court’s order in the high court. He argued that the police did not follow due procedure under the NIA Act, which is why the special court in Lucknow did not have the jurisdiction to hear the case. He said UAPA offences are listed under the NIA Act and section 6 of the Act says that after an offence is registered, the station in-charge is supposed to file a report with the state government, which must inform the Centre1. Within15 days, the Centre has to take a call on whether the offence was scheduled or not, and also decide who will investigate the case. “The investigating agency was not chosen by the Centre, hence due procedure was not followed,” Chaturvedi said. Initially, the Mathura police had arrested four PFI members, Siddique Kappan, Atiqur-Rahman, Masood Ahmad, and their driver Alam, while they were going to visit the family of the Hathras victim on October 5 last year. Later, Rauf Sherif, the general secretary of the Campus Front of India, which is the student wing of PFI, was arrested along with activists Asad Badruddin, Firoz Khan, and Mohammad Danish. All were accused of receiving funds from abroad to foment caste riots in Hathras. The five-member STF of the UP police had filed a 5,000-page chargesheet in the case in April this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kappan-pfi-activists-case-moved-to-nia-court/articleshow/88286054.cms||---

The schools have been closed since November 29 due to air pollution. Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, a society with over 2,000 private schools as its members, has written to the deputy chief minister, “School is where the children belong. It is really heart-wrenching to see the corridors devoid of the hubbub of the children. Just when, the children were overjoyed with the announcement of the reopening of the schools, soon came the closure notice, too, due to adverse air quality.” It added, “So, now when the air quality has improved, it’s time to reopen the schools without further ado. Children really need to come out of home-bound scenario into their most treasured zone.” Human-to-human interaction is indispensable for mental, social and emotional wellbeing of the children, the society has stressed. “One-to-one interaction, healthy competitive environment, extracurricular activities and, above all, perfect ambience to study are really significant for a student. Besides, education in an offline mode cannot be replicated in an online mode.” On Monday, the education department and the chairperson of Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights wrote to Commission for Air Quality Management, requesting it to review the decision on school reopening. The Supreme Court has asked the commission to decide on easing the restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/private-schools-body-writes-to-sisodia-with-reopening-plea/articleshow/88286034.cms||---

They had booked flight tickets in mid-November and as they were about to book accommodation, they were informed by the hotel that it would not be possible for them to return the amount to them if sudden restriction were imposed. Tambe said, “The hotel did not deny the booking, but it said it was at our risk. So, we decided not to book the hotel, and also cancelled our flight tickets. We were three families going together and the cancellation of airfare cost us Rs60,000.” Travellers who had to cancel their flights or accommodation bookings for the holiday season were not just disappointed due to the sudden change in plans but had to incur huge losses. Many travellers and family bookings had to bear losses ranging between Rs10K to Rs 50K for cancelling their bookings due to the new variant. Many said that they did not want to take the risk of reaching their holiday destination and then facing unprecedented problems if restrictions are imposed due to the new variant. Some hotels have said that that they would conduct RT-PCR tests and would not accept reports of any outside labs. Manas Gohil, another traveller who had booked his vacation with his family, said, “We were to go to Sikkim for ten days from December 21. Our flight tickets had to be cancelled as the airlines told us that we were from Maharashtra where there were cases of the new Covid variant. The other states are not accepting travellers from states which have recorded Omicron cases. So, we cancelled the tickets and had to forego almost 50% of the fare.” Many travellers had booked family vacations and are wary of travelling. They said that taking a family along was a big risk because even if they were vaccinated, they did not want to expose their kids to the new variant. Amir Sayyed, a tourist operator, said, “There have been many cancellations of hotel bookings in the past few days as hotels have been imposing strict restrictions with tests and other rules that are difficult to follow for many travellers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tourists-face-big-financial-losses-over-cancelled-bookings/articleshow/88286038.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

But, things have changed now and it becomes clear immediately after coming out of the airport. Everything looks changed and less time is taken in reaching the city from the airport. Ring Road, which has been constructed in a record time, has reduced the vehicle load on city roads. All the roads leading to Varanasi have been widened,” Modi said while speaking about the issue of development at Vihangam Yog Sansthan in Umraha area before leaving for Delhi. Elaborating his attachment to the city, the PM said, “Even while in Delhi I keep thinking about the development of Kashi. And, when I got an opportunity after 12.30am on Monday, I went to see the work that has been completed or is in progress in city areas. The work done at Godowlia pleases one’s eyes while the Banaras railway station has been transformed completely.” He added that Kashi is guiding the country to a new direction and the development that has taken place here has given a massive boost to the tourism sector. “Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the figures of tourist influx kept rising in 2019-20 and it was almost double the figures of tourist arrivals in 2014,” he said. “Kashi has shown that change is possible with strong willpower,” Modi said adding, “Other shrines and pilgrimage sites are also been developed on the same lines. This is evident at Kedarnath, which was spoiled in 2013 but today new records of footfall of pilgrims are being set there. The same confidence is helping the country to set new milestones of development,” he added while further elaborating Varanasi’s development. “Today, when anyone reaches the ghats along the river Ganga or Kashi Vishwanath temple, the developments become evident as per the stature of this holy place. Overhead wires are getting underground, sewage is discharged in rivers only after treatment,” he said, adding, “These developments are benefiting art, culture and trade apart from faith and tourism.” The PM said, “The Rudraksh convention centre, DDU Trade Facilitation Centre and other facilities are giving a strong support to the skill of artisans while improved health facilities have turned the city into a medical hub.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashi-has-cleared-roadmap-of-indias-development-pm/articleshow/88286679.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

However, schools are still contemplating whether to reopen or not, especially as Christmas vacations are around the corner. The director and honorary secretary of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Nandkumar Kakirde said that the schools will be closed for Christmas vacations from December 24. Hence, there is no use in reopening the school for just five days. “We are reopening school for Std V to VII from January 3. We will seek parents’ opinion and then decide to reopen for the lower primary classes from Std I to IV in the weeks later,” said Kakirde. The decision to allow only 50% of students in the class and other criteria etc are creating a lot of problems. “First of all, the government must have considered all facts before passing the order on reopening. It is very stressful and hard for teachers to take classes online and offline simultaneously. It is difficult to manage a class of 25 young students and then also pay equal attention to the other 25 students attending online,” added Kakirde. Schools in Mumbai are all set to reopen on Wednesday after the civic body decided to allow in-person classes. Activists have been insisting on physical classes to stem the loss from online learning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-area-primary-schools-to-reopen-from-tomorrow/articleshow/88286060.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Delhi||Wetland Tag For Najafgarh Jheel May Provide It Legal Protection...||New Delhi: The central government has proposed to notify Najafgarh Jheel as a “transboundary” wetland. No waterbody in Delhi, so far, has been notified as a wetland, which gets legal protection. The proposal for the Najafgarh lake, which falls in both Delhi and Haryana, has been made by the Union ministry of environment and forest and climate change (MoEF&CC). According to a recent report submitted by Central Pollution Control Board to National Green Tribunal (NGT), “The wetland division, MoEF & CC, proposed to notify Najafgarh Jheel as Najafgarh Wetland being a transboundary wetland, based on the brief documents submitted by both Delhi and Haryana states to MoEF&CC.” The report added that a framework for an integrated environment management plan for Najafgarh Jheel, as approved by the ministry, will be implemented in a time-bound manner by the Delhi and Haryana governments within their respective boundaries. The ministry came out with the guidelines last year for implementing Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules 2017. The guidelines state that for each wetland proposed to be notified, a “brief document” should be prepared with information like demarcation of wetland boundary, supported by accurate digital maps with coordinates and validated by ground truthing; ecological character description; account of pre-existing rights and privileges; and modalities for enforcement of regulation. Explaining the process of notification, Manu Bhatnagar of Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage, which filed a plea in NGT on restoration of the lake, said, “After brief documents are submitted, the ministry will have to issue a draft notification on the wetland, giving details of the layout and activities permitted or banned in and around the waterbody.” The ministry will invite suggestions or objections for a specific period before issuing the notification, and steps will be taken for the waterbody’s conservation, he added. Both Delhi and Haryana have submitted their environmental management plans listing immediate, medium- and long-term measures. An official of the Delhi environment department said, “Based on the environment management plans submitted by Delhi and Haryana, the ministry will provide a joint plan. We will start implementing the immediate measures once we receive the joint plan.” In both plans submitted by the two governments, most of the recommendations were almost the same. While medium-term measures are meant to be implemented in two-three years, the long-term ones are likely to need three-five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wetland-tag-for-najafgarh-jheel-may-provide-it-legal-protection-/articleshow/88286093.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Delhi||Delhi govt to treat two drains from Haryana bringing in dirty water||New Delhi: In another step to control the contamination of the Yamuna, the Delhi government will treat the wastewater that two major drains from Haryana are bringing into the city. According to water minister Satyendar Jain, the Yamuna receives 155 million gallons per day (MGD) of sewage from neighbouring states, which includes two large drains from Haryana — drain number 6 and Badshahpur drain. Delhi Jal Board is already treating the sewage water coming from drain number 6 at the Narela sewage treatment plant and will now treat 95MGD of sewage water coming from the Badshahpur drain through an in situ technology. “The in situ technology will filter and treat the water in the drains themselves. It will save the cost of building new sewage treatment plants and the sewage water falling into the Yamuna can also be treated,” said Jain, who went on an inspection visit to Badshahpur. The minister also explained the government’s plan to set up reverse osmosis (RO) plants in the national capital to treat saline water. As per the scheme, water-processing plants will be developed in areas where the groundwater level is high but not usable due to salinity. The areas selected by the government include Okhla, Dwarka, Nilothi-Nangloi, Chilla, Rohini and Najafgarh. The government is going to set up 10MGD reverse osmosis plants from which clean drinking water will be supplied to all nearby villages. A total production target of 90MGD has been set from these areas and the project is expected to be completed in a year. The new RO plants will not waste much water in the purification process, and the water recovery rate of these plants will be 80%, said Jain. According to a report of Central Ground Water Board, Delhi’s groundwater contains more than 22 lakh MGD of saline water. To make it potable and fit for supply, it needs to be treated with reverse osmosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-to-treat-two-drains-from-haryana-bringing-in-dirty-water/articleshow/88286106.cms||---

The NCP delegation, led by netas like Prashant Pawar and Duneshwar Pethe, has demanded a probe against Maharashtra State Mining Corporation Limited, Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited, Indian Bureau of Mines and private players concerned. The NCP leaders claimed several discrepancies in dealing have cost Mahagenco a loss of around Rs4,760 crore due to the selling of rejected coal to the washeries. Their complaint also mentions a loss of around Rs952 crores for non-payment of GST and Rs238 crore for non-payment of royalties, among other such evasion of taxes and duties. The delegation has also stated that an inquiry is required for the disposal of coal by washeries in contravention of the guidelines. The delegation has pointed out alleged money laundering by the private companies involved with Mahagenco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ncp-demands-cbi-action-on-coal-scam/articleshow/88286110.cms||Soumitra Bose

The state has so far reported about 20.7 lakh infections and 14,460 fatalities. As many as 24 states/UTs in the country recorded more than 1% fatality rate, while it is 0.7% in Andhra Pradesh. Punjab tops the charts with a 2.7% mortality rate. Nagaland, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra witnessed a more than 2% death rate. Andhra Pradesh occupies the 31st place among all states and UTs in terms of Covid-19 fatality rate, hinting at enhancing tracing, timely detection of infections and appropriate clinical management. Andhra Pradesh witnessed its first 50 Covid-19 related deaths by the time the state’s cumulative case tally touched the 2,380 mark in May 2020 with a fatality rate of over 2%. At the peak of the first wave in August-September 2020, the mortality rate stabilised at around 0.9%. It further dropped to 0.8% when the curve flattened to the lowest levels on February 15, 2021 with only some 30 new cases. Despite the unprecedented infection numbers during the second wave since March 2021, the fatality rate hovered around 0.8% for several months. With the improvement of the pandemic situation on all parameters in the last three months, including case positivity rate, reproduction numbers, hospitalisations, oxygen consumption, etc., the death rates have further dropped to 0.7%. Director, Andhra Pradesh public health and family welfare department, Dr G Hymavathi, said early preparedness, aggressive testing, effective contact tracing and improved medical management have helped the state in keeping the death rate in check. “The health department has constituted an expert committee to guide Covid-19 containment and management in the state. The state has stuck to a scientific approach since the beginning of the pandemic in March last year,” said Dr Hymavathi. Meanwhile, the state received about 38,000 applications from the kin of Covid-19 deceased for Rs 50,000 ex gratia each. This is against some 14,460 Covid-19 fatalities officially declared by the health department. Of these applications, the state rejected about 6,000 applications on various grounds. The health department has so far processed about 12,000 application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/with-0-7-mortality-rate-ap-at-31st-place-in-covid-deaths/articleshow/88285222.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The viscera has been preserved to examine whether the doctor had consumed poison before jumping into the Ganga. His body was found at Siddhanath Ghat on Sunday. On December 3, the doctor had killed his wife Chandraprabha, son Shikhar and daughter Khushi and went missing. He had left a suicide note mentioning that he is wiping out his whole family owing to fear of Omicron and Covid-19. Since then the police were constantly looking for him. His last location was found at Atal Ghat. The body was found floating in river Ganga near Siddhanath Ghat on Sunday afternoon. On being informed, the DCP West BBGTS Murti reached there. The body was retrieved with the help of Jal police personnel. His car keys, ID cards and medicines were found in the pockets of his clothes. “As per the autopsy report, there were no injury marks on the body and the cause of death was stated to be drowning. Most probably, he had resorted to the extreme step on the evening of December 3, the day when he had killed his wife, son and daughter. Amrit Lal, the elder brother of the accused doctor, meanwhile, said that it is even more painful that the mystery of the triple murder could not be ascertained. “Now it will never be known why my brother resorted to such extreme step,” he said. The relatives performed the last rites of the deceased doctor at Bhairav Ghat on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/drowning-as-cause-of-death-confirmed-in-postmortem/articleshow/88286116.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After May fanfare, underpass plan at airport to be redrawn||MUMBAI: Six months after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray did bhoomipujan for the construction of new connectors between the airport and Western Express Highway (WEH), MMRDA has gone back to the drawing board to redesign the project. The bhoomipujan was done on May 31 for an elevated road and a vehicular underpass to better connect both terminals of the airport and WEH. The projects were meant to improve vehicular access from WEH towards Dahisar and Bandra. “We have realised that the underground vehicular underpass is not technically feasible. There already exists an underpass to take traffic from the Bandra side to the airport. We will have to go below this level for a second underpass, which is unviable,” said a senior MMRDA official. As per the new plan, a bypass will be built above the existing underpass to take traffic from the airport to WEH’s Dahisar-bound carriageway. The official said, “The highway sinks and ascends at this specific point. We plan to bridge this sinking spot by placing stilts. Above this stilt, the up and down direction traffic to the highway will move. The space created below the stilt will carry traffic from the airport to Dahisar." The carriageway is crucial as vehicles coming from the international terminal have to first come to the south-bound carriageway of WEH and then take a U-turn below the Vile Parle flyover to take Dahisar-bound lanes. Sources said the plan was also altered because it required acquisition of airport land — an expensive proposition. MMRDA had also planned to extend the flyover that brings traffic to the airport from Dahisar. This too will change as land is available near Nand Deep guest house for additional lanes. Apart from this, MMRDA had also planned a vehicular subway from the domestic terminal of the airport to the Bandra-bound lanes and another from Vile Parle to the domestic terminal. MMRDA has said that there are no issues with these lanes for now. Confirming developments, metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas said, “We are reworking the design because of technical issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-may-fanfare-underpass-plan-at-airport-to-be-redrawn/articleshow/88286135.cms||Manthank Mehta

Union minister for health and family welfare, Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar, told Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that the clearance for the three medical colleges coming up at Paderu in Visakhapatnam district, Machilipatnam in Krishna and Pidiguralla in Guntur district was given. He gave this information in reply to a question by YSR Congress member V Vijayasai Reddy, who asked for the present status of the 16 medical colleges being constructed by the state government. The minister said that these three medical colleges were cleared under the centrally sponsored scheme for establishing new medical colleges attached with existing district or referral hospitals. The central government through the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare would sponsor these colleges, the minister said. He further informed Vijayasai Reddy that the central government had also cleared the proposal for upgradation of the existing medical colleges under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Three colleges of Siddhartha Medical College in Vijayawada, Government Medical College at Anantapur and Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences at Tirupati, were approved for upgradation with additional infrastructure and facilities under the PMSSY, the minister said. Earlier in the day, the chief minister told district collectors to gear up the hospitals to meet the impending Covid-19 threat. He told the collectors to complete 100 per cent vaccination. He wanted the collectors to complete 100 per cent first dose vaccination by December 31. He also told the collectors to speed up giving the second dose of vaccination in the next two months. The chief minister congratulated Nellore district collector who completed 100 per cent vaccination of first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/centre-gives-green-signal-to-three-medical-colleges-in-state/articleshow/88285232.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP promised 100 parking sites, didn’t build 10, says AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj||NEW DELHI: AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj on Tuesday said that BJP promised 100 parking complexes in its manifesto 10 years ago but has not provided even 10 parking complexes till now. In a press conference, Bharadwaj stated that Delhi needs parking space for around one crore vehicles as per its population and Supreme Court and High Court have reprimanded the corporations several times over it. The MLA claimed that parking charges were being collected illegally at hospitals and malls. AAP has started a campaign to highlight the various responsibilities of the corporations and under the campaign, it elaborated on parking issues on Tuesday. “Parking is strictly corporations’ responsibility. The absence of regularised parking causes people to haphazardly park on the roadside, causing traffic jams and many other troubles. In 2017, SDMC promised 27 parking spaces. Out of this, only two parking spaces were built and one of them collapsed,” Bharadwaj stated. “SDMC has collected around Rs 400 crore for parking over the last 5 years. North DMC has collected Rs 284 crore for the parking construction. This money is collected from markets with the sole purpose of developing parking lots. Despite this ginormous budget, they failed to develop the promised parking spaces,” Bharadwaj stated, adding that most of the parking sites in Delhi are running illegally in connivance with BJP-led corporations. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP functionaries opposed construction of car parking at Karol Bagh & Shalimar Bagh and at some other places. “It seems AAP leaders level allegations just to confuse people. Parking charges collected by the corporations are far less than what is needed to construct parking complexes, therefore, the corporations are choosing PPP model for several projects,” said Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-promised-100-parking-sites-didnt-build-10-aap/articleshow/88286123.cms||---

According to the corporation, there are 132 plots of different sizes that have been identified for e-auctioning at Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar. These include community centre areas and land near a proposed railway line. “The plots shall be used for warehousing, godowns and uses related to transport allied business and not used for all the commercial facilities in view of the nature of the Transport Nagar and there will be restricted usages of these plots,” said North Corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel’s letter. Aam Aadmi Party had earlier accused the BJP-led corporation of selling the plots at ‘throwaway’ prices. BJP councillors are ‘pocketing’ the money by selling public assets owned by the corporation, it alleged. “The BJP-led North MCD is planning to sell about 132 plots of land in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar at abysmal, throwaway prices – selling them off at circle rates. Even if you walk around the whole of Delhi with a lamp, you will not find a single piece of land at such atrocious rates. The BJP-led North MCD is selling plots in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar at par with circle rates so they can fill their own pockets,” AAP MLA Dilip Pandey claimed recently. “It is proposed to dispose of these plots through e-auction as per the reserve price of individual plots based on the circle rates applicable as on today. It is clarified that in case Delhi government modifies the circle rates, the reserve price will be modified accordingly,” said Goel in his letter further. The reserve price of the 132 plots on leasehold basis comes to Rs 3,73,89,25,714, the proposal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-to-auction-132-plots-at-sanjay-gandhi-transport-ngr/articleshow/88286133.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Emotional comeback for Bawankule into council after 2 yrs||Nagpur: Two years after being denied a ticket during the 2019 assembly polls, BJP’s Chandrashekhar Bawankule turned emotional while hugging leader of opposition (LOP) Devendra Fadnavis during the victory celebrations here on Tuesday. He just held Fadnavis and tears rolled out of his eyes. After securing victory, the new MLC visited Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s home with his son, where he was traditionally welcomed by his wife Kanchan by offering a coconut. Gadkari later congratulated him over his stupendous success through a Tweet from Delhi, where he was attending the Parliament session. The saffron party managed to retain the seat after 2015 MLC polls, when Girish Vyas was elected unopposed. “The internal feud between various factions of Congress led to their debacle. We got 44 MVA votes, which are more or less from the Congress, led by its incapable state chief Nana Patole. He succumbed to pressure from two local ministers and changed the candidate just 12 hours before the polls, and supported an independent candidate. It has never happened in history. Patole must accept moral responsibility of party’s crushing defeat and resign,” Bawankule said. Hailing the massive victories in Vidarbha, BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil said he was happy for both winning candidates, Bawankule and Vasant Khandelwal. “The MVA should now conduct the assembly speaker’s election through secret polling to perform a reality check. The Nagpur battle was made into a prestige issue by the Congress, and also lost by their childish moves. Bawankule’s patience finally paid off.” An elated city BJP president Pravin Datke said the BJP had managed to get quota of all 318 votes and received 44 cross votes from the opposition. “I want to sincerely thank MVA voters along with ours. The MVA partners are always at loggerheads. They are together only on paper, as it is a marriage of convenience.” Earlier, in the morning, party activists gathered at the counting centre at the collectorate and celebrations started as soon as Bawankule took the lead from first round. By the second round, the picture was more or less clear, and the activists arrived at a lawn in Civil Lines with traditional bands and waving party flags. They were seen raising party slogans and hailing their leaders, including Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Fadnavis and Datke. A minimum of 275 votes were required for victory. In the first preference vote count, the BJP polled 362 votes, Congress-backed independent Mangesh Deshmukh secured 186, while former MVA official candidate Ravindra Bhoyar got just one vote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/emotional-comeback-for-bawankule-into-council-after-2-yrs/articleshow/88286140.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra collection of stamp duty down 17% in Nov||Mumbai: Maharashtra’s stamp duty collections dipped by a steep Rs 548 crore or 17% between October and November this year, indicating a decline in real estate transactions which had seen a steady rise as pandemic restrictions lifted. The stamp duty and registration fee revenue dipped from Rs 3,220 crore in October to Rs 2,672 crore in November, the latest data shows. So far in this financial year, October had reported the highest collections. Officials say the dip in November was expected and was in line with the average revenue in the rest of the months. “October revenues shot up perhaps because real estate sales were higher in the run-up to Diwali. It also reflected the release of pent-up demand,” said a senior Maharashtra government official who did not wish to be named. Real estate transactions have increased steadily since last year. In 2020, the economic hit of the lockdown slowed down sales, but the state’s cut on stamp duty resulted in a turnaround. This year’s transactions so far have been higher than last year. In the eight-month period between April and November, the state has collected stamp duty and registration fees worth Rs 17, 332.5 crore. This is 69% higher than the revenue generated during the same period last year, which was Rs 10,270 crore. Real estate circles say although sales have improved since last year, getting home loans remains a challenge. “Definitely, there are more inquiries and sales this year as the economy improves. But improving credit status and getting housing loans is challenging. It takes time for the housing loan to be cleared since people have to first address other pending loans,” said Nayan Shah, former president of the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry. The revenue from stamp duty and registration fees in Maharashtra was Rs 845 crore in April this year. It rose to Rs 1,157 crore in May, then further to Rs 1,831 crore in June and further still to Rs 2,411 crore in July. The rise continued in August (Rs 2,537 crore) and September (Rs 2,654 crore) and reached Rs 3,220 crore in October, the highest since April, which officials attributed to higher sales closer to Diwali and the result of demand having built up over a period of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-collection-of-stamp-duty-down-17-in-nov/articleshow/88286152.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Over two years ago, they partitioned most of their joint stakes in land, yet some of the properties are still held together. The two had been partners for last 18-20 years. The equations began to change some two years ago and the two began to split ways. Bajoria told TOI that they are partners but most of the properties, other than a couple of plots, have been sold. They remain joint owners of some land. “However, both politics and business are separate,” he said. As the two began to split, there were plans to pitch Khandelwal against Bajoria even in the last MLC elections. However, it could not be finalized till the last moment as there was a likelihood of an alliance between the BJP and Shiv Sena. The seat went to the Shiv Sena finally, said a source closely involved in the developments. “The BJP leadership this time insisted that Khandelwal contest the elections and he agreed,” the source said. Now, after the elections certain decisions may have to be taken over the partnership issue. A call may have to be taken on whether to continue it or not. After elections, the rivalry on both sides has become quite evident, a source said. However, Bajoria remains a partner with some other kin of Khandelwal too, a source said. Basically a bullion trader, this was Khandelwal’s first election. The family has been related to the BJP with active involvement in politics. Khandelwal’s father was involved in allotment of seats. However, none of the family members had come forward to directly contest polls. This time a meeting was held at their home and on the insistence of senior leaders like Nitin Gadkari, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajay Sancheti, Khandelwal decide to contest the polls. His brother Nitin Khandelwal is also a bullion trader and has held the position of director in Gems and Jewellery Council, a trade association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-akola-mlc-still-holds-joint-property-with-losing-candidate/articleshow/88286160.cms||Shishir Arya

A proposal will be tabled in the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday. With the central government clearing the bill introduced in the Parliament to repeal the three farm laws which were opposed by farmer groups, protesting for nearly one year, the state government too feels the amendments introduced by the state will no longer be required. Once the proposal to take back the bills is cleared on Wednesday, it will be tabled in the winter sessions of the legislature to complete the procedure. The three amendment bills, introduced in July in the Assembly, were related to agriculture, cooperation, food and civil supplies, to counter the new farm laws enacted by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-to-take-back-its-three-farm-law-bills/articleshow/88286161.cms||---

---||Delhi||Bipolar man wins long battle to become judge...||New Delhi: Accepting a favourable report from a medical board, which held he would be able discharge his responsibilities as a judicial officer despite suffering from the bipolar affective disorder, the Supreme Court has allowed 2018 Delhi Judicial Service Examination qualifier Bhavya Nain to join the service. The apex court has earlier asked AIIMS to constitute a medical board to examine Nain and file a report. It was hearing an appeal against a Delhi high Court order, which had directed that Nain be allowed to join the lower judiciary after qualifying the examination. Taking the medical report on record, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh upheld the HC order and paved the way for Nain to join the service after two years of legal battle. “The medical board interacted with Bhavya Nain and examined his medical records. The board also spoke to the doctors in person who had earlier issued the disability certificate. The board has opined that Nain suffers from the bipolar affective disorder, but has been in remission (asymptomatic) since August 2018. At present, he is stated not to have any disability and there is nothing to indicate that he will not be able to discharge his responsibilities to the post of judicial officer, for which he has been selected. He has, however, been advised to continue his regular treatment and follow-up with his treating psychiatrist,” the bench said.  Nain cleared the preliminary examination, the main examination and also the interview, but was rejected on the ground that his disability was not found to be permanent as per the disability certificate submitted by him. He then moved HC, which, on May 8 last year, allowed his plea. The HC had also issued consequential directions to declare him as selected to the Delhi Judicial Service being the only qualified candidate in the “mental illness” category with his notional seniority being preserved, along with the other batchmates being deemed to have joined this post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bipolar-man-wins-long-battle-to-become-judge-/articleshow/88286162.cms||---

During the meeting with the traders, Vasco PI Nilesh Rane asked them to ensure the CCTV cameras they install have focus towards roads, which will help police to gather information about miscreants in the event of a crime. “We can get important clues when CCTV footage is available. We do our best to arrest culprits but having CCTV surveillance will be advantageous. It will help reduce crime in the town as there will be a higher risk of being caught,” Rane said. He gave the traders tips on positioning the CCTV cameras, and told them that they should preferably fit cameras near their cash counters, inside their shops, and if possible, one outside. “We are looking for sponsors to install CCTVs cameras in the town. You must cooperate with us to safeguard your interest,” Rane told the traders. Most traders assured the PI that they will get CCTV systems installed in their shops as early as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-traders-told-to-install-cctv-cameras/articleshow/88286780.cms||---

Official sources at the Lucknow airport, seeking anonymity, said the pilots of the flight had sensed a bird strike near the lower left fuselage of the aircraft at 2,600 feet while climbing after the take-off from the Indira Gandhi airport, New Delhi. “The pilots sensed a burning smell inside the cockpit and cabin for five to six minutes after the hit. However, the aircraft dashboard and instrument panels were showing normal readings on aircraft’s health, therefore the journey was continued,” said the sources. The aircraft landed safely in Lucknow after the 47-minute flight. “The pilots did not inform the air traffic control about the bird strike while landing at Lucknow airport at around 2.51pm. Only an hour later, the ground handling staff informed the Lucknow airport authorities about the incident, following which aircraft maintenance engineer (AME) started inspection of the aircraft,” sources added. The unscheduled inspection delayed the flight for Delhi-bound 117 passengers. “Initially, AME had expected to clear the aircraft for takeoff by 8pm, but later the 150-seater Airbus A320-232 was declared unfit (aircraft on ground) for immediate departure. At 7.53pm, an empty aircraft was brought from New Delhi and flew with all 117 passengers at 8.57pm,” said the source. Lucknow airport officials said, “It’s immediately not clear if the pilots informed the New Delhi airport traffic control about the incident, since s they did not inform Lucknow ATC.” Watch Delhi-Lucknow flight carrying 148 onboard, suffers bird hit, lands safely||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/flight-suffers-bird-hit-in-delhi-lands-safely-at-amausi/articleshow/88286734.cms||Arvind Chauhan

---||Hyderabad||Firm quizzes bank’s move to call fraud after forensic clean chit||Hyderabad: What should be role of aggrieved banks if their own forensic auditor gives a clean chit to big defaulter? Can it draw its own findings from the forensic report and go ahead to declare the defaulter’s account as a fraud? Division bench of Telangana HC may soon answer this question. Bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji on Tuesday heard these questions and the arguments surrounding them while hearing a petition filed by Shree Saraiwwalaa Agrr Refineries Ltd which questioned the decision of the Union Bank of India declaring its account as fraud. The company’s counsel said that the basis for such declaration is the RBI circular that had asked banks to do so. “But the same circular says that a forensic audit report should be taken as the basis for arriving at a decision. In our case, the forensic auditor gave us a clean chit but the bank is calling us as fraud,” he said. The bench in the last hearing noted the fact that the loan was originally extended by Andhra Bank which later merged with Union Bank of India. But the counsel for this bank in the last hearing remained silent despite queries from the bench. The bench then summoned the chief general manager of Union Bank of India asking him to appear before the court on the next date of hearing. Accordingly, when the hearing in the matter resumed on Tuesday, Ashok Chandra, chief general manager, was present before the court. A senior counsel appeared for the bank and said that they do not agree with the findings. The defaulter firm resorted to huge fudging of accounts and was showing a doubtful debt of Rs 397 crore. “Receivables inflated and the drawing power for the company authorities was enhanced,” he said. “Our conclusion about the conduct of the company is different from that of forensic auditor,” bank’s counsel said. A consortium of Union Bank of India, SBI, and ICICI together had lent money to this company which has now gone beyond Rs 1,000 crore with interest, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/firm-quizzes-banks-move-to-call-fraud-after-forensic-clean-chit/articleshow/88285280.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Coup of sorts in Akola-Washim-Buldhana constituency as BJP steals win||Nagpur: It was a coup of sorts in Akola-Buldhana-Washim constituency by the BJP in snatching the MLC local authority constituency seat from its former friend turned foe Shiv Sena, which had occupied it for over 18 years. Despite being nowhere near the majority mark of around 412, the saffron party achieved the unthinkable by turning the tide against the Sena, which was supported by its Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners – NCP and Congress. BJP’s Vasant Khandelwal crushed Sena’s three-time MLC and favourite Gopikisan Bajoria by a big margin of 109 votes when the results were announced on Tuesday. The former polled 443 votes against latter’s 334, while 21 votes were declared invalid. As reported by TOI on Saturday, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) coupled with independents turned the tide in BJP’s favour and set the ground for Khandelwal’s unexpected win. Bajoria’s defeat after 18 years has jolted MVA leaders and activists. The victory margin clearly indicates that BJP not only managed to secure votes from Prakash Ambedkar’s outfit but also from independents, making a big dent in MVA votes. Before the polls, the collective strength of MVA’s three partners was over 400 and they were just six behind the majority mark. On the other hand, BJP at 246 was way behind the halfway mark. It was going to be easy sailing for Bajoria against Khandelwal, who was a first timer at the hustings. The two candidates were business partners for 18-20 years before splitting up two years ago. Out of 822 voters, 808 exercised their right to vote on December 10. Even with collective strength of 246 BJP, 86 VBA and 77 independent voters taken into account, the total comes to 409, just three short of the halfway mark. This means 34 voters cross-voted from MVA to BJP. “This is not my victory alone, but of the sincere efforts by party leaders and workers. I will continue to strive for the overall development of the constituency and thank all for supporting me,” Khandelwal said. A disappointed Bajoria told TOI that cross voting had indeed taken place leading to his downfall. “There is no point in talking about defeat. We accepted the voters’ mandate. We will do a complete analysis and submit a report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. I will continue to work for the party like am doing for all these years. I will also expand the scope of my social work in the constituency,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coup-of-sorts-in-akola-washim-buldhana-constituency-as-bjp-steals-win/articleshow/88286175.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Sood had then said that on August 26, 2014, a few days after the alleged shootout, at 1.45 am, he received an SMS from an international number saying, “Don't go to the USA show slam or i will kill you talk to me; pass this message to Shah Rukh Khan. Don Ravi Pujari.” The show was in connection to the promotions of their film “Happy New Year”. On Tuesday, special public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat asked him several questions pertaining to the statement. Sood stood in the witness box placed at the front of court room number 55 of the City Civil and Sessions Court, Kala Ghoda. Several litigants and lawyers had come to catch a glimpse of the actor. Gharat said that Sood deposed in accordance to his earlier statement. So far over 30 witnesses have deposed during the trial with a couple turning hostile.

The findings confirmed earlier studies, which found milder form of Covid-19 in a majority of children affected, as symptoms were reported in only about a third of the patients studied, while a much lower number, 14% reported hospitalization. Researchers, however, emphasized on the need for continuous genomic surveillance even amongst children infected with Covid-19. The study collected nasal and throat swabs from 583 Covid cases aged 0-18 years in eight Indian states from March to June 2021. Dr Samiran Panda, the chief of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, told TOI, “Children were contracting the infection during the second wave, with the 4th serosurvey of Covid-19 in India showing that more than 50% children belonging to 6-17 year age group were seropositive. Though a significant number of children were infected just like adults, not many of them required institutional care. This was at a time when all the schools were still closed.” Panda said the study was undertaken to know about the variants causing the infection among children during the second wave, which is important to understand the overall behaviour of the virus in paediatric population in India, considering limited research in this field so far. Dr Pragya Yadav, from the NIV and a member of the research team, said, “While a greater proportion of genome sequences found in samples studied from children were Delta, others were variants of interest (VOI). Most common lineages were Delta, followed by Kappa, Alpha and B.1.36, seen in 65.82%, 9.96%, 6.83% and 4.68% in the study population.” The 583 samples collected during March 2020 to June 2021 had representation from eight states (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh Punjab and Andhra Pradesh; as well as one Union Territory (Chandigarh). Delta lineage predominated among samples of children in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana whereas the Kappa variant was observed among children samples from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chandigarh. In the study, more than half the samples were from males and the median age of the study participants was 13 years. More than half of the patients (51.8%) belonged to the age group of 13 year and above.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/delta-main-cause-for-covid-in-indian-kids-in-2nd-wave-study/articleshow/88286168.cms||Neha Madaan

The man was already married, but had promised to marry the 20-year-old victim after divorcing his wife, police said. The accused has been identified as Asif, a resident of Faridabad. Asif went for painting work at a flat where the 20-year-old woman worked as a domestic help, police said. On December 11, the cops said, the woman’s mother reported that her daughter had not returned from work the previous day. A missing report was lodged at DBG Road police station and the CCTV footage of her workplace was scanned. “It was found that the woman left her workplace at 7pm on December 10. Two days later, on December 12, her body was recovered from a jungle area in Faridabad’s Surajkund,” said an officer. CCTV footage from nearby areas revealed that the victim was seen going to a cake shop on December 9 with an unknown person, who was later identified as Asif, the officer added. It was found that the man was one of the labourers working at the same house. Deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan said Asif was detained and he confessed. “Asif said he had befriended the woman at the workplace. She wanted to marry him, but he didn’t initially tell her that he was married. On December 10, both of them met near East Park Road from where he drove to Faridabad where they stayed in a hotel,” the DCP said. At the hotel, Asif told the victim about his wife and the divorce plan; but this led to a heated argument, Chauhan added. The next day, Asif left the hotel on the pretext of making arrangements for their wedding. “After a few hours, he returned with a kitchen knife and took the woman to an isolated place in Surajkund and stabbed her in the neck,” the officer said, adding that he also strangulated her with her dupatta. Asif then came back to work in Delhi to avoid suspicion. He has been booked for murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/married-man-takes-lover-to-isolated-spot-stabs-her-to-death/articleshow/88286176.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi government kills wait time for new vehicle registration certificate||NEW DELHI: A new Delhi government project may soon ensure that the buyers of new vehicles will no longer have to wait for months to get the registration certificate (RC) for their vehicle. Under the pilot project, 1.44 lakh RCs have already been issued since this March, the government said on Tuesday. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the Delhi government had simplified public service delivery in a way no other state had. “What earlier took more than a month will now get done on the spot while buying a vehicle. No extra charges are being levied from customers for printing RCs at the dealer’s point,” Gahlot said during an inspection of an RC printing facility at a vehicle dealer’s showroom in Bhikaji Cama Place. Started in March, the pilot project was soon expanded across Delhi, and by September, all self-registration dealers in the city were empowered to print the certificates, the transport department said, adding that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal would soon dedicate this service to the people. Delhi sees close to six lakh new vehicle registrations annually. It has 263 dealers who will provide the facility of printing RCs at their end. The new QR code-based smart cards for registration certificates have the owner’s name printed on the front, while the microchip and the QR code will be embedded on the reverse. This will enable unification in linking and validating one’s information to smart cards with the Vahan database. The QR code is also being implemented nationwide, and its reader is easily procurable and will do away with the requirement of any manual intervention altogether, the department added. The zonal deputy commissioners of the transport department issue blank RCs with a unique hologram number to the dealer points. This will prevent tampering and duplication problems. Data entry, verification and approval of vehicle registrations will also be done at the dealer’s end, and the authorisation and login credentials, and the e-sign facility will be Aadhaar-based, the department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-kills-wait-time-for-new-vehicle-rc/articleshow/88286190.cms||---

Resplendent in saffron attire, Rizvi walked into the Shia board meeting in Lucknow and announced his resignation even as a resolution was being tabled to annul his membership under Section 16(A) of Waqf Act, Shia Waqf Board chairman Ali Zaidi told TOI. Rizvi’s membership had become untenable after he embraced ‘sanatan dharma’ on December 6.

Talking to TOI, Maulana Syed Raza Hussain Rizvi, member of Shia Waqf Board said, “As per the Waqf Act, only a Shia Muslim can be member of the board and the same condition applies for mutawallis of waqf properties. We were readying to sack him, but he appeared before the board and resigned from all waqf posts.” In his resignation letter, Rizvi stated since he embraced ‘sanatan dharma’, he’s no longer a Shia Muslim and was severing all links with the community and the Shia Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rizvi-aka-tyagi-quits-shia-board/articleshow/88286737.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

He was speaking to the media on Tuesday during his visit to the city to greet Chandrashekar Bawankule on his victory, at Swagat Lawns in Civil Lines. “I am extremely happy over Bawankule’s landslide win today. In fact, I am more elated than my own victory in the polls over his success. Even in Akola-Buldhana-Washim constituency, Vasant Khandewal registered an emphatic win. It is a start of MVA’s slide in the state and it will not be able to win any elections in future after losing people’s trust,” the former chief minister said. Stressing that both triumphs were decisive ones, Fadnavis said it busted the myth of three-party coalition would win any election. “We won four out of six MLC local authority constituency seats. We thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, party president JP Nadda, and state president Chandrakant Dada Patil for reposing trust on us. I specially thank our leader and Union minister Nitin Gadkari, under whose guidance we successfully fought these polls here.” Adding that Bawankule’s victory would start a new trend of saffron party winning all future elections, the Southwest Nagpur MLA said the people of Maharashtra would continue to bless the party. “We got all our full quota of votes and also from MVA. I thank the voters for trusting our candidates.” Explaining Bawankule’s gap of over two years for making a comeback to the Maharashtra assembly, the BJP leader said it was not a legislative gap, but a party one. “There are two big posts in any political party – president and general secretary. He was offered second position. Now, Bawankule’s comeback is his ‘never go back’.” Speaking on former BJP corporator Ravindra Bhoyar, who switched over to Congress and was then dumped, Fadnavis said he made blunders one after the other. “First, he joined Congress and then was put in such a situation that he voted for himself, which was the solitary one he received.” On party’s prospects, he said BJP’s emphatic conquest boosted the morale of its workers across Vidarbha. “It is at an all-time high that will benefit us in all our future polls, and we will win next year’s civic elections with a convincing margin. The party under Patil has already made full preparations for all local body polls and BJP would again emerge the number one party in state next year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/twin-victories-a-tight-slap-on-mvas-face-fadnavis/articleshow/88286196.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Besides the fake chain (gundla mala), police seized Rs 10.45 lakh in cash and from their possession. Speaking to the media, police commissioner Tarun Joshi said the duo from Karnataka — P Mohan Lal and Solanki Dharma — were habituated to a luxurious life and addicted to alcohol. Mohan Lal, who was a trader, lost his earnings after the Covid-19 pandemic struck. He join hands with Dharma to sell fake gold ornaments. In October, the two came to the city from Bengaluru. They recently approached a pesticide dealer at the Enumamula market area and introduced themselves as road contact workers. The next day, they contacted the shopkeeper again and showed him the gundla mala stating that they found it during road repair works. They then asked him to arrange money for them while keeping the ornament with him as security. They said the money was for their sister’s wedding. To fool the dealer, they first gave him one gold ball from the chain to ascertain if it was real. The shop owner, after confirming that the ball was indeed real gold, handed over Rs 12 lakh to the duo. However, once the ornament was with him, on checking he found out it was fake. The pesticide dealer then approached Intezargunj police. On Tuesday, the duo came to Warangal railway station. On seeing them, police took them into custody.

This is the first-of-its-kind distribution transformer installed by a power distribution company in the country, a TPDDL statement said. The transformer can be easily installed under the multilane main roads, service roads, public parks, building parking, basements and public parking places. It is a virtual zero space installation, as the top surface can be used for general purpose application like walkways, roads and parks among others, the company said in a statement. This 630 kilo volt-ampere submersible transformer has been installed under the parking space of its substation building in collaboration with Toshiba Transmission and Distribution Systems (India). The setup will help in providing continuous and reliable power to key consumers during exigency, including consumers providing essential services. “The equipment is suitable for water submersion duty,” the TPDDL statement said, adding that its robust technology makes it low maintenance and capable of withstanding extreme weather conditions. A smart meter with digital input or output has also been installed for monitoring the load and raising alerts in case of an issue. “This utility installation of a submersible power station will not only further strengthen our network but also ensure reliable power supply to our consumers at all times,” said Ganesh Srinivasan, chief executive officer, Tata Power-DDL. This substation is particularly useful in today’s time when metro cities are facing steep load growth and space crunch due to urbanisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-a-first-tata-power-installs-submersible-substation-in-city/articleshow/88286204.cms||---

This would be the first tree house opened for tourists in the Himalayan state’s jungles, officials said. The tree house concept, they added, promotes sustainable living without causing damage to natural surroundings. “As the structure has been built in the biodiversity-rich Terai west forest division, visitors will get to enjoy sightings of tiger, elephant and deer while sitting in the comfort of their rooms in the tree house. The cost per night for booking the tree house would be around Rs 10 to 15,000,” said Balwant Shahi, divisional forest officer, Terai West forest division. He added that more such tree houses will soon be developed in the forests of Uttarakhand. The 40-feet-high structure, which will open its doors for visitors next month, is built with Sal and teak wood and has two bedrooms and a bathroom. Welcoming the move, Rakesh Katwal, a hotelier based in the Kumaon region, said, “It is good to see that the forest department is coming up with sustainable options to boost forest tourism rather than constructing concrete structures.” Meanwhile, the forest department is also expected to inaugurate a jungle safari in the Fato range around Christmas. This safari, say officials, would provide employment opportunities to local youth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-stay-in-a-tree-house-in-ukhand-forests-from-next-year/articleshow/88284321.cms||Shivani Azad

As per the preliminary reports, suspects loosened one bolt from each of the fuel tanks and drained them.  In at least two cases, when the suspects could not steal the diesel, they let it flow out on the ground, eventually causing loss to the truck owners. According to the owners, a total of about 1,200 litres was stolen from their trucks. After the incident came to light, truck owners dialled 112, following which a team reached the spot and took the incidence on record. However, after the complainants reached the Chandanzira police station to lodge a complaint, they alleged poor response from the police. One of the truck owners, Shaikh Atif said, “Police officials said that they will take diesel theft complaint related to only one truck on record and assured that later during the investigation, they will add complaints about the other four trucks.” Echoing him, mechanic Shaikh Sageer said, “A truck had been parked at my garage for repairs. The thieves have emptied the entire fuel tank. We have been making rounds of the police station since morning, but in vain.” No offence was registered till late in the evening. When contacted, the police station staffer said the police did not refuse to register the offence. “They have been asked to come back later when the station chief would be present,” said a police sub-inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/thieves-target-5-trucks-steal-over-1200-litre-diesel-in-jalna/articleshow/88284324.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The AP government’s ambitious comprehensive land survey programme under ‘YSR Jagananna Bhu Hakku-Mariyu Bhu Raksha Patham’ is aimed at bringing decades-old troubles regarding land records to an end and is considered to be the first such project to ensure permanent land rights and land protection to benefit the farmers. A team of 11 senior officials led by Maharashtra survey settlement commissioner Niranjan Kumar Sudanshu is touring the state for the past two days to study the land survey project being implemented here. AP survey settlement and land records commissioner Siddharth Jain briefed the Maharashtra team on various aspects of the survey during its visit to the survey work near Jaggayyapeta in Krishna district on Tuesday. Kumar said it is not a trivial matter to designate an employee for the survey department, especially at the village level, and to formulate a policy to complete the registration process there as well. “Utilizing the latest technology used at the international level to carry out the programme successfully without any shortcomings is commendable,” he said. Jain said the project has been successfully completed in 51 villages on pilot basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/maha-ap-land-survey-model-worth-copying/articleshow/88285304.cms||Samdani MN

Revanth said lakhs of farmers in Telangana were in distress due to the stand-off between the central and state governments over procurement of paddy. “Farmers are unable to clear their debts as the government is yet to buy a large quantity of paddy produced by them. While some of the farmers have died on the heaps of paddy waiting for the government to procure it, a few other have ended their lives leaving behind suicide notes,” Revanth said. Stating that uncertainty over procurement of paddy by the government and lack of clarity on the next crop to be cultivated has turned situation from bad to worse, Revanth took to Twitter to express concern over situation of farmers. Families of farmers who died by suicide must get Rs 6 lakh compensation and other assistance as per provisions of GO No. 421. “I appeal to all farmers not to lose hope and not to resort to any extreme step. Congress party will fight for your rights,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lack-of-clarity-over-next-crop-cultivation-revanth/articleshow/88285311.cms||---

Justice V G Bisht heard an anticipatory bail application under section 438 CrPC by a Pune resident in an FIR lodged by the Deccan Police. Since the applicant is in custody in another offence, the additional sessions judge dismissed it on the ground of maintainability citing a Rajasthan HC decision. Justice Bisht referred to a Supreme Court verdict that ABA will not be maintainable in case a person is in custody in the same offence for which pre-arrest bail is sought. He noted the applicant is in custody in the offence registered by Koregaon Park police and is yet to be arrested in the FIR by Deccan Police. He agreed with the applicant’s advocate Subodh Desai, that there was “no proper interpretation” of section 438 by the sessions judge.  “Accused has every right, even if he is arrested in a number of cases, to move (court ) in each of the offence registered against him irrespective of the fact that he is already in custody but for a different offence, for the reason that the application (s) will have to be heard and decided on merits independent of another crime in which he is already in custody,’’ said Justice Bisht. Setting aside the order, he directed the sessions judge to hear the ABA “on its own merit and in accordance with law’’ within 3 weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pre-arrest-bail-can-be-granted-even-if-accused-in-custody-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/88287155.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Mall cheer for retail sector ahead of Christmas, New Year||KOLKATA: Mall operators and retailers are hoping to return to the growth track in 2022 after two challenging years when the pandemic derailed their businesses. While the industry suffered a major loss in 2020, most retailers have made a smart recovery in 2021 and are set to end the year with revenue on par with 2019 or slightly ahead. Rentals, too, have recovered to pre-Covid levels. “We are set to end the year with 10%-15% revenue growth over 2019 despite the 45-day closure in May-June, 2019. Sales during the festive season have been phenomenal. With most of the population in the city now vaccinated and indications that the Omicron variant — though more transmissible — is less severe than the Delta variant that caused havoc earlier this year, we are hoping there will be no disruptions in 2022,” said South City Mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. South City, which has a revenue share model rather than rental, has witnessed recovery of commercial payout above 75%-80%. “We are now seeing a demand for retail store expansion,” said Bagree. In July 2021, Quest Mall was recording around 90% of the business it had transacted in the corresponding month of 2019. But from August, its month-on-month revenue has exceeded that of 2019. “For the last few months, the percentage achievement is at 120% compared to the corresponding months in 2019,” said Quest Mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra. While half the retailers at the mall were on the revenue share model prior to the pandemic, around 90% retailers are now on the revenue-share. At Acropolis, mall general manager K Vijayan said rentals were back to pre-Covid level after extended periods in 2020 and 2021 when rent waivers were offered to retailers. “Acropolis witnessed steady uptick in sales since July and post October, it witnessed further growth in sales post resumption of multiplexes. It has recovered 100% of pre-Covid rental,” he said. All the malls, including City Centre I and II operated by the Ambuja Neotia group, witnessed faster recovery after the second wave this year compared to the first wave last year.”In the first wave, many discovered online shopping. But by the time the second wave waned, people were desperate to step out and experience real shopping the way they’ve known it prior to the pandemic. Ditto with dining. Ordering home was a convenience but dining out was an experience. All this fuelled the recovery,” said Ambuja Neotia wholetime director Ramesh Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mall-cheer-for-retail-sector-ahead-of-christmas-new-yr/articleshow/88285308.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Later, the suspect too attempted suicide by consuming poison. He is currently in a hospital. The deceased woman has been identified as Sangita, who is the wife of prominent businessman Alokchand Lahoti. The suspect, Bhimrao Dhande, had been employed with the Lahoti family for four decades. A murder case has been registered at Sadar Bazaar police station Inspector Anirudh Nandedkar of the Sadar Bazaar police station told TOI, “The suspect has been employed with Lahoti family for four decades. He stabbed the woman over a dozen times, before attempting suicide by consuming poison.” Nandedkar said the incident took place after a heated argument between the Lahoti couple and Dhande; allegedly over the latter reaching out to others for help. Following the argument, Dhande lost his cool and started pelting stones at the bungalow and eventually damaged window panes and injured Alokchand Lahoti. This led to a scuffle, during which Dhande’s tooth broke. The duo reached Sadar Bazaar police station. There, they were issued a medical memo for getting themselves medically screened at a government hospital, before any complaint could be registered. Police said Dhande left the police station in a huff and instead of going to the hospital, he headed back to Lahoti’s bungalow and latched the house from inside. He allegedly took a kitchen knife and stabbed Sangita over a dozen times, killing her on the spot. Later, he consumed poison. Police said Alokchand on hearing the screams from inside the house tried opening the door, but in vain. He informed the police, who rushed to the spot and broke open the door, only to find the woman in a pool of blood, while Bhimrao was unconscious. They were rushed to the hospital, where the woman was declared brought dead, while the suspect regained conscious within hours of being admitted. “Doctors have said that the suspect was out of danger and can be discharged after being him under observation for 12 hours or so,” said Nandedkar. Police said that the suspect will be officially arrested on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-attempts-suicide-after-stabbing-elderly-employer/articleshow/88284375.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Going cashless will not only reduce illegal activities but also bring more transparency as jail staff won't be able to charge a single rupee above the marked price of the product." He added that the jail will likely go cashless from next month. Last week, three mobile handsets and 10 SIM cards were recovered from prison inmates. Two inmates -- Ankit Bisht and Mahipal -- even had narcotics on them. Earlier on October 4, three mobile phones, four SIM cards, narcotics substances and cash worth Rs 1.29 lakh were found in a search operation inside Almora jail. Transactions worth lakhs of rupees were also found in the account of an employee working inside the jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/almora-jail-to-go-cashless-inmates-to-get-debit-card/articleshow/88284365.cms||---

Following this, investigations have begun in approximately 5,000 serious cases. Some 22,000 instances of the crime have been recorded over a period of one-and-a-half years. The state special operations group (SOG) had recently arrested one person from Jaipur for downloading child pornography. This was among the incidents shared by the US organisation with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), which sent the data to state officials. These videos and photographs are being downloaded for viewing purposes and officials have not yet found any evidence of monetary exchange for the same. The state child commission has expressed concern over the matter and is likely to seek details from the investigating agency. Speaking on the complaints and investigation, ADG SOG & ATS Ashok Rathore said, “We have received complaints on child pornography sites being visited by the offenders. We are sifting through the information, and based on this analysis, we would share the same for further legal action by districts.” “In this regard, we would also tell them how to proceed on receiving these inputs,” he added. Over a week ago, a 22-year-old man was arrested from the Jaipur's Kalwar area for sharing child pornography on social media. Inspector Sajjan Kanwar, cyber crime police station, SOG, who arrested the accused, said, “In that case, we found the IP address and other technical details which led us to the man. We have now started going through other complaints as well. Out of the 22,000 instances, there are around 5,000 serious cases which we have started working on. There are also instances when someone has posted a video or photograph of their own child without any ulterior intention. So, we have to carefully go through the details to find the ones that are actually being used for pornography.” Complaints older than one year are difficult to investigate as the technical details required are unavailable. “Till now there is no trace of money being exchanged. We are following the chain of uploading these videos/pictures and downloading the same. The persons caught in these cases will be booked under IT Act and if required then under POCSO Act as well,” Kanwar said. Meanwhile, the state child commission is also gathering information to raise awareness about cybercrime against children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/5k-child-pornography-cases-being-probed-by-sog-in-state/articleshow/88286765.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Metro turnaround signals return to normalcy||KOLKATA: Metro Railway is gradually emerging from the pandemic’s shadow, having grossed Rs 48.5 crore revenue in the first seven months of the current fiscal, against the meagre Rs 42.6 crore it had earned in 2020-21. Between April and October this year, Metro has clocked 3 crore passenger journeys against 2.6 crore passengers ferried last year. “Kolkata’s Metro is back on the revival path. It showed the way forward in crowd management during Covid by introducing e-passes to ensure distancing inside the coaches. Metro has now brought back tokens and also started QR-coded tickets. Globally, metro rail systems are facing passenger hesitancy in the pandemic, but our Metro, which is the backbone of the city’s public transport, has recovered ridership on a sequential basis — from 20,000 on the first day of post-lockdown resumption to its current 3.7 lakhs daily footfall,” said Sanjay Chatterjee, founder of Ideation Technology Solutions that works with World Bank for Kolkata’s transport and logistics projects. The Railway Board has set up a steep target of Rs 264.3 crore for 2021-2022 to make up for the huge losses incurred in the last financial year. Metro is counting on the increasing footfall for boosting fare-revenue and is aggressively delving into station branding to rev up non-fare revenue. It will be some time before daily ridership along Line 1, which is the country’s oldest and most populous Metro, attains its pre-pandemic daily ridership of 6 lakh to 6.2 lakh. The facility had earned a whopping Rs 219.5 crore in 2019-20 and clocked a cumulative ridership of 20.4 crore. “In 2020-2021, ridership plunged to 2.6 crore as services remained suspended for six months in the first pandemic year and revenues dropped miserably,” rued an official. During the devastating second wave, there was no Metro services for 61 days between May 15 and July 15. Pandemic-triggered rules had also led to the revenue slump. When services resumed after the 178-day hiatus, capacity was deliberately reduced to 400 passengers against the pre-pandemic count of 3,000 during peak hours. Commuters had to book e-passes before boarding so that the 400 per train count could be maintained. But with token sales being permitted, daily ridership jumped from 2.9 lakh to 3.7 lakh, and is now inching to pre-Covid levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-turnaround-signals-return-to-normalcy/articleshow/88285328.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Chandigarh||Parliamentary panel directs MHA to find alternate route to Chd Airport||Barinderjit.Saluja Chandigarh: Taking cognisance of the serious inconvenience faced by people, the Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) of the Home Ministry has directed the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to look for an alternative route to reach Chandigarh Airport. The PSC has also directed the MHA to liaison with the state government to develop a route through Jagatpura to reach the Chandigarh Airport. The question on the alternative route to the airport was raised during the parliament session in the action taken by government on recommendations and observations contained in the 231st report on demands for grants (2021-22) of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Committee recommended that the MHA take up the matter with the ministries of civil aviation and defence on priority basis to connect the old and new terminal through an underpass below the existing runway. This is to facilitate people headed to the airport. The Committee noted that the existing route from Tribune Chowk to Chandigarh International Airport is causing unnecessary inconvenience to Chandigarh residents, who have to cover greater distance to reach the airport. Alternatively, the Committee has recommended that the MHA coordinate with the Punjab government to make provision of approximately 4.7 km road through Jagatpura village for Chandigarh Airport, which will reduce the distance by about 10km and save time. The PSA has asked the MHA to liaison with the state government to construct a road passing through Jagatpura town in Mohali, falling on the borders of Chandigarh adjacent to Chandigarh Airport for a shorter route. Cabs and taxi drivers have been following this route to reach Chandigarh Airport from Chandigarh. BOX No compliance to earlier directions There has been no cognisance to previous directions of the PSC to find an alternative route to the Chandigarh International Airport and Chandigarh administration as well as Punjab government have failed to find a suitable shorter route. The proposal to get an underpass from the old airport connecting the new terminal was also explored earlier but it could not materialise due to defense installation security cover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parliamentary-panel-directs-mha-to-find-alternate-route-to-chd-airport/articleshow/88285366.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Kolkata||AI Bangkok flight gets extension till March 2022||Kolkata: Air India’s flights between Kolkata and Bangkok that had been initially announced till December 29, 2021, have now been extended till March 23, 2022. The flights will continue to operate two times a week — on Wednesdays and Sundays. The first two flights that have operated had around 95% bookings. But there have been several no-shows with passengers being denied the Thai Pass that is mandatory to travel to the country in addition to the visa. Travel agents are now advising travellers to first apply for the online Thai Pass before making their visa application. “Passengers need to provide travel details, stay details, $50,000 worth insurance coverage and a fully vaccinated certificate while applying for the Thai Pass. Once the Pass is issued, the passenger can apply for the visa to ensure hassle-free travel,” a travel agent explained. The $50,000 insurance costs around Rs 600-700 for a person aged around 50 years. While AI is the only airline operating on the sector now, Thai Smile is expected to introduce a three times-a-week service from January 2022. IndiGo is yet to take a call on when it will introduce the flights. Meanwhile, AI has introduced a flight between Kolkata and Bengaluru that arrives in the city at 5.15am and departs for Bengaluru at 11.15pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ai-bangkok-flight-gets-extension-till-march-2022/articleshow/88285378.cms||---

MIDC Waluj police inspector Sandeep Gurme said that the offence has been registered on the basis of the directives issued by the local court. “Probe in this case has been initiated and an officer of the rank of police sub-inspector has been appointed as the investigation officer,” he said. Police said that the land deal began in 2004 and went on for next few years, before differences grew between the suspects claiming to the owners of different plots, situated in the same area. As per the complaint lodged by 58-year-old Skariah Vargese, the transaction with the five suspects took place at intervals starting in 2004. The suspects falsely claimed to be owners of a prime land and forged documents to substantiate their claim.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: After rains, leaf curl thrips suck life out of chilli crops||AMARAVATI: The widespread damage to chilli crops caused by leaf curl thrips has left farmers in a state of shock. The chilli cultivation area had gone up by nearly 30% over the last season as the chilli had been commanding good price in the last two years. With prices steadily going up, a large number of farmers switched to chilli cultivation during the current season. The crop was destroyed even before the farmers woke up to the severity of the disease and consequences. “Chilli thrips create damaging feeding scars, distortions of leaves, and discolorations of buds, flowers and young fruits by feeding on the meristems of the host plant’s terminals and on other tender parts above the soil surface,” said an agriculture scientist. According to initial reports, about 70 per cent of the crop was damaged in the state. The agriculture department has deputed scientists from YSR Horticulture University and NG Ranga Agriculture University to study the issue. Although the scientists came out with several remedies to handle the situation, the disease spread was very fast and the farmers were no able to save the crop. “I lost the entire crop in seven acres due to the new virus. I had invested nearly Rs 6 lakh on cultivation,” said M Venkata Reddy of Karampudi. He said that the situation was so horrific that no farmer is able to save even 30 per cent of the crop. Many farmers used additional quantities of pesticides to handle the fast spreading disease but only left with additional burden. “This is very damaging pest which spread very fast leaving little scope for the farmers to save the crop. We have advised them to use certain pesticides to control the disease spread but the damage is extensive,” said an official. Farmers noticed the pest for the first time during last season but they could manage it with pesticides. However, the pest seemed to have become pesticide resistant making it difficult to prevent the spread, a farmer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/after-rains-leaf-curl-thrips-suck-life-out-of-chilli-crops/articleshow/88285362.cms||Samdani MN
---||Dehradun||Destabilising slopes will cause irreversible damage to Himalayas: Uttarakhand environmentalists||DEHRADUN: The Supreme Court (SC) verdict on the all-weather Char Dham road widening project on Monday has drawn sharp criticism from Uttarakhand-based environmentalists, who say that while the project has no major defence significance as is being cited, it has the potential to devastate the fragile Himalayan landscape. Speaking to TOI just a few hours after the apex court gave its go-ahead to the project citing national security, CP Rajendran, adjunct professor at the Bengaluru-based National Institute of Advanced Studies, told TOI, “Once the slopes are destabilised, there is no reversing the damage. The project is likely to cause an increase in landslides and floods in Uttarakhand. Besides, the Chinese side of the Himalayas has less slopes. So, the project won’t serve any major defence purpose. This was accentuated by late General Bipin Rawat as well who had said that the existing roads are fine for army movement. The court should have looked into the ‘scientific objections’ more carefully.” Earlier in the day, the SC allowed construction of a 10-metre wide Char Dham road in view of the rising tensions along the Line of Actual Control with China. However, it also set up a new committee headed by a former judge AK Sikri to monitor the project and report its progress every four months. Unhappy with the court order, Hemant Dhyani, environmentalist and one of the members of the SC-appointed high-powered committee of the all-weather Char Cham road project, told TOI, “With all due regards to the judgement, I see a lack of reasoning or explanation as to why the court has allowed widening of the road to 10 metres when the ministry of defence, in its November 2020 application, had sought a seven-metre wide road.” Meanwhile, Virendra Singh Khaira, chief engineer of ministry of road transport & highways (MoRTH) at Uttarakhand, welcomed the verdict. “Honourable supreme court’s order will be followed in letter and spirit,” he said. Notably, the strategic 899-km-long Char Dham road aims to connect four holy towns of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath and provide easy access to LAC to armed forces. In 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the Rs 12,000-crore highway expansion project. However, the project has been facing opposition from environmentalists since the very beginning for its potential impact on the Himalayan ecology due to the proposed felling of 50,000 trees, cutting of hills and arbitrary dumping of excavated material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/destabilising-slopes-will-cause-irreversible-damage-to-himalayas/articleshow/88284418.cms||Shivani Azad

Addressing a lecture to mark the 38th foundation day of the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Dr Kannan said: “Around 80% of cancer patients come to the institute in the third or fourth stage which affects the success rate of treatment. It is important to create awareness about the disease and its early detection. The role of ASHA workers will prove to be important in this regard.” He said that with the help of ASHA workers, projects had been formulated for early detection of cancer in rural areas. “At least 1,360 people were screened for oral and throat cancer of whom 6.93% showed indications of cancer. They were sent to Primary Health Centres for further investigations. Similarly, 3,079 women were screened for breast and cervix cancer and 11.5% showed indications. Another 1,160 women were screened for human papilloma virus, which leads to cervix cancer and 146 were found positive,” he said.  Special guest at the event, additional chief secretary (health education) Alok Kumar, said unlike western countries, India could not create a model of treatment on the basis of heavy equipment and machinery. “Keeping in mind our population, our model of treatment should be economical. We are doing administrative work at the speed which one saw in the 1980s and 1990s. We should go within the community and work with people,” he said. “SGPGI is a tertiary care centre. Often patients don’t know where to go. We need to streamline the system,” said chief secretary RK Tiwari, who was the chief guest on the occasion. PGI director Prof RK Dhiman said courses in ophthalmology and emergency superspeciality would be started in the institute. He added that post-diploma certificate courses would be started in other subjects. “Tele-ICU will start soon to allow district medical colleges to seek help from SGPGI specialists. An MSc programme will also be started in radio-pharmacy and molecular medicine. A software technology park will also be inaugurated this week,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/80-cancer-patients-come-to-hosp-in-advanced-stage/articleshow/88286784.cms||---

The NAAC team expressed surprise at the number of teachers. They wondered how quality of education was being maintained. PU authorities assured that teachers would be recruited before their next tour. Two and a half years ago, a committee was formed, which started the process of teacher recruitment after collecting data from departments.

---||Lucknow||Shelter homes packed, patients & kin forced to spend cold nights in the open||Lucknow: With the majority of shelter homes packed to capacity, many patients and their attendants are forced to spend nights in open in hospital compounds braving chilly weather. Resident of Siddharthnagar, Mujeeb and his five-year-old-son, Ibrahim, were seen huddled in a thin blanket outside the new dental building of King George’s Medical University (KGMU). Doctors of his hometown had referred Ibrahim to KGMU for treatment of serious complications due to tooth decay. “We came on Monday morning and had planned to go back in the evening but doctors advised some tests and asked to come again on Wednesday, hence we stayed back. We checked all shelter homes here, but since there was no space we had to spend the night in the open,” said Mujeeb. A similar situation was found by TOI in its reality check at outside several hospitals, including KGMU, Balrampur Hospital, SPM Civil Hospital and TB Hospital KGMU has six night shelters, which together can hold 1000-1200 people, but since the number of poor patients coming from other districts is huge, these arrangements fell short of space. SPM Civil hospital administration allows only those attendants in shelter homes whose family members are admitted in the hospital. “Guards told us that we are not eligible for shelter home because I have to consult at OPD on Thursday,” said a patient, Raghvendra Singh, who came from Fatehpur. At Balrampur Hospital, people were found shivering in the cold in the open as shelter homes were packed. “My two sisters and I have decided to remain awake all night because there is no space in the shelter home and sleeping in the open is risky,” said Barabanki resident Rubina Khatoon, whose mother is under treatment in the emergency ward.

The cyber police team, led by inspector Gautam Patare and assistant inspector Amol Satodkar, seized articles including Rs 17 lakh in cash, five two-wheelers, two cars, several stamps and computers that were being used to run the illegal online gambling work. Commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta said the probe has revealed that the accused were systematically getting their customers registered on the applications floated through gambling websites. Probe has revealed that none of the online gambling applications used by them were registered or cleared by the state authorities, making it clear that they were evading large sums of taxes, said another officer. The probe has also revealed that the suspects issued login ids and passwords to registered gamblers and they would regularly assemble to calculate the business carried out each week. The raid was held when they had assembled to distribute the earnings made last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cyber-cops-bust-online-gambling-den-seize-items-worth-rs-49l/articleshow/88284447.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Lucknow||Opening of Kashi Vishwanath Dham dispels doubts over mosque security||VARANASI: The apprehension in some quarters of the local Muslim community regarding the security and safety of Gyanvapi mosque, which is situated adjacent to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, seemingly disappeared with the opening of the grand Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. When the opening ceremony was in progress on Monday, the local Muslims were offering namaz at the Gyanvapi mosque in a peaceful environment. “It is true that in the beginning of the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Dham, there were some apprehensions among us regarding the security of Gyanvapi mosque. But now all the doubts have gone away... there is no apprehension now and we are quite confident about the safety of the mosque,” SM Yaseen of the Anjuman Intezamiya Masajid, an administrative body of Gyanvapi mosque, told TOI on Tuesday. Before the construction of the corridor had started, Yaseen gave a statement in the media expressing fear about the safety of the mosque. “At that time the situation was quite different because we had no clear picture of the project. But our doubts started disappearing with the progress of the project in a transparent manner,” said Yaseen. “We wholeheartedly welcome the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Dham because the best thing that happened is that both Hindus and Muslims got convenience,” he said adding that earlier there were narrow lanes leading to the temple and devotees had to stand in the queues for hours. Now there will be no such problem. “There is a fixed time for offering namaz in the mosque. We used to feel very bad at that time when the temple going devotees were stopped and the Muslims were allowed to go to the mosque due to the only way existing there. In such a situation, the hearts of the devotees standing in the queue for hours must have been hurt. But now it will not happen,” he said, adding that the Muslims are equally happy with the construction of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. Regarding the land dispute between the Gyanvapi mosque and Kashi Vishwanath temple, Yaseen said that it is not a matter of grave concern, as such things happen in the society. “The matter is in the court, and we are fighting the case. But it does not mean that it will spoil the unique communal harmony of Kashi,” he argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/opening-of-kv-dham-dispels-doubts-over-mosque-security/articleshow/88286806.cms||Binay Singh

While one of them was arrested while accepting the bribe, the other fled from the scene and locked himself up in a house in the colony. He was arrested late in the evening. The bribe was demanded for undervaluing assets of the complainant to lower his income tax. Senior ACB officers stated both engineers joined CPWD in 2018. “Both of them came to income tax department on deputation just two years after joining the CPWD,” Soni said. ACb director general BL Soni told TOI, “A complainant came to us and said the accused, identified as Pankaj Kumar Chaudhary and Divya Prakash Meena, both junior engineers working with the assessment wing of the income tax department in Jaipur on deputation from the Central Public Works department (CPWD), were demanding a bribe of Rs 3 lakh from him. The bribe was demanded for undervaluing one of the assets of the complainant so that he may have to pay only lesser income tax.” Based on the complaint, a verification was done by the ACB team. “After the complaint was verified, our team, led by additional SP Narottam Verma, trapped Pankaj Kumar for accepting a bribe of Rs 1.5 lakh at the income tax office. The other accused, Divya Prakash, managed to flee from the scene,” he added. The ACB team chased Prakash who had locked himself in his house at the income tax colony. “We kept asking him to come out. He locked himself up for almost two hours, but later came out and was arrested,” said additional SP Narrotam Verma, who led the operation. ACB officials said that both of them would initially value the assets of an assessee high and then approach them with promise to undervalue the same. “For undervaluation, they asked for bribes,” he said. A case has been registered under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act against both the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-junior-i-t-deptengineers-heldfor-taking-bribe/articleshow/88286799.cms||---

In further trouble for them, the court also agreed to the SIT’s submission that section 35 of the Arms Act -- which talks about criminal responsibility of persons in whose premises arms and ammunition are found – should be included in the FIR. This could particularly pose problems for Union minister Teni, in whose charred vehicle, two empty .315 cartridges were recovered after the violence. A SIT member told TOI, “Since it was evident during investigation that it was a planned act, we requested the court to replace IPC section 338 (causing grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly) with that of 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt using weapon which is likely to cause death) and 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC. Sections under Arms Act have been added as we have recovered weapons from the accused.” All the 13 accused in the case were brought to court on Tuesday, and a counter- application was filed by Ashish’s counsel. Providing details, senior prosecuting officer SP Yadav said, “Investigating officer Vidyaram Diwakar submitted an application in court in which it was stated that the killing of farmers and a journalist was not an act of negligence, but was a deliberate planned act. The defence counsel filed a counter-application pointing out that section 34 of IPC (criminal acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) cannot go along with section 149 (offence committed in prosecution of common object).” The court while agreeing to the SIT’s submission also agreed to the defence counsel’s contention regarding section 34 of IPc and ordered it to be dropped. “This development would mean all the accused will have to file fresh bail applications starting at lower court,” Yadav said. Notably, the decision on the bail application of Ashish and others is pending in Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court To recall, on October 3, four protesting farmers and a journalist were mowed down by the convoy of Ashish Mishra, following which three people in the convoy were lynched in retaliation. An FIR was registered under sections 302 (murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 149 (offence committed in prosecution of common object), 279 (rash driving), 338 (causing grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly), 304a (causing death by negligence) and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of IPC, and 13 people, including Ashish, were arrested and sent to jail. “We are happy that the investigation is heading in the right direction. Now, we can expect that Ajay Mishra would be questioned as two cartridges were recovered from the Thar vehicle registered in his name,” said Harjeet Singh, the counsel representing the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/farmers-death-in-kheri-a-planned-act-not-accident-says-sit-in-court/articleshow/88283725.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Chandigarh||No alternative to BJP, oppn has no issues: Ajay Bhatt||Q: On what basis people of Chandigarh should vote for BJP? A: Presently, there is no alternative to BJP, not only at Chandigarh but also national level. The BJP has made its presence felt in south and north-east. The development carried out by BJP in UTs, states and country, is visible to public, and I am hopeful people of Chandigarh will vote for development and BJP in upcoming MC polls and public will also support BJP in upcoming assembly polls and in 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The opposition parties do not have any issues, so they are now misleading people by spreading misunderstandings, but educated people will no longer be misled by them. Q: Will BJP get majority in Chandigarh MC polls? A: People of Chandigarh have been introduced to the fact that development and trust are enshrined within BJP. This is the only party which is capable of giving a stable government to the city as well as at the Centre. I am not only hopeful but confident that BJP will win maximum seats in the MC polls and there will be a BJP mayor in the municipal corporation. Q: In Chandigarh, Congress is the main opposition party and AAP is contesting the MC polls for the first time. How do you rate your opponents? A: BJP has no competition in Chandigarh MC. Congress and AAP will not be successful. The public will once again give thumping majority to BJP. Q: Congress leaders claiming AAP is working as B-team of BJP? What is your take on this? A: We don’t have any link with AAP and there is no such thing as B-team. BJP believes in nation first, party second and self third. In fact, Congress and AAP are working as a ‘secret team’ to stop BJP, which was evident from Delhi elections, but both these parties will now face humiliating defeat. Q: Who will be BJP’s chief minister face in upcoming assembly polls in Uttarakhand? A: Pushkar Singh Dhami is chief minister of Uttarakhand. When he had taken oath as Uttarakhand CM, I had said that next assembly polls will be fought under the leadership of Dhami. I am once again saying that party will contest 2022 Uttarakhand assembly polls under his leadership and he will once again become the chief minister. Q: Congress leaders, including former CM Harish Rawat, are claiming that Congress will form next government in Uttarakhand. How do you see it? A: “Mungeri Lal ke haseen sapne dekhne mein kisi ko koi harz nahi hai’. These are only dreams of Congress leaders and result will tell the ground reality. Uttarakhand has witnessed overall development under BJP’s regime and I am confident BJP will repeat and form next government in Uttarakhand as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-alternative-to-bjp-oppn-has-no-issues-ajay-bhatt/articleshow/88285435.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Goa||Goa coastal body slaps Rs 20,000 fine on ‘CRZ violator’ for prolonging hearing||PANAJI: The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on an alleged offender for prolonging hearings in a case pertaining to a construction within 11 metres of the high tide line at Mobor, Cavelossim, in the no-development zone (NDZ) of the Sal river. After several hearings, the GCZMA had directed the alleged violator to either produce evidence that the existing structure was standing in the same location prior to 1991, or to demolish the illegal extensions. But the alleged violator sought more time from the coastal body, which is working within a timeline provided by the high court to hear the matter, prompting it to fine him. A complaint had been filed with the GCZMA in January this year that an illegal construction is being carried out at Mobor, Cavelossim. The complainant also filed a writ petition in the high court, based on which the court had directed the GCZMA to carry out an inspection of the alleged illegal structure. GCZMA expert members and field surveyors subsequently carried out an inspection on March 1, and stated that prima facie, the structure appeared to be unauthorised and lay in the no-development zone of the Sal river. Based on the GCZMA expert members’ report, the high court asked the authority and the village panchayat of Cavelossim to inquire and take appropriate action in the case. During the hearings, the alleged violator told the GCZMA that the house was already in existence at Mobor, Cavelossim, prior to 1991. He asked to be permitted to regularise the structure as is allowed for pre-1991 houses of coastal communities. He also told the GCZMA that the structure will only be used for residential purposes. The complainant, however, said that the structure has been extended much beyond the existing 27 sqm area of the original house. The new structure has been constructed just 11m from the high tide line, he said. The complainant also said that the extension has been carried out without any permission from the GCZMA and should therefore be demolished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coastal-body-slaps-rs-20000-fine-on-crz-violator-for-prolonging-hearing/articleshow/88286861.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘BSP-SAD pact to repeat history in Punjab assembly elections’||Lucknow: Emphasising on the close relations her party had with Punjab, the birth place of BSP founder Kanshiram, party chief Mayawati on Tuesday said that the state had a special place in her heart. Mayawati, who is contesting the 2022 Punjab assembly polls in an alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal, congratulated the party for its 101st foundation day on December 14 and hoped that the two together would be able to replicate their performance of 1994 when they had together won 11 out of 13 Lok Sabha seats from the state. Party national general secretary and MP Satish Chandra Mishra participated in the celebrations in Punjab as a special guest. “Punjab has a special place in my heart. The BSP and people of Punjab have strong relations. It is the birth place of Kanshiram and also from where he worked for the uplift of the ‘bahujan samaj’. Kanshiram and SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal had good relations and the people of Punjab are aware of it. In 1994, the BSP and SAD alliance won 11 out of 13 Lok Sabha seats in the state, almost wiping out Congress in the process. This time too we should repeat history,” said the BSP chief. Congratulating Parkash Singh Badal, party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and their entire team for the foundation day, Mayawati said that SAD was one of the few regional political parties which had been around for more than 100 years. “The Shiromani Akali Dal is probably the oldest regional party which has been working for the country’s people for over 100 years. This is when in the past 100 years, Punjab has seen several political and social upheavals, many governments have been dismissed and emergency has also been imposed. Despite that, Shiromani Akali Dal has been around as the voice of the people of Punjab,” Mayawati added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-sad-pact-to-repeat-history-in-punjab-assembly-elections/articleshow/88286837.cms||---

Establishment owners have been asked to comply with the Noise Pollution Act. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mohit Handa said that all SHOs (station house officers) had been directed to take strict action against those playing loudspeakers or loud DJ music after restricted hours in the district. Panchkula police has received several complaints about loud music being played late at night. Now that the advisory has been issued anyone found violating the norms will be booked under the Noise Pollution Act 2000. The DCP said that loud music affects children, elderly people and those recovering from diseases, especially heart patients. Residents also demanded check on loud music played at weddings or religious venues after restricted timings, particularly in view of board examinations. On December 6, despite a warning issued to a hotel manager to turn down the volume of DJ music, he did not do so. Police booked the DJ owner and manager of the hotel under the Noise Pollution Act and arrested both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkl-hotels-marriage-palaces-barred-from-playing-loud-music-late-at-night/articleshow/88285445.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Condoning rape a blot on marriage: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: While admitting a PIL that is demanding to bring marital rape in the ambit of punishable offences, the Gujarat high court revealed its mind a little and said that the belief that the solemnisation of a marriage confers on husband the right to rape is a blot on the institution of marriage itself. During the hearing, the petitioner’s advocate stated that Sir Mathew Hale’s three-century old principle that ‘by marrying, the woman gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband and he cannot be guilty of rape’ is not only unconstitutional, but this doctrine has been rejected by England and Scotland as well. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta agreed with the argument and added that it is not only unconstitutional, but such a principle is “absurd, unreal and unacceptable in today’s time”. The court further said, “By marrying, no woman consents to her husband committing forcible sexual intercourse on her. The solemnisation of marriage implies at best an understanding that the couple would have a consensual sexual relationship as part of their married life, not an understanding that the husband can force the wife into the act at his whim and against her consent.” In the opinion of the court, the idea that marriage snatches away a woman’s right to sexual autonomy is “without any basis and incompatible with our constitutional morality. To say that the solemnisation of marriage amounts to conferring on the husband the right to rape is a blot on the institution of marriage itself”. On a woman’s right to reproductive choices and sexual autonomy, the court said, “These are natural human rights that inhere in every human being and are by their very nature inalienable human rights. Being inalienable, neither can such rights be surrendered nor can the law acknowledge or treat them as having been surrendered.” The court has sought a response from the Centre and the state government by January 19, when it has posted a further hearing on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/condoning-rape-a-blot-on-marriage-gujarat-high-court/articleshow/88286843.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: K-Rail project report manipulated, says railway officer||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a serious charge against the government’s prestigious SilverLine rail project, a former railway engineering service officer who had prepared the preliminary feasibility report for the project on behalf of the project consultant, said that the present report on the basis of which the government is going ahead with the project is a completely manipulated and a fraudulent one. Alok Kumar Verma, a former railway engineering service officer who retired from the railways in 2016, was engaged in 2018 by Systra, the French company that was appointed as the project consultant by Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL) for preparing the preliminary feasibility report for the project. “There is a strong real estate angle to why they adopted a standard gauge for trains running at speed up to 200kmph, for which the country has no experience or expertise. If a standard gauge is adopted for this project, we will have to import everything, including the design, technology, rolling stock, etc, from abroad. The agencies abroad would also offer soft loans for something which we will have to depend on other countries. Also, all the stations have been designed to be much outside the towns,” he told TOI. Verma said that after he prepared a preliminary feasibility report asking KRDCL to reconsider several factors, including the gauge, KRDCL put severe pressure on Systra to get the report manipulated, deviating much from the original project proposal submitted to the railways as a broad gauge project. He said that the SilverLine project would be, in all probability, the only line — if built as per the current plan — which would be a completely stand-alone line, segregated from the existing railway network. “No comparative study to assess the relative merits and demerits of building the line on broad gauge versus standard gauge was done, and the railway board had never approved a standard gauge. The in-principle clearance given to the project is also in violation of the railway engineering code as no ground surveys prescribed in the engineering code were carried out to accurately assess the topographic features, and the geological, geotechnical and hydrological conditions. No traffic survey was done to estimate ridership, and the effects of the acute urban sprawl in Kerala, and location of stations on the outskirts far away from the city centre on ridership were also ignored,” he said. He said that after submitting the preliminary feasibility report, the final feasibility report was prepared hastily in just 55 days to suit the requirements given by KRDCL. It included slashing the project cost from Rs 71,063 crore to Rs 56,443 crore and drastic upward revision of traffic projections from 37,750 daily to 67,740 daily. The railways accorded in-principle approval for the project based on a report that is riddled with irregularities and violations, including that Google Earth data was used for extracting the topographic data for preparing the alignment with no ground verification due to the urgency of submitting the feasibility report to railway board, he said. Meanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan and former chief minister Oommen Chandy said that the revelations by the former official are shocking. The opposition leader demanded that the foul play in the survey was earlier raised by the opposition in the assembly. He said that the government is going ahead with a falsely-made report without any proper data. Chandy demanded that the government should release the feasibility report of the project in public domain. He said that the government is not releasing the report fearing that the flaws in the report would come out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/k-rail-project-report-manipulated/articleshow/88286321.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Ahmedabad||Why differentiate between rape victims, asks PIL in Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The PIL filed by Jaideep Verma insists that it is illogical not to treat the rape of a married woman by her husband as an offence and raised a question on it creating classes of rape victims, in which if the victim is the wife of a man, he would go unpunished, and the man would be punished if the act were committed on any other woman. The petitioner submitted that this legal provision is manifestly arbitrary and violative of a woman’s sexual autonomy, which is recognized by certain judgments. The impunity in marital rape is against a woman’s right to say no to sexual intercourse and makes her a subject to the whims of her husband. This is against constitutional and fundamental rights of a woman to live with dignity and to humane treatment. It is against her right to personal liberty, right to refuse, right to reproductive choices and her right to privacy. It was submitted that the exception granted to marital rape has created an artificial distinction between victims – wife and a woman who is not a wife. While the legal protection against rape is available to a woman, the married woman does not enjoy this protection against her husband. While a husband is punished for lesser offences committed against his wife such as cruelty, beating etc., he escapes punishment in a heinous crime. While the law is creating protection against a woman as a wife for smaller offences like domestic violence, legal protection is not available to her in a heinous crime such as rape in which the punishment ranges from 10 years to life in jail. There are five categories of offences of rape in which rape is committed on a pregnant or ailing woman, the punishment is more severe, but if the man is the husband, he enjoys impunity. The petitioner also contended that while a husband is liable to be punished for sodomy on his wife, he cannot be punished for rape. He termed this “illogical”. It was also submitted that the SC has held that the right to sexual autonomy for a woman is inherent and an inalienable right. However, the exception in the IPC provisions nullifies this important right.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-differentiate-between-rape-victims-asks-pil-in-gujarat-high-court/articleshow/88286848.cms||---

As the work of removing the debris is underway, the road has been opened for one-way movement only. The Anuskura ghat was an alternative route after the Amba ghat, connecting Kolhapur-Ratnagiri, was closed for heavy vehicles due to the ongoing repair work. All the heavy vehicle traffic heading to Amba ghat had been diverted through Anuskura ghat. Now, this traffic movement has been partially affected. Prasad Sankpal, head of district disaster management committee in Kolhapur, said, “Traffic through Anuskura ghat is ongoing through one lane of the ghat section and the landslide debris was immediately removed by the authorities concerned.” He added that due to the heavy rain during the monsoon season, Amba ghat had got weak at 12 spots and the work to carry out repairs is ongoing due to which only light vehicles are allowed to pass through the ghat section. The repair work is expected to take a few more days to be completed. That is the reason the heavy vehicle traffic has been diverted via Rajapur- Anuskura ghat route till then, he said. Amba ghat and Anuskura ghat are important connecting passages between parts of Konkan and Ratnagiri district with Kolhapur district, and further towards eastern Maharashtra. These ghat regions witness largescale movement of heavy vehicles throughout the day. Fish, sugar, coconut, fruits, jaggery, rice are transported every day between these regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/landslide-impairs-traffic-at-anuskura-ghat-section/articleshow/88284558.cms||---

Hundreds of farmers from various villages of Sattari taluka participated in the morcha, and warned of intensifying their protest if their demand was not fulfilled within 15 days. “We demand that monkeys be declared as vermin to protect our crops that are routinely damaged by monkeys,” Ashok Joshi, convener of SSM, said. Among other demands were to allow transfer of arms licences to legal heirs of farmers, reduce the radius of the wildlife buffer zone from 10kms to 1km, and streamlining of the policy on wildlife. Uday Sawant, a SSM member, said that transfer of arms licences should be allowed to legal heirs of farmers as it will help protect crops against attacks by wild animals. “Farmers of Sattari have been enduring losses due to crop damage by monkeys. We want monkeys be declared vermin,” Sawant said. Sawant further said they have been highlighting the issue for many years as the nuisance by wild animals has increased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/declare-monkeys-as-vermin-demand-sattari-farmers/articleshow/88286855.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Inducting expelled BSP netas won’t benefit any party in Uttar Pradesh polls: Mayawati||LUCKNOW: In an apparent reference to several of her party members, including MLAs, joining Samajwadi Party recently, BSP chief Mayawati said that this kind of politics was not going to benefit any party. She also hit out at the BJP governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh for making hurried announcements and inaugurating incomplete projects ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls, warning them that people could see through these desperate attempts. “By inducting expelled, selfish and inactive members from other parties into their own ahead of elections, political parties must remember that they will not be able to increase their presence like this. In fact, people don’t look favourably upon such political parties. Everyday, there is news of some or the other person joining like this, as if it is a great thing. BSP likes to keep away from such things,” she said. Currently, there are only three active MLAs left in BSP out of the 19 originally elected in 2017. One other, Sukhdev Rajbhar, passed away recently while Ramvir Upadhyay, MLA from Sadabad, is under suspension though he has not joined any other party. Another, Shah Alam from Mubarakpur, resigned recently though his resignation is yet to be formally accepted. The rest have all been expelled over the past two years and at least eight of them have joined SP. This includes Aslam Raini, Hakim Lal Bind, Sushma Patel, Aslam Ali, Hargovind Bhargava, Mohammad Mujtaba Siddqui, and most recently, Lalji Verma, Ram Achal Rajbhar and Vinay Shankar Tiwari. Among these, said party sources, Verma and Rajbhar were “forced out” of the party due to internal politics. On December 6, Mayawati expelled Vinay, his elder brother Bhishma Shankar Tiwari, who was MP from Sant Kabir Nagar in 2009, and another relative Ganesh Shankar Pandey, who was chairperson of Vidhan Parishad when BSP was last in power. Vinay and Bhishma are sons of Hari Shankar Tiwari, a six-time MLA. Two others have either joined BJP or are likely to in the near future, including Sagri MLA Bandana Singh and Purwa MLA Anil Singh. Don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari has also been denied a ticket by Mayawati, who said this was a calculated step to weed out rouge elements from her party. Despite this exodus, party members still claim that this will not have any impact on BSP’s prospects in the upcoming elections. “Our vote base is intact and the votes are in Behenji’s name. People know that these MLAs have political aspirations beyond what BSP stands for. Nobody is going to engage with them,” said a senior party member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/inducting-expelled-bsp-netas-wont-benefit-any-party-in-polls-mayawati/articleshow/88286842.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Pune||Maharashtra eyes 1.25 crore first dose of Covid vaccination in a fortnight; 50% fully immunized||PUNE: The state authorities has set a target to vaccinate 1.25 crore beneficiaries up for first dose by month-end, with 85% of the eligible population in Maharashtra already covered with the first shot, while 50% of the eligible people have been completely immunised. State health minister Rajesh Tope said Maharashtra was carrying out of 7-8 lakh vaccinations per day. “So, this target will be achieved with the current pace,” he told TOI on Tuesday. Experts have called for early coverage of the eligible population with the two vaccine doses in view of the Omicron threat. National task force members for Covid-19 and public health experts said the country and the state should try to achieve full vaccination of the 70% eligible population at the earliest. “There are reports that beneficiaries due for their second doses have not taken their shot in time. People have to be serious and ensure complete vaccination,” a task force member for Covid-19 said. Last month, more than 12 crore beneficiaries, who were due for their second dose in the country, had not taken the vaccine. In the state, over 90 lakh beneficiaries have either skipped or delayed the second dose. “Vaccination is the key, along with Covid-appropriate behaviour, in the wake of the omicron variant,” Dr Subhash Salunkhe, national task force member and public health expert, said. To push up vaccination, the state had even approached the Union government to reduce the Covishield gap interval of 84 days. Eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang told TOI that while data showed a longer gap was better for immune response and efficacy, if shortening the gap results in significantly higher coverage with the second dose, then it may be worth it. Mathematical modelling can be used to compare the potential impact of long and short gaps. While the state has already requested to reduce the gap of Covishield doses, the Centre has not yet agreed to change the gap period. Experts have called for reduction of Covishield two-dose gap to 8-12 weeks, instead of 12-16 weeks. With many districts going in for coercive tactics, the state health minister said counselling was the only way forward and the Centre has been clear in its approach to persuade the beneficiary. Many districts that were underperforming have introduced coercive methods of holding back salaries or even ration to ensure to speed up vaccination. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, in his recent review meeting in Pune, had said they would try and persuade those skipping their second dose, but even after persuasion, if they are not cooperative, the state would have to plan stricter ways to ensure complete vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-eyes-1-25-crore-first-dose-vax-in-a-fortnight-50-fully-immunized/articleshow/88285470.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Police are trying to find out why the cell phone location of the 21-year-old jawan, a gunner in the Army, was moving back towards Delhi after reaching Bathinda station in Punjab, which was just two stops away from his destination, Faridkot, on December 6. Sai’s father Patel Reddy said his son had no intention to be a deserter. A police team from Siddipet commissionerate went to Bathinda to investigate the missing case along with a local police team and the team of Delhi Airport Terminal II, where the missing case was transferred. Sai was last seen by eye-witnesses at Bathinda railway station. “A doctor, Manish, and another Army jawan, who travelled with Sai from Safdarjung railway station till Bathinda, confirmed that Sai was in his berth when they disembarked at Bhatinda,” a police officer from Siddipet said. Police team found out that Sai had boarded Patalkot Express at 3.30am on December 6 at Safdarjung railway station and the train reached Bathinda station at 9.30am. However, subsequently the cell phone tower location of Sai was spotted moving towards Delhi. Around 11.30am, the phone’s location was near Jakhal Mandi and at 1pm its location was near Rohtak, police said. Police teams have verified CCTV footage near the Bhatinda railway station and found out that Sai got out of the station on December 6 morning. Police teams were trying to locate him. Meanwhile, Sai’s father Patel Reddy said that his son worked extremely hard during his 16-month training to secure his job. “After his training in Maharashtra, he has been posted in Faridkot for the last six months. He came home thrice on leave and never showed any indication that he was not interested in the Army duty. It has been almost 10 days since he went missing and we are unable to eat or drink anything,” Patel said. Sai Kiran Reddy came home in November on 20-day leave. To report back for work, Sai started from his native place, Pothireddypally village in Cheryal mandal of Siddipet on December 5 and boarded a flight to Delhi. On December 5 night, Sai was seen leaving IGI Airport in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/missing-jawan-left-train-2-stops-ahead-of-destination/articleshow/88285468.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Business||UK high court defers decision on Nirav Modi’s appeal against extradition||LONDON: The high court here deferred ruling on Tuesday on Nirav Modi’s appeal against his extradition to India in order to allow his barrister more time to make submissions on a fresh assurance from the Indian government on how his mental health will be taken care of at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai. Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing Nirav, can now submit questions on the latest assurance submitted on November 13 and get expert opinion on it from Wandsworth prison’s consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Andrew Forrester, and prison condition expert Dr Alan Mitchell. A directions hearing will take place in the new year. Nirav, in Wandsworth prison, is accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of more than Rs 7,000 crore, of laundering the proceeds and interfering with witnesses and evidence. The latest assurance states that were Nirav to need psychiatric treatment, he could go to the JJ Hospital in Mumbai. Fitzgerald said there was no evidence of how he would be transferred out of prison to hospital and there was a shortage of police escorts. He questioned where Nirav would be quarantined before entering the prison or if he caught Covid, and what medical care he would get. "We need to test the reliability of this assurance from November 13," he said. "There is no description of what suicide prevention measures are in place. We don’t know what kind of psychiatric care there is at JJ Hospital." Referring to Dr Forrester’s first report on Nirav’s psychiatric condition, which "predated his arrest", Fitzgerald said: "He will jump out of the window if he faces extradition as his mother did." Helen Malcolm QC, representing the Indian government, said: "We asked for access to Nirav Modi’s medical record and for our expert to see Nirav and this was refused." Lord Justice Stuart-Smith told Fitzgerald: "Don’t assume that in the event no access is granted to a government of India expert that we would make every assumption in favour of Nirav." He apologised to members of the CBI and ED, who had flown from India for the hearing, that a judgment was not given. "India is a sophisticated society which understands mental science and the need for proper treatment — that much we are prepared to assume whatever else is said," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/uk-high-court-defers-decision-on-nirav-modis-appeal-against-extradition/articleshow/88287754.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Kolhapur||Shops shut on Maha-K’taka border over ink attack||Kolhapur: Shops and other establishments in areas on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border, which have a predominance of Marathi-speaking residents, remained shut in response to the bandh call given by the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti and the Shiv Sena in protest against the blackening of senior MES leader Dipak Dalvi’s face allegedly by pro-Kannada activists. The shops and establishments remained shut especially in the border areas of Kolhapur and Belgaum districts. Sena workers trying to enter Belgaum were stopped by the police. A few pro-Kannada activists had thrown black ink at Dalvi at an event organised in Belgaum on Monday. On Tuesday, Sena workers protested in Kolhapur and threatened to shut down shops run by Kannada-speaking people in Kolhapur district. Many shops, hotels and other commercial establishments remained shut till afternoon. Fearing attacks on buses, the state transport undertakings of both Maharashtra and Karnataka called off operations. No Karnataka state transport bus left for Maharashtra from Belgaum, Dharwad, Hubli and other major bus depots. Local transport between Maharashtra and Karnataka also went off the roads. Many regular commuters preferred to travel in private vehicles, which led to queues at the toll checkposts, particularly the one Kognoli between Kolhapur and Belgaum districts. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar condemned the blackening of Dalvi’s face and said the Marathi-speaking people from the border areas were “not weak to be crushed by any violent act”. “The Marathis will bounce back. It is a highly condemnable act since the demand of the inclusion of Marathi-speaking areas in Maharashtra is being made through democratic ways. Maharashtra gives its complete support to the fight carried on by Marathi people for several decades,” Pawar said in a statement released by his office. Meanwhile, Sena leader and MP Sanjay Raut said in Delhi that the Marathi-speaking people got divided in the recent local body elections and faced defeat at the hands of forces which did not want Marathi-speaking areas to be included in Maharashtra. “Maharashtra government should send a strong message to Karnataka that such attacks on Marathi-speaking people will not be tolerated. We should stop just writing messages of condemnation and take steps to protect the Marathi speakers. Despite our push, Marathi-speaking people got divided and voted for the BJP while MES candidates faced defeat in the local election,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shops-shut-on-maha-ktaka-border-over-ink-attack/articleshow/88284576.cms||---

However, luck ran out for him when a villager, who gambled away all of his life's savings following Giri's advice, thrashed him to death in a fit of rage. Fifty-six-year-old Giri was a resident of Nagla Soti village in Bijnor, where many of his followers dreamt of winning the lottery, also known as satta, using the ‘lucky numbers’ suggested by him. Some even managed to hit the jackpot and claimed they did so because of Giri's predictions. Influenced by the ‘godman’, Mohammad Jishan, a resident of Chahshiri mohalla, gave the baba Rs 51,000 along with a mobile phone in exchange for tips on lucky numbers he could bet on. Jishan purchased a series of lottery tickets based on Giri’s advice, putting all his savings – around Rs 5 lakh -- at stake. His hopes were shattered when the lottery numbers were announced and he drew a blank. In a state of shock and anger, Jishan beat Giri to death soon after. According to superintendent of police of Bijnor, Dharamveer Singh, the baba was found with head injuries inside a Kali temple in Bijnor’s Nangal village by devotees on Saturday morning. “It seemed he was bludgeoned to death by a baton but there were no signs of a robbery attempt. The temple is around 700 meters away from the village. Three police teams were formed to crack the case. With the help of a surveillance system and informers, Jishan was arrested on Tuesday. He has been booked under section 302 (murder) of the IPC," Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-loses-rs-5l-in-lottery-beats-godman-to-death-for-failing-to-predict-lucky-number/articleshow/88284568.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Hyderabad||No news for 9 days, Sai’s family suspects foul play||Hyderabad: Though it is nearly 10 days, Siddipet-based family of soldier B Sai Kiran Reddy, who went missing in Punjab en route to report for duty, is still clueless about his whereabouts. They suspect that there could be something more to it than what meets the eye in the disappearance of the 21-year-old jawan. “Although it seems mysterious, I believe that if probed well, police can come to a conclusion about it. How can a person simply disappear? There were two people with whom he had interacted in the train,” said 25-year-old Bhanu Prakash, elder brother of Sai Kiran. It has been nine days since the family in Pothyreddypalli village has been going through the tension. On Tuesday, his mother, who has not been eating properly since her son went missing, had to be rushed to hospital as she became unwell. The 21-year-old soldier of Cheriyal had joined the Army on his own. “In fact, he discontinued studies to join the Army,” Bhanu Prakash said, ruling out the possibility of him being disillusioned at his workplace in Punjab. After Intermediate, Sai Kiran had joined a degree college but discontinued as he had qualified for the Army job. He also reportedly felt there was no point in continuing with his degree where he had joined as there was no proper faculty there. After one and a half years of training, he came home earlier this year. After reporting for work in Punjab, he once again came for Dasara vacation. He came back for another trip in November and left on December 5. He was expected to join his regiment at Faridkot the following day, but his phone was unreachable when his family called him. He did not reach his regiment. From the airport in Hyderabad, he had called up his family twice. “He called once after the check-in and once again when he boarded the flight to Delhi. We had a video chat and he was as normal as like anytime else,” Bhanu Prakash said. There was another reason for Sai Kiran to take up the job. The family has only one-and-half acre land and they needed some stable income. Bhanu Prakash asked him if he had any difficulties at work as Army life is known to be tough. His response was: “We are trained to be tough. If I could be successful in training, it means nothing else can be difficult.” “There is footage of him at the airport in Delhi and also where he got down from a train in Punjab. Our teams are pursuing the leads,” an SI of Cheiryal police station said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-news-for-9-days-sais-family-suspects-foul-play/articleshow/88285472.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre develops technique to quickly identify Omicron variant||AHMEDABAD: In a major breakthrough, Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) scientists developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for faster detection of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. The technique involves cDNA (complementary DNA – a copy of messenger RNA through reverse transcript) prepared from RNA isolated from the viral sample. It is followed by the conventional PCR which provides fast results in comparison to Sequencing of whole virus using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and also provides cost-effective technique to scrutinize samples in remote labs. “The positive sample with this test may be confirmed by sequencing if required. Compared to the test kit developed by ICMR-RMRC which is based on RT-PCR method, GBRC’s kit is conventional and does not require an RT-PCR machine to perform the test,” said a senior official. “The test kit involves the wild-type control to check the reaction setup and to distinguish between wild type and Omicron type of Covid. This technique can be used where results warrant urgency and are at a remote location where high-end facilities are not available.” This test can be performed using conventional PCR machines which may be available at nearby medical colleges or private pathology laboratories, said officials. The conventional method generally takes up to 4-5 days to detect the presence of Omicron from the samples. Gujarat, so far, has four confirmed cases of the variant including three from Jamnagar and one from Surat. All patients are stable, said state health department officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gbrc-develops-technique-to-quickly-identify-omicron-variant/articleshow/88286902.cms||Parth Shastri
