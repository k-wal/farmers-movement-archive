"In the first week of October, one resort had said we could get the entire space for ourselves at Rs 75,000 per night. We delayed our booking due to some logistics. When we booked the space last weekend, we had to shell out Rs 1,60,000 for the same place, as the demand was higher due to the night curfew." Raja Gowda, a farmhouse owner on the outskirts, shares, "We have a four-room farmhouse with minimal facilities. We suddenly got enquiries from people wanting to lease the entire place. We have our place booked for Rs 50,000 by a group of 10 which wants the entire space for Friday night." Many resorts and farms around the city are also giving priority to bigger groups who want to spend more to get the entire space to themselves.

Petrol pump worker Karan Sharma who draws a monthly salary of Rs 11,000, went on a shopping spree with his wife Anita and first booked an XUV300 worth Rs 15.71 lakh, then purchased jewellery worth Rs 18 lakh from Vinod Jewellers in Banthra on December 20. The couple purchased more jewellery worth Rs 4.47 lakh from another shop on December 21, and iPhone handsets worth Rs 5 lakh on December 22, said police. On December 23, Sharma also got Rs 2 lakh petrol recharge done from the pump where he worked. The same day officials from the Bani branch of Central Bank of India called him and informed that there was some technical error and demanded the money back, said police officials quoting the complaint on which an FIR was lodged. "On December 24, bank manager Neha Gupta informed us about a fraud of Rs 76 lakh by a petrol pump worker Karan Sharma. Sharma and his wife fled and did not appear before the bank authorities despite being asked to do so," said SHO, Banthra, Ajay Pratap Singh. The SHO said the transaction irregularity was detected by the bank head office in Mumbai from where officials informed the branch manager. Acting on the complaint filed by the bank manager, police lodged an FIR on the charges of dishonesty and criminal breach of trust against Karan and his wife Anita. They were arrested on December 26 and sent to jail on Monday. "We have asked the bank authorities to trace if any bank official is involved in the fraud," the SHO told TOI. The investigation officers are also investigating how such a huge amount could be spent by a savings bank account holder through a debit card. When TOI spoke to the bank’s branch manager Neha Gupta, she said the matter was being investigated by the technical wing and she was not aware of the technicalities involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-petrol-pump-worker-splurges-rs-76l-shown-in-his-account-due-to-banks-technical-error-arrested/articleshow/88552878.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The arrest of Multani, an activist of the ISI- backed Khalistani outfit, Sikh for Justice (SFJ), who is considered to be the mastermind of the recent blast in a Ludhiana court, happened on the basis of precise intelligence provided by Indian agencies. The arrested terrorist had drawn plan to carry out a big terror strike in Mumbai. He is currently in German custody and will be questioned by Indian investigators. A close aide of SFJ leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu who led the Referendum 2020 campaign for Khalistan, Multani has also been accused of plotting an assassination attempt on Balbir Singh Rajewal, a prominent farm leader who formed the vanguard of protests against the now-scrapped agricultural reforms laws, as part of a larger conspiracy to destabilise Punjab by provoking Sikhs. Rajewal has been projected as the chief ministerial candidate of the 22 farm unions from Punjab which have decided to contest together all the 117 seats in the assembly polls due early next year. The Indian government worked over the weekend to ensure Germany understood the gravity of the situation, particularly since a big terror attack seemed likely in Mumbai, with the agencies getting tipped off about the arrival of a cache of arms and explosives as well as efforts to gather a team to carry out the attack. In fact, bilateral relations were tested as India laid on diplomatic pressure on its strategic partner in Europe to nab Multani on the basis of the specific inputs provided by Indian agencies. During probe into the Ludhiana blast, police came across clues about the involvement of two suspects— Babbar Khalsa terrorist Harvinder Singh Sandhu who is being sheltered by ISI in Pakistan, and Multani in Germany.

The meeting, which started at 4pm, was attended by BJP, Congress, Samajwadi Party, BSP, RLD and others and the discussions continued for two hours. BJP demanded deployment of women cops at each polling booth for verifying the identity of burqa clad women voters. BJP state general secretary J P S Rathore told TOI, “We raised three demands. First, to prevent multiple voting by an individual, we demanded proper verification of burqa clad women voters at polling stations and deployment of women constables at every booth for this. Our second demand was to ensure one polling booth for all members of a family. And thirdly, relocation of any cluster of polling booths in densely-populated areas to avoid mass gathering considering the corona pandemic.” The BJP delegation was led by state vice-president and MLC Arvind Sharma. Congress demanded removal of additional chief secretary, home, from the post before elections. “ACS home Awanish Kumar Awasthi should not be part of election management, he should be transferred before the model code of conduct. It’s in public domain that despite being a government officer, he retweets the tweets of Union ministers. He continues to hail PM’s programmes and government schemes by retweeting them,” Congress said in a letter to ECI signed by Onkarnath Singh, Virender Madan and Mohammad Anas Khan. Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) national secretary Anil Dubey said, “The ECI must provide a list of voters above 80 years and specially challenged to all parties.” Samajwadi Party claimed there are 40 lakh voters in the state who are above 80 years or are specially challenged. The BSP demanded strict implementation of the model code of conduct. CEC Sushil Chandra, election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey, and senior officers are on a three-day visit to UP to review preparations for the assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-party-delegations-meet-ec-share-concerns-demands/articleshow/88553206.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||World||NYC to limit classroom closures, prioritise ramped-up testing for schools||New York City will eliminate its current policy of quarantining entire classrooms exposed to the coronavirus and will instead prioritise a ramped-up testing programme so that asymptomatic students testing negative for Covid-19 can remain in school, officials said on Tuesday.  The step shows health officials are increasing the focus on testing and trying to avoid long isolation periods. A day earlier, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shortened the recommended isolation time for Americans with asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 to five days from the previous guidance of 10 days.  President Joe Biden has pledged to ease a shortage of Covid-19 tests with the Omicron variant threatening to overwhelm hospitals and stifle travel plans as it spreads across the country this holiday week.  New York's new policy was described by mayor Bill de Blasio as "Stay Safe, and Stay Open" and will take effect on January 3. About a million students who attend New York City's public schools are scheduled to return from holiday break on Monday.  New York City mayor-elect Eric Adams, de Blasio and New York governor Kathy Hochul made the announcements at a news conference. New York City aims to detect more infections while mitigating disruptions as officials described remote learning as "a failed experiment".  New York City's previous policy was to quarantine unvaccinated close contacts of infected students for 10 days.  Instead of sending classes of unvaccinated students home to learn online when a student tests positive for Covid-19, the students will be given rapid at-home tests. If they are asymptomatic and test negative, they can return the day after their first negative test.  Students will then be given a second at-home test within seven days of their exposure, according to the announcement.  The step raised some concerns among parents. One tweeted that schools should be kept remote for at least a week's cushion following potential holiday gathering and travel exposure.  Others called for mandatory testing for all children, as well as school employees.  New York will also sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its New Year's Eve celebration in response to a surge of new coronavirus cases fuelled by the highly contagious Omicron variant.  Separately, Biden on Tuesday revoked a proclamation put in place last month that imposed travel restrictions on eight southern African nations, including South Africa, after the emergence of the Omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nyc-to-limit-classroom-closures-prioritise-ramped-up-testing-for-schools/articleshow/88553587.cms||---

It could not have been possible without proper infrastructural development,” said Singh, referring to the ongoing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh since May last year. “In today’s uncertain environment, the possibility of any kind of conflict cannot be ruled out. Strong infrastructure in border areas is essential as it strengthens strategic capabilities. As we move forward in the direction of strengthening our border infrastructure, we have to bolster our surveillance systems as well,” he said at the e-inauguration ceremony. Built by the Border Roads Organization (BRO), the new bridges include nine in Jammu & Kashmir, five each in Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, three in Uttarakhand, and one each in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. Of the roads, two are in Ladakh and one is in West Bengal. The significant ones include the country’s first indigenous 140-feet double-lane modular bridge built at an altitude of of 11,000 feet at Flag Hill-Dokala in Sikkim and the Chisumle-Demchok road at the Umling La Pass at over 19,000 feet in eastern Ladakh. The road at the Umling La Pass will enable faster movement of armed forces, boost tourism and ensure socio-economic development of the region. “Roads in border areas cater to the strategic needs and ensure equal participation of remote areas in the development of the nation,” said Singh, commending the BRO for its perseverance in achieving the feat despite the challenges of sub-zero temperatures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/conflict-cant-be-ruled-out-rajnath-on-lac-row/articleshow/88553562.cms||---
---||India||BJP set to make poll pitch on marriage bill||NEW DELHI: The government may have chosen to refer the bill raising the marriageable age of girls from 18 to 21 years to a standing committee of Parliament recently, but BJP is raising the pitch over the legislation and is seeking to make it one of the key poll issues in the coming state assembly polls, accusing opposition parties of thwarting measures to empower women. PM Narendra Modi has been talking about the legislation in his rallies, invariably alleging that the opposition was hell-bent on thwarting the government and obliquely referring to a sub-text of minority politics without naming leaders like AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi and others. Recently a delegation of women BJP leaders from poll-bound Uttarakhand had called on party president JP Nadda to extend their “gratitude” for the legislation. While the opposition had demanded scrutiny by a parliamentary committee, the government too was not averse to such a path. “The parties which have made corruption as their economic policy, who show obeisance to the mafia, they can’t do development of UP. That is the reason they have problems with every decision meant for empowerment of the society,” Modi said in Kanpur on Tuesday and added, “Be it stringent law against triple talaq or the bill to equalise the marriageable age of boys and girls, they always oppose them.” The bill seeks to raise the age of legal marriage for women from 18 to 21 and will apply to all communities. The PM’s reference of the bill in Kanpur also holds significance for the fact that several Samajwadi Party MPs were vocal against it and dubbed it as interference in the Muslim personal law. Opposing the bill, SP MP ST Hasan, recently said there was nothing wrong in a girl getting married even at the age of 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-set-to-make-poll-pitch-on-marriage-bill/articleshow/88553928.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||World||Biden bets on shorter Covid-19 isolation time amid labour crunch||NEW YORK: Eyeing an Omicron surge that has exacerbated the US labour stress especially in front-line industries, President Joe Biden's administration is betting shorter Covid-19 quarantine times will lessen the economic hit from the latest variant.  The announcement Monday to cut isolation times in half was cheered by airlines and hospitality industries, but sharply criticised by labour unions who question whether public health concerns have been short-changed.  Economists generally offered muted praise as they analyse the Omicron impact, which caused staff shortages that led to thousands of flight cancellations over the holiday weekend, halted theater performances and professional sports competitions, and is expected to slow growth in the first quarter of 2022.  "I don't think the new CDC guidance is going to have a material effect on the economy," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief US economist at Natixis. "But it does help at the margin, it has a psychological impact."  The new guidance cuts the isolation period for asymptomatic Covid-19 cases in half to five days followed by five days of wearing a mask when around others.  It is a relief to business that already had been struggling to fill open positions and return to normal.  Houston restauranteur Dimitri Fetokakis, whose three-restaurant chain employs about 120, welcomed the announcement both because of the tight labour pool and as a sign of progress in navigating the pandemic.  "We've got to get on with our lives. We've got to get on with our businesses," he told AFP. "We can't just sit in our homes hiding from this thing." Omicron a 'gut-punch'Surfacing a month ago initially in South Africa, Omicron has led to exponential growth in the Covid-19 infections in parts of the United States, renewing the stress on testing infrastructure and exacerbating hospital stresses in some places.  But while more infectious, the new strain appears to cause less serious illness.  Oren Klachkin, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said it is still "early days" to gauge the hit from Omicron, but like others he expects lower first-quarter growth followed by a rebound.  The CDC move "will definitely have an impact and alleviate some of the labour shortage issues that we've seen," Klachkin told AFP.  Andrew Rigie, chair of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, described Omicron as a "gut-punch" to the city's recovery, leading to numerous party cancellations over the festive period, and forcing some restaurants to close because of workers who contracted or were exposed to the virus.  The CDC announcement "allows people to get back out and live their life sooner, which means in many cases they are spending money and going to restaurants," he said. Sacrificing public health?The most visible hit from Omicron has been in airlines, with carriers cancelling thousands of flights over the Christmas holiday weekend, much of it due to illnesses afflicting airline and airport workers.  The CDC won immediate praise from the lobbying group, Airlines for America, as well as Delta Air Lines, which had suggested a five-day isolation period in a letter last week to CDC Director Rochelle Walenskey.  "This is a safe, science-based and more practical approach based on what we now know about the Omicron variant," Delta chief health officer Dr Henry Ting said following the CDC announcement.  "We're learning that while Omicron is highly contagious, it also involves a shorter duration of illness and a shorter contagious period compared to previous strains."  But Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, expressed skepticism about the new guidance, saying adopting the timeframe sought by Delta was "less than reassuring" in terms of public health.  "We said we wanted to hear from medical professionals on the best guidance for quarantine, not from corporate America advocating for a shortened period due to staffing shortages," Nelson said on Twitter.  The shift prompted a similar rift in health care, with the American Hospital Association saying the CDC announcement "will allow health care workers to safely return to caring for patients sooner".  But National Nurses United said a CDC announcement last week shortening the isolation period for nurses to seven days from 10 was made without regard for science or the health of employees and the public."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-bets-on-shorter-covid-19-isolation-time-amid-labour-crunch/articleshow/88553960.cms||---

Protein subunit vaccines could be better choice for boosters. Sharing how both Covaxin and Covishield behaved against Delta, Dr Anurag Agrawal, chair of WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on SARSCoV-2, said those data gave some indication on how the existing vaccines may behave against Omicron. He said based on the limited data available, he expects protein subunit vaccines to be the better choice for boosters. Subunit vaccines contain fragments of protein from the pathogen, to help produce an effective immune response. Scientists say such vaccines with lesser side-effects can be administered to a large group, including ones with chronic health conditions. He said prior to the Delta attack, efficacy of Covaxin and Covishield was apparently similar at about 75% to 80% for infections and about 90% for severe disease. “In Indian healthcare workers, pre-prints and full publications from ICMR and AIIMS have shown that Covaxin remained effective during the Delta wave, but with lower efficacy than previously reported. It was around 50% for infections, and 70% for severe disease,” Dr Agrawal, also director of Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR), told TOI. “In the same ICMR-AIIMS study, Covishield’s effectiveness against severe disease was about 80%. The protection against infection in other healthcare worker studies varied but was typically around 60%,” he added. Global data for other whole inactivated virus vaccines versus those that target the spike protein, showed the latter fared better, he said. “One should assume that Covaxin’s efficacy against infection will decline sharply against Omicron, but will remain high for severe disease,” Dr Agrawal said. To tackle Omicron, the immune response needs to be very strong and can be reached either through hybrid immunity, with infection plus vaccination, or by boosters, Dr Agrawal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/subunit-vaccines-better-choice-for-boosters-who-expert/articleshow/88554052.cms||Bappa Majumdar

The grim milestone, as reported by the California Department of Public Health, wasn't entirely unexpected in a state with 40 million residents poised for a surge in new infections amid holiday parties and family gatherings forced indoors by a series of winter storms.  The first coronavirus case in California was confirmed January 25, 2020. It took 292 days to get to one million infections on November 11 of that year, and 44 days from then to top two million.  California's caseload is also ahead of other large states. Texas had more than 4.4 million and Florida topped 3.9 million as of Sunday.  California has recorded more than 75,500 deaths related to Covid-19.  The state has fared far better than many other states that are dealing with a coronavirus surge, with areas in the Midwest and Northeast seeing the biggest jump in cases and hospitalisations amid frigid temperatures that have kept people indoors. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention lists California as a place with "high" transmission of the virus, along with nearly everywhere else in the country. But in the last week California averaged 16.4 new cases per 100,000 people, less than a third of the national rate.  Meanwhile, coronavirus related hospitalisations have been rising slowly in California, up about 12% in the last seven days to 4,401. That's less than half as many as during the late summer peak and one-fifth of a year ago, before vaccines were widely available.  The timeline of Covid-19 in America often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travellers from China, where the outbreak began. The February 6, 2020, death of a San Jose woman was the first known coronavirus fatality in the US. That same month, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community.  On March 19, 2020, governor Gavin Newsom issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-home order, shuttering businesses and schools to try to prevent hospital overcrowding.  It is unclear how many of the newly reported cases were attributed to the Omicron coronavirus variant. Much about Omicron remains unknown, including whether it causes more or less severe illness.  Scientists say Omicron spreads even easier than other coronavirus strains, including Delta, and it is expected to become dominant in the US by early next year. Early studies suggest the vaccinated will need a booster shot for the best chance at preventing an Omicron infection but even without the extra dose, vaccination still should offer strong protection against severe illness and death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-1st-us-state-to-record-over-5-million-cases-amid-omicron-surge/articleshow/88554219.cms||---

However, they must consult their doctor before taking the jab, the Centre said on Tuesday. The decision was taken after a meeting of health secretary Rajesh Bhushan with states on Tuesday. It was decided that those above 60 years can avail the precautionary dose without a doctor’s certificate. Besides, personnel deployed in election duty will also qualify as frontline workers and be eligible to receive the booster dose on completion of nine months from the second dose. CoWin will send reminder messages to all those who are eligible for the third dose, which will be reflected in digital vaccination certificates, the health ministry said. States have been advised to set up separate vaccination centres dedicated for children between 15-18 years. The Centre has projected 7.40 crore children between 15-18 years, with UP, Bihar, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh accounting for the maximum load. Besides, 2.75 crore people in the 60-plus age group with comorbidities are projected across the country. Bhushan chaired a workshop through video conference on Tuesday with all states and UTs to review the roll-out of vaccination for the 15-18 age group and the precautionary third dose for vulnerable categories and those in the 60-plus age group with comorbidities. He said only Covaxin is to be administered in the 15-18 age group. Eligible children can either register themselves on CoWin from January 1 or avail of a walk-in registration when vaccination commences from January 3. States were informed they have the option to designate some Covid vaccination centres exclusively for the 15-18 age group which can also be reflected on CoWin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-60-wont-need-doctors-certificate-for-3rd-vaccine-dose/articleshow/88554155.cms||---

The Congress legislators who joined BJP are Fateh Singh Bajwa, MLA from Qadian and brother of senior Congress leader Pratap Singh Bajwa and Balwinder Singh Laddi, sitting MLA from Hargobindpur. The two Congress MLAs joined the saffron party a day after another senior Congress MLA, Rana Gurmit S Sondhi, joined BJP, reinforcing the assessment in certain quarters that BJP- Amarinder- Dhindsa Front may turn into an alternative platform for those who cannot be accommodated by Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal. Sources said Fateh Singh was apprehensive of losing out to his sibling for the ticket for Qadian. There was also uncertainty about Laddi getting renominated. Still many found it intriguing that the former Congress leaders chose BJP over Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress. These joinings came a day after Amarinder Singh and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, a former Union minister, met the BJP brass after which an announcement for a formal alliance was made between BJP and the parties of these two leaders. Welcoming the leaders into the party-fold, Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who is BJP’s poll in-charge for Punjab, said leaders from other parties are joining the saffron party as it is gaining ground in Punjab. Later at a press conference, Shekhawat shared details of the committees, which will look into the nitty-gritty of the tripartite alliance and work on a common manifesto. “State general secretaries of BJP Subhash Sharma and Dayal Singh will be our representatives whereas General (Retd) Shergill Raninder Singh Tikka will represent Amarinder Singh’s party,” Shekhawat said and added that Justice (Retd) Nirmal Singh and Parwinder Singh will be representatives of Dhindsa’s party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-ex-india-cricketer-dinesh-mongia-2-sitting-congress-mlas-join-bjp/articleshow/88554465.cms||---

Hyderpora building owner Altaf Bhat, who had rented out some space to Gul, a property broker who also ran a call centre in the hired premises, was used as a human shield by the Bilal in his bid to escape, the police claimed. "Both terrorists, Bilal Bhai (from Pakistan) and Amir Magray of Gool Gulabgarh, Ramban, were carrying pistols when they tried to escape using Bhat as a shield. The security forces who had cordoned off the building opened fire and Altaf Bhat was killed in cross-firing," DIG Sujit Kumar said at a press conference at the police control room here. DGP Dilbagh Singh and IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar were also at the press conference. The SIT report reveals that Amir Magray had been staying with Bilal, who belonged to the outfit TRF/Lashkar-e-Taiba, in the room hired by Gul in Hyderpora. DIG Kumar said Magray was a terrorist and, when asked, had lied to the security forces when he told them there was no foreign terrorist in the building. DIG Sujit Kumar Singh, in his detailed presentation about the investigation into the Hyderpora encounter, said that CCTV footage and other evidence showed that Altaf was used as a human shield by Bilal Bhai. "The footage and other evidence show that Amir Magray had accompanied the foreign terrorist Bilal Jamalata in the first week of November to downtown Srinagar where he had shot at a civilian," the DIG said, adding, "Magray, who was working clandestinely with Mudasir Gul at his call centre in the Hyderpora building, would often travel to Bandipora and Gurez." "Two pistols and four magazines were recovered from the encounter site," the DIG said, adding that Bilal Bhai, who was involved in selective killings, would make calls from Magray’s cellphone. He would otherwise stay put in the attic, the DIG said. The police officer said the SIT had sought details in writing about Mudasir Gul, Altaf Bhat and Amir Magray from their kin but they did not furnish details nor cooperate with the investigators. "There were no satisfactory details from Altaf’s family," he said. Meanwhile, the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) rejected the police’s claims as a "concocted cover-up story" and reiterated its demand for a "credible judicial probe" into the controversial Hyderpora encounter. "Today’s press briefing by the J&K police about last month’s tragic incident at Hyderpora is only a repetition of the old story. It does not even slightly give any objective picture of this shocking incident," PAGD spokesperson M Y Tarigami said in a statement. The J&K government had ordered a magisterial inquiry by the additional district magistrate that was to be completed within 15 days, while the police constituted an SIT under DIG Sujit Kumar to probe whether three locals had been killed by the forces during the operation against the Pakistani terrorist. The Jammu and Kashmir home department had said on Tuesday that it had received the inquiry report regarding the Hyderpora encounter and that it had been sent to the concerned judicial magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pak-terrorist-killed-accomplice-mudasir-tried-to-escape-using-altaf-bhat-as-human-shield-sit-probe/articleshow/88554597.cms||M Saleem Pandit

India’s total Omicron tally on Tuesday evening stood at 717. Delhi led the spurt in fresh cases with 23 patients testing positive, taking the national capital’s total to 165, just two short of Maharashtra, which has the highest number of cases in the country. Significantly, no fresh cases were reported in Maharashtra on Tuesday. Sources in the Delhi government said that with Omicron cases on the rise, it is likely that all international passengers arriving in the national capital might have to go for mandatory quarantine at hotels near the Delhi airport. This measure is being mulled to contain the community spread of the new variant. Besides Delhi, Tamil Nadu recorded 11 cases, taking its tally to 45, while seven cases were reported from Telangana and five from Gujarat. With a total of 78 cases, Gujarat is the third worst affected state in the country after Maharashtra and Delhi. Telangana ranks fourth with 62 cases. In Tamil Nadu, of the 11 fresh cases, seven are from Chennai. As many as 24 of the total 45 patients in the state have been discharged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-with-46-new-cases-indias-omicron-tally-now-717/articleshow/88554666.cms||---

Under Section 12 of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the trial court had ordered the woman be given Rs 3,000 a month, medical expenses and a separate house from the joint property. This was challenged by the woman's father-in-law and brothers-in-law. The high court has said in a recent judgement that relief ordered by trial courts under the Domestic Violence Act is applicable to the woman's father-in-law and brothers-in-law if they are enjoying joint family property without there being any partition. The case pertained to an order passed by the 1st additional sessions judge at Kalaburagi, granting Rs 3,000 per month as maintenance and medical expenses to a woman. The court also ordered that she be provided a separate at Yelsangi village out of the three houses owned by her in-laws' family. A direction was also issued for payment of arrears of maintenance within one month and further direction was given to the jurisdictional police concerned to carry out the order of the court. The woman's husband, father-in-law and two brothers-in-law challenged the trial court's order. The high court, however, noted that the Domestic Incident Report is clear that all of them (petitioners) are residing together and the family owns 9 acres of land and all of them will get three acres each and no partition had taken place. The petitioners contended before the high court that the respondent-wife has filed a petition against the husband Shivakumar before the JMFC court at Indi and also another plea seeking directions for the custody of their children. They argued that the wife was residing separately from 2010 and the petition was filed in 2013 making her petition seeking maintenance among other reliefs under Section 12 of the DV Act not maintainable. Another argument was that a suit for partition is pending and no decree has been passed. The respondent-wife's counsel cited a number of Supreme Court judgements and argued that definition of the aggrieved person and domestic relationship remains and the act of domestic violence is a continuing offence and does not get time barred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/in-laws-must-give-woman-court-ordered-relief-says-hc/articleshow/88554783.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Bengaluru||874 turn down Covid aid, 1,200 untraceable in Karnataka||BENGALURU: While hundreds of families which have lost a member to Covid-19 have received compensation from the Union and state governments, 874 families from across Karnataka have refused to accept the aid saying they do not need any financial assistance. Bengaluru, with 551, has the most number of such families, followed by Kolar (55), Koppal (40) and Hassan and Dharwad with 30 each. There are 69 cases — 32 from Bengaluru — where all members of the family have died leaving no legal heirs to claim compensation. The government is unable to trace nearly 1,200 families, most of whom (910) are from Bengaluru. “These are cases where authorities were given improper or incomplete addresses and wrong phone numbers,” the official said. According to data accessed by TOI, while there have been more than 38,000 Covid-19 deaths, the government has received 25,755 applications — 13,059 from BPL families and 12,696 others. Out of these, nearly 24,000 have been approved to get the compensation. “Out of all the applications, only about 3,000 came in voluntarily and the remaining are a result of the work of district-level officials. All the deputy commissioners have ensured their teams find addresses of families and get them onboard. Their effort is commendable,” Satish Kumar, director (pensions), said. 420 cases of victims’ kin living in other statesThe pensions department is overseeing the distribution of compensation from the Centre and managing centralised data, while district authorities are responsible for disbursement of state government aid. While the Centre gives Rs 50,000 per death regardless of the economic background of the victim’s family, the state has announced Rs 1 lakh per family for those below the poverty line. Kumar said the exercise to get families onboard to avail the compensation brought to the fore families that did not want the financial aid. “None of these are BPL families and they say they are actually not in need of the aid,” another official said. This means these families were entitled for Rs 50,000 per death and their refusal to accept the aid saves the Centre at least Rs 4.4 crore. Further, there are 420 cases where the families of persons claimed by Covid in Karnataka are actually living in other states, mostly Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. “In these cases, we have transferred the details to the governments of those respective states,” the official added. In total, there are 2,545 cases — falling under these four categories — that the government will be unable to pay compensations to. And, 1,674 of these cases are from Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/874-turn-down-covid-aid-1-2k-untraceable-in-ktaka/articleshow/88554787.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||India||Divisive ideologies tearing apart social fabric: Sonia||NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday said divisive ideologies, which had no role in India’s freedom movement, are tearing apart the country’s social fabric, as she asserted that her party will fight these forces with all its command irrespective of its electoral fortunes. In her message to party workers on Congress’s 137th Foundation Day, Sonia said ideologies, anchored in hate and prejudice, are playing havoc with social amity. “They are rewriting history to give themselves a role (in the freedom struggle) they do not deserve. They inflame passions, instill fear and spread animosity. The finest traditions of our parliamentary democracy are being deliberately damaged,” she said. Congress will never compromise on its ideology “that is part of its glorious legacy”, she added. Though Sonia did not name any party, her broadside was an unmistakable aim at BJP. “Electoral ups and downs are inevitable, but what is enduring and lasting is our commitment to the service of all people of our diverse society,” she said. At the flag-hoisting ceremony held at the AICC headquarters, the Congress tri-colour fell from the flagpole as Sonia Gandhi pulled the string to hoist it. Sonia snapped the falling cloth midway, which she later displayed in hand to party leaders and workers present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/divisive-ideologies-tearing-apart-social-fabric-sonia/articleshow/88554803.cms||---

Karnataka government will get e-vouchers delivered to the mobiles of eligible students. The voucher code can be received on feature phones too. The students will be able to redeem the vouchers at the identified colleges/institutes for the purpose of fees paymentThe National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), State Bank of India (SBI), and the state department of e-governance have partnered to enable and implement e-Rupi.Rajiv Chawla, additional chief secretary in the department of personnel and administrative reforms (e-governance) in the Karnataka government, said, “e-Rupi is a very powerful tool for governments to use as it allows direct transfer of the benefits to the targeted beneficiary, with safety and security. The instrument ensures that the beneficiary gets the benefit as per the guidelines of the scheme. Each transaction is mapped with the beneficiary and the institution ensuring that the e-voucher can be redeemed by the college where the student has enrolled.”Challa Sreenivasulu Setty, MD of retail and digital banking in SBI, said the government is looking to extend the use of e-Rupi to other use cases like DBT (direct benefit transfer), kerosene oil distribution, subsidised distribution of food grains, donations, grocery. Karnataka government has onboarded around 176 schemes of 35 departments on the DBT platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-govt-to-disburse-scholarships-via-e-rupi/articleshow/88554810.cms||---

Sebi has mandated that these be separated from April next year, after a two-year extension to the initial roll-out date. IIAS found that in October, among the companies in the Nifty 500, as many as 244 companies are yet to comply with the regulations. Of these, 204 companies have executive chairpersons. These are mostly family-controlled companies and public sector undertakings (PSUs or state-owned enterprises). 33 of the 244 companies have a non-executive chairperson who is related to the managing director.IIAS said implementing this regulation is also forcing companies to think about succession planning, which is needed given that family ownership dominates corporate India. “Even so, the regulation may have unintended consequences of lowering the number of independent directors on boards,” it said. It said given that Indian family structures and linkages are spread out, there may well be situations where extended family members chair the board while promoters continue in their executive capacities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/md-chairperson-roles-in-cos-still-not-separated/articleshow/88554811.cms||---

While Jayashree B died instantly, her mother and two younger brothers, who were also on the vehicle, sustained fractures. The truck driver fled leaving the vehicle behind. Police have filed an FIR under IPC sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), and 304A (causing death due to negligence). Varthur resident Vinimala K, 35, and her three children were on their way to her sister’s place when the accident took place, between 3.15pm and 3.30pm, on Gunjur-Varthur main road. The truck that was trying to overtake the scooter ended up brushing against the two-wheeler’s right handle. “As it was a narrow stretch and there was mud debris on the left side of the road towards Varthur, Vinimala and her children fell to the right,” said a police officer who witnessed the incident. “The girl who was sitting at the end of the pillion fell first and came under the wheels of the concrete crusher.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/teen-crushed-to-death-by-speeding-vehicle/articleshow/88554812.cms||---

The Karnataka Common Entrance Test (CET) 2nd Extended Round Seat Allotment 2021 result was declared on December 27 and parents claim due to server crashes the correct seats were not allotted. Candidates with allotted seats must now report to their respective colleges to complete the admission process.One such parent, Karthik (name changed) told TOI that candidates were to enter the options for the seats of their choice from 11am on December 24 to December 26. “But the server kept crashing and on the last day, when we made the changes, the message ‘a page not found’ was repeatedly displayed. We hoped that the changes made were registered,” Karthik said, explaining that on December 27, when the second-round seat allotment list was published, they were shocked to see that none of their options was registered. “Instead, we have been allotted seats in colleges that were not in our preference list at all. We can’t even opt out now,” he added.The last date to surrender the KEA seat selected in the first or second round was before 5pm on December 25. KEA had announced that if any candidate fails to report to the college after allotment of seats in the second extended round, legal action will be initiated against him/her in accordance with the law.“We can’t be forced to accept. But with wrong seats and fear of legal action, we don’t know what to do,” another parent said, adding that they were neither allowed to enter the KEA office to speak to the officials nor did anyone address their concerns.The parents who reached KEA complained they were not given sufficient time before the second round. “NEET counselling has not even started and now students are forced to take up whatever is allotted to them or else threatened with a penalty (5 times of the fee) and legal complications,” a parent said. The students are required to report to colleges from December 28 to December 30 (before 5.30pm).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/server-snag-wrong-seats-in-cet-create-confusion-at-kea-office/articleshow/88554813.cms||---

Instead, colleges can offer regular four-year programme with lateral entry for diploma students. The move comes in the wake of an order from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). In Karnataka, a few engineering colleges like University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE) and BMS College of Engineering (BMSCE) have evening programmes of three-year duration. These are open for working professionals who are diploma holders. Aspirants have to appear for an entrance exam held by Karnataka Examinations Authority. As per AICTE norms, colleges can offer evening programmes if they want, but those have to be in the regular four-year format. Diploma students can have a lateral entry in the second year. While AICTE had released the order last year, it wasn’t implemented and students were admitted for the programme in 2020-21 academic year. While many academicians have supported the decision, pointing out the deteriorating quality of BE degree, some aspirants are unhappy. At UVCE, the programme started in 1971, with 60 seats each in civil, mechanical and electronics branch. Classes were held from 6pm to 9pm and on weekends. “We have merged the seats of the mechanical and electronics departments with the regular quota of the day college. The civil engineering seats have been reallotted to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,” said R Venugopal, vice-chancellor of Bangalore University, under which UVCE comes. “Quality of learning was a concern. Students weren’t regular to class,” said a faculty member. BMSCE has decided to offer regular four-year courses in the evenings for students who would like a second shift from this year. “ Teachers will continue to teach existing students,” said Ravishankar B, principal, BMSCE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-more-three-year-2nd-shift-be-courses-in-state/articleshow/88554814.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Experts rue health of lakes in Bengaluru, say STPs inefficient||BENGALURU: Thanks to apathy of successive governments, stormwater drains (SWDs) have turned into sewage carriers, a major source of pollution of city lakes. Wile authorities are now relying heavily on sewage treatment plants (STPs) to ensure lakes get clean water inflow, experts say STPs aren’t efficient in removing nutrients from the sewage entering waterbodies. Ramprasad V, an expert on lakes, said, “Although we understand that the best way to bring water into lakes is through SWDs, that doesn’t seem to be the solution right now. As of now, mostly secondary treated water is being let into a few lakes from the existing STPs, but the right way to do it would be to allow only tertiary treated water after the elimination of nutrients to prevent increased growth of algae and water hyacinth.” Experts say algae and water hyacinth are a clear indication of the presence of nutrients in water. Once the lake is covered with hyacinth and algae, they start affecting the waterbody’s ecosystem, depriving life beneath of oxygen. Nagesh Aras, another expert, said, “Nitrates, phosphorus and potassium are micro-nutrients and are usually not removed at a secondary treatment plant. If they have to be removed, it has to be done through bioremediation, which simply means passing the water through the roots of various plants which absorb all these nutrients. When that doesn’t happen, the hyacinth in the waterbody tends to do the same thing. So hyacinth and algae are part of the solution, but they eventually cover the entire lake and don’t allow sunlight to penetrate, which in turn doesn’t allow the submerged variety of plants to go through the cycle of photosynthesis. This leads to a drop in the level of dissolved oxygen, causing a huge imbalance to the ecosystem.” Therefore, raw sewage is directly harmful, but secondary treated water is harmful indirectly. Diversion drainsShankar Reddy, special commissioner for lakes, said STPs are likely to remain a permanent solution. “Having said that, it would be impossible to eliminate SWDs as they play a vital role. It might take a while for SWDs to bring in fresh water into the lakes as there is heavy sewage inflow in the city’s SWDs. However, what we can do from our end to ensure that sewage doesn’t enter lakes is to construct diversion drains near them,” he said. “ According to BWSSB, its STPs have tertiary cleaning technology which eliminates nutrients in the water. An official said, “We have been removing the nutrients and only then allowing water into the lakes. We have received clearance from KSPCB (Karnataka State Pollution Control Board) and CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) for this.” The city has over 800km of SWDs, which are desilted often. BBMP, however, still struggles with eliminating sewage from the drains. Manoj Jain, special commissioner for SWDs, said, “Sewage being present or absent in SWDs completely depends on BWSSB. Bengaluru is a growing city and BWSSB needs to keep an eye on its existing network of drains to prevent sewage from flowing into SWDs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/experts-rue-health-of-city-lakes-say-stps-inefficient/articleshow/88554815.cms||---

The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had registered a case against Nayaz Ahmed G, attached to CS Pura police station in Gubbi town of Tumakuru district, on November 3, 2011, while he was caught receiving the money from Thimmegowda alias Chandranna. Incidentally, sub-inspector Somashekar, the main accused, was also nabbed by ACB sleuths, who had to chase him for over 1km. Head constable Keshav Murthy, who allegedly demanded Rs 30,000 bribe and agreed to receive Rs 10,000, was arraigned as accused no. 2. A case under section 7(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was filed against the accused. Nayaz was accused no. 3. As the special court rejected bail, Nayaz moved the high court. He contended that SI Somashekar had already been granted bail. However, Justice K Natarajan, who perused the materials on record, noted that bail was granted to accused no. 1 on the grounds that conversation between the complainant and him was not sufficient. “But the entire conversation under the spot panchnama reveals that petitioner-accused no.3 actually received money from the complainant. Investigation is still pending. Therefore, it cannot be said that the petitioner has not accepted any money. Of course, he might have received bribe on behalf of accused no.1. But, he was caught red-handed while accepting the bribe. There was a demand and acceptance of money by the petitioner, who came on a motorbike and received the amount and had a conversation with the complainant. Therefore, this is not a fit case for grant of bail at this stage,” the judge observed while dismissing Nayaz’s petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cop-who-collected-12k-bribe-denied-bail/articleshow/88554816.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Citizens panic as drain work leads to soil erosion around Metro pier||BENGALURU: Many residents of Ulsoor panicked as they noticed soil erosion around a Metro pier in the area during BBMP’s stormwater drain (SWD) repair work late on Monday evening. Many residents and commuters raised concern as an earthmover of the BBMP contractor was digging close to the Metro pier (109A) near Ulsoor Metro station. While the soil next to the pier was exposed, there was no structural damage to the pillar. They said the retaining wall of the drain too was damaged. “The earth excavator was desilting the SWD and drilling the walls when we suddenly felt a vibration and noticed the foundation of the pillar in the drain,” said BR Chandra, civic activist and ward committee member of Ulsoor. However, BBMP officials clarified there was nothing to worry. Sources said the contractor had not intimated BMRCL about the work. “Digging shouldn’t have been taken up near the pillar without permission from BMRCL as digging agencies won’t know where the foundation is, among other things,” a BMRCL source said. BMRCL officials visited the spot and gave their suggestions to BBMP on the matter. Meanwhile, as a precaution, trains operated at a slower speed of 5kmph near Ulsoor station. A representative of the BBMP contractor said the pillar’s foundation hasn’t been damaged. “There is no question about the safety of the structure as the piles go at least 10-20m beneath,” he said. SWD work is part of the chief minister’s Nava Nagarothana scheme, which specifies construction and remodelling of primary and secondary SWDs and bridges at 27 locations in the Challaghatta (C-100) project. A senior ward engineer said there are other local issues affecting works here. “There is excessive garbage dumped in the SWD and the three vents in it have been affected badly. Work on this has been taken up,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/citizens-panic-as-drain-work-leads-to-soil-erosion-around-metro-pier/articleshow/88554817.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||KSRTC told to refund excess fare, pay Rs 5,000 relief||BENGALURU: A man took exception to Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) refusing to refund the Rs 300 extra fare it had charged him for a journey during non-peak period. He approached a consumer court, which recently ordered the state transporter to refund the excess fare and also pay a compensation of Rs 5,000 for causing him trouble. Umesh S, of Sullia taluk in Dakshina Kannada, had on January 7, 2019, booked two tickets for a non-AC KSRTC sleeper bus for Rs 1,500 to travel from Sullia to Bengaluru on January 24, 2019. But because of a family emergency, he was forced to cancel the tickets within a few days and received a refund after the deduction of cancellation fee of Rs 290. With his personal situation improving, on January 10, 2019, he rebooked the tickets for the same day by the same bus, only to be surprised to find that the fare for two tickets was only Rs 1,200 the second time. He approached KSRTC’s division controller of Puttur district, Dakshina Kannada, and raised the issue of difference in ticket prices despite the travel date falling in a non-peak and non-season period. On January 16, 2019, Umesh applied for a refund of Rs 300 but the KSRTC authorities didn’t bother to respond to his petition. With more attempts to get back his money failing, he served the utility with a legal notice on March 16, 2019. But with the authorities refusing to budge, Umesh finally approached the Dakshina Kannada District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission on February 13, 2021, with a complaint against KSRTC’s division controller of Puttur. Umesh’s lawyer presented his claim, while the KSRTC attorney argued that the passenger had rushed to the consumer forum despite the transport corporation assuring him of the Rs 300 refund. He further stated that the fare difference for the same date and same bus was due to a computer software flaw in the booking system of KSRTC and the agency had asked Umesh to provide his bank details to make the money transfer but he had failed to comply. In court proceedings lasting over nine months, judges of the consumer court noted that KSRTC had accepted the flaw in the ticketing software but decided to initiate a refund to the passenger only after he sent the transporter a legal notice and not after he first approached it for his rightful refund. This shows that the transport utility officials don’t care about their customers and this attitude amounts to deficiency in service. The court ruled that the division controller of KSRTC, Puttur division, must refund an amount of Rs 300 with interest to Umesh apart from paying him a compensation of Rs 5,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ksrtc-told-to-refund-excess-fare-pay-5k-relief/articleshow/88554818.cms||Petlee Peter

Archana Reddy, a resident of Bellandur, had visited Jigani with her 16-year-old son to cast her vote in the elections held to Jigani town municipal corporation. After that, she visited some family friends and relatives before heading back home in her car. Four assailants, who had come in motorbikes and scooters, ambushed the vehicle. Three men, Manoj, Harish and Pramod, were travelling with Archana. The car in which Archana Reddy was travelling“They tried to stop the vehicle near the traffic signal. We were told that the car was being driven by Harish at that time and he alerted Archana, her son and the others to escape. Harish tried to speed away but the miscreants blocked his car’s path with a two-wheeler, forcing Harish to stop. The front portion of the car was damaged as it rammed the two-wheeler and then the railings. By then, the three men and the teenager jumped out of the car and ran some distance. They turned back and saw three armed men pulling Archana Reddy out of the car and hacking her. She died instantly. Her body bore at least 15 wounds,” an officer said. Probe revealed that Archana and her second husband Naveen Reddy had developed differences over her ancestral property in Channapatna, Ramanagara district. Archana had lodged a dowry harassment case against Naveen two months ago. “Naveen Reddy resides in Jigani, while Archana lived in Bellandur. We’re yet to get a clear picture on her family background. It is a murder for rivalry which was pre-planned and executed,” he said. According to police, Archana had divorced her husband nine years ago. She had two children, both from her first marriage. The elder daughter is 21. Police have picked up five men for questioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/homemaker-hacked-to-death-as-teen-son-3-family-friends-look-on/articleshow/88554819.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: JD(S) likely to use Kannada pride as poll plank in 2023||BENGALURU: It was three years ago that HD Kumaraswamy became the chief minister under the JD(S)-Congress coalition, but for both his party and family, it has been a battle for survival. As the HD Deve Gowda family loses its sway in Vokkaliga pockets, with the emergence of fresh faces and inroads by Congress and BJP in parts of Mandya, Mysuru, Hassan and Ramanagara, the regional party seems to be undergoing a churn. It is rumoured that at least one-third of the sitting JD(S) MLAs may shift their loyalties to either Congress or BJP before the 2023 elections. Kumaraswamy plans to revive JD(S) by leveraging Kannada pride and not be overdependent on the Vokkaliga factor. With both BJP and Congress targeting one another with accusations of corruption and being subservient to larger national forces, JD(S) is considering Kannada pride as a viable plank to mount its 2023 poll challenge. Over the past three weeks, JD(S) has tried to put the spotlight on Kannada by raising issues like the violent Belagavi border situation with Maharashtra in the winter session and taking to social media on the National Testing Agency conducting the UGC-NET in Hindi. “What we are seeing is a space for us, as a regional party, to establish our position. Let the two parties fight with each other on national issues, but for Karnataka it is only JD(S) which can prove to be the answer to regional concerns. It helps to keep our party alive,” said Kumaraswamy.

---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: JD(S) likely to use Kannada pride as poll plank in 2023||BENGALURU: It was three years ago that HD Kumaraswamy became the chief minister under the JD(S)-Congress coalition, but for both his party and family, it has been a battle for survival. As the HD Deve Gowda family loses its sway in Vokkaliga pockets, with the emergence of fresh faces and inroads by Congress and BJP in parts of Mandya, Mysuru, Hassan and Ramanagara, the regional party seems to be undergoing a churn. It is rumoured that at least one-third of the sitting JD(S) MLAs may shift their loyalties to either Congress or BJP before the 2023 elections. Kumaraswamy plans to revive JD(S) by leveraging Kannada pride and not be overdependent on the Vokkaliga factor. With both BJP and Congress targeting one another with accusations of corruption and being subservient to larger national forces, JD(S) is considering Kannada pride as a viable plank to mount its 2023 poll challenge. Over the past three weeks, JD(S) has tried to put the spotlight on Kannada by raising issues like the violent Belagavi border situation with Maharashtra in the winter session and taking to social media on the National Testing Agency conducting the UGC-NET in Hindi. “What we are seeing is a space for us, as a regional party, to establish our position. Let the two parties fight with each other on national issues, but for Karnataka it is only JD(S) which can prove to be the answer to regional concerns. It helps to keep our party alive,” said Kumaraswamy. He admitted that Kannada pride may very well serve as a poll plank for JD(S). “We will take it to the streets in the election year as neither of the national parties has shown any inclination to highlight the disrespect shown by the Centre to Kannada and issues plaguing Karnataka. This has increased ever since the BJP came to power,” he said. The bigger concern for JD(S) is to find voices other than Kumaraswamy and his 88-year-old father Deve Gowda, to articulate its position.

Seven more are in various stages of finalization. The new policies are in line with the Centre’s push for reform in the space sector, aimed at significantly higher participation from the private sector. As reported by TOI earlier, private enterprises would have access to DoS infrastructure, including launchpads, can get technologies from Isro, use facilities for testing, besides building, owning, and operating their own satellites and launch vehicles. Space exploration and future human space programmes will also see enhanced participation from the private industry. While the space communications, remote sensing, and transfer of technology (ToT) policies will be sent to the Cabinet after being cleared by the Space Commission, three more — humans in space, navigation, and space transportation policies — are being revised to include some suggestions from ministries, industry, and the public. A senior scientist from Isro headquarters said that aside from these six, the DoS has drafted policies on FDI, space exploration, space situational awareness (SSA), and national space policy, which will be released for public consultation soon, taking the total number of new policies to 10. Apart from these, there is the Space Activities Bill, which will act as the umbrella legislature for all policies, the scientist said. K Sivan, secretary, DoS, while confirming the developments said: “...The space communications, remote sensing, and ToT policies are in the final form and ready for Space Commission, after which it will go to the Cabinet.” When a new policy is drafted, it first gets a nod from the DoS expert committee, following which it is put out for public consultation. Once this process is over, the DoS incorporates new suggestions after which the revised document goes through an informal review of the empowered technology group. Once the empowered technology group review is complete, it is placed before the Space Commission before being sent to the Cabinet. “Drafts of all 10 policies and the Space Activity Bill are ready. They are in various stages of finalization. The entire process should be complete in the next few months,” Sivan added. Isro has plans for three earth observation (EO) satellite missions in the first quarter of 2022. While two of them — EOS-4 (Risat-1A) and EOS-6 (Oceansat-3) — will be launched using PSLV, the third one, EOS-2 (Microsat), will be launched in the first developmental flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/three-key-space-policies-to-go-to-union-cabinet-soon/articleshow/88554823.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Air pollution in parts of India went up during lockdown||Bengaluru: Reduction of economic activities during the pandemic-related lockdown had resulted in decrease of air pollution in most parts of India, but satellite observations show that parts of India showed an increase in pollution in contrast to the general trend.Scientists from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) have identified that regions in the central-western part of India and north India are prone to higher air pollution exposure based on state-of-the-art satellite observations and hence are exposed to greater risk of respiratory problems.ARIES is an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), which said that while satellite-based observation of toxic trace gases — ozone, nitrogen-di-oxide and carbon monoxide — near the surface and in the free troposphere mostly showed a reduction of the pollutants over India, an increase of ozone and other toxic gases was observed in some regions like western-central India, some parts of Northern India, and remote Himalaya. “This could have aggravated respiratory health risks around those regions during the pandemic. We utilised the EUMETSAT and NASA satellite observations for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, and investigated the influence of significant cutoff of anthropogenic activities on the changes in the vertical and columnar distribution of ozone, CO, and NO2 during the lockdown period,” one of the scientists said.The study published in ‘Environmental Science and Pollution Research’ led by Prajjwal Rawat, a senior research fellow at ARIES along with his research supervisor Manish Naja, shows that ozone, carbon monoxide, and NO 2 showed an increase of about 15% over the central-western part of India.According to the results, carbon monoxide showed a consistent increase — as high as 31% — of concentration at higher heights during the lockdown. “The long-range transport and downward transport from the stratosphere significantly increased ozone concentrations over north India during the lockdown, and remote regions like the Himalayas and coastal cities showed the bare minimum influence of lockdown in air quality, with a tendency to increase in criteria air pollutants,” one of the scientists added.The scientists explain ozone production and loss are constrained through the complex photochemistry involving its precursor gases like Nitric Oxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids.“...A decrease in its precursor gases could also lead to enhancement of ozone, depending upon the chemical environment. Moreover, ozone concentrations are also altered via ambient meteorology and dynamics,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/air-pollution-in-parts-of-india-went-up-during-lockdown/articleshow/88554825.cms||---

---||Chennai||3 months on, governor yet to forward anti-NEET Bill to President||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu assembly’s unanimous anti-NEET Bill seeking to nullify the national-level test for MBBS admissions is still lying with the governor’s office, more than three months after it was sent to the Raj Bhavan. The governor is yet to forward it to the President for assent. The information was furnished in response to an application under the Right To Information (RTI) Act filed by P B Prince Gajendrababu, general secretary of State Platform for Common School System (SPCSS). The RTI plea sought to know the action taken by the governor on the Bill and its current status. R N Ravi assumed charge as Governor of Tamil Nadu on September 18. In his reply dated December 17, S Venkateshwaran, under secretary to governor/ public information officer, stated that "the file is under consideration." Tamil Nadu Assembly passed The Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Act, 2021 on September 13, to provide admission to medical courses only on the basis of Class XII marks in board examinations. "Though Article 200 of the Constitution did not specify the time limit for the governor, it says the decision may be taken "as soon as possible." A governor is entitled to take his time to study the Bill and seek legal advice. However, the Constitution does not allow undue delay," Prince Gajendrababu told TOI. He further urged the governor to send the Bill to the President for assent. SPCSS president P Ratnasabapathy said the forum would go on a hunger strike on January 30 demanding presidential assent to the NEET Bill. A high-level committee, headed by Justice A K Rajan, former judge of Madras high court, set up by the DMK government in June, reported to the government that NEET had undermined the diverse societal representation in MBBS and higher medical courses, favoured affluent groups and thwarted the dream of underprivileged to pursue medical education. The committee said the NEET neither seemed to ensure merit nor standard of the students being offered MBBS under its purview. Following the recommendation, the state government adopted the Bill with the support of all Opposition parties, except BJP, in the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/3-mths-on-guv-yet-to-forward-anti-neet-bill-to-president/articleshow/88554833.cms||A Ragu Raman

The Modi government has not been permitting the opposition to discuss the government policies in Parliament and it has not taken up issues relating to the withdrawal of the farm laws either, said the PCC chief after hoisting the Congress flag at its headquarters Satyamurthy Bhavan in Chennai to mark the party’s 137th foundation day. “Modi was forced to withdraw the farm laws following the Gandhian way of protests by the farming community. But the issue was not taken up for discussion in Parliament,” said Alagiri. He along with other senior leaders of the party paid floral tributes to late Congress leaders on the occasion. Coming down heavily on the BJP-led government, Alagiri said people can expect “more farcical schemes” from the Centre in the days to come. He wondered if the BJP’s demonetization decision benefited the common man. It was the same with the BJP’s contentious farm laws, he said. At a recent book release event on the premises of a private school in Chennai, BJP leader H Raja released a book on former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the first copy was received by an RSS functionary, said Congress spokesman A Gopanna. The book belittled the contribution of Nehru to the nation’s development, said Gopanna.  “I will approach the school administration and seek its permission to release a book on Narendra Modi. If they do not give me permission, I will approach the court,” he said and wondered how an educational institution could allow such a programme that belittled the former PM. The district units of Congress too celebrated the foundation day across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/central-schemes-benefit-no-one-says-tncc-chief/articleshow/88554835.cms||---

Justice S M Subramaniam issued the directions in response to a petition by a devotee, A Radhakrishnan, who said the temple possessed about 150 acres of land and that miscreants were creating documents in a fraudulent manner to grab the temple properties. Justice Subramaniam observed that the effort requires verification of revenue records, documents and directed the officials of all departments concerned to convene a meeting to conduct a discussion regarding the action to be initiated within six weeks. In his petition, Radhakrishnan contended that there is maladministration in respect of the temple properties and that he had been frequently approaching temple authorities to take action, but no action was taken till date. “The land-grabbers are creating many documents to ensure that the action taken are not fructified and they are able to claim ownership of all temple properties,” he said in his petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-calls-for-sustained-efforts-to-retrieve-lost-temple-lands/articleshow/88554837.cms||---

He was speaking after a meeting with chief educational officers where the progress of demolishing unsafe buildings in schools was discussed. Later, the directorate of government examinations released a schedule and said the first revision test will be held from January 19 to 28 followed by one from March 21 to 29. Marks in these tests, school education department sources said, are likely to be used as backup in case board exams are cancelled due to another Covid wave. Schools welcomed the announcement saying students will get more time to prepare for exams in May. “They will have three to four months to prepare. Teachers also will have time to complete the syllabus and revise,” said N Vijayan, senior principal, Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaram. Teachers’ associations, however, urged the government to plan the rest of the academic year keeping the rapidly spreading Omicron variant in mind. “States have started to close schools to prevent Omicron spread. The school education department should consider the situation while planning exams,” said P Patric Raymond, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation. Earlier, speaking about the meeting with chief educational officers, Poyyamozhi said that in the first phase, officials identified unsafe buildings in 1,600 schools and that demolition work was on. “We instructed officials to check the stability of all buildings in schools. In the wall collapse incident in Tirunelveli, the toilet wall was built without any foundation,” he said. Officials were directed to ensure display of helpline number 14417 in classrooms and schools to create awareness among students. Schools should have a complaint box to receive sexual harassment complaints, Poyyamozhi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-class-x-xii-board-exams-to-be-held-in-may-2022-minister/articleshow/88554838.cms||---

Chief minister M K Stalin ordered the increase of 14 percentage points in dearness allowance, which will result in more than 82% increase in dearness allowance for the employees and pensioners from January 1, next year. On September 7, Stalin had informed the assembly, while making a statement under Section 110, about the state government’s intent to increase the dearness allowance for its employees and pensioners from January 1, 2022, the release added. Stalin also sanctioned an additional 170 crore as Pongal gift for category ‘C’ and ‘D’ employees, besides pensioners, those on special timescale and those who retired from such services and former village administrative officers. While category ‘C’ and ‘D’ employees will receive 3,000 as Pongal gift, for pensioners it will be 500. People on special timescale will receive 1,000 and former village administrative officers and those retired from special timescale will receive 500 as Pongal gift from the state government. Despite the state struggling under debt burden, Stalin had ordered the sanction of the amount needed to pay the dearness allowance considering the welfare of the government employees and pensioners, the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-hikes-da-of-staff-pensioners-by-82/articleshow/88554839.cms||---

The 13-year-old multiple sclerosis patient had been to the Marina with her parents often, but on Tuesday she was able to fulfil her dream. Seeing her chortle with happiness as the water lapped up her feet, her mother Megha Agarwal too was elated. “We aren’t aware if she ever felt left out as we cannot understand her feelings much but seeing her so happy, I realize how much she must have wanted to do this,” she said. Like Medha, several other persons with disability got to live a dream. Thanks to Greater Chennai Corporation setting up a plywood ramp 250m long and 8ft wide right to the water’s edge. Set up every year to mark World Disability Day, the ramp is open for a week. This time, corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said, it will remain till January 17. In three months, he said, they will set up a permanent ramp using either a geo-fabric material or timber after getting clearances. A temporary ramp was first set up in 2016, but until this year it was always only up to the high tide line. This time, due to wheelchairs provided by the Coast Guard, people could get into the water. And, they came from as far as Porur and Puducherry. The parents, including R Jaya and R Muneeswari who had brought their children, were as happy. Of the more than 50 people with various disabilities who had come to the beach, at least five went into the water assisted by Coast Guard personnel, volunteers and police officers. The amphibious wheelchairs will be available at the beach until January 16. Smitha Sadasivam, member of the disability rights alliance, said it shouldn’t be just one day at the beach. “Steps should be taken so that people on wheelchairs can access the beach whenever they feel like just like other citizens of Chennai. Also, we have requested the corporation to include persons with disabilities in all future projects and proposals to ensure their rights and accessibility issues are catered to,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/disabled-get-to-live-dream-at-marina-ramp-to-remain-on-sand-until-jan-17/articleshow/88554840.cms||Komal Gautham

While 691 new investors invested in Indian startups in 2019, this count of first-time investors grew to 1145 in 2021, as per data from research firm Tracxn. This count stood at 708 in 2020. As per Tracxn’s data, a few new investors who backed the country’s startups include American firms GoodWater Capital, 2AM VC, Goat Capital, and others. South Korean game publisher Krafton also turned investor this year backing gaming startup Nodwin Gaming. Homegrown new VC firms such as Multiply Ventures and GetVantage also backed startups such as Clever Harvey and The Ayurveda Co respectively among other companies. Further, low yields and increased tensions between the US and China, and China’s crackdown on tech companies have worked in India’s favor and put it in a macro-economic and geo-political sweet spot. The number of international investors with investments in Indian tech startups grew from 697 investors in 2019 to 990 in 2021 with the share of investors based in the US and UAE rising and money from China and Japan falling steeply. The proportion of investors from the US investing in India has grown gradually from 44% in 2019 to 51% in 2020 to 53% in 2021. The ratio of Chinese investors backing Indian startups has declined by almost half — from 7% in 2019 to 3% in 2021. “With global fixed income yields at record lows, allocation of investments to emerging markets by global LPs is on the rise,” Vivek Soni, EY, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/more-first-time-investors-bet-big-on-desi-startups-in-2021/articleshow/88554841.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

They tied the women up and escaped with over 50 sovereigns of gold, Rs 5 lakh cash and 1kg silver. Police who reached the spot checked the CCTV footage and found the involvement of Santhanakrishnan. Police said Srinivasan runs a coaching centre for TNPSC preparations and Santhanakrishnan works as an assistant to him. He had often visited the house and noticed the valuables locked in a room. Along with his friends, Santhanakrishnan hatched a plan to rob the valuables and escape town. He knew that the women would be alone in the house and always left the doors unlocked. He chose the afternoon for the crime as he knew that they would be busy watching TV and it was easy for them to gain entry, police said. The Kancheepuram Taluk police registered a case and arrested the accused. The police seized 44 sovereigns of gold, 33 grams of silver and Rs 1.20 lakh cash. They have been remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kanchi-burglary-relative-of-victim-among-3-arrested/articleshow/88554844.cms||---

---||India||SC: Insurer can’t refuse medical claim citing existing condition||NEW DELHI: An insurer cannot repudiate a claim by citing an existing medical condition that was disclosed by the insured in the proposal form, once the policy has been issued, the Supreme Court has said. A bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna also said a proposer is under a duty to disclose to the insurer all material facts within his knowledge. The proposer is presumed to know all the facts and circumstances concerning the proposed insurance, it added. While the proposer can only disclose what is known to him, the proposer’s duty of disclosure is not confined to his actual knowledge, it also extends to those material facts which, in the ordinary course of business, he ought to know, the court said. “Once the policy has been issued after assessing the medical condition of the insured, the insurer cannot repudiate the claim by citing an existing medical condition, which was disclosed by the insured in the proposal form and which condition has led to a particular risk in respect of which the claim has been made by the insured,” the bench said in a judgment. The top court was hearing an appeal filed by Manmohan Nanda against an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), rejecting his plea seeking a claim for medical expenses incurred in the US. Nanda had bought an Overseas Mediclaim Business and Holiday Policy as he intended to travel to the US. On reaching the San Francisco airport, he suffered a heart attack and was admitted to a hospital, where angioplasty was performed on him and three stents were inserted to remove the blockage from the heart vessels. Subsequently, the appellant claimed the treatment expenses from the insurer, which was repudiated by the latter stating that the appellant had a history of hyperlipidaemia and diabetes, which was not disclosed while buying the insurance policy. The NCDRC had concluded that since the complainant had been under statin medication, which was not disclosed while buying the mediclaim policy, he failed to comply with his duty to make a complete disclosure of his health conditions. The apex court said the repudiation of the policy by the United India Insurance company was illegal and not in accordance with law. It said the object of buying a policy is to seek indemnification in respect of a sudden illness or sickness that is not expected or imminent and that may occur overseas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-insurer-cant-refuse-medical-claim-citing-existing-condition/articleshow/88554885.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Malegaon blast: Witness claims ATS forced him to take Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath’s name||MUMBAI: A witness in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, whose statement had been recorded by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), claimed in a court on Tuesday that the ATS had forced him to take the names of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and four RSS leaders. Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, currently facing cases of extortion, was posted as the additional commissioner of the ATS when it investigated the Malegaon blast case. The witness deposed before the special NIA court on Tuesday. The statement of the witness had been recorded by the ATS when it probed the case, before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the case. During his deposition, the witness told the court that the then senior ATS officer Param Bir Singh and another officer had threatened him and forced him to take the names of Yogi Adityanath and four RSS leaders, including Indresh Kumar. He claimed that the ATS tortured him and made him sit (in the ATS office) illegally. After his deposition, the court declared the witness hostile for making allegations against the ATS and for denying that he made any statement before the anti-terror agency. So far, 220 witnesses have been examined in the case and 15 of them have turned hostile. On September 29, 2008, 6 people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Nashik’s Malegaon town, located about 200 km from Mumbai. The accused in the case include LS member Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Colonel Prasad Purohit.

Police have claimed that the fight was related to some Instagram posts. The deceased has been identified as Shaukat Ali, who lived in Uttam Nagar. Police said the victim had made some comments on the Instagram post of an accused, who got angry and allegedly threatened Ali. According to the cops, the accused thrashed and stabbed Ali with an ice poker on Sunday. According to the postmortem report, the cause of the death was haemorrhagic shock caused by tearing and penetration of large blood vessels by some sharp-pointed objects. The victim’s family members levelled allegations against a few local people, out of which some are minors. Further probe revealed that the incident was triggered by comments made by both the accused and the victim on each other’s social media posts. Additional deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Vikram Singh said three juveniles had been apprehended. “One of the suspects has a criminal history. Different teams are working round the clock to nab the other accused involved in this crime,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-juveniles-held-for-murdering-20-year-old-over-insta-posts/articleshow/88553559.cms||---

On Monday and Tuesday, 17 cases were reported in the city every day which was equal to the number of cases reported on June 26. Positive cases being reported in the city had reached ‘zero’ in September at the end of the second wave. They started rising again but remained in single digits till December 8. The numbers had remained low largely as not many contacts of those who tested positive were found infected. The situation has changed again as contacts have started testing positive. The 17 new cases on June 26 were detected from 1,749 tests. If details provided by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) are to be believed an equal number of new cases were detected on Monday and Tuesday from 4,730 and 5,674 tests. While the number of tests now may seem much higher, sources said that earlier only RT-PCR tests and their results were counted by the VMC. Now, even rapid antingen tests are being included in the number of tests conducted. VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that it was early to comment if a rising trend had set in. “The new cases include a high number of close contacts identified during contact tracing. The situation is not alarming right now, but we will have to wait for a few more days before reaching to a conclusion,” he said. Patel added that the progress of the disease will also be decided by the way the Omicron variant behaves. So far, no Omicron case without travel history or without close contact with a infected person with travel history has been detected. On Tuesday, no new Omicron cases were detected. A major respite for the administration and doctors is that the hospitalisation, as well as the number of serious cases due to Covid-19, have remained low so far. Against 19 serious cases on June 26, there was only one serious case on Monday and Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/new-covid-19-cases-in-vadodara-reach-june-levels/articleshow/88553087.cms||---

---||Business||Mukesh Ambani talks succession for 1st time as RIL chief||MUMBAI: In his first statement on succession plans, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani on Tuesday said the younger generation is now ready to take on leadership roles. Speaking at the company’s Family Day function, which marks group founder Dhirubhai Ambani’s birth anniversary, he emphasised that he would like the process to be accelerated. “We should guide them, enable them, encourage them... and sit back and applaud as they perform better than us,” said Ambani. Ambani, 64, took over as chairman of RIL after his father’s death in 2002. His three children, Akash, Isha and Anant, have been involved in RIL’s telecom, retail and energy businesses. While none is on the board of RIL, they are directors in the company’s key arms. “I have no doubt that Akash, Isha and Anant, as the next-gen leaders, will lead Reliance to even greater heights. I can see and feel their passion, commitment, and devotion to the cause of Reliance every day. I see in them the same spark and potential that my father had for making a difference to millions of lives and contributing to India’s growth,” he said. His statement comes ahead of Sebi’s April 2022 deadline to split the chairman and managing director positions in listed companies. While Sebi has extended the timeline for listed entities to comply with its new norm, chairman Ajay Tyagi said on Tuesday, “We have given enough time to the industry for splitting the post of chairman and managing director. I can only make an appeal to the industry to follow it.” Ambani further said the time has come to lay the foundation for RIL’s future growth by seizing the humongous opportunity. RIL, which started as a textile company, has metamorphosed into a conglomerate with varied business interests whose products touch people’s lives every day. “We have completely re-engineered our energy business. Now, Reliance is poised to become a global leader in clean and green energy and materials. This transformation of our oldest business will provide us the largest growth engine for Reliance,” he said. At RIL’s annual shareholder meeting in June this year, Ambani had announced an investment of Rs 75,000 crore in clean energy over three years as the company moves away from fossil fuels. On the retail and telecom (Jio) businesses, Ambani said, “In the past one year alone, we have onboarded nearly one million small shopkeepers and created nearly one lakh new employment opportunities. This growth engine will continue to create significant societal value by providing unlimited opportunities for our partners and employees. Jio gained over 120 million subscribers and brought fibre to nearly four million homes and commercial establishments.” He cautioned employees against lowering their guard against coronavirus. While normalcy is slowly returning, it still is clouded by uncertainty, Ambani, also India’s richest man, said. “As we enter the second half of Reliance’s Golden Decade, I can tell you that the future of our company looks brighter to me than ever before. I can confidently make two predictions. First, India will become one of the top three economies in the world. Second, Reliance will become one of the strongest and most reputed Indian multinational companies in the world.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ambani-talks-succession-for-1st-time-as-ril-chief/articleshow/88553711.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Hence, verification of the certificates of the selected candidates should be completed by the third week of February,” Kumar wrote in a letter to all district education officers in the state. He added, “All selected candidates had previously been directed to have their educational and training certificates verified at the regional offices of the Bihar School Examination Board by October 31, 2021. However, based on the information provided by regional offices through December 18, the verification work was not completed.” Following the conclusion of the panchayat elections, the dates for the third round of counselling have been announced. It is expected to conclude by January 28. As a result, the education department has directed the DEOs to complete the verification of all selected candidates’ certificates by the end of the third week of February, so that the process of teacher recruitment can begin promptly thereafter. If the verification of certificates is delayed further, the entire responsibility will fall on the DEO concerned, according to the education department notification. Counselling for the first and second recruitment cycles under different units began on July 3 and 28 respectively and was completed on time. However, the third cycle was unable to begin on time due to the panchayat elections. Now, the third round of counselling and appointment of teachers to fill 12,495 vacancies in 1,368 recruitment units will begin on January 18 with urban bodies, followed by blocks and panchayats. Over 48,000 teachers have been recruited in the last two counselling cycles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-education-dept-process-of-recruiting-teachers-will-begin-in-february/articleshow/88552374.cms||B K Mishra

Wildlifer Girish Punjabi made the participants aware about the richness of the biodiversity and ecosystem of the Tillari region and oriented the youth on how they could contribute towards the protection and conservation of the region. Ramesh Zarmekar spoke about the varied species of birds found in the region. He also spoke about how the protection of wetlands is essential for maintaining diversity of birds. Another wildlifer, Rahul Khanolkar, highlighted the role of bats in the environment and briefed the participants about their habitat. Dodoamarg range forest officer Madan Kshirsagar applauded the efforts of the participants in the plastic collection drive and explained how it is necessary to protect the tiger to be able to maintain the ecological balance, food chain and water sources.

---||Business||MFs need unitholder nod to wind up schemes||MUMBAI: Sebi has made it mandatory for mutual funds to obtain unitholder consent for winding up a scheme. The markets watchdog has also said that schemes with crypto-linked investments would not be allowed until laws are in place. The order requiring unitholder consent is a fallout of Franklin Templeton’s decision to wind up six schemes in April 2020. The move triggered legal action by the unitholders. The Supreme Court then directed that unitholders need to vote for winding up of any scheme. Under the new regulations, consent of unitholders has to be obtained by simple majority under the principle of one vote per unit held. In case the trustees fail to obtain the consent, the scheme shall open for business activities after the publication of results. Earlier, mutual funds could wind up schemes if the trustees felt the same was required. Unitholders could also wind up a scheme if 75% of them pass a resolution to that effect. The regulator could also announce a scheme to be wound up if it felt it was in the interest of unitholders. While trustees can initiate proceedings for winding up the scheme, the ultimate decision will need to be taken by unitholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mfs-need-unitholder-nod-to-wind-up-schemes/articleshow/88553640.cms||---
---||Business||Sebi tightens IPO norms for disclosure, funds’ end-use||MUMBAI: Markets watchdog Sebi on Tuesday tightened norms for initial public offers (IPOs) after a spate of issues saw companies raise funds for ambiguous reasons and investors had to deal with high volatility after key shareholders sold their holdings soon after listing of new age companies. Under the new norms, large shareholders in the company (with over 20% stake) cannot sell more than 50% of their holding as part of an offer for sale (OFS). This becomes relevant as in startups, private equity investors are large shareholders and there is no identifiable promoter. The current norms allow these large shareholders to fully exit. To improve disclosure norms, companies can allocate only 25% of an issue’s proceeds for acquisitions where a target has not been identified. The total allocation for unidentified acquisition and ‘general corporate purpose’ cannot exceed 35%. Issuers will have to appoint a credit rating agency to monitor and report on the end-use of funds. In the board meeting held on Tuesday, Sebi said that anchor investors will have to hold half their holdings for at least 90 days in addition to the current requirement of staying invested for a month. Shares of companies like Zomato and Paytm fell a month after listing after anchor investors sold at the end of the lock-in period. Non-institutional investors now will be split into two categories. A third of the issue will be reserved for those who invest between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 10 lakh and the remaining two-thirds will be for those who invest Rs 10 lakh and above in the issue. This move will prevent the smaller investors from being squeezed out. To ensure that companies do not get too ambitious in their pricing, Sebi has asked them to have an upper price band that’s at least 105% higher. Sebi chairperson Ajay Tyagi asserted that the regulator has no intention to control the prices of IPOs in any manner. “Price discovery is a function of the market and that is how it works globally as well,” he said at a media briefing after the board meeting. The regulator also approved the introduction of Special Situation Funds (SSFs) that will invest only in bad debt assets. SSFs will be introduced as a sub-category under Category-1 Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). The move will greatly help the operations of the National Asset Reconstruction Company, which will be acquiring a large chunk of bad debt from public sector banks. To improve corporate governance in listed companies, the regulator has barred them from appointing directors who have been earlier rejected by shareholders, without the shareholders’ express approval. In a fallout of its tussle with PNB Housing over valuation of shares in a preferential issue to a new owner, Sebi said that preferential issues will require an independent valuation when it results in a change of ownership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-tightens-ipo-norms-for-disclosure-funds-end-use/articleshow/88553678.cms||---

Gujarat Covid cases double to 394 in 24 hours||AHMEDABAD: Alarm bells over third wave knocking on the state’s doorstep went ringing as Covid cases in Gujarat jumped from 204 on Monday to 394 on Tuesday, clocking 93% rise in 24 hours. Out of the total cases, 312 or 79% were recorded from eight major cities of the state. For Gujarat, it was the highest daily tally in 197 days or over six and a half months. The exponential rise of daily cases and relatively lower discharges of patients pushed the active cases to 1,420 – a rise of 334 in a day. The state also recorded five new cases of Omicron, taking the total to 78. Analysis of the rise in daily active cases among Indian states for Monday based on Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) data indicated that Gujarat recorded 12.7% rise – the fourth highest, behind Jharkhand (24.3%), Delhi (14.4%) and Bihar (15.4%). In view of the rise in Covid cases in Gujarat, chief secretary (CS) Pankaj Kumar convened a meeting of collectors and municipal commissioners on Tuesday. Officials said that the administration has been asked to strengthen contact tracing of the confirmed cases, stringent observance of micro containment zones with police presence and boosting vaccination further in areas where the vaccination is lower than state average. The CS also asked officials to improve testing and tracing. “Gujarat is no exception as the cases are rising across India. The global trends also indicate steady rise in Covid cases. In Gujarat, majority of the cases are recorded from urban pockets. But if we study the cases of the past few days, the hospitalization and mortality has not increased much. Thus, we urge all to get vaccinated and observe Covid-appropriate behaviour including wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” said a senior health department official. Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health), on Tuesday said that about 30 lakh children would be covered in the vaccination drive that would start from Jan 3. “About 6.24 lakh healthcare workers (HCW) and 3.19 lakh frontline workers (FLW) are eligible for the booster dose. Likewise, 37,000 senior citizens with comorbidities will be eligible for booster dose. All three categories to get vaccination from Jan 10,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3rd-wave-knocking-guj-covid-cases-double-to-394-in-24-hrs/articleshow/88553355.cms||---
---||Business||Better governance, risk management needed, says RBI||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has called for policy initiatives that ensure effective risk management and sound corporate governance for the credit cycle to gain traction, which it said was important to support economic recovery. The observation by the RBI comes at a time when credit growth by banks has been decelerating for two years due to lack of demand and risk-aversion. “The slowdown in credit is reflecting a scissors effect. Industrial activity and investment constrained credit demand, while stressed balance sheets of banks limited credit supply. Hence, policies aimed at boosting aggregate demand need to be supplemented with strengthening bank balance sheets to reduce stress for a sustainable boost to credit growth,” the RBI said on Tuesday in its report titled ‘Trend and progress of banking in India’. Banks are facing sluggish credit growth even as the system is flush with liquidity and interest rates are at a new low. “For the last three years, private non-financial corporations have been net savers, progressively increasing their deposits with SCBs (scheduled commercial banks), while their credit offtake has remained anaemic,” the RBI said. The financials of banks, however, showed a marked improvement as they cleansed their books of bad loans and raised capital. The capital to risk-weighted assets (CRAR) ratio of SCBs strengthened from 14.8% at end-March 2020 to 16.3% at end-March 2021 and further to 16.6% at end-September 2021, partly aided by higher retained earnings and capital-raising. Their gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio declined from 8.2% at end-March 2020 to 7.3% at end-March 2021 and further to 6.9% at end-September 2021. Gross bank credit grew 6% in FY20 followed by 5.4% in FY21. In the first six months of the current fiscal, it has improved to 6.8%, which is still lower than the long-term average. As compared to this, deposit mobilisation by SCBs in FY21 was the highest in seven years, mainly contributed by the low-cost current account & savings account (CASA) deposits. In the first half of FY22, there was a moderation in deposit growth with the normalisation of economic activity and rising inflation.“The trade-off between short-term liquidity and regulatory support to viable borrowers and medium-term macro-financial stability risks needs to be carefully balanced,” the RBI further said. The central bank said that banks will need to further raise capital to absorb potential slippages as well as to sustain credit flow, especially when monetary and fiscal measures unwind. “Although most of the regulatory relaxation measures have run their course, the full extent of their impact on banking is yet to unravel,” the central bank said. “Banks would need to strengthen their corporate governance practices and risk-management strategies to build resilience in an increasingly dynamic and uncertain economic environment,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/better-governance-risk-mgmt-needed-says-rbi/articleshow/88553613.cms||---

The CM on Tuesday said a meeting would be held soon in the state to chalk out the plan for rolling out vaccination for children. There are at least 75 lakh teenagers in the state in the age group of 15-18 years. “Vaccination of children between 15 to 18 years of age will be formally started by the CM. We will announce the name of the institute from where the CM will launch this vaccination phase in Bihar in a day,” said an official of the health department. Meanwhile, the Centre held a meeting with the senior officials of all the states on Tuesday to discuss the launch of vaccination for teenagers as well as precautionary doses for healthcare workers, frontline workers and elderly people with comorbidities. State health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said children will be inoculated with Covaxin and they will be given the second dose after a gap of 28 days. The Centre has also advised the states to arrange separate vaccination centres for children. In case of centres where people above 18 years of age are also inoculated, a separate queue for children will have to be made. “The idea is to avoid confusion as the children will be given Covaxin only,” Amrit said, adding there will be no shortage of vaccines for the children.

---||Patna||Bihar set to get 24 more ambient air quality monitoring stations||ARA: Bihar is all set to get 24 more ambient air quality monitoring stations covering 22 districts by the first week of January. These will be in addition to the existing 11 air quality monitoring stations in the state. According to Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) sources, the server of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is being linked with stations having air quality index (AQI) system and it will be done by the first week of January. AQI tracks ground-level ozone (smog) and particulate matters, such as tiny particles from ash, soil dust, power plants and factories, vehicle exhaust, pollen and other major pollutants. The higher the AQI level, the greater the level of air pollution and health concern. AQI is divided into six categories on the point scale of 0 to 500.While the AQI value of 0-50 is considered good, the AQI value of 300 and above is considered hazardous for health. With the installing of AQI system, people can now know the level of air pollution in their cities and take preventive measures to avoid health complications. A continuous ambient air quality monitoring station has been installed on the new collectorate premises in Ara, which will start regular functioning from the first week of January with other 23 other AQI system stations. BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said, “In the beginning only Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur were declared as ‘non attainment cities’ and had AQI system. But the BSPCB decided to expand the scope of monitoring the air quality to other parts of state and about one-and-a half-year back, we added 8 more ambient air quality monitoring stations, including 6 in Patna, two each in Gaya and Muzaffarpur and one in Hajipur.” He added: “By the first week of January, we will have 24 more AQI system in the state. Places like Purnia, Supaul, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Nawada, Nalanda, Ara and other places taking the number to 35. Now the AQI system will be in 22 districts out of 38 districts in the state. Installing an ambient air quality monitoring station costs somewhere between Rs 80 lakh and 1 crore. But thankfully we are getting funds from the CPCB and central government.” Stressing on the need to establish co-ordination between different government departments for effective implementation of air pollution controlling measures, Ghosh said: “A chief secretary-level monitoring committee has been formed in which secretaries of different departments such as road construction, building construction, urban development, forest and agriculture departments will try to establish inter-departmental coordination in order to effectively implement the measures for controlling the air pollution. Assignments have been given to all the departments concerned for taking adequate measures to assist in abating the level of air pollution.” “For instance, the building construction department has to ensure that there should be proper ‘screening’ at the construction site so that small particles of harmful dust do not fly in the air. The road construction department has to ensure that fragmented parts of the road are made concrete, the urban development department has the task of effective waste disposal, the forest department has to do plantation and the agriculture department has to check crop residue (parali) burning. The district administration has to ensure that when sand or other construction material is carried on vehicles it should be properly covered,” added Ghosh.  The BSPCB has also prepared a ‘clean air action plan’ for curbing air pollution level. “We have short-term, mid-term and long-term activities recommended for checking the level of air pollution, the BSPCB said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-set-to-get-24-more-ambient-air-quality-monitoring-stations/articleshow/88552808.cms||---

---||Business||India Inc needs to pick up pace to win war for talent||By Kamal KaranthIn the year of great recruitment, enterprises that can embrace speed will have an edge. If you are leading an organisation or the HR department, this may not be the time to be bullish on the retention of your colleagues. The options are too many and the temptations are even more for most of the workforce. If enterprises immediately don’t evaluate and reconfigure how they are attracting and hiring talent, they would be found wanting soon. For the longest time, organisations rested on their brand equity to attract talent. However, with increasing friction between demand and supply in recent times, organisations must look at the other variables in their recruitment cycle. Most enterprises seek skills-scale-salary-speed to be to their optimum advantage when they hire talent. The balance of these four critical aspects in hiring makes all the difference to their desired talent makeup. * Skills: It’s pretty evident that organisations need matching skills, and any compromise on that front can hurt. However, in a market driven by external talent, hiring managers need to be satisfied with a few ‘must have’ skills than spending too much seeking the ‘nice to have’ competencies. * Scale: With the high attrition, especially in the IT talent pool and the pent-up demand after the pandemic, enterprises need to hire more people than they ever did. This hiring scale is essential to maintain a healthy talent pipeline to support the current business momentum organisations have. So, it’s no longer about whom you hired, but how many you hire. * Salary: Every hiring requirement within enterprises starts with a budget for the role. Likewise, every job seeker begins by asking how much the employer can pay. Large enterprises must work through their internal salary parity to hire some of the top talent. It could be a limiting or facilitating factor in today’s red hot talent market. Funded startups have an advantage on the pay front as they hire limited talent and don’t have the legacy employee salary benchmarks as a constraining element. * Speed: For HR teams, however, the most controllable variable in the recruitment process is speed. Historically, every industry or enterprise has defined a recruitment cycle of 4-6 weeks to make an offer depending on the seniority of the role. Unfortunately, this time cycle is becoming a deterrent to hiring in recent times. The current acute talent demand is challenging the recruiting managers to redefine their speed and, thereby, the candidate experience. * Fastest finger first: The rise in offers per candidate and the sharp drop in offer acceptance & joining ratios indicate how competitive the recruitment space has become over the past three quarters. IT industry’s average joining ratio is hovering at 50%, and at about 30% in the non-IT space. Hiring managers can significantly solve this new hiring inefficiency by bringing speed to their recruitment process. Irrespective of recruitment by internal talent acquisition teams or commercial hiring by consultants, the four speed challenges that recruiters have to ace are CV, interview, offer and onboard. Cutting through the clutter With recruiters and talent acquisition teams as process catalysts, hiring managers and enterprises are focusing on a speed-up through: * Prioritising candidates who are serving notice * Tighter talent acquisition teams for CV submissions * Reducing timelines for CV feedback * Minimising rounds of interviews * Combining interviewers as panel * Cutting down the time-to-offer (not more than two weeks) * Slashing the time-to-onboard (buying-out notice periods where possible) The demand for lateral talent, especially with tech skills, will continue for two years as fresh talent gets inducted and trained to match expertise levels. Till such time, the current pool of experts will be in high demand. Multiple offers cover dropouts, short tenures, demand for high pay rises, counteroffers, and massive hikes for job changes — ghosting will continue. And under these conditions, HR teams and enterprises have no choice but to ace the speed challenges immediately.After all, an early bird catches the worm.

Chairing a review meeting of Project Monitoring Committee here, the DM called for removal of the bottlenecks related to land acquisition in ambitious projects like Patna-Gaya-Dobhi four-lane road, second phase of Atal Path and Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur six-lane bridge. During the review of 127km-long Patna-Gaya-Dobhi NH-83, which has to be widened into four-lane road, the officials concerned claimed that land acquisition and encroachment removal works have been completed. Altogether 466 acres of land have been acquired in 31 villages for this project. The DM also issued instructions for commencement of work on second phase of Atal Path. The first phase of the project having four-lane road with two additional service lanes between R Block and Digha was inaugurated by CM Nitish Kumar on January 15 this year. The second phase will connect the road with Ganga Path or Ganga driveway. The DM asked the officials to sort out the issue of transfer of around 1 acre of land to Food Corporation of India (FCI) by road construction department. With regard to upcoming elevated road between Mithapur and Mauli, it was discussed in the meeting that 15 acres of land are to be acquired for the project. The DM issued instructions for shifting a library and a hostel coming under the alignment of the project. The 8.86km-long elevated road from south-western flank of Mithapur flyover to Ramgovind Singh Mahuli railway halt is proposed to be constructed with an expenditure of Rs 668 crore. The DM said payment of compensation for land being acquired for Ganga Path, the 20.50km-long four-lane road along the bank of Ganga between Digha and Didarganj, should be expedited. The foundation stone for the ambitious project was laid by CM Nitish Kumar in 2013. It is being constructed with an expenditure of Rs 3,390 crore. The DM asked the officials concerned to remove a PVC factory at Sabbalpur coming under the alignment of Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur bridge across the Ganga. The compensation for the land has been paid to the factory owner, officials said at the meeting. The six-lane bridge connecting Patna to Vaishali will be 22km-long with 9.76km-long bridge structure. It is being constructed with an expenditure of Rs 4,958 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expedite-land-acquisition-for-road-and-bridge-projects-in-patna-dm/articleshow/88552350.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The forest department in Surat district has formed a team of seven daredevil women for leopard rescue and RFID tagging. This motley group from Khodamba round of Mandvi range in Surat district has achieved expertise in their craft by successfully rescuing and tagging 20 leopards with RFID this year. Interestingly, these women do not fear leopards any more and believe that the wild cats are not enemies of humans. “Once we were controlling fire in Mandvi range of the forest when a leopard crossed us a few feet away. It was one of the closest encounters. But since we are trained, our team did not react and the feline left the spot,” said Pooja Singh, a beat forest guard. While it’s not the animals that they dread, it’s the encounters with human anger that these women find more life-threatening like the episode in Madharkui village. “In one of the toughest rescue operations, we caged a leopard from Madharkui village forest after it killed a four-year-old girl. However, we could leave the village with the animal alive only after firing in the air,” said Neha Chaudhari, range forester. The team is trained and after getting a request for rescue, it inspects the location, prepares a plan for rescue, installs cages and trap cameras to capture the movement of the animal. The team also examines tracks of the leopard. “Besides leopards, the team also rescues injured monkeys and treat injured birds during Uttrayan,” said U D Raulji, range forest officer, Mandvi. “They work in the most sensitive areas of wildlife and forest cover. The women’s team is doing a brilliant job of rescuing and managing locals,” said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forest, Surat. “They are the most committed and highly motivated team who are powerful in multiple ways. They set examples for other women. It is a matter of pride for the forest department,” C K Sonawane, chief conservator of forest, Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/7-women-team-up-to-rescue-tag-leopards-in-wild/articleshow/88553404.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

While 691 new investors invested in Indian startups in 2019, this count of first-time investors grew to 1145 in 2021, as per data from research firm Tracxn. This count stood at 708 in 2020. As per Tracxn’s data, a few new investors who backed the country’s startups include American firms GoodWater Capital, 2AM VC, Goat Capital, and others. South Korean game publisher Krafton also turned investor this year backing gaming startup Nodwin Gaming. Homegrown new VC firms such as Multiply Ventures and GetVantage also backed startups such as Clever Harvey and The Ayurveda Co respectively among other companies. Further, low yields and increased tensions between the US and China, and China’s crackdown on tech companies have worked in India’s favor and put it in a macro-economic and geo-political sweet spot. The number of international investors with investments in Indian tech startups grew from 697 investors in 2019 to 990 in 2021 with the share of investors based in the US and UAE rising and money from China and Japan falling steeply. The proportion of investors from the US investing in India has grown gradually from 44% in 2019 to 51% in 2020 to 53% in 2021. The ratio of Chinese investors backing Indian startups has declined by almost half — from 7% in 2019 to 3% in 2021. “With global fixed income yields at record lows, allocation of investments to emerging markets by global LPs is on the rise. India’s strong consumption base combined with its favorable geopolitical and macroeconomic positioning has made it an attractive destination for large investors,” Vivek Soni, EY, said. Coming off a year of record PE/VC investments and exits in 2021, EY expects 2022 to be bigger by at least 20%. “We anticipate newer PE firms to take notice of the Indian market and open their investment positions here,” Soni said. Anjali Bansal, Founder, Avaana Capital, said the pandemic has accelerated digitization across sectors like education, agriculture, healthcare, supply chains etc. and the Indian startup ecosystem is also maturing with seasoned entrepreneurs returning for their next stints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/more-first-time-investors-bet-big-on-desi-startups-in-2021/articleshow/88553501.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

They may result in a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Dr Rohan Krishnan, the national president of the Federation of All India Medical Association, told this reporter, “Calcium carbide, which is used for artificially ripening fruits, is a known carcinogen, a substance that causes cancer. It also has adverse effects on the liver and other organs. Additionally, it contains trace amounts of arsenic and phosphorus hydride, both of which have a variety of acute and chronic health effects.” He added, “Carbide poisoning results in headache, dizziness, memory loss, mood swings, mental confusion, sleepiness, cerebral edema, and seizures. It also leads to numbness in the legs and hands, general weakness, cold and damp skin, and low blood pressure.” Dr Arun Shah, a paediatrician, stated that if calcium carbide-ripened fruits were regularly given to children, it would undoubtedly impair their physical and mental development. “Consumption of such fruits over time may also result in hormonal imbalances. In general, if a higher dose of carbide is applied to ripe fruits, it causes arsenic and phosphorous poisoning, which can result in eye burning, permanent eye damage, and skin, mouth, nose, and throat ulcers,” he explained. A biotechnology professor at Patna University, Birendra Prasad, pointed out, “Ripening fruits with ethylene and ethephon is permissible if used in moderation. However, due to the dangers associated with calcium carbide, it is prohibited in a number of countries, including India. Despite the ban, fruit traders in Patna use it without fear.” He also noted, “Artificial ripening is prohibited by the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 and the PFA Rules, 1955. As a general rule, no fruit can be ripened using calcium carbide. Those found guilty of violating these rules face up to three years in prison and a fine of up to Rs 1,000.” According to Ajay Kumar, Patna’s food safety officer, traders have reportedly been using carbide pouches to ripen fruits. “Food safety inspectors have conducted several raids on Bazar Samiti’s godowns, but they are rarely apprehended. Occasionally, samples of suspicious fruits are collected and sent to Kolkata for testing, but the results take a long time to come back. The state’s sole Food and Drug Testing Laboratory located in Agamkuan has been inoperable for some time,” Ajay claimed. However, Mukesh Kashyap, Gaya’s food safety officer, admitted that action was taken only in response to consumer complaints and upon production of samples. He asserted that the sale of carbide was not permitted in retail establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/say-no-to-artificially-ripened-fruits-caution-health-experts/articleshow/88552377.cms||B K Mishra

A BJP member Gajendra Jha even announced a fatwa asking anyone to chop Manjhi’s tongue and get Rs 11 lakh from him. The BJP, later, suspended Jha from the party. It saw another round of wordy duel between environment and forest minister Neeraj Kumar Singh Babloo and HAM(S) functionary Danish Rizwan, while Manjhi hosted a joint feast for Barhmins and Dalits on Monday. “The chapter should now be closed, as Manjhi has already apologized for his controversial statement, and it should not drag. He invited Brahmins to a feast at his official residence and they were seated with dignity, served food, and given ‘dakshina’ (Rs 1,001 each),” SuModi said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi is a senior leader of the NDA. No statement should be made against him by leaders of the NDA constituents,” SuMo added. “One who threatened Manjhi (to get his tongue chopped off) has also been suspended from the party by the BJP. With that, a message has also been given that hurling threats at the Dalits or insulting them will not be tolerated,” SuMo also said, pointing out that under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the BJP is committed to unite all sections and ensure their development. It may be mentioned here that facing sharp outcry from people at large and also the political class, Manjhi had apologised for using an expletive against the Brahmins, describing it as a “slip of tongue”. Manjhi, however, had maintained that he would continue to protest against “Brahminism”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sumo-asks-state-nda-functionaries-not-to-be-critical-of-hams-chief/articleshow/88552840.cms||Abhay Singh

The asymptomatic patients have been kept in home quarantine.” Dr Roy added of 10 people who tested positive for Covid on December 26, eight had taken both doses of Covid vaccine. “We had also sent the sample of a person from a Magnolia delegation, who had tested Covid positive, for genome sequencing to find out whether it was Omicron variant or not. However, it was found that it was Delta variant of the virus. We continue to send samples for genome sequencing to keep a strict vigil on any new variant of coronavirus,” Dr Roy added. He claimed that most people testing positive for Covid in the district are young. “Movement of people during the last wedding season and Christmas celebrations might have led to the surge in cases. Nonetheless, we are fully prepared to tackle any exigency as 121 beds are kept for Covid patients at Anugrah Narayan Medical College and Hospital and a 50-bed district isolation centre is also active,” Dr Roy said. The recovery rate among coronavirus patients in the state stood at 98.32% on Tuesday against the national average of 98.40%. Altogether, 6.04 crore samples have been tested for Covid in the state so far, including 1,73,962 in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, 3,97,706 doses of Covid vaccines were administered in the state in the last 24 hours. SO far, 9,82,06,888 vaccine doses have been administered in the state. Parks, zoo to remain closed from Dec 31 to January 2: The crisis management group (CMG) of the state government on Tuesday issued a notification, stating that all parks and zoo in the state will remain closed from December 31 to January 2 in the wake of rise in Covid cases. It means popular hangout spots, such as Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park or Patna zoo, Eco Park and Nature Safari at Rajgir will remain closed during New Year celebrations. The CMG has also asked organisers of all types of social, political, cultural, education, entertainment, sports and religious events to ensure adherence of Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-cases-continue-to-rise-in-bihar-as-47-more-test-positive/articleshow/88552171.cms||Piyush Tripathi

With a stick in hand, he can do the investigation and directly send people to jail,” Tej told mediapersons here. Addressing a public meeting at Sasaram on Monday as part of his social reforms campaign, Nitish had told people from other parts of the world not to come to Bihar if they wished to consume liquor during their stay in the dry state. He had also asked the officials of districts sharing their borders with other states to stop liquor smuggling. Tej also advised Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi and Vikassheel Insaan Party founder Mukesh Sahani to come on one platform to defeat the communal forces. Hitting back at Tej, JD(U) state spokesperson and former MLC Neeraj Kumar said, “With no proper education and manners, it is but natural for a person like Tej to issue such useless statements.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tej-to-nitish-sit-at-border-to-check-liquor-smuggling/articleshow/88552329.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for fairly widespread rainfall in the state on Wednesday and cold day condition on Thursday. Patna Meteorological Centre issued a yellow warning for light to moderate rainfall accompanied by thunderstorm and lightning at isolated places in the of north-west, north-central, south-west and south-central parts of Bihar on Wednesday. Similar yellow warning has been issued for cold day conditions at isolated places in west and central Bihar on Thursday and western parts of the state on Friday. The yellow code warning by IMD means the authorities should be watchful for extreme weather developments. The rainy and extreme cold conditions have been attributed to a western disturbance along with a cyclonic circulation in the region. An all India-weather bulletin issued by IMD on Tuesday said wet spell was expected over northwest, central and east India till Thursday. The bulletin further stated that scattered to fairly widespread rainfall would occur in Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Sikkim till Thursday. The IMD has also forecast cold day condition in Bihar on Wednesday and Thursday. Cold day condition is declared at a place when minimum temperature touches 10 degrees C or low and there is a departure of 4.5-6.4 degrees C in maximum temperature on two consecutive days. Md Zeeshan Ansari, an official at Patna Meteorological Centre, said the average maximum or day temperature on Wednesday and Thursday would be in the range of 16-18 degrees C. The cold day conditions are also expected to be accompanied by dense fog in the morning hours till December 31. Meanwhile, average minimum temperature in the state on Tuesday was in the range of 12-14 degrees C and maximum in the range of 23-25 degrees C. Pusa in Samastipur was the coldest place in the state on Tuesday morning with a minimum temperature of 9.4 degrees C. The minimum temperature at Patna and Gaya, on the other hand, was recorded at 12.2 degrees C and 12.7 degrees C, respectively, on Tuesday. The departure of cloudy conditions is likely to pave way for sharp drop in minimum temperature. Ansari said minimum temperature might plunge by two to four notches from December 31 onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-issues-yellow-alert-for-fairly-widespread-rain-today/articleshow/88552238.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Patna||Work on pedestrian subway on Patna’s Station Road to begin in Jan ’22||PATNA: Groundwork and soil testing have begun for the much-anticipated pedestrian subway on Station Road as part of the Patna Smart City Limited’s (PSCL) Railway Station Area Redevelopment Project. Construction on the 440-metre-long subway will begin in January, as the design is nearing completion. The subway will connect the Patna Junction to the proposed multi-modal transport hub at Bakri Bazar via Mahavir Mandir, and also include multi-level parking near Buddha Smriti Park. It will be completed by December 2023 with a budget of Rs 68.85 crore. Chief minister Nitish Kumar had laid the project’s foundation stone on December 4. According to a PSCL official, due to a lack of seamless connectivity near the Patna Junction, passengers walk across a busy section of Station Road along with their luggage. The subway along the stretch between the Patna Junction and the proposed multi-modal hub near the GPO roundabout will allow pedestrians to walk underground without encountering any difficulties. Additionally, it will ensure a smooth flow of traffic for commuters travelling from Dak Bungalow crossing to Station Road, Mithapur, and Budh Marg, as well as vice versa. Equipped with escalators, lifts, and a walkway, the pedestrian subway will be built using cut-and-cover technology. Harshita, the public relations officer of the PSCL, told this reporter, “In addition to escalators and elevators, the subway will include travelators, which will eliminate the need for passengers to walk all the way from the Patna Junction to the multi-level car park near the GPO roundabout. Other features include air conditioning, a ramp, ventilation, a fire extinguisher, a drainage system, and a generator for backup power. This will be the city’s first subway.” She added, “Once the subway is completed, it will put an end to the ordeal of pedestrians waiting to cross the road due to a massive traffic jam near the station roundabout.” The implementing agency has begun the soil testing process following approval from the state government. It is currently developing the final design for the subway system based on the detailed project report (DPR), which will be vetted by an expert agency. According to the DPR, 330 metres of the 440-metre-long subway will be underground and 110 metres will be on the surface. It will be approximately 8 metres deep. Meanwhile, an overbridge connecting the second level of the multi-level car parking structure to the Station Road flyover (between pillars 7 and 8) will be built to maximise the use of the existing parking space. It is estimated to cost around Rs 17 crore. The proposed multi-modal transit hub, which will accommodate private cabs, autorickshaws, and buses, is also included in the project. A five-story structure will facilitate passenger transfer. The building construction department is currently preparing the project’s DPR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/work-on-pedestrian-subway-on-patnas-station-road-to-begin-in-jan-22/articleshow/88552301.cms||Faryal Rumi

Addressing the party’s rank and file at a workshop here, Sanjay said: “We got a survey done and results have shown that we are winning in all 19 SC constituencies in Telangana. TRS government failed in implementing promises like Dalit Bandhu, double bedroom houses for the poor and making a Dalit as chief minister.” Sanjay said though the opposition parties had campaigned against the BJP as an ‘anti-Dalit’ party, the party won 46 SC seats across the country in the last general elections and the Congress was confined to winning just five SC seats. DK Aruna, national vice-president of BJP, said that it was disgraceful for TRS to claim that it had been successful in convincing the Centre to agree to purchase additional quantity of paddy from the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-will-sweep-all-19-sc-seats-in-t-bandi/articleshow/88552829.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Last week, the Thane Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) was first to take his custody from the Central agencies in Delhi. The 37th Metropolitan Magistrate SB Bhajipale on City Crime Branch’s plea, on Tuesday, allowed the production warrant for Pujari. Sources said that the City Crime Branch will soon be invoking the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) against the gangster in at least two offences out of the 15 for which he has been booked. The police want his custody for a maximum period so that they will have ample time to file a detailed chargesheet against him, the sources added. Besides, the police said there are ‘all ingredients’ of MCOCA – threats, organised gang and pecuniary gains – present in most of the cases registered against Pujari and his gang members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crime-branch-to-take-pujaris-custody-today/articleshow/88554630.cms||Ahmed Ali

Police have seized 3,245 mobile phones and electronic devices from them and they are being analysed for extracting data relevant to maintenance of law and order in the state, the details accessed by TOI show. Police have checked as many as 17,187 people who have a record of getting involved in such activities and raided 7,767 houses before making the arrests. As many as 5,413 people with criminal history were summoned to the police stations in connection with the crackdown on the anti-socials and goons. ADGP (law and order) Vijay Sakhare said that the police were periodically checking those with criminal antecedents. “It is an ongoing process and those with such records will frequently be checked and they will be under the constant watch of the police,” he said. Police have also cancelled as many as 53 bails for those who have violated the bail conditions, and arrested 549 people who were involved in body offences but were not arrested due to several reasons. At the same time, in just 29% of the total proceedings initiated by the police under the Section 107 of the CrPC (preventive arrest) have the executive magistrates issued the orders for their arrest. According to the data, only 187 orders have been issued though the police initiated 639 proceedings under the section. Police had created a special action group against organized crimes (SAGOC) in the state in all the district police headquarters on December 16. The SAGOC is being headed by a DSP of the anti-narcotic cell, who are being assisted by two officers of the rank of sub-inspectors, and 10 policemen, under the overall supervision of the district police chief. ADGP Manoj Abraham has been appointed as the nodal officer of SAGOC. The SAGOC is the supervising team for these operations in the district headquarters, while in each police station, one sub-inspector and two policemen are coordinating the activities of SAGOC. The anti-organized crimes cell (AOCC) is under the control of the SHO of the police station. As per the guidelines formulated for the functioning of the SAGOC, all those who have been involved in body offences will be arrested, and those who were involved in organized crime and goonda activities, will be monitored. Not only such people, but also their friends, accomplices and their places of gathering also will be monitored. If such people are out on bail, they will be closely monitored if they are violating any of the bail conditions, and the sources of income of such persons will also come under the scrutiny. Police have intensified the crackdown in the wake of multiple incidents of violence by goons being reported from various parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/7674-goons-held-in-10-days-in-state/articleshow/88560104.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Kolkata||70 new stations to monitor air quality in West Bengal||KOLKATA: Seventy sensor-based air and noise quality monitoring stations went live in Kolkata and rest of the state on Tuesday morning. Eighty more stations are likely to come up soon. WBPCB is setting up a Central Command Centre at its headquarters, where its team of scientists and analysts will study the data round the clock in real time to come up with comprehensive, actionable data for short- and long-term mitigation measures. TimesViewThe first step to making changes is having exhaustive data that will tell us why we need to make changes. This move will help in doing that. But there also needs to be policy changes and changes on the ground that will improve the city’s air quality. Winters, when more people love to spend more time outdoors, have turned particularly bad. We need to work on this.Operated by West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), these stations will provide real-time air and noise data, along with a couple of meteorological details, to make the network robust and intensive in the country. The sensor based monitoring will include PM1 (ultra-fine particulate matter), which will be used for research, as Central Pollution Control Board has not yet included PM1 monitoring in its mandate. These 70 stations are part of the ambitious ‘150 station project’ that WBPCB has taken up. Once the entire project is ready, it will be a network of 243 stations, including its 79 manual and 14 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS). “National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked us to monitor the air quality of all seven non-attainment cities Barrackpore, Haldia, Durgapur, Asansol, Ranigunj, Kolkata and Howrah. Apart from complying with the NGT order, we have extended the monitoring network, particularly along the border of the state. A recent study of IIT-Delhi showed 53% of the city’s pollution is contributed by trans-border pollution, 21% of it from Bangladesh. A massive amount of this pollution constitutes dust caused by erosion of farmland top soil,” said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra. During winter, he said, pollutants of the Indo-Gangetic Plain travelled easily to Kolkata, situated at the tail end of the plain. This is why the air quality monitoring along the borders helped us understand the dynamism of air pollution and underlined the requirement of a regional approach for its mitigation measures, he said. Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra said, “Climate change is no more a possibility of the future but is already at play at our doorsteps. We are getting affected by the delayed onset of seasons and longer inundation because of erratic monsoon. Police have a major role to play in containing social unrest induced by climate change. We have started making our force aware of the dangers of air pollution, noise pollution, climate changes, plastic waste and absence of waste segregation. We are trying to turn our academic campuses green and minimize waste generation by adopting segregation of wastes and composting.” WBPCB member secretary Roshni Sen said, “Air quality affects us all. We can’t escape it by confining ourselves to our home as several studies have hinted that indoor air is often worse than ambient air. We all need to work in unison to improve the air quality.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/70-new-stations-to-monitor-air-quality/articleshow/88552859.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: House on Badlapur highway that gives ue share of credit to stock market||Kalyan: No way you can miss noticing this house. It’s not so much the sleek exterior, it’s more to do with its unusual name. Called ‘Share Marketchi Krupa’, the one-storey villa with a marble facade at Badlapur is soon gaining prominence, growing into a landmark as it were, on the Badlapur-Karjat state highway. The out-of-the-ordinary name in Marathi means ‘Share Market’s Blessings’. Its owner, Mukund Khanore (31), a Badlapur who dabbles in shares full time, says he christened his house in thanksgiving to the bourse from which he reaped rich dividends and was financial capable enough to have it built. The house which measures 10,000 sqft has been built on an 80,000 sqft plot at Kasgaon and cost him Rs 3 crore. The swank-looking abode translates into a rags-to-riches real-life story of a man who, until some time ago, shared space with in a cooped space like most Mumbaikars — a one-room kitchen home measuring 300 sqft. Khanore used to stay with his wife and mother while his brother and his family liveds in a small room in a chawl. “Now, after I had this bungalow constructed, my brother’s family too has moved in an we live together under one roof,” says Khanore. Khanore says he learnt a thing or two about the vagaries of the share market at an early age. His late grandfather Shivlal taught him about how to gauge the mood swings of the bulls and bears and how to tread cautiously with investment. “I was barely 16 when my grandfather hand-held me and taught me a few tricks of the trade, beyond which I had to round them off with my own skill and judgement,” he told TOI. “It helped me a lot.” After completing his grad uation, Khanore cleared an exam of National Institute of Securities Markets. Eventually, he got in touch with Ramdev Agrawal of Motilal Oswal Group. “His market tips helped me earn a lot,” says Khanore. Not the one to keep financial success restricted to himself, Khanore now motivates others to try a hand at investing in shares through his YouTube channel. Initially, Khanore’s parents used to frown upon his share trading occupation and wanted him to take up a proper job, much in keeping with the typical middle-class mindset, he points out. “They thought all it’s a business of luck. So, earlier, they never really supporte me,” he points out. Today, ‘Share Marketchi Krupa’ draws the attention of many many zipping along the highway, some of whom even gatecrash out of sheer curiosity. “Yes, people have stopped by and even dropped in just to ask why our home has such an ‘ajeeb’ [strange] name,” he says. “Many of them have even stopped an even taken selifes with the house and its name in the backdrop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-house-on-badlapur-highway-that-gives-ue-share-of-credit-to-stock-market/articleshow/88554204.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Hyderabad||Revanth: BJP spreading religious intolerance||Hyderabad: Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy on Tuesday said the BJP government at the Centre was indulging in vote-bank politics while successive Congress governments had focused on welfare of the people. He was addressing the 137th foundation day celebrations of Congress at Gandhi Bhavan after hoisting the party flag. “While former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi empowered youth by reducing the voting age from 21 to 18 years, the BJP government has brought a controversial law to increase the minimum age of girls for marriage from 18 to 21 years. This was an attempt to intrude into the personal laws of different communities. The decision was unilateral and the Bill was introduced without consulting anyone, including nearly 80 women MPs in the Lok Sabha,” he alleged. Expressing serious concern over rising religious intolerance due to the politics of BJP and its allies, he called upon the youth to join Congress and play a crucial role in restoring democracy in the country. Revanth said the BJP, TRS and other parties who were questioning the contribution of the Congress in nation-building should read the history of India for the last 137 years. “It is the Congress vision that transformed India into a global leader on various fronts and an economic superpower. However, the country’s image and rank were badly hit after BJP came to power in 2014,” he said. He stressed on the need to pass the women’s reservation bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-bjp-spreading-religious-intolerance/articleshow/88552842.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Road ahead may be bumpy for AAP||CHANDIGARH: It will be interesting to observe the functioning of the newly-elected Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the expanded 35-member general house of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation in the days to come. Though the party has the maximum number of councillors, the 14 councillors neither have experience in municipal work, nor any significant political faces with political experience. Since the MC is facing multiple crucial issues like disposal of garbage, improvement in sanitation and cleanliness, proper management of solid waste of the city, issues related to income resources, budget scarcity, co-ordination with the Chandigarh administration and other civic issues, it will be interesting to see how new councillors help the MC through these challenges and provide better facilities and governance to city residents. Opposition political parties have already started raising questions over the promises AAP made during its long election campaign. On Monday, the Congress accused AAP of making promises which could not be fulfilled. Congress president Subhash Chawla said, “Given the false promises Aam Aadmi Party has made before city residents, they will have to face severe anger of the people as these are impossible to fulfil due to the nature of the city, which is different from states. Out of total promises in 99%, departments are not with the MC like schools, hospitals, transport etc. Only water is with the MC, which is again not possible to give free of cost as per law. There is an act through which MC runs in Chandigarh and nobody can go beyond that. Moreover, Chandigarh people don’t want freebies, they want facilities on affordable rates.” A senior AAP leader said, “Everyone comes to any profession, job or service for first time. All our elected councillors are competent enough to tackle and resolve all issues. They will also get guidance from time to time from the senior leadership of the party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/road-ahead-may-be-bumpy-for-aap/articleshow/88552860.cms||Deepak Yadav

This will be the first picnic spot in east Delhi with boating facilities, eateries, huge lawns, walking tracks, etc. “While work on phase-II is nearing completion, we have started preparing a request for proposal for the third phase. Only one concessionaire will run all facilities, including boating, food court, parking lot, booking of party lawns, meeting hall, open amphitheatre, as well as maintenance and security of the place. The revenue collected will be shared on a certain ratio,” said an EDMC official. The second phase included civil, electrical and horticulture works, such as constructing the administrative block, open amphitheatre, party lawns, tiling, installing poles, LED or decorative lights, planting shrubs and grass, decorations and grilles around the selfie points. A few works were pending due to payment not being released to the contractor. “Since the project was conceived under the AMRUT scheme, we were waiting for funds from the Centre. It was supposed to allocate us Rs 15 crore. Recently, the government released the remaining Rs 5 crore after which work was accelerated. At present, levelling work is being done in the amphitheatre and lawns. This will be followed by horticulture works. We expect to make the place operational by the beginning of April,” said the official. Entry to the place will be ticketed. “Considering it will be a huge green area in the middle of residential colonies, we are assuming that people will host parties or meetings in the lawns and meeting rooms. There will be ample surface parking space for around 300 vehicles,” the official said. The park measures around 32 acres, out of which the jheel is spread over 14 acres. For rejuvenation of the lake, a phytorid technology-based waste water treatment plant was developed under the guidance of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute in phase-I. “It is fully operational and is filling 6.8 acres of the lake with treated water with an average depth of 2.5 metres,”’ said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-starts-work-on-ph-iii-of-its-jheel-cum-park-project/articleshow/88553599.cms||Vibha Sharma

This idea has been inspired from Metro network where maintenance is carried out at night when train operations are suspended. A senior CR official said, “We have selected CSMT yard and stretch between Byculla and Dadar to implement this on pilot project basis.” In the suburban system, around 70 percent of disruptions are because of point failures. Point failures occur because of water logging, rail fracture, or muck coming in contact with the system. When this happens, trains cannot be diverted from one track to another. The points are also clamped to avoid derailments. An official said, “The present method of using a torch or providing lighting using a diesel generator has short comings because of insufficient brightness. Hence, we are going to install flood light which will focus on Points.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaicr-to-install-flood-lights-on-point-track-for-better-upkeep/articleshow/88554260.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: With Kulwant Singh joining AAP, Congress’s Balbir Singh Sidhu finds arch rival||MOHALI: The political scenario in Mohali has heated up with former mayor and Azaad group chief Kulwant Singh joining Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Azaad group members have sworn allegiance to Kulwant and assured him that they will support AAP. Declaration of Kulwant Singh as the AAP candidate from Mohali greatly changed the political dynamics of the constituency. MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu is already a Congress candidate from Mohali whereas BJP and SAD are yet to declare their cards. Sources in the BJP said that Sanjiv Vashisht was their likely candidate from Mohali. Meanwhile, when asked who they would vote for in the forthcoming Assembly elections, most people said while they liked Congress’s Balbir Singh Sidhu, this time, they would like to give AAP a chance. The remaining 50% was divided between Sidhu and Kulwant Singh. Now, Congress and AAP will have a straight contest between the two candidates with Balbir Sidhu eyeing his fourth stint as MLA Mohali and Kulwant Singh emerging as a major opponent. Talking to a section of prominent residents, TOI found that they were divided over Balbir Sidhu and Kulwant Singh but most wanted change. Jasdeep Singh said, “I like Balbir Singh Sidhu but this time, I would like to give a chance to the AAP candidate for a change.” Charanjit Singh, an RWA member said, “Kulwant Singh is the right choice as he has joined AAP and we would like to vote for him.” Kulwant Singh said, “Mohali will be made free of Congress misrule. During my tenure as mayor, we conducted maximum development works in Mohali and I have faith in AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal.” Balbir Singh Sidhu countered this saying, “Mohali residents have already proved that they have faith in Congress and Balbir Sidhu by voting us to absolute majority in the MC elections. Kulwant lost his own seat in his ward, losing his credibility and he has no chance in the assembly elections.” Balbir Singh Sidhu has won the assembly seat three times but Kulwant Singh has been confined to the corporation or council elections as councillor. Kulwant was candidate for the Fatehgarh Sahib constituency on the SAD-BJP ticket in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections but he lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/with-kulwant-joining-aap-congs-sidhu-finds-arch-rival/articleshow/88552873.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Jodhpur||How free cooking oil boosting Covid vaccination in Jodhpur||JAIPUR: Health department’s 'incentive' initiative to boost Covid-19 vaccination in Jodhpur, which was carried out with the help of a local NGO in Shergarh block that was lagging in vaccination, has proved effective. The department with the help of an NGO distributed one litre mustard cooking oil per Covid dose. In a single day, 15,000 litre of cooking oil was distributed. Now, the state government is formulating a scheme for giving fiscal benefits to panchayat samitis and other bodies that can help boost vaccination. "Some districts have taken incentive initiative to boost Covid-19 vaccination. At the state level, we are also formulating an incentive scheme to boost Covid-19 vaccination. Bodies such as panchayat samitis that help in scaling up vaccination will get fiscal benefits or incentives. We are working on the scheme and will soon launch it in the entire state," Vaibhav Galriya, secretary (health), told TOI. The government has set a target of vaccinating people with first and second dose till January 31. Collectors have been directed to plan at their level for the purpose. In the state, there are at least 87 lakh people who had received the first dose but have not turned up for the second dose. The health department is now going door-to-door to vaccinate them. In Jodhpur, the health department with the help of a local NGO distributed cooking oil to encourage vaccination. "We organized a mega camp for Covid-19 vaccination on December 10 in Shergarh block as the vaccination coverage in the block was not encouraging. With the help of NGO Youth Unstoppable, 15,000 litres of oil was distributed, one litre oil per dose. It proved successful and 15,000 doses were administered in a single day," said Dr Balwant Manda, chief medical health officer (Jodhpur). It is not for the first time the incentives are being given in healthcare sector. Some years ago in Pali and Jhunjhunu districts, incentive schemes were launched for encouraging couples to opt for sterilization and a car was also given at that time to the winner. In Mukhbir Yojna for preventing female foeticide, the government is providing sops to informers for giving information on people involved in sex selection, while in Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojna, the department is giving Rs 500 to healthcare workers or NGOs for helping five families in registration under the scheme.

NGT is expected to raise this issue during a meeting scheduled on January 6 with state officials in Chennai. The report has stated that the entire roadside distance where solid waste dumping was seen was about 200m from Alexander Parambithara Bridge towards Thoppumpady side.  It further stated that visible wetlands were seen near to this dumping area where there was every chance of leachate flow from this disposal. “It is also pertinent to note that environmentally fragile areas like mangrove forests are seen along the banks of nearby Kochi backwaters between Alexander Parambithara and Kannangattu bridges,” the report stated. The inspection was following a complaint filed by Nipun Cherian to KSPCB stating that there was dumping of solid wastes in the land owned by the Cochin Port Trust (CPT) near to Kannangattu-Thevara Bridge. KSPCB also issued notices to CPT after a field inspection was done initially by the surveillance squad of KSPCB regional office. Huge quantity of plastic waste was seen dumped in the land owned by the Cochin Port. It is understood that the land filling work is done by the contractor engaged by the CPT and the solid waste is seen spread over the land for land filling. KSPCB teams have found that the waste dumped was several months old and about five acres of land were affected due to unauthorized dumping of solid waste. The complainant has informed that the district collector and the latter intervened in the issue and made some trenches along the entrance of the site to prevent further movement of trucks dumping solid waste there. But removal of the same to safer places needs to be done immediately though authorized/scientifically constructed solid waste treatment plants are not available anywhere near. He alleged that officials and contractors of CPT were digging pits with earth mover, filling the pits with plastic and hazardous waste and covering it with soil. The plastic and hazardous waste was being dumped into the waterbodies in the property. KSPCB report said that FIRs are already registered with Harbour crime police station and Maradu police station regarding dumping of waste in the property at night by tipper trucks. Complaints are also filed against the CPT officials for filling of land and water with plastic, hazardous waste. KSPCB officials said that though dumping has stopped, the old waste in that area has not been cleared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pcb-report-finds-violation-of-solid-waste-mgmt-rules/articleshow/88552877.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Trial court shouldn’t order filing of FIR as a matter of rule’||New Delhi: A Delhi court has said that FIR should not be ordered to be registered as a matter of rule. Rather, the trial court should hold an inquiry before doing so, it added. The court further said that matrimonial dispute is one such category where the magistrate should proceed with a certain amount of circumspection. A woman had filed an application seeking registration of FIR against her husband for allegedly being already married to another woman when he married her. She claimed that her husband cheated her by not disclosing about it. She also alleged that the man raped her. A magistrate court had dismissed the application, following which she moved the sessions court. District Judge Deepak Jagotra said merely making a statement that her husband has married someone else would not suffice. “No document worth the name has been placed on record to prima facie show if respondent no. 1 (husband) had married someone else. The question of cheating would arise only when the revisionist is able to prima facie show that the respondent no. 1 has married someone else prior to marrying her,” the court said in an order on December 21. The judge then dismissed the revision petition. It noted that as a matter of fact, the woman knew that there was a relationship in the past between the alleged accused and some other woman and she did not come to know about this fact recently. It further said that it is clearly culled out by the Supreme Court that in all the applications filed seeking registration of FIR before the learned magistrate, it is not incumbent on the part of the trial court to give direction to the SHO to register an FIR if any cognisable offence is alleged to have been committed. “Trial court should apply its mind and having regard to the category of cases where FIR may not be required without an inquiry. FIR may not be ordered to be registered as a matter of rule rather the learned trial court should hold an inquiry before doing so,” it observed. Advocate Manish Bhadauria, appearing for the man, had argued that the fact that she had married him despite the fact that she knew that the accused and other lady were allegedly in a relationship, points to the inference that the accused had at no point in time married any other woman except the complainant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/trial-court-shouldnt-order-filing-of-fir-as-a-matter-of-rule/articleshow/88553614.cms||Usha Das

The noise grows loud given the steady flow of people visiting. One day, even a fight had broken out. One side of the wall of our complex has been damaged by these stalls, which have encroached on the pavement. There are a few cancer patients here and they often call me up, saying they cannot sleep due to the loud noise coming from the stalls. This has to stop,” said Subodh Biswas, a resident of Animikha housing complex in Action Area I. Raising Covid concerns, BF Block resident Swapan Ghosh, said, “Many of those visiting the stalls near the New Town mela ground do not even any masks. We plan to submit a petition to the authorities.” “The gatherings and shouting at the food stalls continue till late at night,” said Kingshuk Chakraborty, another resident. “Those running food stalls should at least follow rules and must not create problems for residents. We plan to stage a demonstration,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of resident forums in New Town. Residents said that they had objected to the roadside food stalls even earlier but not to much avail. NKDA officials said the process to rehabilitate roadside hawkers and vendors had been initiated. “The process has started to rehabilitate hawkers and food vendors in the stalls that have been set up across New Town. The late-night gatherings at the stalls is a law-and-order issue. If residents are facing problems, police should be alerted,” said an NKDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-residents-to-protest-against-food-stalls-on-footpath-ruckus-till-late-at-night/articleshow/88552890.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The Janakeeya Samara Samithi, which was active during the protest against the Madhav Gadgil report, will launch a series of protests in the coming days to exert pressure on the state government to dilute regulations for protection of Western Ghats and the action council has called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal in Kuttampuzha panchayat in the district on Wednesday as part of the first-phase protest demanding to exclude human inhabited areas in the panchayat from the designation of ESA.  The action council is alleging that hectares of human inhabited areas were included in the revised report prepared by the panel led by P H Kurien and it demands the government to exclude all human inhabited villages from the categorization of ESA. C J Eldhose, member of the action council, said that thousands of families living in the six wards of the panchayat would be directly affected by the ESA designation. Meanwhile, local leadership of the LDF is alleging that the protest is mere an eyewash as the state government has already approached the Centre to dilute the regulations. LDF convener of the panchayat committee K K Shivan says that the committee has already brought the issue into the notice of the chief minister and the protest is politically motivated. But the UDF is alleging that the LDF representatives had attended an all-party meeting convened by the action council to discuss the protest programmes, two days ago. In 2011, Gadgil had submitted a report classifying 64% of the Western Ghats into ecologically sensitive zones. But the government formed another panel under former Isro chairman K Kasturirangan and the committee diluted the recommendations of Gadgil panel and recommended designation of 37% of the Western Ghats as ESAs. Recently, finance minister K N Balagopal had approached the Union minister of ministry of environment, forest and climate change seeking to demarcate ESAs, excluding human inhabited areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/high-ranges-in-dist-to-witness-series-of-protests/articleshow/88552884.cms||---

Over 6,000 people, including beneficiaries of several schemes, are expected to attend the function. In 2020, the JMM-led coalition government did not observe its first anniversary because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials said the foundation laying for projects of various departments, including urban development, rural development, drinking water and sanitation, irrigation, road construction, building construction, ST and ST welfare, are scheduled on Wednesday. Rural water supply projects worth Rs 8,428.79 crore and the construction of 406 roads and two bridges, under the purview of road construction and rural works departments, at a net cost of Rs 3,034.94 crore will form the bulk of the foundation laying ceremony.

Meanwhile, the opposition, spearheaded by BJP, criticized the government for failing to prevent the “deterioration” in law and order and failing to deliver on its promises of providing employment to five lakh youths a year. However, Soren’s party, JMM, hailed 2020 and 2021 as landmark years in the state’s governance. JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, our government managed to distribute assets worth Rs 30,000 crore in the past six months and roll out landmark schemes such as Mukhyamantri Didi Kitchen, Sahay, Didibari Yojana and Sahay, which have been appreciated by the Centre.

---||Jaipur||Chittorgarh MP stops show glorifying Khilji||Udaipur: The tampering of historical facts in the light and sound show at the Chittorgarh Fort has raked up a controversy. The inaugural show that was virtually inaugurated by chief minister Ashok Gehlot was stopped midway by Chittorgarh MP C P Joshi, who objected to the content that glorified Allaudin Khilji and presented false facts about Rani Padmavati. Minister Udailal Anjana, who was present at the programme, said he did not find anything controversial in the script. "But I do respect Joshi's sentiments," he added. On Tuesday, members of different organizations gathered and protested against the script of the light and sound show and demanded correction of the historical facts. Many organizations have objected to some of the controversial scenes and voiceovers in the show. The scene depicting Rawal Ratan Singh accepting the offer of Khilji to see Rani Padmavati in glass was considered objectionable. Similarly, the dialogues related to the veneration of beauty of Rani Padmavati by Khilji's accountant were found to be objectionable. The inaugural light and sound show, which was projected at Kumbha Mahal in Chittorgarh Fort on Monday, faced the wrath of the minister and the public and was stopped midway in the presence of the ministers and administrative officers. Chittorgarh MP Joshi demanded that the state tourism department should immediately fix the script and nothing controversial should be included.

Akhilesh, while talking to media in Unnao, said: “The money that has been raided, the money that has come out… in the end, we will see that this money will come out of BJP only. At the same time, PM Modi is maligning perfume somewhere, defaming Kannauj which has given employment, business to so many.” The SP chief said, “BJP should tell from where it got so much money despite demonetisation and which banks did the work of giving money.” He added, “There is a BJP government in the Centre and the state, the government should tell how the notes reached on such a large scale. If the CDR of businessman Piyush Jain is taken out, then he will get relations with BJP leaders. The seizure of new notes in such a large quantity in the raids at the businessman’s place in Kanpur and Kannauj is a witness to the fact that the BJP government’s demonetisation failed completely.” The SP chief said that that the perfume trader who is being mentioned as belonging to his party is MLC Pushpraj Jain Pammi of SP. “And the person raided is Piyush Jain, a BJP man,” he said. Targetting Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Akhilesh said, “Yogi and saffron bearers do not tell lies, but there is no one bigger liar than Chief Minister Yogi. He also lied about the deaths due to lack of oxygen. This is a ruthless government. During the Corona period, when the public needed medicine, oxygen and bedding, this government could not provide it. This government has left the people orphaned. From Kanpur, Unnao to Ganga only dead bodies were visible. In this government, even the last rites of the dead could not be performed during the Corona period,” he said. “This government is laying the foundation stone and inaugurating the schemes of the Samajwadi government,” Akhilesh said. While congratulating the people of Kanpur for the Metro, he said: “If the SP government is formed, the Metro will cross the Ganga from Kanpur and bring it to Unnao.” He also promised to compensate the families of all individuals killed by bulls on roads if it was voted to power in Uttar Pradesh. “If a person dies in a bull-fighting accident, Rs 5 lakh compensation will be given by the SP government,” he said while also promising compensation for cyclists who die in road accidents. He said in the assembly elections, farmers, youth and traders will expose the lies by removing the BJP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/akhilesh-slams-bjp-for-linking-him-sp-with-perfume-trader/articleshow/88554223.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: SHRC orders Rs 5 lakh to man who was framed in narcotics case||JAIPUR: The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has issued directions in the case of Bhakaram Vishnoi who had appealed to the commission in 2012 for being implicated in a drug case following which he was also imprisoned for five months. He was arrested after cops allegedly found three litre of opium infused milk at his house. The commission taking all the reports into consideration, issued an order according to which Rs 5 lakh compensation is to be given to Bhakaram within two months. Following the appeal by 70-year-old Bhakaram, the commission had asked for detailed reports from the concerned authorities. During the investigation by the higher officers of the police, it was considered proved that prima facie the case had been made under the conspiracy by the police officers. The order also said that Rs 2 lakh have to be deduced from the salary of the then SHO of Jamba Thanai Sitaram, along with Rs 1 lakh each from salaries of other police personnel, Bhagwan Ram Kani and Karnaram Kani who were part of the conspiracy against Bhakaram.  “The officers were posted at the police station at that time for the protection of the general public, but by misusing their position and powers, they have conspired and conspired to violate the human rights of a senior common citizen, due to which he had to remain in police and judicial custody for five months. Therefore, in view of their conduct, it is recommended that the above three policemen should not be posted in any police station for five years in future,” said the order. It also said that the said compensation will not be based on any departmental inquiry/recovery and has to be paid within two months from the date when the order is received. Praising the officials who unearthed the conspiracy, the commission urged the state government to deliberate over awarding them as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shrc-orders-rs-5l-to-man-who-was-framed-in-narcotics-case/articleshow/88553620.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Woman who died seven months ago issued vaccination certificate||AURANGABAD: The health authorities in Aurangabad have issued a vaccination certificate to one 87-year-old woman who had passed away in May this year. This development has shocked the family members of the deceased woman, who was a resident of the Uddangaon village in Sillod tehsil. The elderly woman had fallen ill on April 21, and had remained under treatment at a private hospital for few days. She was later admitted to the Government Medical College and Hospital in Aurangabad city. She was found to be Covid-positive, and subsequently died on May 2. Suryabhan Patil, the deceased woman’s 42-year-old son, told TOI, “It has been seven months since my mother’s death. Surprisingly, we received a text message alert, informing us that she was vaccinated on the afternoon of December 18.” Patil, who is a farmer, clarified that about four months ago, he and his wife had taken their first dose of the Covid vaccine. They had taken the second dose in November-end. Patil said that he initially ignored the text message. However, later he noticed that the message was actually issued in the name of his deceased mother. He immediately brought the matter to the notice of the village sarpanch and panchayat samiti members. The local residents have now alleged that the health department could be opting for such tactics to meet vaccination targets being set for them by the state as well as the local administration. Sources said the health authorities have started a probe to check how the certificate was issued in the name of a deceased person. However, several calls made and text message sent to Aurangabad ZP CEO Nilesh Ghatne and district health officer Dr Ashok Gaikwad failed to get a response. In a somewhat similar incident, one Shaikh Qadir, of Jambhli village in Aurangabad, who recently had been to a vaccination centre for the second dose, found that as per the records, he had already received the second dose in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Qadir is still trying to get his second dose, but in vain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/woman-who-died-7-months-ago-issued-vaccination-certificate/articleshow/88551240.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The revised rates will come into force from January 1. The decision to revise the rates was taken by the zoos during the 149th administrative board meeting on December 15. The last time the adoption fee was revised was in February 2012.The zoos have seen far fewer visitors in 2020 because of the pandemic. This has led to a steep drop in gate collections through tickets. In order to maintain the zoo, buy good food and medical care for the animals, the zoo relied more on donations from animal lovers and donors. The Zoo Authority of Karnataka (ZAK) also launched the Zoos of Karnataka app to collect online donations and facilitate animal adoption.ZAK member secretary BP Ravi said that, considering the rise in medical, food and administrative expenses, the rates for donations have been revised.“Animal lovers can adopt any zoo animal for a year or even a single day by paying a fee,” he said.According to the revised rates for adoption, the slabs are fixed based on the species of animals which come under the diamond, gold, silver and bronze categories.

After right-wing organization Mysuru Rakshana Vedike expressed its support to Rangayana chief Cariappa a few days back, members of Kodava Samaja, Mysuru along with activists of Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, Mysuru Rakshana Vedike and other right-wing organizations held a protest near the DC office on Tuesday against the activists and left organizations who are demanding Cariappa’s resignation. The protesters initially gathered in front of Rangayana for the protest but moved to a spot near the DC office after police denied permission. One of the protestors said Cariappa brought discipline and transparency to Rangayana after taking the responsibility as director two years back. “He has been troubled by vested interest persons who are also disturbing the activities of the theatre. The government should immediately intervene in the issue and take action against the people who are working against Cariappa,” he said. Another protestor said those with vested interests are protesting against Cariappa and are causing damage the cultural city. “In the name of being progressive thinkers, they had tried to disrupt Dasara celebrations and are now trying to disrupt Bahuroopi. We condemn the Congress party which is supporting them,” he said. Protest against Cariappa Former Rangayana directors and artists, members of Dalit Sangarsha Samiti and other organizations under the banner Samudaya Karnataka continued their protest against Cariappa on Tuesday. As they too were denied permission to hold a protest near Rangayana, they protested at the entrance of Kukkarahalli Lake. Congress leader and former MLA MK Somashekar expressed his party’s support to the protesters. One of the protestors said they will protest in Bengaluru to inform the government about the developments. “We will soon release documents regarding the irregularities done by Cariappa. We will involve students in the protest and we will continue our protest till Cariappa is suspended,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/protests-for-and-against-rangayana-chief-continue/articleshow/88552097.cms||---

The decision was announced by the girl’s father, Jayachandran, here on Tuesday. The high court had on December 22 ordered the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh to the girl and her father. Jayachandran said that they were yet to receive the sum as they feel the government is likely to file an appeal against the court order. In case they receive the sum, a portion of the amount will be donated to the Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund and another portion will be utilised for providing educational aid to tribal students. This will be done through the non-profitable organisation, DISHA, which works for the betterment of marginalised communities. It was the volunteers of DISHA that stood by the family in their fight for justice. “Securing a compensation in cash was never our primary aim for approaching the high court. We wanted the state government and police to be held accountable for their apathy as their actions clearly showed that they were more concerned about protecting the officer. The court order proves that they were wrong,” Jayachandran said. The remaining amount will be used for his daughter’s education, he said. It was on August 27 that Jayachandran and his daughter were harassed by Pink Police officer CP Rejitha at Moonnumukku near Attingal. The duo had turned up to witness the movement of a giant machinery of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre along the national highway. The officer accused them of stealing her mobile phone from her official vehicle parked nearby. She even went on to frisk them in public and tried to take them to the police station. However, the phone was soon recovered from her own bag kept inside the vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/girls-family-to-donate-part-of-compensation-to-charity/articleshow/88552925.cms||---
---||Kanpur||PM asks students to opt for challenges and not comfort||Lucknow/Kanpur: Exhorting IIT-Kanpur students to opt for “challenges” and “not comfort”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that it was high time for the new generation of engineers to step up their efforts “to compensate for the time country wasted after attaining independence”. “Azadi ke baad 25 saalon tak humein desh ko apne pairon par khade hone ke liye prayas karne chahiye they. Lekin tab se bahut der ho gayi... Isliye ab humein ek pal bhi nahi gawana hai...kuch kar guzarna hai (For 25 years after independence, we should have made efforts to make the country stand on its feet. But since then it has been too late. Now we don’t have to lose even a moment),” he said, while speaking at the 54th convocation ceremony at the top engineering institute. His statement was seen as loaded with a covert criticism of the governments which ruled the country for years after independence. Modi also compared the IIT graduates with the youth who took part in Dandi Yatra led by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930 and ushered in a golden period 27 years later in the form of independence. “It is now your turn to take the country forward and make it self-reliant by 2047 when country celebrates its 100th year of independence. A country does not achieves complete independence till it attains ‘Atma-Nirbharta’,” he said, in what marked PM’s appeal to the youth to meet global standards. Modi said that the learning period spent by the students at the IIT have pruned them for a “larger canvas of growth”. At the same time, he stressed the students not to become a version of the “robots they created” but have human emotions to strike a balance between “professional and personal aspirations”, which was a “must for a complete life”. Drawing an analogy with the technical terms, the PM underlined: “There should not be password to share your joys with people.” Nevertheless, he added, the 21st century was a “technology driven” one and life without it was “incomplete”. Modi also lauded IIT-K for making significant contributions towards technology development. He categorically referred to the floating CNG station at Varanasi as well as the development of 5G technology and renewable energy for sustainable development. He pointed out that 50,000 start-ups have been established in India in the recent past of which 10,000 have been set up in the last six months alone, insisting that it has led to remarkable improvement in ease of doing business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/pm-asks-students-to-opt-for-challenges-and-not-comfort/articleshow/88554251.cms||Pankaj Shah

During the 2017 assembly polls, there were a total of 25 ghost villages in the six constituencies -- Almora, Dwarahat, Salt, Ranikhet, Someshwar and Jageshwar -- of the district. Additional district officer, Chandra Singh Martolia, told TOI, "How can there be an election when there is no voter. As these villages have no human population, polling booths will not be set up in these villages." When queried about the reason behind migration from these villages, district officials, requesting anonymity, said that lack of road connectivity, medical and health facilities remain the primary causes prompting people to move to urban centres. Observers say that migration has reduced voter turnout in the district. In 2017, none of the six constituencies could record even a 60% voter turnout. The highest voting percentage -- at 57.96% -- was recorded in the Almora constituency of the district. Meanwhile, according to official data, the number of voters in the district has increased marginally from 5,24,794 in 2017 to 5,31,600 in 2021. For the 2022 state elections, a total of 911 polling booths will be set up at 875 polling centres across the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/uttarakhand/news/ukhand-elections-no-poll-booths-in-almoras-87-ghost-villages/articleshow/88755146.cms||---

Till date, Mohali police has interrogated criminals Rohit, Amit Dagar, Kaushal Chaudhary, Sukhpreet Singh alias Buddha, Aman Jaittu, Bhupi Rana, Sukhjinder Singh alias Sukh and Navpreet Singh alias Navi, but the entire exercise was futile as the Middukhera killers are still at large. It was on August 7 when two assailants pumped 12 bullets into Youth Akali Dal leader Vikramjit Singh and now it is December 22, but the police has failed to arrest the killers, despite them being identified. The police had also named two gangsters, Amit Dagar and Kaushal Chaudhary, in the FIR but has failed to corroborate their statements even after days of interrogation. Now, the Mohali police is all set to interrogate Amit Dagar and Kaushal Chaudhary again, and the paperwork for the production warrant have been completed. Sources in the Mohali CIA said that at present, both are passing the buck over engaging shooters to eliminate Vicky Middukhera on behest of Armenia-based Gaurav Padial, handler of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Also, even though main shooters Sajjan Singh alias Bhola and ‘Khabbu Shooter’ have been identified, the Mohali police has so far failed to arrest them. On the other hand, the Mohali police have been maintaining that their teams are working day and night to arrest the accused. Mohali SSP Navjot Singh Mahal said, “We are on right trail of the accused and soon they will be arrested.” According to sources, interrogation of Kaushal Chaudhary had revealed the names of Sajjan Singh, alias Bhola, and Anil Kumar alias Latth, who killed Middukhera. Kaushal also told the police that he and Amit Dagar liasoned with Armenia=based gangster Gaurav Padial and gave the contacts of Sajjan Singh and Anil Kumal. Sajjan Singh alias Bhola belongs to Jhajjar in Haryana and Anil Kumar alias Latth is an active gangster in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/middukhera-murder-several-top-gangsters-questioned-but-police-yet-to-crack-case/articleshow/88552924.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Going to south Kolkata will be a natural option for the revellers,” said a joint commissioner at Lalbazar. Special squads of bike-borne cops from local police stations will be deployed in these zones, police sources said. In addition to regular night patrolling, cops-on-bikes will also keep tabs on potential hotspots like pubs to stop any nuisance. A senior officer said the security is being stepped up in an attempt to curb harassment, unruly behaviour, rash driving and drink-driving. Special emphasis will be given to stop biker gangs from plying in these areas. On the night of December 31, random checks of drivers outside pubs and eateries will be carried out with the help of breathalyzers to ascertain if any motorist is drunk. The southeast and south suburban division officers of Kolkata Police, said that like Park Street, other areas at Kasba, Survey Park and Park Circus, which have malls and restaurants, will see the deployment of cops from Thursday night. “Though we will begin deployment from Thursday, we are starting with eight officers on the rounds,” said an officer. “The New Year celebrations are set to begin early this year with the weekend coinciding with New Year Eve. So, we have decided to deploy women cops at all the important stretches. We will deploy cops in both uniform and plain clothes. For each stretch, we will have bike-borne strike teams to prevent any attempt to commit offence using bikes,” said an officer. Those manning eateries and pubs on Sarat Bose Road and Southern Avenue said they will remain in contact with the management and bouncers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-lens-on-new-party-zones-in-city/articleshow/88552942.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Slain YAD leader’s brother seek justice from Amit Shah||Times News Network Mohali: Slain Youth Akali Dal Leader (YAD) Vikramjit Singh alias Vicky Middukhera’s brother has sought justice from Union home minister Amit Shah, seeking speedy justice and security for the family. Ajaypal Middukhera wrote to Shah as there was no progress in the case 120 days after the murder of his brother. He requested Shah to get the investigation expedited so that the culprits could be arrested. In his letter, Ajay alleged that there was threat to the lives of Vicky Middukhera’s immediate kin. Ajaypal Middukhera said, “There seems to be hardly any action on the ground to nab the killers of my brother despite crucial CCTV footage of the assailants being available in the case. The least the system can do is bring the culprits to book so that justice is done and Vicky's soul is at peace.” He added, “I have written to the Union home minister to share our unimaginable grief and seek his help in getting the assailants arrested.” “The motive behind the murder is still unknown. We feel threatened. During me and family members’ visits to the police station and even to meet our advocate with regard to follow up in the case, we have an inkling that unknown people are following us,” wrote Ajaypal Middukhera in his letter. He also stated, “Subsequent to the brutal murder of my brother, who was in the prime of his youth, various hardened gangsters claimed to have executed the murder on social media. Many posts were also put up by them threatening action against those who will try to mess with them. This has made me and Vicky’s immediate family tense and fearful of a reprisal from these anti-social and criminal elements.” “We have made umpteen requests to local police authorities to secure our life so that we can fight for justice vigorously but in vain. With folded hands, I request you to kindly instruct your good office to help us in getting police security,” he wrote. On August 7, 2021, Mohali police registered an FIR against unknown persons on Ajaypal Middukhera's complaint. Though police are investigating the case, the motive behind the killing is unclear and no arrests have been made despite 120 days having passed after the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/slain-yad-leaders-brother-seek-justice-from-amit-shah/articleshow/88552927.cms||---

Chandra said an unique feature in the app was the colour coding of buses. “You can get the estimated time of arrival of any bus at any stop, and every bus has a colour code. A green colour indicates bus has seats available, amber means only standing facility is available and red colour means the bus is full,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1l-registrations-on-best-app-for-e-tickets-in-1-week/articleshow/88554270.cms||Somit Sen
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Parking banned along NH bypass||Thiruvananthapuram: Following a mad rush of vehicles on NH bypass on Christmas Day owing to people thronging the newly-opened Lulu Mall at Akkulam, the city police have decided to implement a blanket ban on parking of vehicles along the NH bypass stretch from Chackai to Kazhakootam. The decision has been taken as the unruly parking of vehicles on the shoulders of the bypass road was found to be the major contributor of massive traffic snarl on the stretch. A statement issued by city police commissioner Balramkumar Upadhyay said that it has been noticed that the disorderly parking of vehicles were not just causing traffic snarls but leading to accidents too. Hence, strict action will be taken against the motorists who park their vehicles along the bypass stretch. Considering there is a high number of commercial establishments, including prominent eateries, along the stretch, this ban is likely to give way for resistance from the local traders. A year ago, the district administration had to do away with a proposed traffic diversion at Kazhakootam junction to facilitate the works of the elevated highway following strong protests from the local traders. Deputy commissioner of police (law & order and traffic) Vaibhav Saxena said that the police are anticipating such resistance. However, they have decided to go ahead with the plan to impose a parking ban considering the safety of motorists as well as pedestrians that use the stretch. “There are provisions in the National Highways Act that bans parking of vehicles along highways. The city police are merely implementing these provisions. This is not a new law being introduced by the city police,” Saxena said. The DCP further said that the service roads on either side of the bypass stretch do not come under the NH Act. Having said so, the police will take strict action if they notice obstructive parking on service roads too, he said. With the city police bringing a blanket ban on parking along the bypass, the city corporation is less likely to go ahead with the paid parking along the stretch as part of checking unscrupulous parking. The corporation authorities said that apart from major city roads, only two stretches had earlier been considered for paid parking. Earlier, the traffic advisory committee had directed Natpac to conduct a feasibility study on introducing paid parking on Kumarapuram-Venpalavattom road and Pottakuzhi- Medical college road. However, the proposal never materialized. “On introducing paid parking on bypass, it would require a huge manpower. The returns from paid parking have been dismal in the last two years, especially due to Covid-induced lockdown. Viability of paid parking is a major factor when it is introduced on bypass because the length of the stretch is a key aspect,” said a corporation official. The corporation is more focused on pedestrian safety along the bypass. People are parking vehicles randomly on service roads and then they cross the road to the shopping mall. It is very dangerous because vehicles come at a high speed and pedestrian safety is a major concern, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/parking-banned-along-nh-bypass/articleshow/88552945.cms||TNN

The doctors from civil hospital attached to the medical college tested the students from a hostel block after one of them reported symptoms. Jitendra Dudi, the chief executive officer of Sangli ZP, said, “We have sent the samples of all the Covid-positive students for genome sequencing. Most of them are asymptomatic. We don’t know the exact cause for the spread. The students, however, do come in contact with each other while dining at the mess or staying at the hostel. We have asked the health staff to get the hostels sanitised and get all high-risk contacts tested.” The authorities suspect the infection could have spread by one of two ways. Either one or more students had come back with the infection after having spent time with their families, or they may have contracted the infection on coming in contact with Covid patients in the Covid ward of the attached hospital, said Nitin Kapadnis, the municipal commissioner of Sangli Miraj Kupwad Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/48-women-mbbs-students-of-miraj-medical-college-test-ve/articleshow/88551291.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: PM Narendra Modi links SP to recent cash recovery from Kanpur trader||KANPUR/LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday mounted a searing attack on the Samajwadi Party (SP) leadership linking it to the recent seizure of a haul of unaccounted cash from a Kanpur-based perfume trader, Piyush Jain. He said that those who take credit for all development project completed by BJP, should come forward to take credit for this corruption scandal. “2017 se pehle bhrashtachar ka itr jo unhone chhidak rakha tha wo fir samne aa gaya hai.. (The scent of corruption which they had spread before 2017 has emerged once again),” Modi said, while addressing a gathering after inaugurating the first leg of the Metro rail project at Nirala Nagar railway ground here on Tuesday. Piyush Jain was arrested on Sunday after raids at his premises in Kanpur and Kannauj led to the recovery of about Rs 257 crore in cash, 25 kg of gold and 250 kg of silver. The PM expressed “surprise” as to why the SP, which has been “taking credit” of every project, was “not coming forward in this case also”. “Par ab wo muh pe tala laga ke baithe hain...credit lene nahi aa rahe hain... (They are now tight-lipped and not coming forward to take credit for this also),” Modi said. He further added that “bundles of currency notes were the only achievement of the opposition”.  Modi’s attack on SP came two days after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed that Piyush Jain was connected to SP, a charge which the latter had denied. His sharp slavos, nevertheless, marked BJP’s unrelenting stance to corner the opposition on the issue of corruption ahead of the high stake UP assembly elections. This also comes even as the SP positions itself squarely against the saffron outfit to arrest its chances of returning to office after the state polls. Modi said that the political parties who had their “economic policies driven by corruption and giving patronage to criminals cannot develop the state”." “For previous governments, coming to power meant hitting a jackpot. They would then loot the state,” Modi said. Stressing that while law and order was the primary condition for industrial investment, the previous state governments let loose the web of “mafiawaad”, which led to closure of existing industries in the state. He asserted that people are very much aware how funds were swindled in the name of projects during previous regimes. “People who governed the state earlier never understood the importance of time. They wasted precious time at the start of the 21st century. Their priority was not the development of UP and its people,” he charged. He said that it was the “double engine government of the BJP” which was “compensating for the loss” the state faced. “We are working with double speed,” he said, citing the examples of the country’s biggest airport in Jewar, expressways like Purvanchal and Ganga expressway, country’s Rapid Road Transit System and dedicated freight corridor. “It is the double engine government of BJP, which knows how to fix big targets and meet them,” Modi said, asserting that timely completion of a project ensured proper utilization of public money for the benefit of the people. He said, earlier, piped water was not reaching crores of houses in UP. “Today, we are engaged in providing clean water to every household of UP through Har Ghar Jal Mission,” he added. The PM said, for decades, this situation prevailed in our country that one part was developed and the other was left behind. “At the level of the states, it is equally important to remove this inequality at the level of society,” said the PM and added, “That is why our government is working on the mantra of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas.” The PM also hit out at the opposition for having problems with every step the government takes to strengthen the society. “Which is why they are opposed to steps taken for empowerment of women. be it law against ‘triple talaq’ or increasing the marriage age of girls,” he said, underscoring that the opposition lacked “vision and target”. UP, which had earlier attained the dubious distinction of illegal weapons, is poised to have a defence corridor, he said. “Which is why people are saying ‘farq saaf hai’ (the distinction is clear),” he said, hoisting the tagline of the BJP election campaign. “This ‘farq’ (distinction) is not because of only schemes but also of the work culture,” the PM added. The PM said that before 2014, the facility of a Metro rail was available in only five cities in the country. “Today, UP alone has five cities with Metro rail facilities,” he pointed out. Quoting government data, Modi said before 2014 the total length of the Metro rail line in UP was only 9 kms. It increased to 18 kms between 2014 and 2017. “After taking Kanpur Metro into consideration, the total length of Metro in UP has grown to 90 kms,” he said. Connecting himself to locals, the PM said, “Today is Tuesday, and with the blessings of Panki Wale Hanuman ji, today another golden chapter is being added in the development of UP and today Kanpur has got Metro connectivity,” said the PM, adding that “Also, Kanpur is now connected to Bina Refinery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/modi-links-sp-to-recent-cash-recovery-from-kanpur-trader/articleshow/88554272.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Madurai||New bridges to ease Madurai’s connectivity||MADURAI: Completion of work on major bridges and railway projects in Madurai will make connectivity within the city and with adjoining areas better in 2022. Crossing the Vaigai from south to north is done through bridges in many parts of the city. Among them, the Kuruvikkaran Salai bridge between Aravind Eye Hospitals and Kamarajar Salai was an important crossing point. The route was blocked after Madurai Corporation decided to replace the causeway with a high-level bridge, one of the much awaited projects. The blockage has forced people to take a detour of more than three kilometres to reach the other side. Now, the new bridge is nearing completion and is expected to be opened for public use before the Pongal festival next year, according to corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan. S Arumugasamy, deputy commissioner of police (Traffic), Madurai city, said that traffic to both sides of the Vaigai will be eased after the completion of the Kuruvikaran Salai bridge. “Currently two bridges are under construction. Completion of even one bridge will be helpful in significantly decongesting traffic,” he said. The DC said that they have also undertaken studies and have given suggestions regarding various projects that can ease traffic movement. The Rs 545-crore Natham flyover project undertaken by the National Highways, which was stalled for some time after a worker was killed at the work site, is another important project that is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, according to the highway department sources. Madurai railway division officials are hopeful that the 91 km Theni- Bodinayakanur broad gauge line will be completed and trains would once again ply on the once busy metre gauge line that was closed a decade ago. Work has been completed for 58 km from Madurai towards Andipatti. The 17-km stretch from Andipatti to Theni is almost complete, but a power line crossing dispute has to be redressed. Once the stretch is clear, trains would be operated between Madurai and Theni, an official said and added that the 15-km stretch from Theni to Bodinayakanur is likely to be completed by the end of next year. Adding two more platforms to the Madurai junction to take up the number of platforms to eight is underway. Completion of the same with the yard works will reduce waiting time of trains and facilitate simultaneously handling more trains. A substantial portion of the broad gauge line doubling from Madurai to Tuticorin through Vanchi Maniyachi and from Vanchi Maniyachi to Nagercoil will also be completed, thereby reducing the waiting time of trains from Madurai to the southern districts and also increasing the speed of trains. On the new Madurai-Tuticorin line, the 18-km Milavittan-Melamaruthur section will be commissioned in January. Electrification of the 60 km Manamadurai – Ramnad section and the 89-km Trichy – Karaikudi section is expected to be completed by January and February, 2022. The New Pamban Bridge in place of the 107-year-old Pamban Bridge will be ready. Some of the passenger train services from Madurai that are yet to resume after the lockdown relaxation are also expected to be operated. Some major railway projects that will also be taken up in 2022 include the Rs 235 crore development works at Madurai Junction, which includes a subway from Periyar bus stand to the junction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/new-bridges-to-ease-madurais-connectivity/articleshow/88553715.cms||M K Ananth

---||Kolkata||NY party plans shift home after Omicron scare||Kolkata: Omicron scare, a third wave warning from medical experts and crowds at public places on Christmas Eve have prompted several Kolkatans to revise their plan for New Year celebrations and opt for precaution over partying. Many people have cancelled their outdoor plans at big parties on the New Year’s Eve and lunch or dinner on January 1 and shifted the celebrations to their houses. Some of them have also restricted the guest list to a few family members for safety. The government and health experts have been cautioning against mass gatherings and violating safety guidelines while celebrating Christmas and New Year. “Initially, we had wanted to attend an open air party on New Year’s Eve but later we changed our mind due to the recent development on the pandemic front. Everyday Omicron cases are rising across the country and doctors are advising people to avoid big gatherings. So, it will be wise to stay away from partying this time,” said Mrinalini Bose, a resident of Deshapriya Park. “Instead we will now be gathering at a friend’s place in Behala to usher in 2022,” she added. Many families, who have senior citizens or those with co-morbidities at home, have decided to restrict the celebrations among family members only. According to them, inviting too many people may increase the risk of contracting the infection. “We were invited to attend a friend’s party at a resort in Rajarhat. But we have excused ourselves because many other people will be attending it. We will be having a small party at home only with close family members since my parents are old and unwell,” said Sougata Dey, a resident of Convent Road. Several gated communities have urged residents not to invite too many people for New Year celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ny-party-plans-shift-home-after-omicron-scare/articleshow/88552946.cms||Zeeshan Javed

A Saravanakumar, a 51-year-old from Madurai city, started selling the books he had been collecting since the age of 17 three years ago. He had to sell his rare books to fund education for his son, who entered a medical school. “I sold nearly 4,000 of my rare books and realised that it was a good form of making some revenue,” he said. Before he started this, he was a librarian in Melamadai in Madurai. So far, he has been able to sell his books by putting up advertisements about them on social media. He puts up information about the books that he has and his regular customers contact him if they need it and he sends it to them through post or courier. Though he sells rare books, he keeps the price margins very low. His house in Madurai contains a library of 5,000 books and Saravanan said that he tries to keep the numbers constant by replacing the sold ones immediately. “I started collecting books from the age of 17 and my interest has not dipped even at 51,” he said. His hobby made him build a circle of 150 old book sellers in all the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. When something that looks rare comes to their collection as they get it from scrap dealers or paper vendors, they inform Saravanan. After exchanging photos, Saravanan buys the book that he finds interesting. The old book sellers usually price any book that is over 50 years old after print at Rs 1000 or more, and Saravanan sells it for a margin of 10%. His collection includes books like ‘Sathaga Chinthamani’, which was printed in the year 1890. “This book I do not share with others except its image, because, even opening it could break the pages, and no photocopy is allowed,” he said. A Tamil book -- America Makkalin Vazhkaiyum Panpaadum-- is another rare book printed in the early 1960s, which is no longer printed and was one of the first books in Tamil, which detailed about the life of people in America and was printed by the American Embassy, he said. A book written by the father of Tamil drama, Pammal Sambandha Mudaliyar, on the film industry printed in 1938 adorns his collection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-book-collector-turns-hobby-into-small-biz/articleshow/88553720.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Covid vaccination for kids in 15-18 year age group starts from January 1||CHANDIGARH: Covaxin doses will be administered to children between 15 and 18 years of age and registration for the Cowin portal shall open from January 1 onwards. Guidelines for booster shots are yet to be issued to the Chandigarh administration. These will be given from January 10 onwards. According to the list released by the Government of India, there are 72,000 eligible children in this age group who shall be immunised in the city. “We will decide on sites, which will be different from the existing ones for Covishield for adults to avoid any confusion. These will be all hospital based,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. As per the latest guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare, PGI will start administering Covid vaccine in the Advanced Pediatric Center to all children aged 15 and 18 years of age. The children will receive two doses of Covaxin at an interval of 28 days intramuscularly in the arm. Parents can register their children on the Cowin application using the Aadhar card. From January 10 onwards, all healthcare workers, frontline workers and the elderly with comorbidities will receive precautionary dose in line with GoI guidelines at LT -1 Nehru building, PGI. Director, health services, UT, Dr Suman Singh said, “Cowin system will send SMS to such beneficiaries for availing precaution dose when the dose becomes due. Registration and appointment services can be accessed through both, the online and the onsite modes.” After a 9 month gap of complete immunisation, booster doses will be given to these categories. “As as now, nothing has been communicated on which vaccine will be given for the booster dose. It may or may not be Covishield,” said the UT health secretary.“There will be a waiting period of 30 minutes after the vaccine. Children can also develop body aches and fever. They will be given paracetamol after inoculation. But vaccination is significant to protect them from the coming surge of Covid and all must come forward,” said Prof Madhu Gupta, principal investigator for Covovax trial among children in PGI. Vaccination for the adult population started in the city from January 16. Till date, 85% of the adult population has been fully vaccinated against Covid. Chandigarh has 31,374 frontline workers while there are 20,000 registered healthcare workers in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kids-to-start-getting-vaccinated-from-jan-1/articleshow/88552940.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Delhi||SDMC sets ball rolling on 2 puzzle parking lots||New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has initiated the tender process for constructing puzzle parking lots at Amar Colony and near Punjabi Bagh crematorium. The facilities aim to minimise chaos on roads. At Amar Colony, the parking will be constructed inside a community hall and aim to fulfil the requirement of the visitors, said an official. “Besides, there are so many markets in the neighbouring areas where parking is an issue. Shopkeepers and visitors coming to these markets can use the parking at their convenience,” said an SDMC official. The cost of the project will be Rs 14 crore and will take eight months’ time from the date of allotment of work. At Punjabi Bagh, the parking is primarily meant for visitors at Bharat Darshan Park next to the cremation ground, in addition to the cremation grounds. The park was inaugurated last Saturday. “We have invited tenders for the parking project after getting the House’s approval. It will be developed at the cost of Rs 32.4 crore. The contractor will be responsible for construction, testing, commissioning, operation and maintenance of the system,” said the official. Among the largest cremation centres in the city, the place currently can park 80-90 cars and the spillover parking often leads to traffic jams on the Ring Road. The new facility will be able to cater to 225 vehicles at a time and will take an year to be constructed. “Its tendering process will most likely start from next month,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-sets-ball-rolling-on-2-puzzle-parking-lots/articleshow/88553721.cms||Vibha Sharma

Operation Kaval is a special drive launched statewide on December 17 following recent political murders and gangland murders reported from different parts of the state. City police commissioner Balramkumar Upadhyay said that the police conducted 310 raids till Tuesday. “As many as 238 persons with criminal antecedence were taken into custody as part of preventive detention. All these 238 individuals were involved in crimes reported in the recent past and had a possibility of committing crimes again and hence preventive detention measures were initiated against them,” said the commissioner. A special team led by city narcotic cell assistant commissioner Sheen Tharayil has prepared a list of noted criminals, including goons and drug peddlers. Based on this list, the police checked the whereabouts and recent activities of 774 individuals. Among them, 12 were found to be active in crimes and hence action under Kerala Antisocial Activities Prevention Act (KAAPA) was initiated against them. Recommendations were forwarded to the district collector to detain them under KAAPA as preventive measure. Besides these, the police arrested 169 persons who were declared wanted by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/raids-detentions-to-check-criminals/articleshow/88552965.cms||TNN

Activist Mayur Hassija had filed the complaint after he received the video forwarded in a WhatsApp group named Madurai Blue Cross on December 22. It showed CCTV footage of a man picking up a big stone and hitting a stray dog lying on the road side on its head. Karimedu police had registered a case of animal cruelty and were investigating. On Monday night, Madhan Babu, who first shared the forwarded video, came forward saying he had found the place where it happened. The activist and police reached the spot in Karimedu on Tuesday and found the dog alive. “The dog appears to be affected by a skin disease. That could be why the man attacked the dog. There are no severe external injuries but the dog had breathing difficulties. We are trying to bring it to a veterinary clinic,” said Mayur. The CCTV footage recovered near the place showed that an hour after the man attacked it, the dog got up and walked away. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/attacked-stray-dog-found-alive/articleshow/88553722.cms||TNN

Conceding that the civic body requires funds to meet Rs 700 crore payment obligations to contractors, mayor Firhad Hakim said KMC will have to embark on a drive to augment revenue to correct the imbalance. Explaining the reasons behind the financial crisis, Hakim said the civic body had to spend extra funds in the past two years to combat the pandemic. However, the collection of property tax and several other revenue sources such as building sanction fees, trade licence fees and advertisement fees had dipped considerably as the pandemic resulted in an economic gloom. “It is true that we need to augment our revenue in order to take up development works for the citizens,” said a KMC finance department official. The official pointed out that the civic body has been facing severe economic crisis due to a drop in revenue generation and subsequent rise in expenditure to combat Covid-19 and fund social welfare schemes. Another civic body official said that efforts are on to cut down on expenses, which are not essential. “We may have to shun forced expenditure like beautification of different parts of the city, where there is no need for it. Now we need to fund major infrastructure projects like water supply augmentation and drainage refurbishment. Re-laying of some of the battered roads will also cost some crores,” the official added. The Kolkata civic body has reportedly been in desperate need to augment its revenue by collecting unpaid property taxes in large parts of the city. “A list of major defaulters is being prepared before we send notices to them, asking them to clear the dues,” said a KMC revenue department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-board-stares-at-financial-crisis-plans-revenue-drive/articleshow/88552951.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Mumbai||Air quality drops in Mumbai, experts stress maximum masking||MUMBAI: Air quality in Mumbai and Pune has plunged to the ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ categories, with both particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) crossing their maximum permissible limits in the two cities. The data was released by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s (IITM) System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).  With Covid-19 cases rising, health experts have alerted citizens to avoid exposure to pollutants as much as possible with sufficient masking measures. They observed that even short-term exposure to poor air could predispose a person to the infection.  Several international studies so far have linked air pollution to an increased risk of contracting Covid-19. A study from China recently stated that short-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 had a tendency to increase the incidence and mortality of Covid-19 than long-term exposure, while for other air pollutants, including SO2 and NO2, long-term exposure was more significant than short-term exposure. Track the pollution level in your city SAFAR readings showed that in areas such as BKC, Chembur, Mazgaon and Colaba, air quality plunged to ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ categories. The last 10-day PM10 and PM2.5 average concentrations in both cities showed pollutants to be above the maximum permissible limit on all days, with PM10 concentrations being twice the permissible limit on some days in Mumbai.  State Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “Covid is an air-borne droplet virus. Winter sees the incidence of pollution, fog and smog, all three together. There is a larger number of suspended particulate matter in the air in such a scenario, which increases the risk of transmission of viral infections via airborne droplets. Covid being an airborne droplet virus, there is an enhanced risk of its transmission as well during such environmental conditions.”  Other flu-like illnesses may also have higher transmissibility during such times when air pollution levels are high. “All winter respiratory infections increase due to pollution, fog and smog. That is why Covid peaks occurred in winter lands such as Europe and the US during the colder season. In India, it was just the opposite with Covid peaks so far being in summer. However, Omicron could reverse that trend due to its higher transmissibility. Hence, citizens must follow stringent double masking,” Dr Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/air-quality-drops-in-mumbai-experts-stress-max-masking/articleshow/88554278.cms||Neha Madaan

The meeting, which started at 4pm, was attended by BJP, Congress, Samajwadi Party, BSP, RLD and others and the discussions continued for two hours. BJP demanded deployment of women cops at each polling booth for verifying the identity of burqa clad women voters. BJP state general secretary J P S Rathore told TOI, “We raised three demands. First, to prevent multiple voting by an individual, we demanded proper verification of burqa clad women voters at polling stations and deployment of women constables at every booth for this. Our second demand was to ensure one polling booth for all members of a family. And thirdly, relocation of any cluster of polling booths in densely-populated areas to avoid mass gathering considering the corona pandemic.” The BJP delegation was led by state vice-president and MLC Arvind Sharma. Congress demanded removal of additional chief secretary, home, from the post before elections. “ACS home Awanish Kumar Awasthi should not be part of election management, he should be transferred before the model code of conduct. It’s in public domain that despite being a government officer, he retweets the tweets of Union ministers. He continues to hail PM’s programmes and government schemes by retweeting them,” Congress said in a letter to ECI signed by Onkarnath Singh, Virender Madan and Mohammad Anas Khan. Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) national secretary Anil Dubey said, “The ECI must provide a list of voters above 80 years and specially challenged to all parties.” Samajwadi Party claimed there are 40 lakh voters in the state who are above 80 years or are specially challenged. The BSP demanded strict implementation of the model code of conduct. CEC Sushil Chandra, election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey, and senior officers are on a three-day visit to UP to review preparations for the assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/party-panels-meet-cec-members-of-ec-share-concerns-demands/articleshow/88554311.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The couple already had two other girl children aged four and two. Police said M Kausalya, 23, wife of Muthupandi, 30, gave birth to a girl on December 21 at Sedapatti primary health centre and they were staying at their home in Periyakattalai village. On Sunday, the baby is said to have died suddenly and the family buried its body without informing any authorities. The couple along with their two children was also found be absconding subsequently. Based on a complaint from the village administrative officer (VAO), Sedapatti police registered a case under section 318 of IPC which deals with anyone secretly burying or otherwise disposing of the body of a child whether it dies before or after or during its birth, intentionally conceals or endeavours to conceal its birth. Police arrived at the spot and investigation is on to ascertain whether it could be a case of female infanticide. However, the body was yet to be exhumed on Tuesday. Police sources said the death could even have been due to an illness and the parents could have absconded fearing the police investigation. S Chandramouli, additional deputy superintendent of police (crime against women and children wing), said the exhumation of the body will be done on Wednesday by a team of doctors from Government Rajaji Hospital in the presence of the tahsildar. “The postmortem report will let us know the exact cause of death and we will proceed with further investigation accordingly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/parents-bury-infant-girls-body-abscond-in-madurai-probe-on/articleshow/88553742.cms||---
---||Delhi||Squatters in Kalkaji temple violate rights and interests of devotees: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has underlined that large-scale encroachments by dwellers at the Kalkaji temple premises violate the rights and interests of devotees who visit it. The court also refused to extend the deadline for encroachers to vacate the premises. “Primarily, the dharamshalas in the mandir premises are expected to be catering to the devotees who come from outside Delhi, and who may need temporary spaces while they visit the mandir for darshan purposes…a careful balance needs to be struck between the rights of encroachers, residing within a mandir premises, and using the spaces for commercial interests, like the petitioners on the one hand and the rights of the lakhs of devotees who visit the mandir. The dharamshalas within the mandir are not meant to be occupied permanently by shopkeepers, or their families running shops/kiosks in the mandir premises,” Justice Prathiba M Singh noted recently while declining relief to those being evicted. The court noted that the petitioners have been residing in the dharamshalas inside the temple premises for several years, ranging up to 40 years. “This is obviously without paying a single penny, in a mandir, which is run by the baridaars and other stakeholders with whom litigation is currently pending before this court,” it added. The court had earlier directed removal of encroachments and unauthorised occupants and shopkeepers, who do not have any valid legal rights to occupy the shops, from the temple in South Delhi. It had also appointed a retired HC judge as the administrator of the temple for performing various functions in relation to the religious place and an architect to submit a redevelopment plan for the temple and the entire surrounding complex. “The manner in which the shopkeepers have constructed their shops has created obstructions in the movement of devotees, as is evident from the photographs placed on record. For the purpose of the safety of devotees and others in the mandir, it is essential that unauthorised occupants/ shopkeepers/tehbazari holders/chabutara holders who do not have any valid legal rights to occupy the same are liable to be removed in coordination with Delhi Police and SDMC,” the court had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/squatters-in-kalkaji-temple-violate-rights-and-interests-of-devotees-hc/articleshow/88553734.cms||Abhinav Garg

Federation of Private Schools Association (FePSA) on Tuesday issued a statement urging the state government to not close down schools in the state especially for primary classes. “The government cannot completely close down schools again. Children have been impacted greatly by the closure of schools for more than one and a half years and are only now seeing some normalcy. In the case of primary school children, online classes have not been effective at all. Hence, for the sake of the children, schools should continue functioning,” said M Arumugam, state president, FePSA. He further said that while safety and health of students always come first, the government must consider stricter Covid safety protocol but keep schools open. Government school headmasters are equally concerned over Covid-19 safety but hope that schools are not closed again. “Many are wondering if schools may be reopened after New Year or not. Even if there is a case of Covid-19 reported in a school or there is rise in cases across the state, schools should not be shut down altogether. Schools can remain open in different areas depending on the situation and the student strength. For young children especially, they need to continue coming to school or their future will be at stake,” said the headmaster of a government primary school. Parents are also hoping that school routine will not be disrupted again. “Even though it is on a rotational basis, children are learning something properly through their lessons. If schools are shut again, children will be under immense stress, especially those with working parents like us who may not be able to properly ensure they learn at home. Even if classes are held only one or two days a week, schools must continue,” said N Nagarajan, father of a Class IV student from a government aided school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-parents-want-govt-not-to-order-closure-again/articleshow/88553728.cms||---

Among the new cases, three turned out to be passengers who have returned to the state from ‘at risk’ countries, while four landed from non-risk nations in the last three days. “There are three people among the Omicron cases who do have any travel history. The three include a lab technician, a software engineer and a pregnant mother. All the three are from Hyderabad,” said Telangana health minister, T Harish Rao. Authorities declared three more patients as recovered on Tuesday, taking the count of recovered patients to 13 so far. Four samples collected from RT-PCR positive passengers at the airport were sent for genome sequencing and another 13 previous samples are awaiting reports. Altogether, 165 passengers landed at the airport on Tuesday and 11,921 overall in December. Telangana also saw 228 new cases of Covid-19 cases and one death, taking the total number of active cases in the state to 3,459. On Tuesday, 185 Covid-19 patients were declared recovered on Tuesday, taking the total count of recovered patients to 6.73 lakh. Health authorities said 41,678 samples were tested for the novel coronavirus on Tuesday.

Some of them have decided to celebrate in Goa. For example, Vikram and a group of friends have booked a beach villa to welcome the new year. “The restrictions were expected, and hence we had planned in advance and booked a beach villa. This is much better than going to watering holes which have restrictions on occupancy, and have to close shop by 10 pm. Since it is going to be a private party, we now need not worry about the restrictions,” said Vikram, a private firm employee. Like Vikram, many have decided to welcome the New Year at beach villas, resorts or homes. “It was a ritual to go to a watering holes, party till midnight and return home on New Year’s Eve. However, after the outbreak of Covid, it has not been possible due to the restrictions. We have decided to celebrate in our house, by inviting friends and family,” said Aaron D’Souza, an entrepreneur. “The best thing about celebrating in your house, is that there is no risk of drinking and driving,” he said There are many who want to celebrate away from home, and have decided to head towards Goa. “Last New Year it was in Goa, and this year too. We have been frequenting Goa more often due to the restrictions,”said a young couple, who wished to remain anonymous. Those in the travel business confirmed that people have started booking tickets for Goa for New Year celebration. “There are restrictions in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi and Kerala. The most preferred destinations for revellers and those on holiday, is to travel to Goa by road. Some are going to Jaipur and other cities, that don’t have restrictions,” shared a source from the travel industry. Those in the food and beverages business are upset with the decision. “It is not only about the 50% occupancy guideline, the 10pm deadline will cause a huge dent on the business. Patrons start coming to hotels only after 9 pm,” criticised a hotel owner, adding that the industry has sustained enough losses due to lockdowns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/people-to-celebrate-privately-in-goa-due-to-curbs-for-nye/articleshow/88552165.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Kolkata||Help on app, hawker-citizen conflict on Hakim 2.0 mind||Kolkata: Firhad Hakim, in his second stint as the mayor of Kolkata, has decided to adopt modern technology to improve citizens’ services and resolve the age-old conflict between pedestrians and hawkers. Streamlining hawkers, Hakim said, was also important for the city’s image that was sullied by the visual pollution as well as the hazard that stalls covered with grimy plastic sheets. After taking oath as the Kolkata mayor at the civic headquarters on Tuesday, Hakim said KMC was determined to end citizens’ hassles by giving them an opportunity to apply for essential services, like building plan sanction, water connection, drainage connection and birth and death certificates, through an integrated app service. Moreover, the civic body will offer motorists an app-based service to book parking slots across the city. This new system aimed at ending extortions at car parking lots, the mayor said. According to a KMC official, the civic body has introduced a single-window system for building plan sanction. The KMC health department has also developed an app-based service for issuance of birth and death certificates. “We have to develop a system that will integrate these apps and add more options, like granting water and drainage connections, so that citizens can use a single app for multiple civic services,” the official said. Encroachment of the city’s pavements by hawkers was a hurdle to making Kolkata beautiful, said Hakim. “The same old, worn-out plastic sheets are seen over pavements in hawking zones and that’s a shame. We will encourage hawkers to adopt the Bangkok model, where hawkers use decorated stalls on a portion of pavements. I have declared a cash prize of Rs 1 lakh for a group of hawkers who will do business without using plastic sheet,” he said. The KMC will state ‘Show It To Your Mayor’, under which citizens can message Hakim their grievances, along with photos, on 9830037493. The new civic board also aims to reduce air pollution by planting saplings and trees wherever they get space. The civic brass also plan to procure more mist cannons to water various areas, including the city’s central business district, to cut down down on pollution, especially during winter. “From CBD area to residential zones, we shall use these cannons to reduce air pollution,” Hakim said. City’s highly dilapidated buildings were still posing a major threat to public life, conceded Hakim on Tuesday, adding the KMC now was bent on acquiring dangerous structures, by enacting a new law to save the lives of the residents there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/help-on-app-hawker-citizen-conflict-on-hakim-2-0-mind/articleshow/88552975.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Goa||NIO scientists push for geo-engineering to enhance Arabian Sea’s iron levels||Panaji: There is so little iron in the ocean that even a bit of rust from an iron-made ship significantly throws measurements off. To avoid any such contaminations, scientists from the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) studied samples of seawater from the Arabian Sea and found that a large part of it in the south and northwest are iron-deficient, leading to lower productivity. To remedy the situation, they have suggested seeding the waters of the Arabian Sea with an ample amount of iron to enhance its biological pump, thereby increasing its capacity to sequester atmospheric CO2, which will help diminish the atmospheric CO2 levels introduced into the biosphere. This geo-engineering, they said, would also enhance biological productivity, leading to an increase in fish production. As a part of the Geotraces-India initiative, a major oceanographic programme supported by the Union ministry of earth sciences, dissolved iron-cycling in the Arabian Sea and subtropical gyre region of the Indian Ocean have been studied. “The new study highlights the discovery of very high dissolved iron concentrations emanating from the hydrothermal vents in the water column over the Carlsberg Ridge in the southern Arabian Sea that can be a hotspot for other trace metals too. It is surprising to observe hydrothermal-sourced iron in the shallow water depth,” said researchers Chinni Venkatesh and Singh Sunil Kumar. The latter is also the director of the NIO. Another very important finding of this study is the dominant supply of dissolved iron from the continental shelf or slope sediments in the Arabian Sea region, while atmospheric soluble iron dust flux — which was considered the main source of iron prior to this study — plays a secondary role. The perennially oxygen-deficient intermediate waters of the Arabian Sea source a significant amount of iron. The researchers sampled the seawater with specially designed metal-free sampling gear and processed them in a metal-free, clean laboratory installed onboard an ocean research vessel. The instruments used to detect iron onboard or at a shore-based laboratory are highly sensitive to minor fluctuations of the order of nano-molars in seawater. Dissolved iron in the Arabian Sea supplied by various sources are getting removed equally by biotic and abiotic processes. The integrated dissolved iron in the sun-lit region is double in the Arabian Sea compared to the subtropical Indian Ocean, which is responsible for the higher primary productivity in the Arabian Sea. “The intrusion of southern ocean waters and upwelling of iron-deficient deep water alongside the Murray Ridge both likely cause iron limitation in the Arabian Sea,” the study reads. “In a current alarming situation of global warming and climate change, our scientific results insight a solution to mitigate the abundance of the greenhouse gas, CO2. Our findings suggest that seeding the waters of the Arabian Sea with an ample amount of iron can enhance the biological pump and can increase the capacity to sequester atmospheric CO2 through primary production (conversion of atmospheric CO2 to organic carbon). This process will diminish the atmospheric CO2 levels introduced into the biosphere by anthropogenic activities, which will also take care of the ocean acidification problem,” the researchers said. They added that a decrease in the pH levels of surface oceans will lead to ocean acidification if the climate change problem is left unattended. “Geo-engineering, such as iron-seeding in the Arabian Sea, will enhance biological productivity, leading to an increase in fish production and stimulating the fishery-based economy of almost 14 million dependent people,” the study suggests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nio-scientists-push-for-geo-engineering-to-enhance-arabian-seas-iron-levels/articleshow/88553800.cms||Nida Sayed

They invited PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu to accompany them to AICC headquarters on December 31, 2021 under the “Delhi Chalo” programme announced by PFUCTO. Protesting teachers said that since the Punjab government failed to fulfill the longstanding issues of university and college teachers despite repeated assurances, teachers were left with no option but to meet Rahul Gandhi to remind him of his upkept promise of implementing the 7th UGC pay scales. They said he made the promise to gen secretary, AIFUCTO and general secretary, PFUCTO in 2018. As teachers raised slogans pressing their demands, PPCC general secretarty Joginder Pal Dhingra met them on behalf of Navjot Singh Sidhu and assured them that their issues would be resolved soon. Thereafter, he called higher education minister Pargat Singh. PUTA vice-president Prof Supinder Kaur reminded Pargat Singh about the demands of teachers. Dhingra then accompanied the PUTA delegation to meet deputy CM O P Soni to apprise him about the issues. Soni assured the teachers that he would take up the matter during the cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday. Talking to TOI, PUTA secretary Amarjit Naura said, “We have started this protest after a long wait of months but when nothing happened and our demands were unheard, we were forced to go for ‘Education bandh.’ It is very unfortunate that nation builders are fighting for their rights. Now, we plan to move to Delhi and see what happens next.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/teachers-approach-sidhu-dy-cm-to-press-demands/articleshow/88552953.cms||---

Of these, nine are from Thanjavur, he said. “The craftsmen should get the required certificates from all the concerned departments for exporting their products. Unlike earlier, an exclusive portal has been developed online where craftsmen can market their products all over the country. They can easily sell their products across the globe. So, the artists should utilize the present opportunity in the right way,” he added.Compared to other districts in Tamil Nadu, Thanjavur has a number of craftsmen. The government should launch a guidance centre for exporting their products in Thanjavur. When the Union government presents mementos to artists who get national awards, they should present handicraft products with a GI tag, he added.Addressing the event, deputy director of Federation of Indian Export Organisation (southern region) Selvanayagi said Thanjavur is famous for ancient handicraft products. However, the commercialization of these traditional artworks is challenging. Government of India and state governments provide several programmes to assist this sector by giving exposure to them and highlighting the potential of this sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/thanjavur-should-be-made-export-hub-for-gi-tagged-products/articleshow/88553743.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana injects hope with mammoth shot in Covid vaccination drive||HYDERABAD: Started on January 15, the first Covid- 19 vaccine drive took 347 days to reach 100% coverage of the state’s 2.77 crore eligible population. More than 80,000 doses have been administered daily on an average, except for the days on which there was limited vaccine supply. In terms of how the vaccine drive went, health minister T Harish Rao stated that while 87% of the vaccine drive took place in government centres, the remainder took place in private centres. Nearly 10,000 vaccinators worked overtime to complete the vaccine drive, and 35,000 members of the health care team were involved in the massive drive. Approximately 7,970 teams were deployed to go door to door to find people who had not received the vaccine and administer it. There were 3,500 government vaccine centres and 2,064 private vaccine centres in the state. According to health experts, more efforts at the district level are needed to ensure 100% second dose coverage. “Vaccine wastage in the state is very low, and there has been effective use of available stocks. The drive was made possible by good cooperation between the public and private sectors,” said Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, centre director, health care management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). By the end of the first dose coverage, the state had less than 0.05% vaccine waste. The health minister said vaccine drive efforts have been stepped up following the involvement of line departments such as municipal administration and panchayat as a staff has actively convinced people in rural areas to take the vaccine. “The Centre has decided on a target population of 2.77 crore based on projected population taking the 2011 census into account,” he said. The state had a stock of 30 lakh doses to continue coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-injects-hope-with-mammoth-shot-in-vax-drive/articleshow/88552959.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Madurai||Madurai: Cop gives tea, advice to make drivers on highways stay alert||MADURAI: The last thing that drivers of trucks, vans and buses travelling on highways bordering Madurai district expect is being stopped by the police, especially at night. However, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) S Sekar is looking to change that mindset as he patiently provides tea and water to refresh drivers before putting in a few words of advice to drive safely as well as keep them alert on their late night journeys. Sekar, who is the DSP, anti-land grabbing special cell, said he had started this initiative when he was posted in Tirunelveli district. “In Madurai, I have been doing this since March this year one day a week whenever I’m on late night duty near any highway junction like Kodikulam or Paravai junction. More often than not, truck drivers feel intimidated and are apprehensive when the police stop them. I wanted to try and change that,” he added. The cop waves at any van, truck or bus on the highway to stop and provides the drivers with water to wash their face to refresh themselves, hands them tea and even a mask if they don’t have one. “I engage and talk to the drivers as well to help relieve some stress and enquire about their families. Accidents happen mostly during the night, especially between 12 am and 3 am. Even without knowing, drivers get sleepy but having tea and washing their face refresh them. I give them advice to drive safely too,” said Sekar. The DSP also creates awareness about the police helpline number and use of Kavalan SOS App among the drivers. He drapes drivers who have all safety tools in their vehicle with a towel which says “My Friend - Madurai City Police”. The cop’s efforts have won him praise from drivers and the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cop-gives-tea-advice-to-make-drivers-on-highways-stay-alert/articleshow/88553750.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The team has also discovered a stone replica of an impalement device (Kazhumaram) used in the previous centuries to torture and execute people. The Pudukottai archaeology research forum conducted a study on the stone sculpture discovered by the students. The sculpture measuring 84 cm in height and 54 cm in width was identified to be that of Mahavira also known as Vardhamana, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism. The sculpture was found abandoned near a village temple at Iraiyur village near Keeranur.  The sculpture of Mahavira is seen meditating with a tree in the backdrop. A portion of the sculpture has eroded due to wear and tear over the centuries, yet some of the features of the sculpture are still intact and unique, the archaeology forum said. The sculpture was identified by S Mariammal, S Rangaraj, R Priyanka and S Lokeswaran, all students enrolled in the Master of Arts in History in Bharathidasan University. Accompanied by A Manikandan, a research scholar in Tamil University and other members of the forum, the team found a square shaped Siva Lingam, stone sculpture of Nandi and a stone replica of an impalement device.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bdu-students-discover-10th-c-jain-sculpture-in-pudukottai/articleshow/88553758.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Lawyer, brother pose as IAS officers, held||RAJKOT: A lawyer and his brother from Chhatisgarh were arrested for posing as IAS officers to seek VIP treatment while visiting Somnath temple in Gir Somnath district on Tuesday. The accused were identified as practicing advocate Sharad Pande, a resident of Korba district in Chhattisgarh and his brother Ravi Pande. According to police, Sharad called up Gir Somnath collector and sub-divisional magistrate identifying himself as a deputy secretary of law in Delhi on December 26. Sharat told the collector that a high court judge, who will soon be promoted to Supreme Court and two advocates were coming to Somnath temple. He asked the collector to make arrangements for VIP rooms, protocol officers and vehicles. Sharad also made a similar call to the sub-divisional magistrate Saryu Zankar. However, when there was no message from Gandhinagar, Zankar got suspicious and informed the police. On investigation, police came to know that Sharad, along with his brother Ravi and judicial magistrate first class (JMFC), Korba, Anjali Singh had come to Gujarat. They had boarded a flight from Raipur to Ahmedabad and also asked DCM railways to arrange rooms in the railway guest house. Sharad and Ravi had visited temple town Dwarka and there too they had introduced themselves as IAS officers. Assistant superintendent of police Gir Somnath, Om Prakash Jat, told TOI “After getting information from Dwarka police, who had found the accused to be suspicious, we booked the room for them. We also called them to inform them that all arrangements had been made as per protocol. When they came, we asked for their ID card but they refused to show it. During the interrogation, they admitted to their crime.” Sharad and his brother Ravi were booked under IPC section 170, 419 and 114, while no case could be filed against Anjali Singh as she did not call anybody and did not show fake identification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/chhatisgarh-lawyer-brother-held-for-posing-as-ias-officers/articleshow/88553004.cms||---

Locals said that they are choosing less preferred locations to avoid crowds on New Year’s Eve, giving themselves a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. “We will be spending New Year’s Eve at Laknavaram,” said M Vinod, who will be going to Warangal on December 31 with his family. Vinod said that he will also be visiting other famous places nearby — Ramappa Temple, Bhadrakali Temple, Bogatha waterfalls, among others, and will return to the city on Monday morning. K Tulasi Ram, a resident of Vanasthalipuram, said that he will be visiting Yadagirigutta with his friends on New Year’s Eve. “In the city, even a small pub or hotel is charging about Rs 3, 000 to Rs 5,000 per person. So, five of us decided that it makes more sense to spend the day on the outskirts of the city. We will return to the city on January 1 after darshan,” he added. Many have also made plans to stay close to nature preferring trekking and safaris instead of partying in the city. “We will be at a tiger reserve in Telangana on New Year’s Eve. A group of eight families will be going there and we will be spending the weekend in the forest,” said Ganesh M, a private employee. Some even took to Twitter to share their travel plans. “Planning to start the New Year, with a longish road trip.

---||Lucknow||Modi has given Kashi a modern outlook: Thakur||New Delhi: Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur said on Tuesday Prime Minister Narendra Modi has saved the ancient heritage of Varanasi while giving it a modern outlook. Speaking at the closing ceremony of the three-day inaugural Kashi Film Festival after a BJP campaign rally in Ballia, Thakur complimented the UP government for hosting the festival and said there is no better place to host it than the oldest living city of the World. “Kashi is as ancient as it is modern. It has roadways, highways, airport and ports. This is clearly a place where content is easily available. I have come here before 2014 as well and I have seen Kashi change. Many new things have been added. After the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor, people are finding excuses to come here. Without disputes Modi not only saved and restored the ancient heritage of Kashi, but also delivered on his development promises,” Thakur said. The I&B minister also took potshots at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress, saying that the Modi government built the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Temple corridor even as the opposition parties were still raising slogans asking BJP to “name a completion date” for the projects.  “I challenge Akhilesh Yadav to show us one work they completed fully in their own regime. From the Rs 9,000 crore Saryu Sinchai Yojana to the Ken Betwa Link for Bundelkhand, we has delivered development. As for action being taken against corrupt people, I want to ask why Akhilesh Ji is feeing the pain when a corrupt ‘itr’ (perfume) trader is acted against,” Thakur said, referring to the recent ED raids against certain persons. Thakur also promised to strengthen the National Film Development Corporation to help young talented film makers create content. He also said his ministry will make India the content sub-continent of the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-has-given-kashi-a-modern-outlook-thakur/articleshow/88554325.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Fractured Dreams’: Translating life experiences into sculptures||Thiruvananthapuram: Artist V Satheeshan’s solo sculpture exhibition at Museum auditorium titled “Fractured Dreams” evokes the memories from his childhood, regressions in life and myriad experiences. His one such experience has paved the way for his journey as a sculptor. Satheeshan had started making sculptures at the age of 10, when he saw his friends playing with various toys. As his father could not afford to buy toys for him, young Satheeshan started making toys for himself with clay and wood. Despite many discouragements, he succeeded in his career as a sculptor who portrayed real life scenes. He even discontinued his job to give more time to making sculptures. A total of 18 sculptures are on display at the solo exhibition and sale organized at the Museum auditorium. The sculptor was so happy to revive his life incidents and his creations are made with bronze. One of the works titled “recapitulation of a dead romance” is a tribute to lost love. The sculpture is featured in such a way that a man stands on the floor carrying a woman with butterflies. Here, the man standing on the floor symbolizes the realization of the situation and the woman as in an imaginary world with butterflies. Another sculpture, “I am not alone” is based on a situation where he slept on the railway platform and found a bird nesting on the platform. That moment he realized that he is not the only one, but there are so many other creatures that shelter in random places due to their situations. Other sculptures, including “nest”, “reason to live”, “refugees”, “journey two” and “journey six” are also remarkable. “I quit my job in order to give my hundred percent to my sculptures. It takes more than six months for me to complete a sculpture. The materials are also expensive. I have even taken a loan to buy the materials. The only thing that I have invested in my life is my sculptures. I am receiving a stipend from the central government for senior fellowship,” said the artist. The expo is being organized by the Kerala Tourism department and will continue till December 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fractured-dreams-translating-life-experiences-into-sculptures/articleshow/88553028.cms||---

Soon after the problem was aired by a citizen reporter, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) authorities swung into action and fixed it, leaving dozens of residents relieved.  Residents of Snehapuri Colony were troubled with constant overflowing of sewage water on the road. The sewage water was not only emanating foul smell but was also making it difficult for commuters to travel on the road.  "For almost two weeks, the sewage water was continuously overflowing on the road. There was no response to the complaints raised by several residents. It was only after the grievance was aired on TOI's citizen reporter app that the authorities quickly attended to the matter," said V Sandhya, the citizen reporter.  The authorities reached out to the citizen reporter and assured her that the problem will not persist.  "There is a pipeline that runs right through the centre of the road. A joint of that pipeline was damaged resulting in leakage and overflowing of sewage. We had to undertake an excavation of almost six feet to be able to fix it," said Jan Shareef, general manager, operations and maintenance, division 14, HMWS&SB, adding that the excavation work overnight resolved the problem completely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/habsiguda-road-cleared-of-sewage/articleshow/88552989.cms||---

They eventually saw the 5am flight take off. One of the stranded passengers, Baby Koerie, who works as a domestic help in Mumbai and had borrowed Rs 7,500 from her employer to buy the air ticket so that she could attend her mother’s funeral, could not reach on time due to the bungling. Despite repeated pleas by her and requests from other passengers, who were stranded, to put her on a flight operated by another airline, the GoFirst ground staff remained unmoved. The passengers finally reached Kolkata via Bengaluru around 2.30pm instead of 7.30am. Veterans in the industry termed the incident as bizarre but admitted it exposed a loophole in the boarding system. While a headcount used to happen at the step ladder point earlier, that has been done away with. Now, passenger tickets are scanned at the bus gate. Thereafter, passengers are deemed to have boarded the flight. “The pilots or cabin crew weren’t even aware that the five passengers weren’t on the flight. There was clearly a communication gap between the ground staffer, who manages passengers boarding the bus, and the driver,” said a veteran airline official. A Go First spokesperson said the concerned employee has been taken off duty/suspended pending investigation of the incident. “Go First has a zero-tolerance policy and it is mandatory for all employees to comply with the company’s rules, regulations, and policies,” the statement read. Kavya Sarkar, who along with colleague Subhangi Agarwal, was one of the five left behind by GoFirst flight G8 511, said they had reached the airport at 3.15am, completed check-in, security check and boarded the bus around 4.15am. “The previous bus was packed. So, we boarded the next bus. Thereafter, the wait was endless. I approached the driver three times to point out that we were getting late but he kept insisting that more passengers were awaited and that the flight would not depart,” Sarkar said. Koerie, who was desperate to see her mother before the cremation, began crying. “I just couldn't believe my rotten luck. I was paying a fortune to get a last glimpse of my mother but that opportunity was denied as we were held up in the bus that just didn’t move,” sobbed Koerie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flyers-to-kol-stranded-on-mum-airport-bus-for-45-minutes-see-flight-take-off/articleshow/88552996.cms||Subhro Niyogi

There are 62 Omicron cases so far in the state, including the seven reported on Tuesday. Till now none of the cases reported earlier have gone to critical stage, with majority on the mend without any medicines, officials said. “While it is too early to make any deductions, but what we can clearly see is that there is no involvement of the lungs in the Omicron positive cases. Majority of the patients have not taken vaccine which shows that vaccines might have a preventive role for this variant,” said a doctor treating these cases. The patients have been recovering well with just supplements and the occasional paracetamol. “Most of the patients fall in the middle-age category. They are asymptomatic and have recovered well. The 10 patients who were discharged after a stay of 14 days at the hospital were like any normal person and did not have any impact on health,” added the doctor. Also, majority of the cases have not taken any vaccines (46 out of 62 cases), 14 had taken a single dose and two had both doses. State health authorities maintain that the unvaccinated status of majority of the Omicron positive cases clearly shows that the current lot of Covid vaccines have a preventive role. “Taking two dose of vaccines is important. In majority of the cases, patients are either not vaccinated or partially vaccinated. Therefore, it is important that every eligible person completes their two doses,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-critical-omicron-ve-cases-so-far-in-telangana/articleshow/88552981.cms||Amrita Didyala

To begin with, the institute is planning to launch a new MTech programme in technoentrepreneurship. “This course would enable BTech students keen to pursue entrepreneurship to directly seek admission to MTech. Usually, the MTech programmes are for two years. However, this programme would be one year wherein BTech students would be groomed into entrepreneurship with a special syllabus,” said Prof BS Murty, director, IIT-H. The new MTech course would be in addition to various MTech online programmes that the institute would be offering. Apart from this, the institute would soon be opening doors for summer internships for students from other engineering colleges. “We will select top students from various engineering institutions and expose them to IITlevel learning. In addition to this, we also want to mentor other engineering institutions, in Telangana in particular to enhance teaching and learning,” said Murty. At a time when the institute is likely to expand prospects of research and entrepreneurship within the campus, construction of phase-2 of the institute is also being paced up. Phase-2 of the campus which would have a fourstoried knowledge park (library), separate buildings for each departments, additional hostels, a sports complex among many other facilities is likely to be inaugurated by December, 2022. “A research park and an innovation park spanning 1.5 lakh sq feet each are coming up, which will be a boost to startups and industry relations,” said Murty. Keeping up with the national education policy, the institute is planning to introduce multi-exit programmes, establishing centres of excellence in futuristic research fields and focus on internationalisation. “We have launched FIRST (fellowship for international research scholars in technology) which is open for meritorious foreign students. We will extend a fellowship of Rs 60,000 per month to come to IIT-H and pursue research,” said Murty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mtech-in-techno-entrepreneurship-phase-2-campus-among-iit-h-plans/articleshow/88553016.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Singles, queers seek legal route to beat surrogacy bill, become parents||HYDERABAD: With their dreams to become a parent cut short – courtesy the new Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020 cleared by the Rajya Sabha – many single men, women and members of the LGBTQ+ community are now exploring legal routes to contest the move. “We had already zeroed in on an oocyte (egg) donor and were ready to start the process of embryo transfer when we heard of this development that does not allow single or gay men to opt for surrogacy. It was nothing short of heart-breaking,” said Rakesh*. He and his partner, Alan* -- both of Indian descent – who have been living in Houston for many years, returned to India during the pandemic. “We wanted to have a baby to complete our family. But now we are dejected. We are also very angry with the government for taking away this right. How can they dictate how and whether we can have children or not?” said the 29-year-old. The two business development managers are now in talks with lawyers to see what options are available to them to appeal against the bill. Also hoping to join this legal battle is Kiran* a divorced man who was in an advanced stage of the process, when the Hyderabad-based clinic he was consulting, had to pull the plug. “After a two-year process, we had finally got the embryo prepared and ready for it to be transferred to the surrogate mother. I cannot believe, it’ll never see the light of the day now,” the healthcare professional said. Driven by the desire to become a father and a four-year-wait to adopt a male child (single men are not allowed to adopt a girl child), he had turned to surrogacy. “This blanket ban on all single men, for fear that that they might either ill-treat or not be able to take care of kids, is very unfortunate. Imagine what happens to a child who is born to a couple and the mother passes away at some point. Does the father not take responsibility in such a situation?” Rohan asked. Sadly, while the gay couple are adamant to have a child through surrogacy – even if that means going overseas – Rohan isn’t sure if his finances would allow that. “I have no hope now,” the 43-year-old said, echoing the sentiment shared by those like Saheli* — born with MRKH syndrome, a disorder that affects the reproductive system. “I could never get married because men rejected me. They didn’t want a woman with no uterus and, therefore, no hope of ever birthing a child. Now, even my desire to become a mother, through surrogacy, has been dashed,” she says. But she isn’t willing to give up without a fight. “I am looking at legal support. If I find more like-minded people, it’ll only strengthen our case,” the 28-year-old said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Vaccine nod for kids met with relief among parents||NEW DELHI: Parents of many school-going children feel somewhat relieved with the central government deciding to allow vaccination of kids above 15 years from January 3. This will put to rest many apprehensions they have while stepping out of home since the outbreak of Covid-19, several of them said. Over the past few months, schools have reopened and closed again due to severe pollution and then the pandemic again. The enforcement of the “yellow” alert amid a spike in daily Covid cases and positivity rates means educational institutes will remain closed for now. But parents still feel once the vaccine doses are administered, they will get a much needed relief. “In the present scenario, it is necessary for the children to be vaccinated. My daughter did attend school when it reopened as she preferred the offline mode and the administration was also taking precautions, but apprehensions were always there,” said Urvashi Arora, a parent of two. “My 11-year-old son has, however, does not wish to go to school unless vaccinated. Our family has suffered during the second wave and we really want vaccination for the children.” Arora’s daughter, 17-year-old Shruti, a student of The Indian School, said, “I was really happy to hear that now even we are eligible for the vaccine. Earlier while we were stepping out, I did not feel safe enough. For the adults of the family, it was much better as they were vaccinated. We should definitely get it.” Tanmay Kumar, a 15-year-old student of the same school, said, “We have been waiting for the vaccine and have a positive attitude towards it as the entire family has already taken it. Once jabbed, we will feel more confident to step out and the tension that prevailed even while going to school will be much less.” Shreyansh Garg, a Class XII student of Mount Abu Public School, felt it was better late than never. “While it would have been better had it been rolled out a little earlier, at least it is good that we are finally eligible for the vaccine,” he said. “Term I was tough for students as we did not get enough opportunities to go to school to clear doubts and meet teachers. Once we are vaccinated, hopefully Term II would be a better experience,” the 17-year-old said. Rashmi Arora, a parent, has also been waiting for the decision. “While the situation was under control in the past few months, the cases have gone up again and it is important to vaccinate children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vaccine-nod-for-kids-met-with-relief-among-parents/articleshow/88553772.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

They also urged the trade, commerce and tourism fraternity in Trichy to give a clear insight to the local ministers on this issue. The airport terminal has exhausted its capacity owing to the increasing international and domestic traffic. As per the proposals made by the Airport Authority of India in 2010, they had sought 12,500 feet of land to enable the airport to handle wide-body aircraft, which would enhance passenger and cargo handling capacity. However, the process of acquiring the required land from defence and state government has been going at a snail’s pace, enthusiasts said. There is no second opinion that all the airports in the state should be developed. But, when compared to other airports, Trichy international airport is second to Chennai in earning revenue as well as foreign remittance to the state. So, the state government should give due preference to expand the existing runway of Trichy airport, H Ubaidullah, an independent researcher on aviation, said. “Acquisition of defence land is required for the overall expansion of the airport, which includes the construction of the new terminal building. There is no connection between the defence land and the runway expansion. If the land owned by local people was acquired, the expansion work can be started on the very next day. So, the state government should do the needful to acquire the required land,” he stressed. V B Jaganath, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavors (TIDES), alleged that despite Trichy being the only profit-making airport in the state next to Chennai, the state government is not keen on developing the airport. Big shots from the trade, commerce, travel and tourism sector in Trichy are remaining mute spectators on the issue. They should take up the issue with the chief minister through local ministers. Without the intervention of the chief minister, the runway expansion issue will not be fructified in the near future,” he said. Stating the inordinate delay in transferring the required land to the Airport Authority of India, Trichy MP Su Thirunavukarasar has written a letter to the civil aviation minister appealing him to take up the matter with the minister of defence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cm-urged-to-intervene-speed-up-trichy-airport-runway-expansion/articleshow/88553768.cms||---

Apart from Covid-19, blood samples were separately collected from specific clusters to gauge the spread of dengue in the city. The survey is likely to be completed in the next two days. Random localities were selected by the state health department without involving the district health and the civic bodies so as to ensure the accuracy of screening. In the city, Andakondan, Thillai Nagar, Dheeran Nagar and Geethapuram were among the locations covered. In rural Trichy, Thuvakudi, Thuraiyur, Thottiyam and Ariyavur were covered. The survey selects one household in a locality identified by the state health department. A person is selected by using the Kish method (respondent selection type) among the family members in the house listed based on age and other parameters, to collect the blood sample. The samples are collected in a series of houses. Serosurvey will examine the blood sample of residents to detect the immune response to the virus and identify the presence of antibodies and the process will help the authorities to measure the spread of the infection in a particular area. Vaccinated people were also covered in the sample collection. While the dengue blood samples will be sent to the Manapparai lab for study, samples taken for the Covid-19 survey will be sent to Chennai, officials said. “We are conducting the survey from 7 am to 1.30 pm, sanitary officials were part of the team to sensitize and prepare the residents to collect the blood samples,” Dr A Mohamed Hakkim, a medical officer with the corporation said. A total of 30 samples were collected from each of the clusters. The previous serosurveys were conducted in October 2020, April 2021 and July 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/serosurvey-fourth-round-under-way-in-trichy-district/articleshow/88553760.cms||---

The boys aged 14, 13 and 11 were found by the Palode forest range officials during a search. The three boys, who were neighbours and related to each other, had gone missing on Monday when their parents were away for work, said police. A case was registered and a search was launched after receiving the complaint in the evening. On Tuesday morning, their bags were found abandoned near their relative’s house at Palode. Subsequently, the forest officials launched a search in the forest nearby and eventually found them. The reason why the boys ran away is yet to be verified, said police. It is learnt that they were scolded by a neighbour for entering his house without permission and even accused them of attempted theft. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/three-missing-boys-found-in-forest-area/articleshow/88553026.cms||TNN

Training and placement officials said this was the highest number of jobs ever offered in the campus’s history and that the figure was likely to swell. The institute is expecting to achieve 1,000 campus placements by April end, when these final-year students will pass out. Around 100 undergraduate and 200 postgraduate students are yet to appear for the placements. Director Pramod Padole has instructed to keep placements open for the previous batch too, where 549 students were placed, as it was hit hard by the pandemic. The record job offers have come for the batch which has completed its last two years in online classes. The average placements ranged between 400 and 500 in the last five academic years. A survey by the institute helped identify the weaknesses and provide suitable training to make students industry-ready. The highest package offered was ₹34.25 lakh per annum (LPA) to two students, in the management consulting domain. The top 10 recruiters offered packages between Rs18lakh and Rs34.25LPA. IT services, financial services, e-commerce and educational services were some sectors where students got placed. Some of the recruiters picked up as many as 38 students from different engineering branches. The BTech course has eight branches, MTech 20 and MSc three, besides BArch and PhD. The average cost to company (CTC) improved from Rs8.42LPA to Rs10.36LPA this year. Also, 40 more companies participated in the placement drive, as against 158 last year. Padole said the institute had recently made lot of changes in its training and placement mechanism. “We have introduced 120 hours of special courses. Every student is supposed to undergo these courses which are related to core subject knowledge, soft skills, overall presentation and capabilities. We implemented them from last year and are getting good results now. Special manpower too was employed for this activity,” he said. The director added that average salary had gone up by more than 60%. “Job offers for postgraduate (PG) students have improved a lot. We are expecting good prospects for PG. One complete year for internship, instead of six months, was introduced as demanded by the industry. The move is showing results,” he said.

---||Nagpur||Mysterious death of tigress in Maha Pench; 164 have died in 2021||Nagpur: A day after a young tigress from Pombhurna in Central Chanda succumbed to crude bomb injuries, one more tigress was found dead under mysterious circumstances in Pench Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra, on Tuesday. With this, the total tiger toll in Maharashtra has touched 42 since January 1, 2021. According to the data compiled by Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), an NGO working in wildlife conservation, there has been a 48% jump in tiger deaths in the country this year as compared to 2020. In 2020, 111 tiger deaths (80 found dead and 31 poaching and body parts seizures) were recorded. In 2021, 164 tiger mortalities, including the one that died in Pench on Tuesday, have been reported to date. “Looking at the number of deaths, 2021 was a bad year for tigers too. So many deaths are unusual. The population might not grow at this rate. It is a setback to tiger conservation,” said Nitin Desai, Central India director of WPSI. Deputy conservator (core) Prabhu Nath Shukla said the Pench tigress taggged as T-35 was found dead on Tuesday afternoon in compartment number 635 in Pathar beat of Saleghat range. “It had been sighted on Monday by a group of tourists when it was trying to get up, but looked paralyzed. After several failed attempts it managed to get up and went inside the bushes and disappeared. It was found dead around 1pm,” Shukla said. “On Tuesday, though a team of veterinarians reached the spot, due to heavy showers post-mortem could not be performed. It will be conducted on Wednesday only then the exact cause of death will be ascertained. All the body parts of the animal were intact and there are also no injuries on it,” Shukla said. Forest sources said the tigress died near the Bhuyarzari waterhole, and poisoning as one of the causes of death cannot be ruled out. There are no power lines nearby or any village. The tigress had three cubs but it is not confirmed whether these cubs had separated from the mother. “Before lockdown in March, these cubs were sighted with the tigress and must be 15-18 months now,” said sources. Wildlife conservationists and nature lovers have cast aspersions on forest officials for not rescuing the tigress earlier and saving the animal. “If the tigress was noticed in a paralyzed state, attempts should have been made to check on its well-being immediately. It was sighted in the morning and a team from Nagpur could have easily rushed to the spot, which is hardly 35km from the city. It is very sad to see a tigress dying this way,” said Sarosh Lodhi, conservationist wildlife photographer. “The future of West Pench looks grave considering the frequent electrocution and poisoning cases. A concentrated effort should be made to check irregularities in the region and bring the culprits to book,” said Lodhi. “Last December, a two-member committee of retired DFO GK Vashisht and WPSI’s Nitin Desai had suggested a series of measures like route patrolling and other steps. This was after tourists had a miraculous escape when their safari vehicle crossed a live electric wire fence laid inside the Surewani forest, not far from Saleghat. Considering the incident, it is difficult whether the recommendations are being followed,” said wildlife lover Ankit Rattan. DyCF Shukla said, “It is true that the tigress was sighted on Monday but we received the videos on Tuesday. We have deployed camera traps to know whether there are cubs. A completely eaten wild boar carcass was found 200 metres away from the tigress. But only post-mortem will reveal the facts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mysterious-death-of-tigress-in-maha-pench-164-have-died-in-2021/articleshow/88553769.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Trichy||Govt gives in-principle nod for bus terminus on 48 acres in Trichy||Trichy: Days ahead of the visit by chief minister M K Stalin to Trichy to launch various projects, the Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday awarded the much-awaited in-principle approval for establishing an integrated bus terminus (IBT) for Trichy city on 48 acres at Panjapur on the Trichy-Madurai highway. Trichy corporation has planned to divert and utilise a portion of funds from the smart cities mission to establish IBT and allied infrastructure within 15 months of the launch of civil works.According to the order issued by the municipal administration and water supply department, out of the 574 acres of land available for Trichy corporation in Panjapur, the IBT and allied projects are likely to utilise 325 acres. The initial estimate of IBT is placed at Rs 140 crore while the proposed truck terminal on 25 acres is estimated to cost Rs 76 crore, multi-utility centre on 100 acres Rs 59 crores and infrastructure development for 152 acres Rs 75 crore, says the GO. Of the total Rs 350 crore required for the proposals, Trichy corporation is likely to use infrastructure and amenities fund for mobilising Rs 140 crore and the remaining fund is to be met from the smart cities mission programme. As revamping of the existing underground drainage network proposed under the mission will be delayed due to practical difficulties and as the project has not commenced, the civic body has proposed to delink the proposal from smart cities mission and implement it under other schemes including AMRUT. To make use of the grant which was earlier proposed for the underground drainage project, Trichy corporation will take up the IBT construction work under the smart cities programme funding. Since the projects under the smart cities mission will have to be completed by March 2023, IBT for the city is touted to become a reality within 15 months. Trichy corporation has passed the proposal as a resolution in the council on December 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/govt-gives-in-principle-nod-for-bus-terminus-on-48-acres-in-trichy/articleshow/88553765.cms||Deepak Karthik

Jamnagar assistant superintendent of police Nitish Pandey informed media persons that they have attached the property to destroy organized crime syndicates. “If we want to destroy any organised crime syndicate from its roots we need to break them financially. With this aim we had registered offences against Jayesh Patel’s crime syndicate under GujCTOC and IPC sections. During investigation we got evidence of the illegal properties that had been extorted from the victims and given to members of the syndicate,” said Pandey. “We had prepared a list of the properties and sent a proposal to the home ministry seeking permission to attach these and after getting a go ahead, we attached properties worth Rs 8 crore,” he added. Jayesh Patel allies Jaysukh Ranpariya was arrested in London in March this year. He is wanted in 42 criminal cases including murder, extortion, cheating, forgery and money laundering. Patel and his syndicate is notorious for forging documents and grabbing land. Patel had fled to Dubai eight days before advocate Kirit Joshi’s murder for which he had allegedly given a contract to a killer.

A lorry carrying ONGC logistics near Mayiladuthurai was stopped and sent back after the farmers including the general public intercepted the truck alleging that the authorities from ONGC brought them to dig a new oil well. According to police, the ONGC attempted to construct an oil well at Anjar Varthalai village in Kuthalam taluk in Mayiladuthurai district a few years ago. The project was later abandoned following a protest from villagers. Meanwhile, the ONGC logistics items from the village of Anjarvarthalai were loaded into a truck and brought to the defunct ONGC oil and natural gas storage centre in the Malliyam Manjalaru area. On seeing the truck, the general public including farmers of the village, led by professor T Jayaraman, the coordinator of the Anti-Methane Project Federation, accused the ONGC of being involved in an attempt to build a new oil well and blocked the trucks. On information, ONGC officials arrived there along with Kuthalam police and held talks with the protesters. However, the protesters refused to disperse from the spot and the truck with drillers and other equipment had to be sent back. Later, the protesters disperced from the spot, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/alleging-bid-to-dig-oil-well-farmers-block-ongc-truck/articleshow/88553770.cms||---

According to the police, 47-year-old Thakor was in court for the hearing of a maintenance case, filed by his wife some years ago. He had been attending the hearings for the last three years and had paid some money to his wife. “Thakor was supposed to pay Rs 4.50 lakh to her and hearing for which was kept on Tuesday,” said Gotri police inspector V R Vaniya. “Thakor was sentenced to jail for a few days in the same case in the past too. He seems to have consumed poison to divert attention as he would have had to pay more money to his wife. His condition is stable but the doctors have kept him under observation,” Vaniya added. Thakor’s family members claimed that he was hassled as he could not arrange for the money and that’s why he consumed poison out of frustration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-consumes-poison-in-court-premises/articleshow/88553033.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘CITY NEEDS MORE BUS CONNECTIVITY’||Must consider BRTS The currently operating airport liners are a good option for people but if three or people travel together, the cost of reaching the bus pickup point along with the cost of ticket to the airport turns out to be equal to cab fare. Hence, people prefer cabs as they pick you up from your home. Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) similar to the one in Ahmedabad with smaller electric AC buses would be more efficient. -- Sandeep Nagda Metro from suburbs More than flyovers, the twin cities urgently require mass public transport from suburbs to connect various parts of Hyderabad. It's not enough to have connections to the airport and railway stations, residents need proper transport to visit shopping centres, workplaces, recreational spots, hospitals etc. The problem is that planners and politicians have not taken proactive steps to have metro connectivity originating from the suburbs. They have, instead, focused on having it only in elite places where people rarely use public transport. The public transport plan should focus on suburbs so that all don't have to live near convenient spots. -- N Nagarajan Smaller AC buses I suggest the RTC authorities arrange small buses with AC facilities to and from railway stations and the airport that connect as many important points in the city as possible. The number of trips too must be increased. – G Adinarayana Add more autos, taxis We often get down at Begumpet railway station, whenever we travel back to Hyderabad, as it is the nearest to A S Rao Nagar. What we observed is, there aren't enough auto-rickshaws, taxis, and cabs available for passengers here. As a result, one is forced to wait for a long time and is often inconvenienced. Ola and Uber rides are frequently cancelled, thus adding to our worries. Public transport service at this railway station certainly has to be improved, given the large number of people using it. – Parimala G Tadas Peak hours need more rides The TSRTC services, either to the railway stations or airport, are very erratic. I suggest that the authorities collect information regarding arrival time of trains and flights and work out increased bus services during those times from places that’ll help commuters. Further, some routes (like 113 route from Ameerpet) have very few buses which leads to overcrowding in the few that ply along this route. There are also no buses at all to Secunderabad railway station from places like from Srinagar Colony and people have to go to Ameerpet to travel to the station. TSRTC must address this. The administration should depute staff to assess the requirement and add buses accordingly. The administration should also mention the first bus timings, last bus timings and the frequency timings etc at all bus shelters for immediate information to the public. -- Katuru Durga Prasad Rao Manage autos better Previously Hyderabad Police used to manage autos at Secunderabad railway station. After the introduction of Ola and Uber, the police stopped that service. The police should control and manage autos at all important railway stations in twin cities, to arrest this practice of unfair pricing by autos especially during night hours -- 9 pm onwards. Additionally, RTC should run buses to all important destinations like Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, Manikonda, Hi-Tec city etc for all important trains from Secunderabad station. -- Ch Mohana Rao Launch feeder services Majority of the people in Hyderabad prefer using public transport as it is more affordable. But our government does not focus on prime destinations like the airport, and leaves people to pay a high price to get there. If the Government is serious about this issue, they can do a few things: 1. Start using mini buses as feeder services connecting the main bus stops to residential areas around it. 2. Put up banners on the bus and at the bus stops with scheduled timings and ensure the drivers strictly follow them. 3. Fix a reasonable price for the bus ticket so that the commuter does not choose another mode of transport. 4. Conduct awareness programmes to make people aware about these services. – Khulood Zaheer More connections from S'bad I think the authorities should start bus services from the other side of Secunderabad Railway station – which is platform no 10. Thousands of passengers use this side every day, yet there is not a single city bus service from this place. There is also a need for more metro services on the Hayathnagar-JBS route. We must plan short distance services to attract passengers who are using shared autos. -- Telukuntla Srinivas Rail line to RGIA Since metro connectivity to the airport is still a long way away, the most useful alternative would be to have rail connectivity to RGIA. Like Bengaluru that recently announced plans of a high-speed rail link from the city to the airport, Hyderabad too must think of it. Regular connectivity to the airport from Umdanagar -- the last MMTS station, or a new station close to the airport will go a long way in providing a cheap and faster mode of transport for passengers using the facility. Like the airport buses currently running, connectivity can be provided from this railway station. Also, the total cost of such a project will be a fraction of the huge cost of a totally new metro service. Moreover, fuel consumption and vehicular pollution will also be under control. -- Sudhir S Affordable ticket fare Since its inception, the Hyderabad Metro Rail has gained popularity and is doing a commendable job in helping commuters reach their destination in a shorter time. But for many, buses are still the most popular choice. Hence, it is important that authorities identify the areas/routes that have maximum demand and increase the number of buses here – including ladies specials -- especially during peak hours. Efforts must also be made to run special buses to and from the airport and railway stations with reasonable ticket fare. Lastly, we must try to bring back the double decker buses as they can ferry more commuters at the same time. – C K Vinaya Chandra Connect stations to homes There is no dearth of public transport in Hyderabad for sure. But how disciplined the system is the question. Since the introduction of metro rail, public interest has soared since it has eased the process of reaching destinations. But the commute from the station to respective ends still leaves a gap. Take for example this: after alighting at the Synchrony/Raidurg station if one wants to reach Puppalaguda the means of travel is restricted to autos and/or cabs. Post the spiralling fuel prices, the fares have shot and not everyone can afford the exorbitant rates. Here, a system must be introduced by running a bus to Marichetu via Lanco Hills. This will be very helpful. Similar systems can be looked into, at various corridors which will assist commuters. -- Anand Menon Sanitise public vehicles Firstly, in the wake of Covid-19, it is important that authorities ensure public transport vehicles are sanitised frequently so that people can feel confident travelling in them. Then, the TSRTC must step in and arrange city bus connectivity from metro stations to interior parts of the city with greater frequency, since it is a challenge now. Lack of parking at metro stations is also an issue. I suggest the authorities consider issuing a combined metro train, MMTS and TSRTC bus pass to attract citizens to travel in public transport. It must also think of extending metro connectivity up to the Rajiv Gandhi International airport so as to reduce travel time. MMTS services also must be introduced in new routes keeping in mind the increase in traffic over the next few years. -- Nagendra Kumar Vempalli Special focus on students The government must bring in more buses, with some earmarked for students. They must also work out a way to provide a live location of these buses through their official app or website so that people can access them easily. There should also be a feedback option made available on the app so that the issues of commuters can be looked into. There should be bus stops at every railway station, metro stations and airport and service available every 15 minutes. -- Hema Krishna RTC-driven cabs I suggest that the RTC introduce RTC cab services on par with Ola and Uber services to cater to the needs of people. It will generate more jobs and passengers too will be able to avail of cab services at a cheaper rate. -- Mubbesher Mehdi Extend MMTS, metro To resolve commuting issues between the city and important destinations like airport and railway stations, authorities must link MMTS and metro and allow commuters to travel in both on a single ticket. They should connect MMTS to the airport from Hyderabad, Kacheguda, Secunderabad and railway stations like Lingampally. They should run more TSRTC services between places like Miyapur and airport, increase the number of buses between the airport and railway stations, link MMTS stations like Umdanagar to the airport through more buses and reduce the fare of AC buses. Reducing taxi fares and strictly implementing pre-paid taxi systems at all important stations can also help commuters. – Nagarjuna S R Y Exclusive airport service Public transport facilities are a major setback in Hyderabad and are not accessible to everyone, every time. In my view, the government should propose mini-bus transport facilities for airport and railway stations for pick up and drop at remote areas. To make travel easier for the public more RTC buses should be running during peak hours. MMTS train connectivity should be accessible at every location so that commuters can travel hassle-free anywhere. – Ramya Karthik Cheaper cab service To address the current issue, we need more MMTS connections during peak hours and exclusive deluxe AC buses from populated locations of the city to the airport at regular intervals. Also, to break the monopoly of Uber and Ola we need to launch a reliable alternative cab service with special incentives for airport services and other important destinations. -- Subbarao Karra Metered autos Commuting in Hyderabad is becoming difficult day by day. Authorities must increase the frequency of buses to and from the airport so that people can travel in comfort and not depend entirely on Uber and Ola. It is also important to bring in some regulation to manage autos in the city as drivers refuse to go on meter these days. If Mumbai can have autos strictly plying on meters why can’t other metros follow? Local authorities have to play a big role in disciplining the errant auto drivers and streamline this service for the benefit of common people. -- Mukunda Rao||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-needs-more-bus-connectivity/articleshow/88553025.cms||---

He has distributed about 10,000 seeds of Bilva patri (Aegle marmelos), in South India, including 2,000 in Dakshina Kannada district, after the campaign was formally launched by Sri Siddheshwar Swami in Vijayapura on January 15, 2018. Currently based out of Bengaluru, he travels across the state to collect seeds. He told TOI: “The Bilva patri tree is important because of its medicinal and religious significance. Despite this, it is not easily available. I learnt about seeds separation in Shivayogi Mandira, Badami taluk, where there is a Bilva vana, and frequent the forest department’s research centre at Doresanipalya. The growth rate is good. It takes about a month for sprouting, and about five months to get a good seedling, if kept in a one-foot pouch, and watered once in three days. The plants attain a good height in areas with good sunshine,” he said. Kashimath, who was recently appointed as the president of the Karnataka Parisara Vedike, is planning to organise Bilva Utsava to spread awareness on the trees, and distribute its seeds. He has sent seeds to various religious heads and temples across the state. He plans to strengthen his campaign with the support of the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Department. He is in touch with botanists and other subject experts, and is also researching on various types of Bilva patri trees. In the meantime, he has also launched a campaign to conserve the bela or elephant apple (Feronia elephantum). “The fruit is highly nutritious, but it is being neglected. I have sent about 5,000 seeds to Vijayapura, to be developed into seedlings. If successful, the seedlings will also be distributed. All seedlings or seeds are distributed free of cost,” he said.  Tribute to BGL Swamy V G Kashimath is reaching out to government officials and politicians to popularise the contributions made by Bengaluru Gundappa Lakshminarayana Swamy, an Indian botanist and Kannada writer, and the son of D V Gundappa, a philosopher and Kannada writer. “The need of the hour is to popularise the contributions of B G L Swamy as a botanist and writer. I have also written to Union minister Pralhad Joshi and met the Dharwad deputy commissioner and submitted a letter to name the 40 acre botanical garden after BGL Swamy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/retired-official-on-a-mission-to-conserve-bilva-patri-trees/articleshow/88552201.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

It was a rough work-from-home day in April 2020, when I picked up a book kept at the corner of my home for a long time. I started reading and it propelled me to derive meanings from semantics used in it. That aroused curiosity in me as I started to learn some new words, texts, and adages. The analogy used in the stories and a fallacy about spiritual development was valiantly brought forward. The interest kept building on, and I started to buy more books of different non-fiction authors. With a lot of spare time at hand due to the lockdown, I found ample opportunities to discover more exciting works by different authors. I started to research and read about the real-life experience of our great historians, scholars, saints, and the works of different artists in India. The pictures of famous entrepreneurs, real life heroes, and short stories now fill the walls of my study and tell stories of resilience and courage that these great leaders of India displayed. I started to build on my communication skills, recording and rehearsing my speeches and developed an unflinching thirst to become a good storyteller and an articulator. That has helped immensely in strengthening my professional brand and my colleagues now look at me with great pride. I would have continued the daily mundane task of a 9 to 6 life and remained dormant, but this reading habit has inculcated in me the belief in spirituality and improved my communication. I am very thankful for this change in my life.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Fresh push to efforts to cover those who haven’t taken second vaccine dose||NEW DELHI: With the number of Covid-19 cases rising by the day, Delhi government has kicked off an all-out initiative to fully vaccinate the city’s eligible population as soon as possible. From phone calls to house visits daily, efforts are being made to ensure that those whose second dose of the vaccine is due don’t lose even a day in getting inoculated. “While we have achieved 100% coverage of the first dose of the vaccine, we are trying every measure to ensure that people get their second dose on time,” said a Delhi government official. The official added, “Omicron may be a mild variant from what we have seen till now, but those who are fully vaccinated will be protected from severe symptoms and hospitalisation. Also, the Delta variant is still around, so everyone needs to get both doses to get full protection.” Mentioning that there was a large population whose second doses were due and a sizable number whose second dose was now, in fact, overdue, the official said, “We have made district-wise lists with data from the CoWin portal to see which beneficiaries are due for their second dose and who are overdue.” Every district has set up call centres manned by trained counsellors. “We are now making all-out efforts and every beneficiary who is due for the second dose is being called by these personnel every day till they get vaccinated. Those who are reluctant to get the dose are being counselled about the importance and guided to the nearest vaccination centre,” said the official. “In case beneficiaries are unable to reach a centre, our mobile teams try to visit their home and get them vaccinated. The majority, however, are coming on their own to get inoculated. We are administering on average 70,000-80,000 second doses every day,” the official said. Till 7pm on Tuesday, 2,59,22,565 vaccine doses had been administered and first doses had crossed the 1.5 crore mark. However, the total number of eligible beneficiaries according to Delhi’s electoral rolls is 1,48,33,713. Officials said the reason for this was that many people from the NCR had also taken their first dose in Delhi. The number of second doses administered till Tuesday was 1,08,84,768, which meant 73.4% of the total beneficiaries were fully vaccinated. North West and South West districts had administered over 30 lakh doses, while New Delhi and Shahdara had given more than 18 lakh doses. North East district was close to administering 19 lakh doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-push-to-efforts-to-cover-those-who-havent-taken-second-vax-dose/articleshow/88553796.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The state had recently filed an application before the Esplanade court for orders to the Centre to produce a pen drive which was given to the MHA by Maharashtra opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis along with a copy of the report which Shukla had prepared on alleged corruption in police transfers and postings in the state when Anil Deshmukh was the state home minister. The court had heard the state’s special public prosecutor, Ajay Misar, last Friday and had posted the case for orders on Tuesday. The court directed the Union minister to hand over the pen drive to the state within the next 10 working days. The Centre had declined to hand over any pen drive or report as alleged to be in its possession. The state wanted it in connection with an investigation into the report ‘leak’ case it had registered against unknown persons. Misar had informed the court that the investigating officer from the cyber cell in the case registered against the alleged leak of Rashmi Shukla’s phone tap report has sought answers from Fadnavis and that he has informed that he would intimate the time when he would be free. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/give-rashmi-shukla-pen-drive-to-maharashtra-state-court-to-mha/articleshow/88554339.cms||---

They eventually saw their 5am flight take off. One of the stranded passengers who could not reach on time due to the bungling was Baby Koerie. She works as a domestic help in Mumbai and had borrowed Rs 7,500 from her employer to buy the air ticket so that she could attend her mother's funeral. Despite repeated pleas by her and requests from other stranded passengers to put her on a flight operated by another airline, the Go First ground staff remained unmoved. The passengers finally reached Kolkata via Bengaluru around 2.30pm instead of 7.30am. “I just couldn't believe my rotten luck. I was paying a fortune to get a last glimpse of my mother but that opportunity was denied,” sobbed Koerie. Industry veterans said the incident exposed a loophole in the boarding system. While a headcount used to happen at the step ladder point earlier, that has been done away with. Now, passenger tickets are scanned at the bus gate. Thereafter, passengers are deemed to have boarded the flight. “The pilots or cabin crew weren’t even aware that the five passengers weren’t on the flight,” said an airline official. A Go First spokesperson said the employee concerned has been taken off duty/suspended pending investigation. “Go First has a zero-tolerance policy and it is mandatory for all employees to comply with the company’s rules, regulations, and policies,” the statement read. Kavya Sarkar, who along with colleague Subhangi Agarwal, was one of the five left behind by GoFirst flight G8 511, said they had reached the airport at 3.15am. –Subhro Niyogi||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/5-flyers-stranded-on-airport-bus-see-flight-take-off/articleshow/88554360.cms||---

Despite the result of NEET-PG was out six months back, counselling has not been held due to seat reservation issue pending in court. As a result teaching hospitals are working with only PGTs from two batches. They said that the delay in counselling has led to shortage of 45,000 doctors. “What happened in Delhi is not acceptable.

Which yatra will Samajwadi Party take out: A 'Vishwas Yatra' or 'Mafia Yatra'? Will it take out a yatra to remind people of the riots? Or, will it take out a ‘barat’ (wedding procession) of ‘bahubalis’ (strongmen),” Nadda sought to know from the people attending the Jan Vishwas Yatra in Hapur’s Garhmukteshwar on Tuesday. “Earlier, there was goonda raj, but now crimes and riots have ended in UP,” said Nadda, praising chief minister Yogi. Exuding confidence that BJP would win the 2022 election by a thumping majority, Nadda said, “We will win, so will the people. It will be a victory of people who dream of development of the state. It will be a victory of farmers, women, youths, and the self-respect of Uttar Pradesh, while it will be a defeat of casteism, hooliganism, appeasement and mafia raj.” The BJP chief said earlier people used to seek permission for kanwar yatra and religious processions, but now it's hardly required. In an apparent reference to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Nadda said, “There are political leaders who share their photos with crowds on Twitter, but the reality is they are somewhere else and the crowd shown is of some other place. I want them to see the crowd in our Jan Vishwas Yatra here. I would like to tell the media to show the crowd.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-riots-free-after-bjp-came-to-power-nadda/articleshow/88552260.cms||---

TOI had on Tuesday reported that the NMC administration conveyed to Bhoyar its inability to form three-member committee as per resolution passed in the standing committee meeting on December 22. Despite municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B forming a seven-member inquiry committee headed by additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena on December 17 to inquire into Bogus Contracts Scam, the standing committee had constituted three-member committee of its members — BJP corporators Sanjay Balpande (chairman), Pragati Patil and Congress corporator Asha Uikey. Bhoyar had said the administration’s committee was conducting inquiry into contracts approved between April 1, 2020, and December 13. The standing panel committee was to probe all contracts approved in last five years. He had set deadline of 15 days for submission of report. The NMC administration sought legal view on the standing committee’s decision. NMC’s legal department said the standing committee did not have power to constitute committee for conducting an inquiry. Considering TOI report, Bhoyar asked for clarity on this issue from officials at the standing committee meeting on Tuesday. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and municipal secretary Ranjana Lade informed him about the legal view. Bhoyar told TOI, “Administration is at fault in the case so it is avoiding inquiry by us. I came to know general body has powers to form committee and conduct an inquiry. I will raise the issue and ensure formation of inquiry committee in the general body meeting on December 31.” TOI had on December 22 had reported bogus contracts of Rs68 lakh came to fore in solid waste management department. An NMC official said, “Bogus contracts from solid waste management department have swelled to over Rs1 crore. Inquiry is still going on. Chances of more bogus contracts in this department cannot be ruled out.” Bogus contracts have come to fore in four departments — health, solid waste management, library, and birth and death registration. Considering the Rs1 crore from solid waste management department, the scam will swell to Rs4.41 crore. Earlier, bogus contracts of Rs2.07 crore were confirmed from health department, Rs74 lakh from library, and Rs60 lakh birth and death registration department. BOX IN A NUTSHELL * NMC administration exposed Bogus Contracts Scam * Departmental enquiry started seven staffers, four suspended * NMC lodged complaint with police, which arrested three staffers and two contractors * Civic chief on Dec 17 appointed seven-member committee headed by additional municipal commissioner to inquire into all contracts between April 1, 2020 and Dec 13 * Standing committee on Dec 22 passed resolution to form committee of three members to probe contracts approved in last five years * Legal view sought on standing panel resolution * Legal department said standing committee does not have powers to constitute committee for inquiry * Standing committee chairman will raise issue in general body on Dec 31, ensure formation of inquiry committee||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/standing-panel-chief-upset-to-demand-inquiry-panel-in-gb-meet/articleshow/88553816.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The accused, Govindraju Durga Purna Vaishali, had sought bail from the special court claiming innocence. She submitted that her husband, Machvaram Sudhakar, was involved in the day-to-day functioning of the company, Ashi Trading Co, which imported talc powder consignments from Afghanistan. Some 2,988kg heroin was found hidden in a consignment. She also submitted that her husband had said one person named Amit was more actively involved and instrumental in commission of the present offence and a key to providing the further chain of connected persons involved in backdoor puppeteering, but the NIA has not arrested them and made her a scapegoat. To oppose the bail plea, NIA’s special prosecutor Amit Nair argued that this case involves an international drug cartel comprising of players based in Afghanistan, Iran and India, and the modus operandi suggests a deep rooted conspiracy to exploit the trade friendly approach of India to further the nefarious activities of the international drug cartel, with an intent to destabilise the Indian economy and pose a serious threat to national security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nia-court-denies-bail-to-woman-in-mundra-drug-case/articleshow/88553079.cms||---

Malaviya had been officiating as the acting DGP since September 1 after he took over from Virendra. The 1986-batch IPS officer was among the names the Bengal government had proposed to the Center for ratification. The Centre’s nod, sources said, reached on Monday. The Bengal governor formally issued the appointment on Tuesday, saying Malaviya, who was given additional charge of the state DGP besides the DGP (modernisation), would now head Bengal police. Based on Supreme Court norms, the DGP must be shortlisted from a three-member panel proposed by the UPSC, involving both the Centre and states. The Bengal government had even moved the apex court, questioning why UPSC should, and not the state, make this shortlist because law and order was a state subject. With the Centre’s nod, Malaviya became the DGP for a tenure till December 2023. Malaviya is the senior-most IPS officer in Bengal. The 58-year-old officer from Uttar Pradesh joined the Bengal cadre IPS on December 15, 1986, and is the great-grandson of social reformer and freedom fighter Madan Mohan Malaviya.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Ashraf alleged that he tested positive in the rapid antigen test (priced at Rs 2,490) at Thiruvananthapuram airport on Monday night and had to cancel his Air Arabia ticket to Sharjah. Immediately, he left for Kochi airport, underwent the same test, tested negative and took a flight to Sharjah on Tuesday morning. “I raised doubts on the test’s accuracy as I had tested negative in an RT-PCR test conducted 24 hours ago. When I requested officials to redo the test at the airport, they refused and sent me back. Without wasting time, I took a taxi to Nedumbassery and arrived there at 4.45am on Tuesday. I took the same test, paying the same fee and the result was different. I tested negative within seven hours,” he wrote on FB. He flew to Sharjah in an Air India Express flight at 10.10am. In his FB post, Ashraf asked central and state governments to take steps to avoid such mistakes that affect thousands of international travellers. “Government should be ready to prevent private labs from handling Covid formalities at airports,” he said. Talking about Ashraf’s experiences, director of Thiruvananthapuram airport Madhusudan Rao later said that a private lab was doing all things related to Covid tests at the airport and authorities will look into this case. “I don’t know the scientific reason for this error in result. If we receive a complaint, we will seek an explanation from the lab,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rapid-antigen-test-accuracy-questioned/articleshow/88553115.cms||TNN
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s ECLGS borrowings 3rd-highest in India||AHMEDABAD: Signalling greater financial requirements to meet working capital needs of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), Gujarat has had the third highest borrowing under the emergency credit line guarantee scheme(ECLGS). According to the latest report of the state-level bankers’ committee (SLBC), Gujarat, Rs 20,862 crore was borrowed under ECLGS – the third highest amount in India after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Guarantees worth this amount have been issued by the National Credit Guarantee Trust Company Limited (NCGTCL). Bankers and industry stakeholders say that Gujarat is not just a manufacturing-heavy state but also is home to various MSMEs, which faced increased cash needs soon after the pandemic began. When industry was faced with higher freight and raw material costs, their working capital needs shot up further. Gujarat had some 12.18 lakh MSMEs as of July 2021, according to data from the MSME ministry tabled in Parliament. “Gujarat is a manufacturing-heavy state with a high number of MSMEs. The emergency credit extended by way of government guarantees provided to businesses came as a huge booster to industries that were struggling for working capital due to pandemic-induced disruptions,” said M M Bansal, convener, SLBC, Gujarat. “Had this scheme not been in place, the number of non-performing assets in banks would have increased as industrial units across sectors would have faced survival difficulties,” Bansal added. Industry experts say that besides handling disruptions triggered by the lockdown, cost of production as well and export went up dramatically, which also led to fresh working capital requirements for manufacturers. Borrowings from Gujarat account for 9.16% of the Rs 2.27 lakh crore of borrowings across the country, according to the SLBC report. “Exports in various sectors provided a cushion to most manufacturers. While manufacturers and businesses across Gujarat leveraged this opportunity, they faced higher freight and container costs. Costs of raw materials such as cotton, yarn, steel,cement, basic chemicals, specialty chemicals or even coal, have gone up drastically. Most of these materials were not available on credit, as a result of which MSMEs had to make immediate payments, pushing working capital needs further,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat state council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujs-eclgs-borrowings-3rd-highest-in-india/articleshow/88553103.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Agra||10 lakh people skip second dose of Covid vaccine in Agra||AGRA: About 10 lakh people who have taken the first shot of Covid-19 vaccine are yet to get themselves jabbed with the second dose even after the expiry of the prescribed interval between the two doses. More than three months have elapsed since these people took the first dose. Now, calls are being made to these people to come and take the second vaccine shot immediately in view of the looming threat of the Covid variant, Omicron, spreading. According to the health department records, till Monday, out of the 35 lakh population of over 18-year-olds in Agra district, 15.55 lakh people had received both doses of the vaccine. Over the past 12 months, 28.60 lakh people received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Out of these, more than 90% were administered Covishield vaccine. Of the 13.05 lakh who received the first jab, 10 lakh had taken the first shot more than three months ago. The recommended gap between the first and second dose is 12 weeks in case of Covishield vaccine and four weeks for Covaxin. Missing out the second dose means one is less protected, said Dr Sanjeev Burman, Agra district immunization officer. “It means that if you are exposed to the infection, you may get infected, and severely,” he added Dr AK Srivastava, chief medical officer of Agra district, said both doses are needed for adequate protection against severe Covid-19 infection and hospitalization. "We are prioritizing on administering the second dose to beneficiaries who have not got themselves jabbed even after the expiry of the prescribed interval between the two doses. There are around 10 lakh people who have missed the prescribed time for taking the second dose. We are calling them to complete the course of vaccination without further delay,” he said. Following orders of the central government, the health department has also started training the nursing staff for administering a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine to people above 60 years old and children in the age group of 15 to 18 years. Meanwhile, four new cases of Covid-19 surfaced in Agra district on Tuesday, taking the tally of active cases to 14, the highest in the last three months. The CMO said, “Samples of those who tested positive are being sent for genome sequencing to identify the variant of Covid-19. So far, no case of Omicron has surfaced in Agra district.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/10l-people-skip-2nd-dose-of-covid-vaccine-in-agra-dist/articleshow/88552276.cms||Deepak Lavania

On the second day of the in-person classes, the school handed out a notice to the student regarding a 15% fee hike from 2022-23 academic year. Parents in the city are miffed over the administration of several private schools in the city as they have started issuing fee hike notices some to the extent of 25% over previous year. Parents said that as much as the schools suffered financial burden, many of them also faced economic losses, some lost jobs and suffered pay cuts. The schools have chosen the wrong time for a fee hike as they were still recovering from the loss, they added. She said, “Schools have not cared to wait even for a single day to hand over the notice regarding the fee hike. I lost my job working as a receptionist at a three-star hotel in the city during the first wave. I recently joined a new place but have suffered from financial setbacks. I am a single parent and it is difficult for me to manage all the expenses.” Another parent whose son is studying at a prominent school in the city said on condition of anonymity that the school had raised the fee by 25 %. The parent said, “The fee structure of the school is flawed. The school effects fee hike when the child is in senior kindergarten, then again a hike when the child is in Std I because it is the primary section, and now this year for Std II also the school has announced a hike. Later, at Std IV the school will again hike the fee and in Std V also because they would be in middle school then. The way they plan the fee structure is exploiting the parents completely.” Schools have been sending fee hike notifications to parents since the news of school reopening had been coming in from the state government. Several schools in the city stated that the two years had been very difficult for the management and in many schools they stated that the hike which was due since the pandemic was kept on hold but it was difficult to survive further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fee-hike-notice-from-schools-in-hard-times-upsets-parents/articleshow/88553114.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Dakshina Kannada District BJP Arts and Culture Cell president Sarapady Ashok Shetty said that the night curfew restrictions will affect Yakshagana performances in the district. “The district administration should extend the night curfew deadline from 10pm to 12am for Yakshagana. Artistes are in distress due to the pandemic and lockdowns in the past two years. Professional artistes and their families have suffered financial crises when Yakshagana programmes were banned during lockdowns. The night curfew has been imposed at a time when the Yakshagana season has just begun. Several shows that were booked earlier have been cancelled. As a result, more than 900 artistes from 30 troupes will be jobless,” Shetty said. The delegation also sought a meeting of all troupe heads immediately, to find a solution to the issue. “If the district administration fails to take necessary steps, artistes and their family members will stage a protest in front of the deputy commissioner’s office,” the delegation warned in their memorandum. Rajesh Gujaran, manager of Sasihitlu Yaksagana Mela, S A Varkadi, manager of Mangaladevi Mela, Bappanadu Mela manager Vinod Kumar Bajpe, Sunkadakatte Mela manager Ramesh Kulshekhar, Nagashakti Mela manager Santhosh Shetty Kadthala and artistes were part of the delegation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/artistes-demand-night-curfew-exemption-for-yakshagana/articleshow/88552278.cms||---

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) health department had submitted a proposal for procurement of insecticides for curbing vector-borne diseases. The committee led by its chairman Prakash Bhoyar has asked the department to submit market rates before the panel. “The panel will only give its nod to the department for the purchase of insecticides once it is satisfied with the comparison of rates,” Bhoyar told mediapersons. He said the demand for comparison of market rates had been taken following the bogus contracts scam and another scam of procuring 14 items in NMC at higher rates, as pointed out by Congress corporator Sandeep Sahare. He added that for any proposal henceforth coming before the panel for a purchase (procurement), comparison rates of the products will be sought and only then will the panel will give its nod to the administration. The panel gave nod to the administration to spend Rs60,63,800 for setting up generator system for an oxygen plant and air conditioning system at paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on the Nagpur University’s (NU) Jamnalal Bajaj new administrative building premises. NMC has converted NU’s new administrative building into a 100-bed hospital in anticipation of the third wave of Covid-19. Of the Rs60.63 lakh, Rs32,52,100 will be used for setting up generator for the oxygen plant and Rs28,11,700 for installing air conditioning system at PICU and NICU there. The panel also gave its nod to scrap nine fire tenders that have completed 15 years of life span. It also approved the provision for NMC’s fire and emergency services department of Rs2.99 crore for purchasing three fire tenders with a capacity of 5,000 litre water. The department will scrap and replace the nine tenders in three phases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/standing-panel-stalls-proposal-seeks-market-rates-of-insecticides-for-comparison/articleshow/88553825.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Tikait urged people to "save" the holy city from forces seeking to disrupt peace by inciting riots in the name of religion. The farmer leader was in Mathura to end the 421-day protest held by Samata Foundation in support of farmers' sit-in in Delhi against the Centre's agriculture laws. “Mathura ko Muzaffarnagar mat banne dena (Don’t let Mathura turn into Muzaffarnagar),” Tikait said. Without naming any political party, he said some parties are trying to polarise voters and, hence, attempting to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere in Mathura. “As of now, people of different faiths are able to offer prayers peacefully here, but some are trying to create a communal divide and incite riots. Do not fall into their trap,” Tikait told the crowd. "People cast votes on development, not conflict. The government should focus on its work. Basic problems such as cleaning of the Yamuna should be their focus, and a law should be enacted to ensure guaranteed MSP (minimum support price) for farm produce,” Tikait added. Several political leaders in recent weeks have made controversial statements regarding the disputed site in Mathura. Earlier this month, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya tweeted: “Foundations of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi are underway, and preparations are on for Mathura now.” A few days later, UP cabinet minister Chaudhary Laxmi Narayan Singh stated: “If Lord Krishna's temple is not constructed in Mathura, will it be made in Lahore or Rawalpindi?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/efforts-on-to-disrupt-peace-dont-let-mathura-turn-into-muzaffarnagar-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/88552289.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Kolkata||Classes continue as univs, colleges give winter break a miss||Kolkata: Students and teachers at Jadavpur Universty, Presidency University and several colleges affiliated to Calcutta University have had to sacrifice their winter break to make up for lost time and to finish syllabus. Before Covid times, college students used to enjoy a seven-day leave during Christmas and New Year. But the scene changed this year, what with campuses remaining shut for most of 2020 and 2021 owing to the pandemic and physical classes resuming as recently as November 16. Authorities at several institutes felt they could not afford the winter break, and accordingly, drafted a roster. JU and Presidency are also continuing with their normal routine of a combined online-offline classes. Partha Pratim Ray, physics professor at JU, said, “We never have scheduled vacation from December 25 to 31. But during this time, many departments have semester break. But this time, classes are going on according to normal routine.” Teachers at several CU-affiliated colleges, like Lady Brabourne College, Maulana Azad and Surendranath, have set up class timings, after consultation with their students. Lady Brabourne College has permitted a few departments, like botany and microbiology, to conduct offline practical classes during the holiday. At the same time, other departments have been holding theory classes online. Lady Brabourne principal Siuli Sarkar said, “Teachers had requested to hold practical classes during the winter break and we allowed them to do so after confirming that students were also ready to attend classes.”  Syllabus of semesters III and V have been completed in many CU colleges as the university has declared that online exams will be held from mid-January. For those students, the classes are mainly being held to clarify doubts. Surendranath and Maulana Azad colleges have also started internal assessments. “A few departments are holding internal assessments as we need to complete all the internal tests by January 7. Online classes are also going on for activity-based lessons, to clear doubts to fill the learning gap,” said Surendranath principal Indranil Kar. Teachers of Maulana Azad College and Bhawanipur Education Society are holding online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/classes-continue-as-univs-colleges-give-winter-break-a-miss/articleshow/88553122.cms||---

Bhagwat Doiphode, the resident district collector has confirmed that the vaccination centre at the district collectorate has been made functional from Monday afternoon. On the first day itself, 10 people who wanted entry into the district collectorate were vaccinated, while on Tuesday, another 8 people were vaccinated, he said. A large number of people from across the district come to the district collectorate for some or the other work. Since vaccination has been made mandatory for getting entry inside the district collectorate, people had to return without getting their work done. With this in mind, the Nashik revenue employees association, Nashik municipal corporation, Nashik district election department and Nashik unique health care have started vaccination centres, said officials from the district collectorate. Meanwhile, a similar facility has been started at Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan a few days back after the no vaccination no entry rule was implemented there. Beneficiaries who have not taken the vaccine so far or have taken only the first dose and their second dose is due, are vaccinated at these centres. Doiphode said that district collector Suraj Mandhare has also appealed to the heads of various departments to set up similar centres if possible given the flow of visitors to their departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vaccination-centre-set-up-at-district-collectorate-office/articleshow/88551431.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Nagpur||Donations in cash and kind keep charity running||Nagpur: “I am a Sikh, but had to cut my hair during 1984 riots. We were in Satna then, I was 16 years old,” says a frail Jasmeet Singh. The typical Punjabi accent is evident. Singh, who worked as a shop assistant, had paltry earnings. He had a divorce and finally ended up on the streets. He has been at the Missionaries of Charity (MoC) centre here for some years now. Another man in a wheelchair hopes to join his children soon. “They are all in Mumbai. Now that I am fine, they would take me home,” he says. Milind Joshi remains quiet and just says he is from Jabalpur. He had lost leg in an accident. It appeared like a normal day at Shanti Bhavan — the MoC centre which is the permanent home for most of such individuals. The news of ministry of home affairs (MHA) blocking foreign funds had little impact here yet. ‘Jai Ishu’ (hail Jesus) greeted some of the inmates. The staff clarified there is no stress on conversions or religious preaching. The Missionaries of Charity was established in 1950 by Mother Teresa. Shanti Bhavan was started in 1978. A part of the land was donated by a Parsee family and another chunk came from the government, said a nun who took TOI around. She refused to be named, however. No photographs read a signboard. TOI took a peep into the centre in the light of the MHA action. “We only take in the elderly destitute. Most of them are brought by the police. Two of them were sent from a government hospital, as they had none to take care of,” she said. The nun stressed that the criterion is strict. Only the old and not in a position to take care of themselves are admitted. No fresh admissions happened after the Covid lockdown. Of course, in last some months, inmates from the shelter in Mumbai were shifted to Nagpur. “Mumbai was getting overcrowded, but we cannot stop letting in people... so some were shifted here,” she said. The centre here gets local charity, both in cash and kind. Families donate food, cash or even cheque. However, the major part of the funds come from the MoC unit in Mumbai, which is the apex centre. The centre at Nagpur maintains an account with Central Bank here. The bank balance and other funds available at the disposal are just enough to meet expenses for a month or a some more days. Funds need to be received from Mumbai centre in regular intervals or else there can be a crisis, said a source. The monthly expenditure comes to over Rs2 lakh. The major expenses include power bill, staff salaries. Then there are medicines for psychiatric patients, the bill for which runs up to a lakh, said the nun. Shanti Bhavan at present has 180 inmates, the capacity is to hold 200 in all. Majority of them suffer from psychiatric disorder and need medicine. There is a tie-up for getting medicines from the Regional Mental Hospital, but the supply falls short. As some of inmates watched television, one of them asked if he could get any job outside. Centre for children shut over documentation woes The Missionaries of Charity also ran a centre for children at Gaddigodam, which has ceased operations around six years ago, said a person whom TOI interacted with. Certain documentation had to be maintained online for which we did not have the resources. The centre was shut down due to it. Now, another institution runs a palliative care centre for cancer patients, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/donations-in-cash-and-kind-keep-charity-running/articleshow/88553827.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Surat||Gujarat’s first all-woman team rescues, tags leopards in wild||SURAT: Seven Gujarati bens are giving Bear Grylls a chase for his money by re-scripting his popular adventure series Man vs Wild literally with their own version of ‘Women Vs Wild’ tackling extreme challenges as a team rescuing and tagging leopards in the wild. The forest department in Surat district has formed a team of seven daredevil women for leopard rescue and RFID tagging. This motley group from Khodamba round of Mandvi range in Surat district has achieved expertise in their craft by successfully rescuing and tagging 20 leopards with RFID this year. Interestingly, these women do not fear leopards any more and believe that the wild cats are not enemies of humans. “Once we were controlling fire in Mandvi range of the forest when a leopard crossed us a few feet away. It was one of the closest encounters. But since we are trained, our team did not react and the feline left the spot,” said Pooja Singh, a beat forest guard. While it’s not the animals that they dread, it’s the encounters with human anger that these women find more life-threatening like the episode in Madharkui village. “In one of the toughest rescue operations, we caged a leopard from Madharkui village forest after it killed a four-year-old girl. However, we could leave the village with the animal alive only after firing in the air,” said Neha Chaudhari, range forester. The team is trained and after getting a request for rescue, it inspects the location, prepares a plan for rescue, installs cages and trap cameras to capture the movement of the animal. The team also examines tracks of the leopard. “Besides leopards, the team also rescues injured monkeys and treat injured birds during Uttrayan,” said U D Raulji, range forest officer, Mandvi. “They work in the most sensitive areas of wildlife and forest cover. The women’s team is doing a brilliant job of rescuing and managing locals,” said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forest, Surat. “They are the most committed and highly motivated team who are powerful in multiple ways. They set examples for other women. It is a matter of pride for the forest department,” C K Sonawane, chief conservator of forest, Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/7-women-team-up-to-rescue-tag-leopards-in-wild/articleshow/88553151.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

According to the ‘Ease of Living’ Index, 14 UP cities have been considered better in terms of living in the country. While Lucknow has been ranked the best place for living in the state, Varanasi is the second. Among small cities, Jhansi has been considered to be the best. Among all states, Lucknow has been ranked 26th among big cities, followed by Varanasi. Jhansi has ranked 34th among smaller cities. “The vaccination campaign, agricultural reforms, development of Ganga Basin corridor for organic farming, clean Ganga mission, sustainable energy solutions, uplift of marginalised communities and villages like Vantangia and Musahar have helped transform UP. The state has become easier to live in owing to a slew of public welfare schemes like better housing, sanitation, easy access to LPG connections, free electricity connection to the poor etc,” said a government spokesperson. He said that the One District-One Product scheme had contributed to improving the rural economy and increasing the per capita rural domestic product. Infrastructure development, focus on law and order, construction of greenfield townships, Noida Film City, special initiatives for tourism, and development of expressways and airports made life easier for people in the state, he added. “Projects like Ujjwala Yojana have helped people get easy access to cooking gas. Meanwhile, the state government has declared all 652 local bodies as Open Defecation Free through schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Swachh Bharat Mission for rural and urban areas,” he said. The banking correspondent sakhi programme, under which the government has trained rural women in banking processes and is making banking facilities available at the doorsteps of rural citizens in the state is also being held as a major achievement of the government in ease of living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-tops-in-ease-of-living-index-rankings/articleshow/88554371.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Ajanta/Diaspora cricket||Kolkata: Non-resident Bengalis, in the city this festive season after a two-year Covid break, played cricket at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday to bring together the living bridge of communities across the UK and India. Winter is when Bengalis settled abroad visit their elderly parents and families in Kolkata. But the prolonged travel restrictions have made it extremely challenging for them to be in their City of Joy for nearly two years. Much as the Bengal diaspora and the UK university alumni, featured in T20 format match, were looking forward to safer Christmas and New Year, the omicron variant cast its spell on the much-awaited HSBC Indo-British Heritage Cup. Planned for months by the London-based Bengal Heritage Foundation (BHF), which promotes the state’s rich cultural heritage among the diaspora, at least 30 members cancelled their visits at the last moment. But 25 were able to make it to participate in the gentleman’s game at the Mecca of Cricket, the Eden Gardens, on Tuesday morning. Several Kolkatans turned up to cheer the two teams – “India in the UK” and “UK in India”. The former was 160 not-out to the latter’s 157/6. The “India in UK” team made of BHF and the Indo-British Scholars Association, which has its membership base among Indian students who have studied in the UK. Nicco Park CEO Rajiv Kaul led this team. The “UK in India” consisted of the British Deputy High Commission and the British Council, with Nick Low, the British Deputy High Commissioner to Kolkata, as its captain. “It feels amazing to be able to end the year on a high note with a wonderful game here at the Eden Gardens, on a bright, sunny day under blue skies,” smiled BHF general secretary Amit Guha. The head of supply chain strategy, Marks and Spencer, added, “It was a fantastic way to strengthen the living bridge between the UK and India.” BHF’s outgoing president Sourav Neogi said, “I came specially for the cricket match, spent seven days in quarantine and did my testing on the eight day. Terribly missed our friends who had to opt out at the 11th hour.” The setback notwithstanding, the event was a success. “The match celebrated the close historical and contemporary connections between India and the UK through the shared passion of cricket,” said Debanjan Chakrabarti, director British Council, East and Northeast India. A unique art work, commissioned for the match, was presented to CAB president Abhishek Dalmiya, chief guest. The 3D work, structured like Kolkata’s Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial, and London’s Shard and Big Ben on a cricket ball, designed by University of Arts, London alumnus Samrat Som represents the Indo-UK “living bridge”. It will feature in the upcoming cricket museum at Eden Gardens. Vox Amit Guha: I am glad we could beat the odds to be a part of this match at Eden Gardens. Many of our friends from UK had to cancel the trip because of omicron. Sourav Neogi: In cricket, there’s a lot of shared heritage between the two countries, culminating in the historic 1983 World Cup victory at the Lords.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ajanta/diaspora-cricket/articleshow/88553142.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Pune||Crowd swells at Pune rly stn amid MSRTC strike||Pune: Daily passenger traffic at the Pune railway station has increased considerably due to the ongoing strike of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) staffers, which entered its 50th day in the Pune division on Tuesday. As per Pune rail division officials, October saw an average daily passenger traffic of around 65,000 per day, which rose to 68,000 in November and 73,000 per day in December, till date. Rail officials attributed this partly to the ongoing lack of intra- and inter-state buses. “General traffic in trains has also increased, alongside the strike. Crowds are swelling at the station. Many find it difficult to get buses and opt for trains. At present, Pune Junction has 224 trains originating at and passing through it. A close eye is being kept on the crowds due to Omicron,” a rail official told TOI. According to current regulations, only those with reserved tickets are allowed to travel; even those with waiting tickets are not allowed. In case of local and DEMU trains, only those who are fully vaccinated can apply for and get a universal travel pass, which gets them monthly season passes from ticket counters. Arun Jadhav, who earlier travelled between Pune and Nagpur on MSRTC buses, now opts for trains. “The fares are similar, but getting a train ticket to Nagpur is difficult as in most trains, seats in all classes are booked. One has to somehow adjust and travel. With only a few ST buses running now, it is extremely difficult to get tickets. Fares of private buses are not less than Rs600-700,” said Jadhav, a small-time businessman. Central Railway recently said chain pulling incidents in Pune division between January and October this year were higher than the last two years, despite only those with reserved tickets being allowed in. Against 655 cases this year, last year saw 326 cases, and 2019 had 356 cases. “This clearly indicates that many people are illegally travelling in trains despite regulations. The railways need to come up with a solution for the same,” said Harsha Shah, chairman of the Railway Pravasi Group. ‘Decision on MESMA this week’ With just 150 ST buses plying from Pune, state transport minister Anil Parab told TOI that a call on whether to slap the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA) on striking workers will be taken by this week. “We have tried everything to convince them. But many have refused to join work. Under these circumstances, there is no choice left but to impose MESMA on them. The assembly session got over on Tuesday and we will meet on the same issue on Wednesday for a decision,” Parab said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crowd-swells-at-pune-rly-stn-amid-msrtc-strike/articleshow/88553140.cms||Joy Sengupta

In its highest daily tally for the month of December, the state recorded 44 cases, out of which 25 infections surfaced in Dehradun alone. The state capital was followed by Nainital (10) and Haridwar (3). “These are all scattered cases not related to a particular location,” said Dr Tripti Bahuguna, director-general of the family and health welfare department of Uttarakhand. With this, the cumulative tally of Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand has now surged to 3,44,843 while the total count of related deaths remains at 7,416. Currently, the hill state has 227 active Covid-19 cases and a sample positivity rate of 0.30%. Meanwhile, Uttarakhand's chief secretary, SS Sandhu, has issued an alert to all the district magistrates saying they should take a call on whether to put a cap on the number of attendees in a wedding and other festivities depending on the case count in their respective jurisdictions and also in tandem to the fresh Covid-19 guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and welfare. The DMs have also been asked to form district-level teams comprising administration, police and health department officials to ensure that all the isolation, quarantine and containment centre-related works are executed well within the proper time frame. Earlier, on Monday, the Uttarakhand government announced a night curfew in the state from 11 pm to 5 am.

This brings the total number of such vehicles to six. The staff of these vehicles reach remote parts of four tribal talukas to vaccinate the beneficiaries. This project was started last month in association with an NGO — Swades Foundation. Initially, two such vaccination on wheels vehicles were started and from Monday, four more vehicles have been started. District woman and child development officer Kailas Bhoye said, “We had done an agreement with the NGO to start vaccination on wheels in four talukas of Peth, Suragna, Trimbak and Igatpuri. The Mumbai-based NGO was to give four ambulances for vaccination on wheels. At the time of MoU, they had given us ambulances for Surgana and Igatpuri and four ambulances were yet to arrive. Now, the remaining four ambulances have come.” “Now we have six ambulances in four talukas. Two each in Trimbak and Surgana and one each and Peth and Igatpuri. The staff like the vaccinators, data operator and driver are provided and paid by the NGO itself,” he added. The Nashik ZP is putting in all the efforts to complete the vaccination of the beneficiaries all over the rural district. The tie-up with the NGO for the vaccination is a part of the same, said Bhoye. A large number of tribals go out for work in the daytime and come home late in the night, leaving them with no time to go to the vaccination centre. Through these ambulances, the aim would be to get such villagers vaccinated as soon as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/4-more-vehicles-bring-vaccine-drive-to-tribal-homes/articleshow/88551448.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The installation, which will be on permanent display outside Sambhaji Park on JM Road, was inaugurated on Monday by city mayor Murlidhar Mohol. The lung installation, the centrepiece of the setup, is designed to replicate the function of the human lung. The white material that forms the exterior of the lung structure is made from HEPA filters. “Over time, as the structure is exposed to more pollutants, the colour of the exterior will change slowly to a shade of brown, and if there is tremendous exposure, it will eventually change to black,” said Sharmila Deo from Parisar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lung-installation-to-drive-home-pollution-problem/articleshow/88553130.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

These population estimates were shared by the Centre with the Maharashtra government on Tuesday in order to begin preparations for the expansion of the drive.  Vaccination for the underage group will open from January 3, while booster shots for senior citizens will start from January 10. The Centre has said that only Bharat Biotech's Covaxin will be used for vaccination of those aged 15-18 years. There was no clarity on the vaccine type to be used for senior citizens as booster shots. The Centre has also clarified that seniors don’t have to produce any medical certificate to prove their comorbidities, although they have been advised to get prior advice from their doctors.  While Maharashtra is estimated to have more than 80 lakh senior citizens, the Centre has estimated that 20% could have comorbidities. Dr Pradeep Vyas, state’s additional chief secretary (health), said the Government of India (GOI) has gone by Registrar General of lndia’s (RGl) data. “It is only an estimate and probably not very off-the-mark. They have taken 20% of the state's 60-plus population,” he said.  Mumbai’s corresponding number of senior citizens eligible for booster shots is likely to be around 2.5 lakh of a total population of 11 lakh. However, the city will have more than 9 lakh adolescents to vaccinate. In the wake of rising cases, the drive would be intensified, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The corporation was planning to take the drive to colleges directly. But after being advised against it by the Covid taskforce, they have decided to create special time slots within existing vaccination centres, Kakani said.  Dr Sachin Desai, state’s immunisation officer said the state has more than 50 lakh doses of Covaxin to begin the vaccination of adolescents.  “We have already started getting a lot of queries from younger people wanting to take the shot,” he said. Across the state, no new vaccination centres will be added since the existing ones are seeing lesser footfall as it is. The Centre, in an online meeting held with the states on Tuesday, emphasised that the expansion of the drive from January shouldn't hamper the ongoing drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/60-1l-in-15-18-yrs-group-eligible-for-vaccination-in-maharashtra-centre/articleshow/88554375.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Dehradun||Locals claim money ‘wasted’ in Kumbh beautification projects||Haridwar: Locals in Haridwar are blaming the administration for "wasting money" on beautification projects at the Kumbh Mela and on the renovation of the city's junction and tri-junctions. Some residents questioned the quality of the projects as well. Meanwhile, an RTI reply revealed that agencies that did not have any experience of construction managed to get contracts from the Haridwar Roorkee Development Authority (HRDA), which spent Rs 2.38 crore on beautification work. A total of 16 junctions and tri-junctions were beautified and renovated for the Kumbh mela by HRDA. Many newly constructed tri-junctions were also constructed once again. Social activist Ratanmani Dobhal told TOI, “Money was spent for development of the Chandracharya Chowk, Ayranagar Chowk, and Balmiki Chowk while these junctions were in good condition.” He added, “Similarly, work done by the HRDA was of sub-standard quality and a complete waste of public funds. An inquiry should be set up in the matter.” On the other hand, an RTI revealed that agencies that got the beautification work done had no specific experience in civil work. RTI activist JP Badoni told TOI, “Agencies working in the marketing and art fields managed to get the work. An inquiry should be ordered immediately.” Locals claimed that they also raised questions about the quality of work at the time of beautification.  However, they said that neither HRDA nor the Kumbh Mela administration took any step. HRDA secretary Uttam Singh Chauhan told TOI, “I joined after the Kumbh Mela and no complaint has been received so far. We will take action if we receive such a complaint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/locals-claim-money-wasted-in-kumbh-beautification-projects/articleshow/88552309.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Nagpur||A fire that ignited the flame to give one’s best||It was early morning of January 9, this diarist was leaving in a car for Bhandara to cover an unfortunate incident when a colleague Sarfaraz Ahmed called saying that he too would be joining on the assignment. At least 10 premature babies had died after a fire broke out in the neonatal care unit of Bhandra District General Hospital at around 2am. After getting a green signal from the resident editor, both Sarfaraz and this diarist reached Bhandara without wasting much time. The hospital had become a fortress after the cops cordoned it off looking at the scheduled visits of a large number of politicians including ministers and netas from the opposition. The hospital staff was in shock and didn’t talk much about the incident, making our work difficult. Taking it as a challenge, this diarist and Sarfaraz did multitasking after being requested to do live reporting for Times Now and Mirror Now along with The Times of India. We managed to break the news about the administration trying to cover up the issue by letting in the parents and relatives of children from the back door to avoid media. Besides keeping track of the happenings at the hospital throughout the day, we even visited the houses at far off villages where the state government proactively sent financial help the same day to parents who had lost their kids in the incident. Though it was a sad and unfortunate incident, this diarist along with the colleague tried to do justice to the assignment as a journalist by putting the best efforts to bring out the reality which was well appreciated by our seniors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-fire-that-ignited-the-flame-to-give-ones-best/articleshow/88553844.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Amit Shah targets Akhilesh Yadav on raids, says A is Apraadh & C corruption for Samajwadi Party||LUCKNOW: Union home minister Amit Shah slammed Samajwadi Party on Tuesday saying the letters of the alphabet stand for various ills of the Akhilesh Yadav-led political outfit and for them A stands for ‘Apraadh and Aatank’ (crime and terror), B for ‘Bhai-Bhatijawaad’ (nepotism), C for ‘Corruption’ and D signifies ‘Danga’ (riots). “BJP has destroyed this distorted form of SP’s ABCD...,” Shah said, while addressing rallies during Jan Vishwas Yatra in Hardoi and Sultanpur. He said the recent GST intelligence and income tax raids on some SP ranks left Akhilesh with ‘too much stomachache’. “He (Akhilesh) became so disturbed that he started terming the raids as politically driven. Now, he is not able to answer the public when Rs 250 crore cash has been recovered from a perfumer,” said Shah, in clear reference to the arrest of Kanpur-based businessman Piyush Jain whose premises were raided by Directorate General of GST Intelligence and huge amount of cash was recovered. While BJP has been linking Jain to SP, the latter has been vehemently denying it. Shah, however, remained unmoved and questioned: “Whose money is this after all. It is the money of the poor public which was looted and kept in the house of the perfume businessman.” The raids are in accordance with BJP’s poll promise of a ‘crackdown on black money’, he added. The home minister’s charge marked BJP strategy to corner the opposition on corruption as it gears up for the high stakes UP polls. BJP ranks have been firing a barrage of salvos at SP, which has been seeking to emerge as the most potent political rival to the saffron dispensation. Shah also flayed the opposition for invoking Dalit icon BR Ambedkar and speaking about ‘Dalit Kalyan’ only at the time of elections. “The Congress insulted Ambedkar. It is the BJP which gave him the due respect,” he said, pointing out how Ambedkar’s birth anniversary on April 14 is now observed as Samrasta Diwas and November 26 as Constitution Day. This was besides the construction of memorials of Ambedkar at various places in India and abroad, he added. Shah then targeted the Congress for raising the ‘Garibi Hatao’ slogan but doing nothing to get rid of poverty. On the other hand, he said, since BJP came to power under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, around 42 lakh people have got houses, more than 2.6 crore families got toilets, 1.66 crore received LPG connections and 16 crore people got covered under Ayushman Bharat scheme entailing free medical aid up to Rs 5 lakh. Raising the issue of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, Shah reiterated that SP, BSP and Congress conspired to get it stalled. “People will not forget who fired bullets at karsevaks,” he said, while referring to the 1990 incident of firing on karsevaks by the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. Shah further said that Congress, SP and BSP were against repealing Article 370 granting a special status to Jammu and Kashmir. “But the BJP government went ahead and repealed Article 370 from the Constitution in August 2019,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shah-targets-akhilesh-on-raids-says-a-is-apraadh-c-corruption-for-sp/articleshow/88554373.cms||Pankaj Shah

City police claimed that they have not received a single application seeking permission for New Year’s Eve party falling on Friday. The police are also also yet to get any guidelines from the government about it, said sources.Every year, until the pandemic struck, private and commercial party events were organized at different places. Sources said that the recent state government orders on increased night curfew timings from 11pm to 5am may have played spoil sport. However, looking at the rise in number of Covid-19 cases along with instances of Omicron variant, many restrictions, including limiting the number of people, social distancing and other safety rules, may have scuttled all celebration plans. J N Desai, DCP special branch confirmed that the city police has not received a single application for any event for Friday. He said that even if they happen to receive any, they will grant permission only after the government issues specific guideline on it. At present, curfew violators found roaming without valid reasons after 11pm will face legal procedures, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/no-applications-for-dec-31-party-so-far/articleshow/88553178.cms||---
---||Lucknow||SP chief questions BJP’s silence, retorts to ‘ABCD jibe’||Lucknow: In an apparent response to Amit Shah’s attack on the SP using alphabetical acronym, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who was in Unnao during his Vijay Yatra, took to twitter to shoot back. He said shaken by incidents in Hathras, Agra, Gorakhpur and Lakhimpur even supporters of the BJP are now saying A for ‘Ab’, B for ‘Bhajapa’, C for ‘Chhor’ and D for ‘Di’ (We have shunned BJP now). The SP chief went on to question the BJP leadership on their ‘silence over promises they made in their manifesto’. Speeches of BJP leaders have no mention of whether farmers’ income has been doubled or not whereas in reality it has been halved because of the rise in prices of fertilizers and fuel which they use for irrigation and tiling fields, Akhilesh said. People want to know the number of government jobs that the BJP has given. But the leaders do not talk about it, he said. “What to talk of doubling farmers’ income when the son of Union minister of state for home intentionally mowed down farmers under his jeep as per police probe. They have even reduced the quantity of fertilizers per bag. This is how BJP has humiliated farmers,” the former UP CM said. He went on to attack the BJP for the rising prices which has hit the poor and the middle class hard. “On top of that the poor are being made to pay hefty bills for the power supply because the government failed to increase the power production by a single unit in the past four and a half years. Meritorious students have not been provided tablets and laptops, another poll promise of the BJP which they have forgotten,” he said. Akhilesh went on to accuse the chief minister of lying to the people on the issue of deaths due to lack of oxygen during the second wave of Covid. “The chief minister says no one died due to lack of oxygen. How misleading can one be,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-chief-questions-bjps-silence-retorts-to-abcd-jibe/articleshow/88554387.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Ahmedabad||Winner takes it all: I feel like a celebrity now, says Tokyo paralympics silver medallist||Tokyo Paralympics silver-medallist Bhavina Patel is in a totally different space now. The fame associated with a medal-winning feat, the felicitations bestowed upon a winning sportsperson in a country starved of success at the international level and the way people have taken to para sports after her medal, has made the para table tennis player feel like a celebrity. "My medal at the Paralympics totally altered the perspective of people towards para sports," she told TOI. She says she had got success earlier too, but it largely went unnoticed. "Very few knew me before my achievements in Tokyo. But, after I won the medal, the respect I got makes one realize the amount of hard work you’ve put in as a player," she adds. A lot of awareness has been generated, she says, through her Tokyo success. "Government and civil society organizations have started pitching in. Now, achievements of para athletes at tournaments get highlighted regularly," she says. She also wants the government to identify sportspersons at grassroots level, nurture them and provide support. "Taking up sports as a career is an expensive affair. One needs to invest a lot of money to become an international-level athlete." For now, the Ahmedabad player, who was all praise for the platform provided to her by Blind People’s Association that works towards empowering people with disabilities, is focused on training with an eye on the 2022 Commonwealth Games and Asian Games. Elavenil Valarivan: That Elavenil Valarivan made it to the Olympics based on her performance is in itself a creditable achievement. Making her maiden Olympic appearance, the Tamil Nadu-born, Ahmedabad-based shooter, who was the top-ranked player in the women’s 10-metre air rifle event, finished 16th in the qualification round. Failure to make it to the finals was a disappointment which was worsened by non-qualification for the finals of the 10m air rifle mixed team event. However, Elavenil is counting on the experience gained at the event to improve her game. Yastika Bhatia: Vadodara girl Yastika Bhatia made her international debut for India this year. The 21-year-old was selected to play against Australia in all three formats of the game. She toured Australia and played three one-day internationals, two T20Is and one Test. She scored a match-winning 64 in the third ODI in Mackay and added solidity to India’s middle-order batting. Yastika has captained the Baroda Under-23 team besides playing for the India A team that won the ACC (Asian Cricket Council) Women’s Emerging Asia Cup. Axar Patel: Nearly 7 years after playing his first ODI for India, Axar Patel made his Test debut in Chennai in February. He took 7 wickets in the match, including a five-for in England’s second innings. He took 20 more in the next two Tests as hapless English players struggled to read him. He took 9 wickets against New Zealand in the two-Test series to end the year with 36 wickets in five Tests. He also made 179 runs at 29.83 to prove his utility as an allrounder. Maana Patel: Backstroke swimmer Maana Patel made it to the Olympics via the universality quota. She failed to win her heat and could not breach her personal best mark. However, she termed the race a good learning experience going forward. How she builds on her debut Olympic appearance is something that will be watched with keen interest. Ankita Raina: Ankita Raina began the year on a bright note. The Ahmedabad-born tennis star qualified for the Australian Open doubles only to lose her opening-round match. The disappointing exit was followed by a victorious doubles campaign which saw her lifting the WTA Phillip Island trophy. She became the first Indian woman after Sania Mirza to get off the mark on the WTA circuit. This was followed by first-round doubles appearances at the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. The crowning moment came when she qualified for the Tokyo Olympics. But she and partner Sania after being on the doorstep of victory in their opening-round match, faltered and exited. Chetan Sakaria: The Saurashtra left-arm pacer lost his younger brother during a Mushtaq Ali Trophy match in January but overcame the tragedy and had a good tournament. He was picked by Rajasthan Royals in the IPL auction and had an impressive tally of 14 wickets in the season. He was dealt another personal blow when his father died of Covid in May. Undeterred, Chetan carried on and made his debut in an ODI against Sri Lanka in Colombo on July 23. He took two wickets in the match and went on to play two T20Is against SL on that tour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/winner-takes-it-all-i-feel-like-a-celebrity-now-says-tokyo-paralympics-silver-medallist/articleshow/88553875.cms||Sabu Cherian
---||Kochi||Peta files complaint over bullock cart race in Malampuzha||Kochi: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has filed an FIR in Palakkad against persons involved in an illegal bullock cart race which took place at Malampuzha on Dec 8. The animal protection group had learnt about the incident from the media which carried pictures of two bulls being forced to run and their nose ropes being pulled violently. Peta officials said that they came to know of the incident last week and sent a complaint to the district police chief. The FIR includes the provisions of Sections 3 and 11(1)(a) of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, which makes whipping and beating an animal and causing the animal unnecessary pain and suffering punishable offences. The FIR also includes Sections 289 and 337 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. “The Supreme Court and the high court of Kerala have made clear that bull races are illegal, and there’s no place in civilized society for whipping bulls and twisting and biting their tails, as is common at such events, to force them to run,” says Meet Ashar, Peta India associate manager of emergency response. “Bulls used for work already have a hard life without the additional torment of being forced to race. We commend the Palakkad police for showing that cruelty to animals will not be tolerated,” Ashar added. During races, bulls run out of fear, and to escape pain. They are commonly yanked by their nose ropes to the starting line, hit with bare hands and weapons like nail-studded sticks, and their tailbones are often broken at the joint in attempts to force them to run faster, Peta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/peta-files-complaint-over-bullock-cart-race-in-malampuzha/articleshow/88553194.cms||TNN
---||Lucknow||After Varun’s swipe, Maneka shares stage with Shah at rally||Lucknow: A day after BJP’s Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi took a swipe at his own government, including the one in UP, saying it should be decided “if our priority is to contain pandemic or to indulge in a show of strength” during elections, his mother and Sultanpur MP, Maneka Gandhi on Tuesday shared the stage with Union home minister, Amit Shah at a rally in Sultanpur. Shah acknowledged her presence by calling her name along with other senior party leaders and MLAs from the district. Maneka’s presence at Shah’s rally marked her affirmation for the party leadership, as against her son Varun, who has been signaling a hard stance against the dispensation over a host of issues including the farmers’ unrest and the Lakhimpur violence in which the son of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, Ashish, is one of the prime accused. Maneka had earlier shared the stage with PM Narendra Modi during the inauguration of the 540km-long Purvanchal expressway on November 16. Varun on Monday had cited a Centre’s note to the Maharashtra government in March 2021, which, he highlighted, had said that measures such as night curfews and weekend lockdowns have “very limited impact” on containing or suppressing the transmission of Covid. Stressing on the limited health infrastructure of UP, Varun said it has to be decided “honestly” if our priority is to contain the dangerous Omicron variant of coronavirus or “to indulge in a show of power during polls”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-varuns-swipe-maneka-shares-stage-with-shah-at-rally/articleshow/88554400.cms||Pankaj Shah

The cops said that the accused Kishor Ahir had come from Maharashtra when the cops intercepted his car. “We were conducting routine checking in Sagbara when our team spotted a car and tried to stop it. Ahir, who was driving the car, didn’t stop and instead fled in the direction of Dediapada,” said K L Galchar, Sagbara police sub-inspector. The cops chased the car for about 2km and managed to stop the vehicle. “When the car was checked, we found a skin that looked like that of a tiger. We took the accused to the police station and informed the forest officials. When questioned, the accused didn’t deny that it was tiger skin. He said that he used the skin while conducting some rituals,” Galchar added. The police said that there were some other men in Ahir’s car but they got out of the car when it was intercepted and fled. Ahir, a resident of Nandurbar district in Maharashtra, told the police that those accompanying him in the car had bought the skin. “We suspect that the accused used the skin in some rituals or to dupe people by convincing them that it brings good luck. The forest department will now conduct a further inquiry in the case. We have handed over the animal skin to them. It will be sent for the FSL test,” Galchar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/one-held-with-animal-skin-similar-to-tiger-in-narmada/articleshow/88553014.cms||---

The rescuers lowered a net into the well and the leopard, sensing that this was its only chance out, climbed into it.  The net was then carefully lifted out of the well. After being lifted out, the leopard was transferred to the Rescue Centre in Rani Bagh, Nainital, for medical examination. The entire exercise took about three hours. Balwant Singh Shahi, regional forest officer, said, "The exercise had to be executed with painstaking care. After it was pulled out of the well, the feline was caged.

---||India||India approves Corbevax, Covovax vaccines for emergency use||NEW DELHI/HYDERABAD: The drug regulator on Tuesday approved two new Covid vaccines — Serum Institute of India’s Covovax and Biological E’s Corbevax — for restricted use in emergency situation. The regulator has also granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) to Molnupiravir, which has shown promise in early use in treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults, having nearly halved the risk of hospitalisation and death. Biological E managing director Mahima Datla told TOI that Corbevax will be the most affordable and one of the safest Covid-19 vaccines. “We have already produced 200 million doses that are stocked in our cold room. We hope to complete government’s 300-million doses order by February 2022,” Datla said. The 20-dose vials of Corbevax, to be given in two doses of 0.5ml each at a gap of 28 days via intramuscular injection, can be stored between 2-8 degree Celsius. The approvals by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) assume significance as they will expand the basket of jabs providing people with more options. Approval of Molnupiravir, developed by Merck and its partner Ridgeback, is also touted as a game-changer for high-risk individuals and people with weakened immunity as it is the world’s first medicine to treat symptomatic Covid-19. Around 13 major local pharmaceutical companies have received permission to manufacture the drug. “Congratulations India. Further strengthening the fight against Covid-19, CDSCO, @MoHFW_INDIA has given 3 approvals in a single day for: - CORBEVAX vaccine - COVOVAX vaccine - Anti-viral drug Molnupiravir for restricted use in emergency situation,” health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted. India still has at least two more promising candidates in the vaccine pipeline that may get approval next year. Gennova Biopharmaceuticals has developed India’s first mRNA vaccine called HGC019, which is currently under Phase 2/3 trials. The company is expected to complete the process by January-end. Bharat Biotech is also developing a nasal vaccine, which the company says cuts transmissibility by attacking it at the point of entry — nose and upper respiratory tract. The vaccine has completed Phase 2 trials and is also likely to seek early approval in 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-approves-corbevax-covovax-vaccines-for-emergency-use/articleshow/88555029.cms||---

Forest department has given an NOC to the municipal corporation for it. But residents are not happy with the decision as they worship most of these trees. According to sources, more than 100 trees will be felled while nearly 70 trees will be translocated by the forest department and the municipal corporation. However, these century-old trees cannot be shifted because of their sheer size. A few trees were chopped on Tuesday while the rest will be removed before New Year eve, sources said. Samir Kumar, divisional forest officer, Bareilly, said most of these old trees have completed their life cycle. “In case a tree is declared a heritage tree, then we ask the development authorities to look for an alternative plan,” he said The DFO added that the permission to cut the trees on Stadium Road was sanctioned before he took charge. “The trees that can be saved are being translocated in collaboration with Bareilly Municipal Corporation to areas provided by them. At the same time, plantation drives are carried out across the city to ensure its green lungs are maintained,” he added. But for residents who revere these trees, it is a matter of sentiment. Faiz Khan, a resident, told TOI, “We never wanted development at the cost of trees. The city is already grappling with the issues of pollution and rise in temperatures. Trees are our only saviours. Unfortunately, there is no unity among the people and no one has stood up for saving these trees.” Prabhat Jaiswal, 55, another resident, told TOI, “I have been seeing some of these trees since childhood. When I was young, I always used to take shelter from rain under the large branches of a banyan tree. Its leafy shade has been a refuge for many a fruit seller and cart puller on a hot day. These trees are home to many birds and squirrels. Now, all of them will be rendered homeless. I am in pain but can’t do anything to save them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/20-century-old-trees-to-be-felled-for-bareillys-smart-city-project/articleshow/88551515.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala's Secular Legacy Is Under Stress||Thiruvananthapuram: Politics in the state took a sharp turn in 2021 and grew more polarized with hate politics scaling new heights, even as conventional political parties struggled to put up a brave face and stay relevant. The changing political landscape led to a fair amount of organizational churning across all fronts, with almost all parties regardless of their electoral performance being forced to change their status quo at the organizational level. While the CPM laid to rest the age-old notion that it revolves around the all-powerful state secretary, the Congress proved that an apparently impossible leadership change is possible when facing an existential threat. The BJP surprised political opponents as well as rebels in its own camp by giving up the practice of effecting a leadership change after every electoral setback. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan proved more than one point in this year by shouldering the party and the government and winning a historical second term for the LDF in the assembly elections held in the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic and a spate of allegations against his government and party. The decisions to drop senior CPM leaders from the election fray, opening the doors of AKG Centre to the Kerala Congress (M) and the strategic hobnobbing with religious minority groups piloted by Pinarayi were all politically validated. Meanwhile, the drone of communal bigotry grew louder and assumed the proportions of a cacophony this year. The secular façade of many crumbled down as minority politics took an unusual turn. Parties like the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) felt the heat as the Left made inroads into many of its citadels and Muslim organizations like Samastha Kerala Jamiat-ul-Ulema publicly disowned the IUML’s plans to use mosques as venues for staging political protests against the LDF government. The UDF’s influence over Christian minorities weakened after religious minorities, for the first time, refused to come under one common flag. As bigotry got paraded as politics, at least a small section of people has started justifying murders, without any prick of conscience. Political commentator Roy Mathew says polarization within the minority groups was never this severe. Of course, it must have gotten more attention in 2021 for it being an election year. Till recently, minorities in Kerala used to rub shoulders with one another on matters of faith and rights but that camaraderie has been weakening with every passing day. "Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt’s call to keep vigil against Love Jihad and Narcotic Jihad and Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council president Cardinal George Alancherry’s statement that the Church was ready to accept the BJP government’s proposal to raise the legal age for women to marry show how far the Muslim and Christian community leaders have moved away from one another," he said. It became more evident this year that the church leaders could possibly take a political stand favourable towards the BJP, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/keralas-secular-legacy-is-under-stress/articleshow/88551498.cms||B S Anilkumar

The victim, Anand Sharma, a resident of Valsad, was assaulted when he tried to resist the robbers from grabbing his mobile phone, Sharma had come to Surat to meet her aunt.

Rizvi and Annapurna were present at the meeting, along with Ghaziabad's Dasna Devi temple head priest Yati Narsinghanand and right-wing organisation Hindu Raksha Sena president Swami Prabodhanand. They vowed to "organise such meets across the country". Prabodhanand said, “We are being name-called on social media...we are not 'fake saints'. All those who took part in the Dharma Sansad belong to akharas and other prominent organisations. We have decided to form a core committee to promote our agenda and organise such events across India.” Members of the committee added that they have submitted an application to the Haridwar police to lodge a cross FIR. SHO (Haridwar) Rakendra Singh Kathait told TOI, “We served notices to the two accused that were present in the (Dharam Sansad) meeting on Tuesday. More names will be added as we proceed with the probe.” Provocative speeches inciting violence against Muslims were allegedly made at the Dharam Sansad in Haridwar that went on from December 17 to 19.

Vehicles will not be allowed to ply on RK beach road. Restrictions will be imposed on the stretch from RK beach to Bheemili beach. Meanwhile, many hotels have already started preparations to hold events as part of New Year celebrations expecting permissions this year. To stop people from celebrating on the beach stretch, special police teams have been formed. The special team will check drinking in public places and bike races, besides conducting drunk drive tests at various places. Police are reportedly not giving permission to hold DJ parties or any other mass events in hotels and resorts too. City police chief Manish Kumar Sinha told TOI that the district authorities will discuss the issue on Wednesday. “There will not be any activity on the beach road, even gatherings. Public health is the priority, and not celebrations” he said. It means all events at hotels, cake cutting and gathering on roads, bursting of crackers and other activities will be banned. Sources in the police department said liquor outlets will also be closed much early on December 31. Traffic cops are planning to lay focus not only on busiest junctions but also places which are known to be gathering points of youth. A couple need to shell out not less than Rs 5,000 for New Year celebrations at a star hotel. Hotels have already started to mount political influence on the police, sources said. To discuss the ‘influence,’ the city cops and district administration will hold a meeting on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cops-ban-new-year-bash-on-beach-road/articleshow/88553199.cms||Siva G

The university will not be able to begin classes of the first-year students this year as the counselling for a number of courses like BTech (scheduled for December 21), BEd (scheduled for December 20) and others will continue till the last week of the month. “We won’t be able to teach this year as counselling is not over yet. Also another round of counselling will be held to fill vacant seats,” said a BBAU official. With Christmas holidays in the last week of December, the academic session will not begin this year. We have to take extra classes and cut on leave to bring back the derailed session on track, he said. Candidates who had applied for admission at the university said that the delay is increasing their stress levels as they are clueless about how the university will meet this time loss. “The delay is because of the university but we have to pay for it as now teachers will rush up with the syllabus,” said a BTech candidate Ankit. BBAU began the admission process for its UG and PG courses on August 13.

---||Lucknow||Chinks in Covid-19 vaccination shield appear after three months||LUCKNOW: Here’s why people who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 need a booster dose 8-10 months after completing the two-dose course, to prevent infections from new variants of novel coronavirus. A recent study by the blood and transfusion medicine department of King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has found that vaccine-generated antibodies start depleting three months after the course and after six months the levels drop below 50%. The study, done under the guidance of KGMU vice-chancellor, also found that 8-10 months after the two-dose course, antibodies dropped below 80% and one-fourth of the people even lost vaccine induced immunity fully. “Our study found that the level of antibodies generated after full two-dose vaccination start declining six months after the course. After eight or more months, 1 out of every 4 fully vaccinated person loses vaccine induced immunity. In the remaining three, average antibodies levels drop below 80% in comparison to the numbers generated after full vaccination. Such people are vulnerable to infection. Hence, the decision to give a booster or third dose to people who were fully vaccinated eight or more months ago is correct,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, head, transfusion medicine. “People who completed their vaccination course between January and April should get a booster dose as soon as the drive begins,” she added. She also emphasised that the declining trend of vaccine antibodies also makes it clear that even fully vaccinated people should continue to follow Covid safety protocols. The study was done on a sample of 500 fully vaccinated health workers divided into three groups. They were tested a month after completing the course and were found to be having adequate number of antibodies. The first group of 200 people had taken the vaccine 3-6 months ago. The retest found that though all of them had antibodies, the levels on an average had dropped by 42%. The second group was also of 200 peoplw who had completed the course seven months ago. The retest showed that 25 had lost vaccine induced immunity. The remaining 175 had antibodies, but levels had dropped by an average 68%. The third batch was of 100 people who had completed full vaccination eight or more months ago. No antibodies were found in 25 of them, while 75 had antibodies, but the levels on an average had dropped by 84%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chinks-in-vax-shield-appear-after-3-mths/articleshow/88554421.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Kheri violence: Key witness says no security despite SC order, claims threat to life||Rudrapur: Tejender Singh Virk, a key witness to the violence that took place in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, said on Tuesday that that despite the Supreme Court's order, the Udham Singh Nagar police has refused to provide him security. "My life is in danger and I have no one to protect me," he said. Virk, president of the Terai Kisan Sangathan and leader of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, suffered serious head injuries and was operated on at a multi-specialty hospital in Gurugram, Haryana, after a convoy of cars allegedly belonging to Union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish -- the prime accused in the case -- hit him along with the four farmers who died in the accident that day. "The people who mowed down farmers with their SUVs can kill me any time. Lakhimpur Kheri's SSP wrote a letter to Udham Singh Nagar's SSP, asking him to provide me security as I am a resident of Rudrapur. So far, nothing has happened. The SSP of Rudrapur said police will provide me security only on the day on which I am summoned to court. If anything happens to me, the BJP-led Union and state government will be solely responsible for it." The SSP of US Nagar in Uttarakhand, Daleep Singh Kunwar, said he has received the letter but the matter is under the jurisdiction of UP police. "We will ensure that the witness gets security when he goes to court. As far as providing permanent security is concerned, since the matter doesn't lie in our jurisdiction, we cannot take any action and it is the duty of the UP government to provide security to the witness," he added. Former Congress minister Tilak Raj Behar vowed to take the matter to Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami to "pressure" him into providing Virk security. "The Uttarakhand government is not providing security to Virk...There are several instances where CM Dhami has granted security to local leaders of the saffron party in Rudrapur. However, when it comes to securing a farmer leader, who is an important witness to the Lakhimpur incident, the BJP is not doing the needful. We will take this issue to the CM and request him to abide by the apex court's order," Behar said. The violence that took place in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 led to the deaths of eight people, including four farmers and three BJP workers. It happened ahead of the visit of UP's deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya. The special investigating team probing the incident has arrested 13 people in the matter so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kheri-violence-key-witness-says-no-security-despite-sc-order-claims-threat-to-life/articleshow/88550792.cms||Aakash Ahuja

In the last six days, they have taken action against over 200 such motorcyclists driving such ‘modified’ bikes. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP-traffic) Anand Bhoite told TOI, “We have not only challaned these motorcyclists, but also got their modified silencers removed, so that they cannot reuse them.” He added that silencers create a lot of disturbance and sound pollution in residential areas. Last year, Pimpri Chinchwad traffic police took action against 2,500 motorcyclists for using modified silencers. “We had warned garage owners against making modifications in silencers of two-wheelers. But they continue to do so. We have now decided to take legal action against garage owners, too,” Bhoite added. A resident of Bavdhan said, “In our locality, there are several such motorcycles. At night, loud sounds create immense disturbance for us.” An officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad traffic branch explained that the modifications are not legal. Section 190(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act (MVA) deals with vehicles that do not stick to prescribed standards of road safety as well as control of noise and air pollution, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/200-bikers-fined-over-modified-silencers/articleshow/88553219.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 'BMC lost Rs 2,000 crore due to unchanged property tax'||MUMBAI: State Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde told the state assembly on Tuesday that the BMC lost revenue worth Rs 2,000 crore as property tax in the city has not been hiked since the pandemic began. After he pointed out that the state had not yet waived property tax for dwellings below 500 square feet in the city in accordance with the Shiv Sena’s election promise, Shinde said this was under consideration, and the state would soon take a decision. “Every five years, there is a hike in the property. This time it would have been a 17% hike. However, given the pandemic, it was unfair to hike the tax. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray agreed to this. The revenue loss to the BMC is Rs 2,000 crore over the last two years,” said Shinde. Leader of Opposition and former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis pointed out that the Sena had not fulfilled its election promise of exempting dwellings of less than 500 square feet from property tax. “A total waiver was promised but only a small amount was waived,” he pointed out. The waiver has only been granted on the general tax component of property tax for homes below 500 square feet. There are 1.85 lakh dwelling units in the city that are under 500 square feet. Responding to the BJP, Shinde said, “We agree that there should be a complete waiver on property tax for dwellings below 500 square feet and a decision on this will soon be taken.” In the run-up to the BMC polls in 2017, the Shiv Sena had in its manifesto promised to abolish property tax for all flats up to 500 square feet in the city. It had also announced that dwellings between 500 and 700 square feet would get tax rebates. However, a waiver was subsequently granted only for the general tax component of property tax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-lost-rs-2000cr-due-to-unchanged-property-tax-in-mumbai-min/articleshow/88554429.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation to levy property tax in 23 merged villages, residents demur||PUNE: The civic body will start charging property tax from establishments in the recently merged 23 villages from the next financial year, starting April 1, 2022. Around 1.6lakh properties will be added in the tax ambit of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). On Tuesday, the civic standing committee approved a proposal regarding the same. PMC hopes to generate around Rs100 crore from the said levy per year. As per the proposal, PMC will charge only 20% of tax for the 2022-23 fiscal. This will rise to 100% by 2026, in a phased manner. PMC officials said the villages will be liable to give around Rs100 crore in the first year. “Before this, gram panchayats were charging the tax. It was around Rs90 crore per year. PMC will get more,” said Vilas Kanade, head of the property tax department. Elected members and citizens of the 11 merged villages added to PMC in 2017 have been demanding a waiver of water tax, claiming that they do not get adequate water since the last four years. They also want tax to be charged as per old gram panchayat rates. Now, the denizens of the 23 merged villages have made similar demands. Leader of opposition in PMC, Deepali Dhumal, said, “Hardly months have passed since the merger and PMC is not providing facilities. Even issues like payment of administrative employees from these villages have not been tackled. How can citizens be asked to pay such taxes in such a scenario?” An average of Rs2 per square ft was charged as property tax per annum by the gram panchayat. PMC charges Rs2 per sq ft per month, taking the tax amount up significantly to around Rs24 per sq ft per year. Citizens speak “Basic services like lifting and processing of garbage is not properly available for us. Other services like water supply are also absent,” said Saurabh Mate, a resident of Khadakwasla. “Even after the merger, we are still dependent on water tankers. Road infrastructure is bad. What is the point of charging for civic amenities when they are absent?” asked Vishal Harpale of Phursungi village.” “Nearly four years have passed since we merged into PMC. They do not provide water properly. Other facilities like drainage and solid waste management are lacking. Give us a valid reason to pay tax,” said Bhagwan Bhadale of Uruli village. “Municipal infrastructure is the worst in our villages. If we go by the past experience with 11 villages, the same will happen in the 23 villages,” said Shrirang Chavan of Dhayari village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-levy-property-tax-in-23-merged-villages-residents-demur/articleshow/88553230.cms||---

Under the jurisdictional directorate of STPI-Noida, the Meerut centre is the 54th centre of STPI in small towns. The minister said that the STPI centre in Meerut will play a catalytic role in empowering the tech start-ups and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) of the region to boost software exports and create employment opportunities, while attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and realizing the vision of Digital UP. In FY 2020-21, STPI-registered units contributed Rs. 4,96,313 crore to IT/ITeS exports, in which UP contributed Rs. 22,671 crore. With a total built-up area of 25,074 sq. ft., the state-of-the-art incubation facility at STPI provides plug-n-play space of 3,704 sq. ft. with 133 seats and raw incubation space of 2,021 sq. ft., while warranting high-speed data communication facilities. “The facility will also offer a vibrant ecosystem for creating a maker culture among the young techno-entrepreneurs and start-ups, while empowering them to develop innovative software products to address the challenges of India and the world at large. It will help in boosting the IT exports from the region and generating direct and indirect employment opportunities for the youth of the region,” said Rajeev Chandrashekhar. The union minister also said that the transformation that happened in UP during the last five years is immense and it encouraged various companies investing in technology to invest in UP. He maintained that digital India has played a key role in empowering students to become innovative and entrepreneurial. “The road to Digital India will be through Digital Uttar Pradesh,” he further added. STPI DG Arvind Kumar said that a Microsoft report suggests that large companies want to shift their operation from Tier-1 cities to Tier-2/3 cities for cost-effective production. STPI has embarked on dispersing the IT industry to these cities and also implementing the NGIS program to nurture tech entrepreneurs and startups in Tier-2/3 cities to develop innovative products in emerging technologies through seed funding." “Establishment of STPI centre is an important milestone towards empowering industries, startups and entrepreneurs to leverage the facility and contribute towards the growth of this city,” underlined Bhuvnesh Kumar, Joint Secretary, MeitY. STPI has also played a phenomenal role in promoting Tier-2/Tier-3 cities of the country. Out of 62 STPI centres, 54 centres are in Tier-2 and Tier-3 locations with an objective of uniform and overall development of IT/ITES exports across the country. STPI has been nurturing the tech start-ups ecosystem by implementing Next Generation Incubation Scheme (NGIS) and establishing Centre of Entrepreneurship (CoEs) in emerging technologies pan-India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/union-minister-inaugurates-software-technology-park/articleshow/88552411.cms||Ishita Mishra

Justice Viju Abraham directed for sending notices to ‘Pulsar’ Suni, actor Dileep, and Manikantan after considering prosecution’s plea challenging the trial court’s decision not to allow the demand. The court has said that notices can be served to the accused through the lawyers representing them before the trial court. At the trial court, counsels representing the accused had contended that the certified copies of phone call details issued by telecom companies should not be accepted as evidence. Following this, prosecution had approached the trial court with the demand to summon the original phone call records from the telecom companies and to summon additional witnesses to prove the records. Prosecution had sought to summon seven witnesses who had already deposed before the court, including a film producer, and had argued that nine more witnesses have to be summoned. However, the trial court had only allowed to summon three more witnesses, following which the prosecution approached the high court.

Hearing a petition filed by two farmers, Moku Venkat Reddy and Mahipal, of Ramaram village in Gandala mandal of Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district, the judge directed the state not to dispossess the farmers of their land. According to Paka Sai Santhosh, the counsel for the farmers, the state had issued a land acquisition notification in May 2018 to construct a distributor canal connecting the main canal of Nawapeta reservoir under the Devadula lift irrigation scheme. But the notification lapsed as there was no progress within the stipulated one year. “The state had to issue fresh notification, but it is going ahead with its plans without doing so and claiming that the irrigation project is the owner of our 6.5 acres. Revenue authorities had gone to the extent of making wrong entries in the record to threaten the resisting farmers. We made representation to officials to change entries in the records, but instead of doing that the state is going ahead to dispossess us,” the farmers’ counsel said. The judge noted in his order that petitioners are in possession of the land and they also received Rythu Bandhu benefit extended to farmers by the state in January 2021. The judge also did not agree with the version of officials that they had already taken possession of the land and stayed the acquisition process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-cites-rythu-bandhu-benefits-to-farmers-to-bust-govts-claims/articleshow/88553240.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Pankaj reiterated that the Centre was actively pursuing the matter with the law department and soon after receipt of opinion from it, the matter would be referred to a tribunal. Pankaj also assured the Telangana government that they would look into the issues raised by the state government on the alleged illegal irrigation projects taken up by AP on Krishna river. Somesh Kumar said Telangana had submitted six DPRs on Sita Rama Lift Irrigation Scheme (LIS), Sammakka Sagar Project (Thupakulagudem project), Mukteshwar (Chinna Kaleshwaram) LIS, Chowtpally Hanumanth Reddy LIS, Modikuntavagu Project and Channaka–Korata barrage on the Godavari to the Central Water Commission (CWC) in September this year. The DPRs are still pending with the CWC.  As per the decisions taken in the apex council meeting conducted on October 6, 2020, the jal shakti minister had requested chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao to withdraw the case from the Supreme Court to consider referring the matter to a tribunal under section 3 of Inter-State River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act 1956. Stating that the Telangana government had withdrawn its case from the apex court, Somesh Kumar urged the central government to take immediate action in this regard. Somesh Kumar also referred to five projects in Godavari basin – Ramappa-Pakala link project, Kaleshwaram project (additional 1 tmc per day), Kandakurthy LIS, Gudem LIS and PV Narasimharao Kanthanapally barrage – which were wrongly included in the unapproved list of projects in the gazette notification of GRMB and asked the Union secretary to delete them from the list of unapproved projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dprs-on-godavari-river-to-be-cleared-soon-centre-tells-t/articleshow/88553277.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Suspected ‘militant’ who was arrested from Mumbai hotel is actually just a conman||MUMBAI: A 32-year-old Kashmiri man who was arrested from an Andheri hotel, allegedly on suspicion of being a militant or anti-social element, turned out to be a conman who had duped people of crores after posing as the director of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Shaukat Ahmed Lone alias Dr Basith Shah was out on bail and had checked into the hotel 15 days ago to resume his fraudulent activities. He was arrested in August 2019 in Mangaluru, Karnataka, after he had duped several people across the country, promising them jobs with WHO. The accused, a school dropout, had collected Rs5 lakh to Rs10 lakh from each of his victims.  Lone was remanded to judicial custody on Tuesday after six days in police custody. He was picked up from the hotel on December 22 for fighting with the staff. The Sahar police, on inspecting his Aadhaar and PAN Card, found discrepancies in the name. Suspicions were further raised when the investigating team seized at least 12 leave and licence agreements that he had used to live on rent in different states. “Initially, we thought Lone may be a militant. A detailed probe showed that he is a conman and had checked into the hotel two weeks ago with the intention of conning job seekers. So far, no victim from Mumbai has come forward to report fraud cases. He was booked for cheating and forgery as his name on the PAN card was Lone, but the Aadhaar Card stated Dr Shah,” said an officer from the Sahar police station. The police had also arrested a lawyer from Bandra who had notarised a leave and licence agreement Lone had got recently. During the probe, the Sahar police learned that Lone — a resident of Ganjipora village in Ganderbal district, Jammu and Kashmir — had duped people in Belgaum, Goa, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Amritsar, as well as other places in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Jharkhand. Before he was picked up in Mangaluru in 2019, he led a lavish lifestyle and used to stay at swanky hotels. “The accused revealed that he had also uploaded his profile on a matrimonial site claiming to be the director of WHO and had duped many women. He used to roam around in an SUV with a placard identifying himself as the WHO director,” said the police. On August 17, 2019, the Barke police in Mangaluru stopped Lone’s Punjab-registered car, suspecting something was amiss. The car had a placard that stated both ‘WHO director’ and ‘Government of India’. His aide Baljinder Singh (48), who hailed from Mohali in Punjab, told the cops he had been driving Lone around for two years. They had travelled the length and breadth of the country in the same car, duping people wherever they stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-suspected-militant-is-actually-just-a-conman/articleshow/88554463.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Patna||Third wave of Covid pandemic has already begun in Bihar: Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said the third wave of Covid pandemic has already started in the state and all necessary arrangements were being made to save people from it. Inaugurating the 96th national conference of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) here, Nitish appreciated the role doctors in saving lives of people during the last two waves of the pandemic. “The doctors worked tirelessly risking their lives and treated both Covid and non-Covid patients when the first and second waves of Covid hit the state. They deserve all the appreciations,” he added. The CM said since the third wave of the pandemic has already started in the state, the health department was busy improving facilities at the hospitals as per the guidelines issued by the central and state governments. Nitish also informed the gathering about the works being done by the government to improve healthcare facilities in the state. “The Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) is being developed as a world-class facility with over 5,400 beds. The number of beds at NMCH and some other medical college and hospitals in the state was also being increased,” Nitish added. He said besides setting up new departments, the number of beds at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Patna was also being increased. “Nine new medical colleges have been established in the state,” the CM said. While assuring the medical fraternity of full government support, Nitish asked them to make people aware of the health problems caused by consumption of liquor and open defecation. He said since doctors earn a distinct status in the society and considered “god” by people for saving precious lives, they may contribute in bringing awareness in the society against social evils. Speaker of the legislative assembly Vijay Kumar Sinha, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, health minister Mangal Pandey, additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit, IMA state president Dr Ajay Kumar, secretary Dr Sunil Kumar, managing director of Ruban Memorial Hospital Dr Satyajeet Singh and about 5,000 doctors from across the country attended the national conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/third-wave-of-covid-pandemic-has-already-begun-in-bihar-nitish/articleshow/88552778.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Nano spray that speeds up homeopathy cure||VADODARA/ ANAND: A 16-year-old female in Anand was suffering from acute stiffness of neck that caused unbearable pain. She was not able to speak as even that caused neck pain. Three days after she started taking a homeopathic nano spray, both on the neck and internally, she got the much-needed relief. An Anand-based homeopathy practitioner has developed this new method through which homeopathy medicines — that are generally given to patients in form of globules sprinkled with indicated medicine — have been replaced by a spray, sureshots nano spray. “The advantage of giving the medicine as a spray is that it is very easy for the patient to take it. Also, the effect of the medicine is good and fast. The same spray can be taken orally, applied on the skin or in the nose as per the doctor’s advice,” said Dr Anshul Shah, a master’s degree holder in homeopathy science and a MD (hom) who has been practising homeopathy medicine for the last 22 years. After approval from the institutional human research ethics committee of Anand Pharmacy College, Anand, the trial of the spray method has been done on 100-odd patients. “The method of taking the spray is completely scientific, effective and based on the principles of Organon of Medicine by the Father of Homeopathy Dr Samuel Hahnemann. After the trials, we have received positive feedback from 90% patients,” said Shah, medical superintendent of Anand Homeopathic Hospital, run by Sri Ramakrishna Seva Mandal Trust. “Using the spray method, we could treat all the diseases which are treatable with homeopathy including cases of gastritis (acidity), skin ailments, hair loss, arthritis (joint pain), allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies), nasal polyps, a kind of allergy in which there is blockage and swelling inside the nose,” he claimed. The trials have been carried out on patients from different age groups — from infants to senior citizens — with no reported side effects. “This method may also be very useful to the patients admitted in the ICU or who are unconscious and cannot take globules,” said Shah, who has applied for patent for his invention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nano-spray-that-speeds-up-homeopathy-cure/articleshow/88552963.cms||Prashant Rupera

For the second consecutive year, their business is in doldrums thanks to soaring prices of raw materials like thread, bamboo and paper leaving even kite enthusiasts flying low. On top of it, the night curfew as part of the Covid-19 restrictions too is dampening the festival spirit as the night bazaar for Uttarayan will not take place even this year. Established kitestring manufacturers and traders from the city have been exporting special varieties of Surti manja to different part of the country and also across the globe. “There is around 30% rise in cotton yarn prices escalating manja costs further. Also the rising number of Covid cases and renewed restrictions including night curfew are adding to our worries,” Prakash Sadadiwala, a Manja maker, told TOI. “Curfew is also impacting orders from other cities as well. We had only restarted our business now for the season and once again Covid situation started worsening,” Sadadiwala added. Jayesh Mistry’s family has been running the kite and manja business for decades now. “Auction of kites and manja used to take place in the main kite markets of Rander, Bhagal and Dabgarwad area, a few nights before the Uttarayan festival. But this year too it will not take place due to curfew,” said Mistry. Firoz Sheikh, a kite manufacturer said that the kite and manja businessmen are expecting the government to give some relief in curfew timing before the festival. “We are strictly following Covid guidelines like social distancing, use of mask and sanitizer at our shops,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pandemic-cuts-strings-of-surats-kite-business/articleshow/88553250.cms||Mehul Jani

This was revealed by Rai Anup Prasad, the arrested director of the company which got the contract from the government. Indications are that some of these printing units did not have a printing machine and so they outsourced the job to someone else.  On November 28, UPTET was cancelled after a question paper was leaked on social media, leading to the arrest of 38 people. At least 20 lakh students were scheduled to write the examination at 2,736 centres in two shifts. A senior STF said the paper leak of UPTET took place because of involvement of multiple agencies. “Rai Anup Prasad had outsourced it to agencies which did not have any printing facility and these agencies had passed on the order to other agencies,” the STF officials added. As many as 12 firms have come to fore which were given contract to print question papers. STF officials said as per rules, the printing of any examination paper is kept a top secret until the day of the examination. However, Rai Anup Prasad compromised entire process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uptet-paper-leak-12-noida-delhi-firms-under-stf-lens/articleshow/88554431.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||40 panchayats vaccinate 99% of eligible population with 1st dose||Coimbatore: Around 40 panchayats in the district have managed to vaccinate 99% of their eligible population with the first dose of Covid vaccine so far. The number of panchayats achieving this feat should have been more considering the fact that more than 94% of the eligible population is vaccinated with the first dose in the district. Health officials said that many panchayats have only a few people left for achieving 99% vaccination. For instance, Arisipalayam, Nachipalayam, Orattukuppam and Seerapalayam panchayats in Madukkarai block need to vaccinate 10-15 people in each panchayat to reach 99% vaccination. “Most of these people are highly-hesitant to getting vaccinated from the start. We have tried several ways, even pointed out to the spread of a new variant, but these people are not ready to get a dose,” a health official said. The state government had announced commendation certificates to panchayat and health officials who have achieved 100% vaccination. “But the fall in Covid cases in the past few weeks has made people less receptive to the vaccination drive,” the official said Mass vaccination camps had helped in increasing the number of vaccinated, but number of camps conducted in the past 3-4 weeks have come down. “There was a shortage of volunteers to conduct vaccination camps in the district,” said another health official. A senior health official said that the number of vaccination camps had to be reduced in the recent weeks due to unavailability of nursing students, who used to volunteer. “Nursing college students have exams and they were preparing for it. We expect them to return after Pongal and the vaccination may go up then,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/40-panchayats-vaccinate-99-of-eligible-population-with-1st-dose/articleshow/88553271.cms||TNN

In the early hours of December 26, the suspects had triggered a blast at a private bank’s cash dispensing machine at Chimbali near Alandi and stolen Rs16 lakh.

There are 1,400 ATM kiosks in Pimpri Chinchwad. It is not possible to provide security to each one of them.” He said that the people should also co-operate with the police. “In the Chimbali case, one of the residents had heard the blast.

---||Nagpur||Home isolation will help control Covid: Experts||Nagpur: City’s software professional Amar Diwakar (name changed) returned from Dubai and was detected Covid-19 positive in the RT-PCR test. Diwakar, 35, was absolutely fine and had no symptoms. He was asked to go to the MLA Hostel quarantine centre as home isolation is not allowed in Nagpur. Instead, Diwakar decided to get himself admitted to a leading private hospital as he had an insurance cover. After a nearly week-long stay in hospital, he realized that the insurance company denied his claim. “They said all my vital parameters like SPO2, blood pressure were absolutely fine. I was not even prescribed paracetamol and I was unfit for the hospitalization criteria of Covid-19. I had to pay the charges from my own pocket,” said Diwakar. Many like Diwakar, who prefer private hospitals over free institutional quarantine centres, are suffering from a similar problem just because home isolation is not allowed in the city. Nagpur is probably the only city in India where ‘home isolation’ of asymptomatic or mild symptomatic Covid patients is banned. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has strategically banned ‘home isolation’ before the festive season of 2021 citing the reason that people often violate the isolation rules and become spreaders. Despite this move, the city has reported more than 100 new patients in the last 4 days and the demand for home isolation has once again been raised. TOI spoke to experts who also backed this demand of positive patients terming it ‘beneficial’ for all. Doctors who are treating Covid patients said home isolation to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients as per the ICMR norms should be allowed in Nagpur as it has more benefits than drawbacks. “At present, we need more tests. Unfortunately, only contacts of positive patients are undergoing tests. Spontaneous testing has already been reduced. Home isolation will boost spontaneous tests,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. “There are cases where people have conducted the rapid test, detected positive, and decided not to conduct RT-PCR just because they don’t want to go to the Covid Care Centre or hospital,” said physician Dr Harshwardhan Bora. Interestingly, some of the VIPs who have tested positive in the last four-five days are reportedly recovering in home isolation, though they are ‘officially’ shown admitted in private hospitals. BENEFITS OF HOME ISOLATION Legal | As per the ministry of health and ICMR, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients should be sent to home isolation Better | Common experience of physicians that mild patients do recover fast in home set-up Tests | More people will be encouraged to get tested as the fear of living away from family won’t be there Awareness | Even mild symptomatic will get themselves tested to keep family members safe Load on hospitals | As many prefer hospitals over CCCs, workload on doctors will lessen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/home-isolation-will-help-control-covid-experts/articleshow/88553273.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The police said that Abhijit Katke’s relative, 39-year-old Vikas Kadam, lodged a complaint in this regard. “Katke’s watchman fled with the valuables from the residence, after which the family members conducted a search for him in the village and some other areas before approaching the police and filling a complaint,” said a police officer. The closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras of the bungalow recorded the entire theft incident, and cops are now studying the footage to help their probe. “The watchman is seen entering the bungalow premises,” informed the police. The bungalow is located at Vitthalwadi near Loni Kand, off Pune – Ahmednagar highway. Katke’s father Chandrakant and Katke had gone to their regular wrestling talim for their daily workout, when the theft took place. They had locked the bungalow before going out. Senior police inspector Gajanan Pawar of Loni Kand police told TOI, “The Katke family had hired the watchman just about 15 days ago. He knew the timings of family and executed the theft with his accomplice.” “We are still searching for him,” added the police. Maharashtra Kesari is an Indian-style wrestling championship, established in 1854 in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/valuables-worth-rs-28-lakh-stolen-from-kesari-winners-home/articleshow/88553274.cms||---

The proposal was dropped when some of the councillors, who represent these localities, demanded for the same while saying that Glada had funds for development works and it will be better if MC does not take over these colonies as of now. Congress councillors Vineet Bhatia and Umesh Sharma said, “We cannot afford to bring these colonies under MC jurisdiction because most of the time the civic body is without funds but GLADA on the contrary has enough funds for the same.” They said they did not get funds from the civic body in the past as well. Mayor Balkar Sandhu, however, said if councillors object to the proposal, then they cannot move ahead with the same. Officials have been sitting over this proposal to take over these colonies for years. The technical teams of MC and GLADA conducted a survey in the colonies to check what kind of basic amenities are absent in these colonies. The officials claimed that some street lights, roads, bridges and other works are pending in these colonies and roughly Rs 21 crores will be spent on the work. If this proposal had been given approval, then the GLADA would have paid this one time amount to civic body for carrying out the development works. In the proposal, the colonies which were supposed to be taken over included Sector 32-A and Sanjay Gandhi colony, Central Park and green belt EWS pocket and static compactor site 32 sector, Sector 33, 100 square yards pocket in Sector 38, Sector 39-A, commercial pocket in Sector 39, Sector 40, commercial pocket and parks in phase IV Focal point Dhandhari Kalan, Phase 3 Dugri Road, 200 feet wide byepass Dugri Road, Missing link, Dugri Road, commercial pockets phase 1 and 2 urban estate Dugri, Railway under bridge near Lodhi Club, commercial pocket canal colony site near Nehru Sidhant Kendra, old court site and Old Kotwali site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-rejects-proposal-to-take-over-18-colonies-from-glada/articleshow/88552447.cms||---

No arrest has been made as police said they are probing the authenticity of the complaint. Earlier, the doctor had pressed charges against her and four of her associates for extorting money from him. The incident dates back to November 8. The doctor had alleged that the woman had consented to intimacy but filmed him without his knowledge. Thereafter, she stormed into his clinic with her “husband” and three others. The group created a ruckus and beat up the doctor, demanding Rs2 lakh. The group stayed in the clinic till the wee hours of the next day, until the doctor paid them off. After some time passed, they harassed him again for Rs50,000 more. The doctor then decided to approach the police. The cops have since learnt that the man who had introduced himself as the woman’s husband was not so. Four individuals were arrested, the fifth is on the run.

---||Pune||Pune cantonment board clears Rs 1.2 crore of Rs 48 crore water tax dues||PUNE: The Pune cantonment board (PCB) has cleared Rs1.2 crore of Rs48 crore water tax dues, which Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) claims are payable by the board over the last four years. The move comes close on the heels of the Ministry of Defence’s Directorate General of Defence Estates extending a Rs12cr non-recurring grant-in-aid to the cash strapped PCB to enable it to overcome the ongoing financial stress to some extent. Individual water connection holders in the PCB areas collectively owe another Rs29cr to the PMC. “We have received the first instalment towards the outstanding dues and a follow-up for the remainder is going on,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water supply department. “We are hoping that the cantonment will clear dues at the earliest,” he added. Recently, the PMC had suspended water supply to the Pune cantonment for a day over the issue to send a “stern” message to the PCB to clear the dues. Amit Kumar, the PCB’s chief executive officer, told TOI on Tuesday, “The partial payment has been made after we had a preliminary discussion on the issue with the PMC authorities last week. Our board president will also hold a meeting with the PMC officials next week to discuss all issues and work out short and long-term solutions. We have decided to clear the pending amount in instalments.” A PCB official said, “We have also sought from the PMC details about all 394 water connections. Some of them have been closed in the last few years, but the PMC is still sending bills for these connections. In some cases, we have found that the PMC is applying commercial rates for residential water connections.” The PCB and PMC authorities had closed 109 illegal connections. However, about 70-80 connections of them have again been restarted by some of the citizens illegally in the last two years, said the PCB officials. “Water supplied to PCB administrative buildings, hospitals, schools, and gardens are considered commercial connections. That is why the water bills of these connections amounted to Rs22 crore alone. This needs to be addressed,” said another PCB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcb-clears-rs-1-2cr-of-rs-48cr-water-tax-dues/articleshow/88553284.cms||Sandip Dighe

These include some books and a diary of Ranjeet with information of some contacts. On Monday, the officials reached the Ludhiana jail and again frisked the barracks of Ranjeet and Sukhwinder. They took along some notebooks, diaries, and books. The officials reached there after Ranjeet stated that he had noted down some important contacts in his diary kept in the jail.On December 23, dismissed cop Gagandeep Singh had died and at least six people were injured in the blast. Gagandeep is the prime accused and the duo is suspected to be involved with him. A jail official said, “The officials visited the jail as Ranjeet and Sukhwinder had told them that they have a diary there in which they have written about some contacts. Since the police are tracing all the links, the officials took their belongings.” A senior police officer said, “It’s not yet clear how Gagandeep reached the city. Since we are suspecting the involvement of more people in this case who could have helped him by dropping him at the courts complex or by providing the explosives, we are scanning all links of the three. The details of all their previous accomplices are also being checked and they will be traced.”On asking about the car without registration number plate recovered from the complex, the officer said, “We are still working on it.”Meanwhile, the NIA team again visited the spot on Tuesday. The debris of the blast has not been removed from the complex yet. The second floor is sealed for the visitors and only advocates are allowed there and that too after their identity proofs are checked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/probe-agencies-visit-city-jail-seize-belongings-of-suspects/articleshow/88552454.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Duo held in suicide bid of escort could be cop informers||MUMBAI: A probe into the death by suicide of a woman, a movie struggler and who worked as an escort in Jogeshwari (W) last week has found that the two accused arrested for abetment and extortion had claimed to be from an organization “National Crime Bureau” and were not NCB officers nor did they hold NCB ID cards.The Amboli police that registered a suo-motu FIR has seized the identity cards (National Crime Bureau) that they used to threaten the 25-year-old victim, a West Bengal resident, who ended her life on December 23 after paying around Rs 8 lakh out of the Rs 20 lakh ransom that they demanded from her to not trap her in a case of drugs and escort service. Police probing the case learned from the duo, Suraj Pardeshi (38) and Pravin Valinbe (35), that they knew how the police raids were carried out. But they did not reveal whether they had been involved in similar offences in the past. “We are trying to gather information on whether there are any such cases where the gang has extorted money from any other women or high profile people. The exact modus operandi and the total number of people they blackmailed and extorted will be known once the three absconding accused are caught,” said an Amboli police officer. The entire fiasco for the victim began after she partied at a hotel on December 20 and received a call from Pardeshi, who informed her that an NCB team was going to raid the hotel on the basis of a tip-off received that an escort service is run in the hotel and she is the prime suspect. “The duo and the three wanted accused are suspected to be a police informant. The accused gets details of the victims through people known to them or they may be keeping a track of people by visiting hotels,” said the officer. The victim ended her life three days after she was blackmailed and threatened for Rs 20 lakh ransom. She was a struggler and was trying to get an opportunity in films. “She got into escort service and Pardeshi knew about it which he tipped off to his gang members to extort,” said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-duo-held-in-suicide-bid-of-escort-could-be-cop-informers/articleshow/88554473.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Aurangabad||No more general duties at police station: Aurangabad IGP Prasanna||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad range special inspector general of police Mallikarjuna Prasanna, in order to optimise the existing police force and focus on the core duties and responsibilities, has done away with general duties of police constables at the police station level. Giving much-needed relief to police constables, Prasanna has ordered that none of the investigation officers, from the rank of naik police constable to assistant sub-inspector, should be given more than 30 cases per year. Moreover, for every task the police personnel does, he or she should be given a reward. The directives have been implemented across 87 police stations spread across four police units of Aurangabad rural, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad. The police personnel removed from general duties have been trained and posted as beat constables as well as investigation officers, helping police on multiple fronts, including disposal of cases and visible policing. “Except for essential duties like duty officers, character certificate, wireless, crime, inward, we have done away with the concept of general duties,” Prasanna said. The officer, citing example of a constable from Chandanzira police station in Jalna handling 87 cases in one year, said, “The IOs fear that they may be overburdened with fresh cases if they complete the cases at hand. So, they keep cases pending with them.” As a solution to the problem, Prasanna ordered that every constable from NPC to ASI should not be given less than 20 and no more than 30 cases each year, so that they get sufficient time to do quality probe in non-serious offences. “If he or she is found to have completed probe in 30 cases and have filed their charge sheets in a span of eight months, he will not be burdened with any fresh case,” Prasanna said. To keep a track of every case, a dashboard has been developed and it sends a reminder messages to the IO about the remaining time limit for every case he is probing. Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Nimit Goyal said by implementing the directives, since January this year, out of the 11,700 cases pending from 2015 to 2021, 9,411 cases have already been disposed. The officer added that earlier he had 219 IOs from constabulary, but now he has 310 due to which his unit has been able to dispose 7,858 muddemal cases, 542 unclaimed vehicles and have rescued 665 of the 775 missing people. For all these works, 145 police officers have been given 597 rewards and 936 constables have received 2,639 rewards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-more-general-duties-at-police-station-aurangabad-igp-prasanna/articleshow/88551617.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Ludhiana||From missing manhole covers to streetlights, ward issues dominate meet||LUDHIANA: This year’s last MC general house meeting was all about missing sewerage manhole covers, streetlights and other small issues of wards. Despite mayor Balkar Sandhu’s repeated requests to talk about the entire city, the councillors kept on arguing about their ward issues. There were also heated arguments between Congress councillors and Lok Insaaf Party councillor Harvinder Kaler over doubting the working of purchase committee chairman and Congress councillor Jai Parkash. In the meeting, SAD councillor Sarabjit Singh Laddi raised the issue of missing sewerage manhole lids at Rahon Road. He said despite repeated requests, the officials did not issue new covers even as public suffered. When Congress councillor Jai Parkash informed the House that around 700 new lids have arrived, councillors raised hue and cry, saying they did not get even one, with the officials refusing to give them. Then, Kaler raised questions on the purchase committee members and said without their checking material at store, they were made to sign papers. Congress councillors, including Mamta Ashu, started arguing with Kaler for pointing fingers at senior-most councillor Jai Parkash. The mayor pacified them and asked Kaler to apologise. The SAD councillors came in support of Jai Parkash and said they have faith in him. The mayor asked the zonal commissioners to take regular meetings with councillors to resolve the ward matters, so that larger issues could be discussed in the House meeting. He advised the councillors to start thinking about the city and give valuable suggestions, so that residents get better services. When service regularization agenda was being discussed, Congress councillors Gurdeep Neetu and Naresh Kumar said they had never seen the sweepers who were recommended for regularisation of services from their wards. It led to a spar between the regularisation committee members and both the councillors. The mayor asked the committee members to check the lists again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/from-missing-manhole-covers-to-streetlights-ward-issues-dominate-meet/articleshow/88552478.cms||Nidhi Bhardwaj

---||Kolhapur||As tourist footfall increases, Kolhapur roads choke up||Kolhapur: Vehicular traffic movement in the Kolhapur city was out of gear most of the day on Tuesday. Even ambulances had trouble making their way out of the traffic jams at road crossings. In most cases, motorists were only thinking of finding some way to move ahead, without paying heed to traffic signals or the traffic cops. The sudden rush on city roads can be attributed to the increased number of visitors to the Mahalaxmi temple and tourists headed towards the Konkan who have to pass through the city. The main roads, such as the old Pune-Bengaluru highway, Bindu chowk, Dabholkar corner, Darasa chowk, Gangavesh and Rankala, were jammed. The traffic police personnel said the traffic situation started worsening since Christmas. Things are likely to stay the same till December 31. The policemen are on the streets. During the day, they manage the traffic, and at night, the act against curfew violators. “We have traffic diversions in place and all our staff is on the ground. Though the traffic has increased, people are finding their way to reach their destinations safely,” said city traffic inspector Sneha Giri. The Mahalakshmi temple is overcrowded. Many are angry as despite increase in footfall, the number of entry passes alloted are just 1,500 per hour. “We cannot increase the number of the devotees in the temple to more than 1,500 per hours as it would be difficult to manage social distancing and other Covid related measures,” said Shivraj Naikawade, the secretary of Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/as-tourist-footfall-increases-kolhapur-roads-choke-up/articleshow/88551621.cms||---

Several players also brought in capital to accelerate their growth. Fuelling its inorganic growth, Ahmedabad-based diversified business conglomerate, Adani Group, made a slew of acquisitions in different verticals. Healthcare and personal care businesses also witnessed mergers and acquisitions through the year. KKR invests in Vini CosmeticsGlobal investment firm KKR invested $625 million (Rs 4,600 crore approx) for a controlling stake in Vini Cosmetics, the maker of top deodorant brand Fogg.

While homegrown private equity firm ChrysCapital acquired 27% in Corona Remedies Private Ltd for an undisclosed sum, JM Financial Private Equity pumped in Rs 60 crore in Canpac Trends Pvt Ltd, a packaging solutions company from Ahmedabad. EV, medical, edu-tech startups gain bigLacked by the digital boom since the pandemic, tech startups were among the big gainers in Gujarat’s startup ecosystem. Be it fintech firms or those in the edu-tech, electric vehicle or even medical technology sector, startups have gained big. For instance, Edutech startup, Learn Vern, raised Rs 7.3 crore in April. Ahmedabad’s omni-channel retailer of generic medicines, Medkart, raised Rs 40 crore in series-A round in November. According to industry experts, a maturing startup ecosystem, easy access to startups through a network of angel investors, witnessing other investors gain from exits are propelling more funds into startups. While investors are looking at value creation through startups, technology, medical devices and pharmaceuticals are three sectors which saw a major boom since the pandemic and startups in these segments were natural gainers, according to industry stakeholders. Covid drug sales skyrocketThe sales of antiviral remdesivir jumped to record 3.49 lakh vials across Gujarat in April. Similarly, sales of antiviral favipiravir also spiked with 1 crore tablets of 400 mg and 34.47 lakh tablets of 200 mg being sold in April. The sales remained high during March and May in the second wave. Stock investors breach 1-cr markWith share markets attracting new investors, the number of stock investors from Gujarat on BSE crossed 1-crore mark. The leading bourse saw its registered investors from Gujarat jump to 1,00,12,127 on November 30. AUM for MF breaches Rs 1L croreIn 2021, investors in Gujarat kept their hopes high on equity-linked mutual funds. The assets under management for equity-linked MFs in Gujarat breached the benchmark level of Rs 1 lakh crore and settled at Rs 1,00,437 crore in May 2021, according to data compiled by Association of Mutual Funds in India. Financial consultants suggested that fresh inflows in equity MFs by investors in anticipation of better returns along with rise in net asset value of existing investments drove the surge in AUM. Gujarat’s GST collection creates new recordRising prices of finished products and raw materials coupled with pent-up demand fuelling consumption during the Diwali festive season drove the goods and services tax (GST) collection to record-high levels in Gujarat in November. The state’s tax collection in a single month stood at Rs 9,569 crore – up 26% year-on-year. There was record-high tax collection for the second consecutive month after GST mop-up in October 2021 settled at Rs 8,497 crore. Increase in industrial production along with surge in raw material costs caused a surge in overall tax mop-up in the state during both these months. Adani in $100bn m-cap clubLed by Asia’s second-richest man Gautam Adani, Adani Group catapulted into the coveted $100 billion market capitalization club on April 6. Riding on sustained rally in stock prices of its companies, the conglomerate’s m-cap has since remained above $100bn and joined the league of Tata Group, Reliance and HDFC. Taking a hitChip shortage hampers auto supply chainWith the global semiconductor shortage intensifying as 2021 progressed, the automobile supply chain continued to remain disrupted. The waiting period for new vehicles, including cars and luxury bikes, increased from a fortnight to as high as 6-9 months. Dealers failed to cash-in on the improvement in demand and market sentiment. Even manufacturing plants of giants, including Suzuki Motor Corp in Hansalpur and Tata Motors in Sanand, announced curtailing production in regulatory filings, in the wake of intensifying global chip shortage. Cyclone batters shipbreaking, salt, onion processing industries: Cyclone Tauktae hit onion dehydration units in Bhavnagar district’s Mahuva town, located some 110 kms from Diu where the cyclone made landfall. The world’s largest shipbreaking yard at Alang in the district too witnessed noticeable damage. A substantial amount of salt was also washed away. Ford Motor Co announces exitIn a major setback to Motown Sanand, US-based automobile major, Ford Motor Co, announced the shutting down of its passenger vehicle manufacturing units in Sanand and Chennai. Ford, which had entered Gujarat with an investment of Rs 4,000 crore, will wind up manufacturing by the fourth quarter of 2021. While the firm will continue with engine making in Sanand, the exit plan has left workers in a lurch. Dealers are also worried about inventory. Fuel prices at record highPropelled by surging crude prices, the price of petrol and diesel touched record high in Gujarat. While petrol price touched Rs 106.65 per litre on November 3, diesel too touched Rs 106.1 a litre. Since April 15, fuel prices went up by 22% — the steepest rise in prices. After reduction in tax, petrol price is consistent at Rs 95.12 a litre and disel at Rs 89.13 a litre. Meanwhile CNG and natural gas too have seen price revision multiple times. Surging raw material prices impact productionBe it coal, steel or cement prices or those of cotton and cotton yarn or basic chemicals and polymers, a dramatic surge in raw material costs was the bane for Gujarat’s manufacturing sector for most part of 2021. Over a six-month period from April to October, imported coal prices nearly tripled from Rs 5,000 a tonne to Rs 16,000 a tonne. Coal is a key input material for running thermal power plants, boilers and furnaces across several industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-reshapes-merger-and-acquisition-space/articleshow/88553941.cms||---

Municipal minister Botsa Satyanarayana inaugurated the renovated park and indoor stadium. Raghavaiah park lost its sheen after the national highway expansion. The VMC developed pathways, seating plaza, food court and children’s play equipment at the park with an estimated cost of Rs 1 crore. The VMC allocated 14 Finance Commission funds for the development works.  Similarly, a new synthetic court and gym were developed at DRR indoor stadium with an estimated cost of Rs 1.23 crore. The VMC authorities said the first phase of works was completed and the second phase works will start as soon as possible.  Botsa Satyanarayana asserted that the state government is committed to developing the city. “Vijayawada is progressing in all aspects. Development projects are in full swing. We are not concerned about the allegations made by TDP,” the minister said.  On OTS scheme, Botsa said: “OTS scheme is started on demand from the public. The scheme will give complete rights on houses to the poor. Huge response to the scheme itself is a befitting reply to the Opposition parties. TDP, which failed to transfer the right during their regime, is cheating the public with false promise of completing OTS for free.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/renovated-park-stadium-opened-in-vij/articleshow/88553303.cms||TNN

---||Aurangabad||153 offences against liquor, gambling dens in 5 days||Aurangabad: Latur police, in the last five days, have registered 153 cases against gambling and liquor den operators and customers across the district. The dedicated drive against these illegal businesses was carried out by several police teams from December 22 to 26. Superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale said, “During this period our teams nabbed 168 suspects and have seized articles to the tune of Rs 10.79 lakh,” he said. The officer said due to the police’s frequent action against gambling and liquor dens most of them have changed their modus operandi. “Instead of selling or serving liquor illegally and operating gambling dens from some hotels, dhabas or other dedicated places, the suspects have started moving to remote areas, farms and houses to evade police action,” he said. In order to bring a check on them, the teams were tasked to gather information about their latest locations before carrying out an all-out drive and catching them by surprise. Authorities said to ensure that the drive has an element of surprise, cell phones of the suspects in each raids were seized so that they could not alert their counterparts operating in neighbouring areas. The local press was also kept in the dark about the dedicated drive, as any news during these five days would have alerted the suspects. Pingale has now tasked respective area police stations to record all possible details of these suspects and dedicatedly monitor their daily activities. “Due to continuous monitoring of these suspects, we will come to know if they have returned to illegal activities. On learning about the same, immediate action will be initiated against them,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/153-offences-against-liquor-gambling-dens-in-5-days/articleshow/88551673.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The NMPML could not operate some buses due to a lack of adequate CNG. The Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd (MNGL) has written to the NMPML officials informing them that the new LNG to CNG conversion plant established in the Pathardi area of the city will be operational by January end. As the plant gets operational, MNGL would be able to cater to the requirement of CNG for 200 vehicles, an official said. Presently, NMPML has 150 buses (100 CNG and 50 diesel), operational on 42 routes. It is yet to operate another 100 CNG buses. Now, it has planned to deploy more than 100 CNG buses on additional 22 routes by January end. The NMPML officials said that at present, the MNGL is supplying CNG through tankers for plying the buses. The NMPML rolled out city bus service from the first half of July with a fleet of 27 buses on 11 selected routes. During the last five and a half months, more than 150 buses have been deployed on 42 different routes in phases. Due to the inadequate CNG supply, we could not deploy all the CNG buses. However, the proposed LNG to CNG conversion plant will help solve the problem of CNG, and all the buses could be made operational on the remaining routes across the city. The MNGL officials said that the plant is ready, and they are in the process of getting all the necessary permissions from different authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmpml-to-deploy-100-more-cng-buses-by-jan-end/articleshow/88551647.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||Pune: Truck rolls down in reverse killing 3 bystanders on Bhumkar Bridge||PUNE: A truck, carrying industrial equipment from Pimpri to Satara, hurtled down almost 600m in reverse mode on Bhumkar Bridge, running over three people and hitting a car and two SUVs before coming to a halt around 9am on Tuesday. The Bhumkar Bridge, located close to Navale Bridge, connects the busy Katraj-Dehu Road bypass with the National Highway that goes to Bengaluru via Satara and Kolhapur. “Narhe residents Hemant Yashwant Talale (27), Chetan Ramesh Solanki (31), and Nitin Chandrakant Dhawale (29) of Shivane, were standing under a tree at the end of the Bhumkar Bridge waiting for a lift from vehicles going towards Satara when they were run over by the truck,” assistant inspector Prashant Kanase of Sinhagad Road police told TOI. Kanase said, “The three deceased were employees of private companies at Shirval Industrial Estate in Satara district. They were looking towards Pune for a lift. They barely had an inkling as the truck came from the rear and ran them over before slipping down further.” Solanki had got married 15 days ago and had returned to Pune only three days back, the police said. Earlier around 5am, the truck had almost driven up the bridge when it ran out of diesel and came to a halt. The driver then applied the air brakes and a National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) team, passing by the spot, placed protective barricades around the truck. “Around 9am, the driver and the cleaner returned with diesel, refuelled the diesel tank and got into the truck cabin to start the vehicle. At this point, as the driver tried to start the vehicle, the air brakes malfunctioned and the heavy vehicle started hurtling down in speed in reverse. The driver was unable to control the truck in the absence of brakes,” said Kanase, citing initial investigation. After running over the bystanders, the truck went down to hit a Volkswagen Polo car, a Tavera and a Brezza before coming to a halt. These vehicles were left damaged, but the occupants survived without any injury. It was a close shave for a newly-married couple, out on a visit to a temple with their family, in the Tavera hired from a travel company. A software engineer and his finance professional friend, who had driven all the way from Delhi to Pune en route Mahabaleshwar in the Polo car for New Year celebrations, survived as the safety air bags got deployed in time. “The driver and the cleaner fled after the mishap abandoning the truck at the accident site,” sub-inspector Amol Kale of the Sinhagad Road police said. “We are searching for them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/truck-rolls-down-in-reverse-killing-3-bystanders-on-bhumkar-bridge/articleshow/88553329.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Pune||Air quality in Pune worsens, task force for maximum masking||PUNE: Air quality in Pune and Mumbai has worsened to the “moderate” and “poor”categories, respectively, with both the particulate matter PM 10 and PM 2.5 crossing the maximum permissible limit in the two cities since the last few days, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s (IITM) System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) data showed. With Covid-19 cases rising, health experts have alerted citizens to avoid exposure to pollutants as much as possible with sufficient masking measures. They observed that even short-term exposure to poor air could predispose a person to the infection. Several international studies so far have linked air pollution to the increased risk of contracting Covid-19. A study from China recently stated that short-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 had a tendency to increase the incidence and mortality of Covid-19 than long-term exposure, while for other air pollutants, including SO2 and NO2, long-term exposure was more significant than short-term exposure. SAFAR readings showed that air quality in Shivajinagar and Bhosari fell to “poor” on Tuesday. In areas such as BKC, Chembur, Mazgaon and Colaba locations in Mumbai, the air quality plunged to “poor” to “very poor” categories. The last 10-day PM10 and PM2.5 average concentrations in the two cities showed the pollutants above the maximum permissible limit on all the days, with PM10 concentration being twice the permissible limit on some days in Mumbai. State Covid-19 Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “Covid is an air-borne droplet virus. Winter sees the incidence of pollution, fog and smog, all three together. There is a larger number of suspended particulate matter in the air in such a scenario, which increases the risk of transmission of viral infections via airborne droplets. Covid being an airborne droplet virus, there is an enhanced risk of its transmission as well during such environmental conditions.” Other flu-like illnesses may also have higher transmissibility during such times when air pollution levels are high. “All winter respiratory infections increase due to pollution, fog and smog. That is why Covid peaks occurred in winter lands such as Europe and the US during the colder season. In India, it was just the opposite with the Covid peaks so far being in summer. However, Omicron could reverse that trend due to its higher transmissibility. Hence, citizens must follow the stringent double masking in the backdrop of the increased pollution and the emergence of the new variant of SARS-CoV-2,” Dr Joshi said. Dr B S Murthy, project director, IITM-SAFAR, told TOI, “Some pollution hotspots could be due to increase in vehicular emissions or decrease in air temperature and wind speed. If any, that reduces ventilation of near surface pollutants to higher levels.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, told TOI, “Suspension of large amounts of particulate matter in the air even for a short period of several days could be a risk factor, predisposing one to Covid. Particulate matter can become a carrier for the airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus in polluted environs. People should take due precaution, the most important being proper masking practices.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/air-quality-in-city-worsens-task-force-for-maximum-masking/articleshow/88553326.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||We are not representatives of dogs and cats: Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar||MUMBAI: Taking astrong view of inappropriate behaviour by legislators after BJP MLA Nitesh Rane made “meowing sounds” at state minister Aaditya Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar called on MLAs to observe a code of conduct.  After an all-party meeting on Tuesday where parties agreed to observe a code of conduct within the legislature, Pawar said, “We are not representatives of dogs, cats and chickens. Making animal sounds at others is not acceptable. Such behaviour is an insult to the voters who have elected us. Let’s not forget that proceedings of the assembly are telecast to lakhs of people,” said Pawar. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said while strict action needed to be taken against inappropriate behaviour, it is unfair for the punishment to be excessive. Referring to the suspension of 12 BJP MLAs for a year, he said, “Such excessive punishments create an opportunity for the judiciary to interfere with the legislature,” he said. BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said there should also be a code of conduct for officials. “Collectors make us wait for two hours. Even when we ask for information, we are asked to file an RTI,” he complained. Shiv Sena MLA Bhaskar Jadhav said that even constables did not show respect to MLAs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ajit-we-are-not-representatives-of-dogs-and-cats-in-mumbai/articleshow/88554500.cms||---

While these institutions officially do not come under the ambit of the education department, several school authorities have asked parents to follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) devised by the government for operation of primary schools to ensure safety of students during the pandemic. Mahesh Ashtaputre, chairman of Shri Vidya School, said majority of parents voted in favour of reopening schools for pre-primary section during online survey. “Even though online education was on for pre-primary section, the children were missing multiple benefits of classroom teaching. The peer or group-learning that the children have during the physical classes has resumed now,” he said, adding that the option of online learning is also available for students. While classes for primary students resumed in Aurangabad from December 20, many pre-primary schools started their operations after a gap of almost one week from December 27. Renuka Washikar, a mother, said, “Children from pre-primary section cannot learn effectively online. The pandemic has caused shaky start to their schooling and we hope that schools remain functional in future in order to avoid further academic loss.” Ramnath Thore, education officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said the civic administration was expected to issue an advisory for pre-primary schools shortly for operating during the current pandemic. “Every school should operate by keeping the safety of students in mind,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pre-primary-schools-resume-offline-classes-in-aurangabad/articleshow/88551679.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Testing times for all, here’s why doctors are protesting||NEW DELHI: Nearly 45,000 doctors are waiting to join the workforce but the counselling for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for Postgraduate (NEET PG 2021), which is a process to allot medical colleges to qualified postgraduate candidates, has been delayed, leading to a shortage in hospitals and adding to the workload of the resident doctors. With the third wave of Covid-19 looming large, the residents are asking the government to expedite the counselling process and have struck work to press their demand. The normal schedule for NEET PG exam is January and the counselling takes place in March-April with the new batches joining the medical colleges in May. The exam was delayed by the pandemic and was conducted only in September, with results declared by the end of that month. Meanwhile, the government issued a notification on July 29 providing 27% reservation for other backward classes and 10% for economically weaker sections in the all India quota for NEET-PG. The counselling, which was to begin from October 25, was put on hold after some students moved the Supreme Court on the new reservation norms. When the matter was last heard in the apex court on November 25, the Centre sought four weeks to revise the eligibility for the EWS quota from the current limit of Rs 8 lakh annually. The matter will now be heard on January 6. The residents want the counselling to be conducted quickly. They began the protest on November 27 but called it off later. However, they went back on protest in the second week of December. Dr Manish, president, Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA), said, “We have suffered a loss of one year due to the delay in counselling.” The resident doctors, who are in the second and third year of their postgraduate courses, are managing the workload of three batches. A resident doctor who wished not to be named cautioned, “With a third Covid wave threatening life, the public will face much inconvenience if there is a shortage of doctors.” Holding up a picture of police dragging him while protesting on Monday at ITO, Dr Shankar Kudari, who claimed to have sustained a foot injury, said, “I am a second-year postgraduate student. My seniors passed in June while my juniors haven’t begun their studies. This means the workforce has been reduced by 33%.” Due to the increased workload in the hospitals, residents were, he said, unable to focus on studies and their theses. Doctors claimed their duty hours at times stretch up to 48 hours without a break. Dr Deepika Acharya, in his second year of PG, said, “We are on hospital duty for 96-100 hours a week. Recently, I worked without a break for 36 hours. This causes mental and physical exhaustion. We are unable to even give proper time to patients.” Dr Pulkit Gupta too claimed to have toiled continuously for nearly 48 hours. He said, “Treating patients requires us to take bold decisions. But we are exhausted. A human body needs eight hours of sleep per day, and for six months now, we sometimes work for 48 hours without a break. I take a 15-minute nap to function normally during such durations.” Even if counselling is concluded at the earliest, doctors said it would take at least a month for the new batch to join hospitals. “When doctors in the first year of PG join the institutions, we train them for specialisation for six months. Without proper training, they can’t shoulder the workload,” said Dr Basava Kiran, who is in his third year of PG in anaesthesia at Safdarjung Hospital. Kiran added, “On top of everything, the candidates who are waiting for counselling are on tenterhooks because they don’t know if they will get a college of their choice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/testing-times-for-all-heres-why-docs-are-protesting/articleshow/88553360.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Visakhapatnam||53,000 services take underground cable route in Visakhapatnam||VISAKHAPATNAM: As many as 53,003 services have been so far converted to underground electrical cabling network in Visakhapatnam, as per the official statistics. The project was taken up by the Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (APEPDCL), under the APradesh Disaster Recovery Project a few years ago with about Rs 755 crore. According to the officials, the project has achieved 60% financial progress ( Rs 457 crore has so far been spent against the total estimated project cost of Rs 755 crore). After cyclone Hudhud battered Vizag city, the APDRP envisaged the underground electricity cabling project in areas that dot the coastline in Visakhapatnam city. The World Bank is providing financial assistance to this project. Besides serving the aesthetic purpose, the project is aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the distribution network to natural disasters. Minister for energy, environment and forests, Balineni Srinivasa Reddy, interacted with the energy department employees on Tuesday on the occasion of the second anniversary of Andhra Pradesh Central Power Distribution Company Limited (APCPDCL). Speaking on this occasion, Srinivasa Reddy said; “As electricity is the prime driver of development, the state government considers 24x7 power supply as the key in reviving economic growth and improving living standards of people. The 9-hour free power supply to farmers will help increase the agricultural produce and give assurance among the farming community on protecting their crops.” “The pay revision commission will decide the new pay scales of electricity employees. The employees need not worry about the decision of the government in this regard. The new regulations will not apply to the existing employees. It will apply to the employees who will enter the services in future. Compassionate appointments will be done in accordance with regulations. Government will take a decision on the dearness allowance of the employees soon. The government will look into the concerns of the outsourcing employees and take appropriate decisions,” the minister told the employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/53k-services-take-underground-cable-route-in-vizag/articleshow/88553338.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra WPR 1.4%, CM Uddhav Thackeray to meet Covid-19 task force members today||PUNE: The state’s average weekly positivity rate increased to 1.4% in the week ending on December 27, after remaining steady at 0.8% for about a fortnight, while it was 2.1% in the district. The state public health department officials said it was still not clear if the cases increased because of the Omicron or the Delta variant, or if it was an impact of Delmicron — a combination of Delta and Omicron. They apprehended that the state’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) could rise further if citizens did not adhere to Covid protocols. The state Covid task force members also stressed that citizens should go into a “caution mode”, avoid going into crowds and stick to Covid protocols. They also prescribed ramped up vaccination. The state’s active Covid cases rose to a little over 10,000 on Monday — a departure from the usual 5,000-7,000 until early this month. The public health officers claimed that the state was expected to record a further rise in cases by the middle of January if strict adherence to protocols was not followed. “The overall active cases have increased by 50% in the last 20 days. The positivity rate has gone up to 1.4%. We are expecting a further surge in the next 20 days,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary. According to data from the health department, eight districts had a higher WPR than the state average of 1.4%. State task force members said all caution should be in place to put a check on rising positivity. A health official said, “The state’s weekly positivity has been rising steadily. Mumbai has been registering the highest active cases, followed closely by Pune.” State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “We have to rule out Omicron, particularly in Mumbai, though samples from the community in Mumbai and Pune are being sent for genomic sequencing. We suspect a community or cluster outbreak in Mumbai city, mainly arising from high-rises, weddings and parties.” The chief minister would hold a meeting with the state task force on Wednesday, Dr Joshi said. “We definitely need to be on a vigil.

The project will take shape with the help of teachers and the members of a few NGOs. R Sudhan, state project director of Samagra Siksha, said that the council will be constituted in all schools as part of the reforms in the school management committee (SMCs). Every school must have a school management committee (SMC) mandated under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, which should have parents and representatives of the local body as members to enable interaction with teachers and school education department officials to fulfill the requirement of the school and children. The SMC is a 20-member committee with a convener and a joint convener. The students’ council will be an added component to the SMCs now. The school education department has been holding discussions with the heads of schools that are effectively utilising SMCs to fulfill the requirement of students since September this year. The committee monitors various activities of the institution, including preparation of a school development plan, overseeing the distribution of financial aid from the state government and other agencies, and monitoring the noon meal programme. Headmaster of panchayat union primary school in K Paramathi of Karur R Selvakannan said, “Ideally it is the students who know better about their requirements. The council is also based on an idea of children’s parliament.” He further added that the students in the council will discuss among themselves their requirements and notify the school management committee about the same. A senior official from the Samagra Siksha said that the initiative is in the initial stage and consultations were on with NGOs and educationists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/soon-students-too-will-have-their-say-in-school-decisions/articleshow/88553342.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Jaipur||3 held for cheating in development officers’ exam in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Sirohi police on Monday arrested three persons including a woman student after a few answers, suspected to be from the village development officer (VDO) exam scribbled on a paper allegedly reached her before the exam. SP (Sirohi), Dharmendra Singh said that the police have not discovered any “digital evidence,” of the alleged answer key yet, and the investigation is underway on the basis of statements of the accused. The district police have listed the arrested persons as Praveen Kumar, Prakash Godara and student Indu Bala, all residents of the nearby Jalore district. Indu had allegedly received the paper with some answers through WhatsApp. “We have to corroborate the statements made by the woman (Indu Bala). We have sent their mobiles phones to the FSL to recover possible evidence,” Singh said. Police said that Indu Bala during her interrogation claimed that her husband Ladu Ram had paid Rs 15 lakh to Raju Iram, Prakash Godara, Prakash Bharani and others for the VDO question paper. She also told cops that she and about 20 other students were taken to a small village in Meerpur in Jalore a day before the exam where the gang had promised that they will receive the question paper there, but none of them got the advance copy of the VDO question paper. On Monday morning, the gang arranged different vehicles to ferry students like Indu Bala to their examination centres. According to Singh, the entice incident unfolded when a police team at 10 AM on Monday intercepted a black SUV sans number plate racing through the city. A police inspector asked the SUV to stop, but the driver sped through Goyali Circle and thence coursed through rugged pathways of Dodua and Kalandri, heading to Jalore district before an SHO intercepted the vehicle near the Vellangari village and detained the driver identified as one Praveen Kumar. Police found one copy of the exam centre entrance card from the SUV, the card belonged to the student Indu Bala. The accused could not provide any reason about why he had another student’s card with him,” Singh said. He was taken to the Kotwali police station where he told cops about Raju Iram. Based on the card found from the SUV, police detained Indu Bala from the examination centre for the interrogation. “We are investigating to check if indeed some answers were shared. Also, in many such cases in the past, we have seen that gangs cheating students by offering to sell them papers for exorbitant prices,” Singh said. The Sirohi’s Kotwali police have filed an FIR against Raju Iram and several others under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. Meanwhile, the Rajasthan staff selection board (RSSB) has ruled out that the VDO question paper was leaked. “There are different series of question papers. And in this case, no questions were leaked prior to the exam. Also, it is not confirmed yet if answers were correct,” RSSB chairman Hari Prasad Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-held-for-cheating-in-devpt-officers-exam/articleshow/88553964.cms||---

These are the people who have received both the doses of the vaccine, either Covishield or Covaxin, by March 31, 2021, and thus completed the requisite gap of nine months from the second shot to qualify for the additional third dose termed as a ‘precaution dose’. The roll out of these precaution doses for the frontliners, healthcare workers and citizens above the age of 60 with certain health conditions (comorbidities) is set to begin across the country from January 10, 2022. “Not all, but about 13% of the total 7.73 lakh eligible citizens in Pune district would be able to get the third dose of the Covid vaccine next month after the roll out on January 10, 2022,” said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region. The officials are vying to finish the target of vaccination all these 7.73 lakh beneficiaries with the third dose within a month or two if dose availability remains steady and uninterrupted. Healthcare and frontline workers were among the first priority categories to get the shot when the nationwide mass vaccination began on January 16 this year. As of now, over 90% of the workers have received both the doses of the vaccine in the district at different stages throughout this year. The vaccination of senior citizens above 60 years of age started on March 1 this year. In Pune district, there are 13,27,500 senior citizens who are counted as beneficiaries for the first and second dose. “But not all of them would be eligible for the third dose as of now. Only those senior citizens with certain health conditions or pre-existing diseases would be able to get the shot against the medical certificate,” Dr Deshmukh said. As per the health department’s estimation, 23% of these senior citizens above 60% years of age have comorbid conditions and would be eligible to get a third dose. “That means about 3.05 lakh senior citizens can avail of the benefit of getting a precaution dose in Pune district,” Dr Deshmukh said. Medical practitioner Sanjay Dabhade said, “Ensuring an adequate supply of vaccination is critical to the success. The state government and district administration can not ignore the right of those who are due for the second dose and also our responsibility towards counselling and reaching out to those who have not yet received a single shot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/95k-eligible-for-immediate-precaution-dose-in-district/articleshow/88553340.cms||Umesh Isalkar

He released the amount at his Tadepalli camp office. Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that earlier people used to wait and run from pillar to post to avail welfare schemes. He added the situation has changed and the schemes are being delivered right at the doorstep of the beneficiaries. Jagan said people can apply for the benefits under any scheme at any point of time. The officials would screen the applications and the government would pay the benefit in June and December every year. The chief minister further said the previous TDP government had only tried to minimise the number of beneficiaries through Janmabhoomi Committees. “The TDP regime was always behind in delivering welfare schemes to the people. However, the present government is delivering the schemes as per schedule despite the financial constraints caused by Covid-19,”the chief minister added. During the TDP rule, only 39 lakh people received a pension of Rs 1,000 per month incurring a monthly bill of Rs 400 crore. The current government increased the pension amount to Rs 2,250 and has been providing pensions right at the doorstep of over 61 lakh beneficiaries every month at an expenditure of Rs 1,450 crore.

An official of the Lasalgaon APMC said the arrival of fresh late kharif onions is gradually increasing at the wholesale market. Last week, the daily arrival of onions was around 12-15,000 quintal which has now increased to over 20,000 quintal. “The rise in supply of fresh late kharif onions has led to the marginal drop in average wholesale onion prices,” he said. The stock of old summer onions with the farmers have completely exhausted and the produce arriving in the market are of late kharif onions that have a shelf life of less than a month. Hence, farmers have no option, but to sell the produce at prevailing market rates. The arrival of fresh late kharif onions is expected to increase further in the next few days. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 800 and Rs 2,255 per quintal, respectively.

Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap made the announcement while speaking at the Congress’s 137th foundation day celebrations on Tuesday. “137 is not just a number, it is a legacy of Congress’s thinking, which is still ingrained in the minds of people of the country. The Congress was formed in 1885 at Tejpal Hall. From Womesh Chandra Banerjee and Dadabhai Naoroji to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, there have been 60 Congress presidents till date. Mahatma Gandhi’s slogan of ‘Quit India’ was also given from August Kranti Maidan in front of the premises of Tejpal Hall. Now we want to make another resolution from this hall. In the forthcoming BMC elections, Congress will contest 236 seats in Mumbai on its own and will once again fly the Congress tricolour over the BMC,” Jagtap said. Despite the success of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in the recent rural local body polls, the Shiv Sena too is set to go it alone in the BMC elections. The party which has ruled the BMC for over two decades is preparing to fight over 200 seats and expand its base in Mumbai. However, political analysts said the Sena may have an alliance with the NCP since the party may ask for a small chunk of seats compared to the Congress. The NCP currently has just 8 corporators in the BMC. The Congress has 28 corporators and is the principal opposition party in the BMC. Sena strategists have said that instead of a formal alliance, the party may have an ‘understanding’ with the Congress in key areas to defeat the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-says-it-will-fight-all-236-bmc-seats-on-its-own/articleshow/88554510.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

They are protesting against alleged manhandling of their colleagues in Delhi by police. "Our colleagues, resident doctors of Delhi, were protesting demanding expatiating of NEET-PG counselling. But, they were manhandled by the police. We are protesting against the police action on resident doctors in Delhi. As a mark of protest, we have returned the ‘tali-thali award’ which was given to us during the first wave of Covid-19," said Dr Amit Yadav, president, Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors. Resident doctors boycotted work for two hours from 9am to 11am and took part in the march in huge numbers. They were seen beating thalis at Shahid Smarak to attract the attention of the Central government. "We are returning ‘tali-thali' award here to the Centre," said an agitating doctor. The protesting doctors pointed out that they had worked hard during the first and second waves of Covid-19 but their colleagues were manhandled in Delhi, which is not acceptable. "We have boycotted work for two hours today. Our meeting is in progress in which we will decide on progress of our agitation. Delhi’s resident doctors are in touch with government and holding meeting, we are awaiting the outcome of the meeting," said Dr Yadav.

---||Delhi||Delhi: CM Arvind Kejriwal urges PM Modi to accept doctors’ demands||NEW DELHI: Urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “personally solve” the issues faced by doctors and expedite the NEET-PG counselling, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that with Covid-19 cases on the rise again, doctors should be in the hospitals and not on the streets. “The doctors of central hospitals have been on strike for several days. They served during the pandemic by risking their lives. Covid-19 is rising again. The doctors should be in hospitals, not on the streets. We strongly condemn the police brutality inflicted on the doctors. The Prime Minister must accept their demands soon,” tweeted the CM. In his letter to Modi, Kejriwal stated, “On one hand, the Omicon variant is spreading at an alarming speed, but on the other doctors in hospitals under the central government are on strike. Resident doctors at many big government hospitals, like AIIMS, Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia, are on strike for the last one month due to repeated postponement of NEET-PG counselling.” “It’s a matter of deep despair that even after their persistent struggle, the demands of resident doctors were not heard by the central government. However, it’s even more upsetting that when these doctors were protesting peacefully, police behaved violently and harassed them,” Kejriwal added in the letter. Mentioning that these were the same doctors who treated Covid patients over the last year and a half without caring for their own lives, Kejriwal said, “It’s very sad to see doctors go on strike. The delay in NEET-PG counselling not only affects the future of doctors, but also causes their shortage in hospitals. The burden on the rest of the doctors increases due to this.” He requested the Centre to conduct counselling soon. “At present, Covid-19 cases are again on the rise in the entire country. If our doctors continue to strike, how will we fight the disease? This situation needs all these doctors to be inside hospitals taking care of patients, not fighting on the streets,” added Kejriwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-urges-pm-to-accept-docs-demands/articleshow/88553380.cms||---

We have also asked them to sanitize the entire school,” according to Padheriya. With the number of cases rising in the last few days, schools are witnessing a decline in participation of students for in-person classroom studies, switching to online mode instead, said sources in the education department. In the case of Terf School, a student of Class 12 commerce stream has tested positive for Covid-19. “He attended school on Monday and participated in the written exams that are underway for Class 10 and Class 12 students. He complained of headaches and fever during the exam. The parents also did not inform us of anything. When the RT-PCR test was conducted, he tested positive and we have informed the DEO office about the same,” said a school official. The student has no travel history and the schools have postponed Class 12 commerce exams, the official added. In the case of Navkar Public School, two students of Class 9 have tested positive. “These students were regularly attending school. As a result, there is some unrest among parents. Other students and faculty members need to test and verify if they are infected or not,” according to a parent whose son studies in Navkar School. Hitesh Shah, trustee of Navkar Public School did not take calls made on his mobile phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-schoolchildren-test-covid-positive/articleshow/88553402.cms||---
---||Delhi||Call off stir, engaged with SC to solve EWS quota issue: Centre to resident doctors||NEW DELHI: Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday urged resident doctors to call off their strike over the delay in NEET-PG counselling in the larger interest of the public and said the Centre is engaged with the Supreme Court to quickly resolve the issue regarding the EWS quota. In a meeting with the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (Forda), Mandaviya assured all requisite steps are being taken by the government and a suitable reply with respect to the EWS report will be submitted to the SC before the scheduled date of hearing on January 6. “We are not able to do the counselling because the matter is sub judice before the Supreme Court. The Government of India will submit a reply to the apex court before the scheduled date of hearing on January 6. We request the court to expedite the issue so that the counselling can be started at the earliest,” he said. TimesViewTop government hospitals like Safdarjang attract thousands of poor and desperate people from different parts of the country. For them, it is the last refuge for the treatment of their dear ones. The court, the government and the doctors must resolve the problem at the earliest to ensure these desperate people don't continue to suffer.The apex court is hearing a batch of petitions challenging the government and a medical counselling committee (MCC) notice issued in July, providing 10% quota for the EWS (economically weaker sections) category and reservation for OBC (Other Backward Classes) in the All India Quota (AIQ) in medical admission through NEET. It has raised questions on the EWS income limit criteria and in the process the counselling process for NEET-PG has been stalled. As per the legislation ratified by Parliament in January 2019, a general category student or candidate whose family income is less than Rs 8 lakh per year is eligible for EWS reservation. While a set of petitions have challenged the income limit criterion of EWS at Rs 8 lakh per annum, the government told the SC in November that it will re-examine the limit with a committee headed by former finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey going into it. However, that would mean the counselling for the NEET post-graduate medical courses will be further postponed by four weeks. The legal deadlock has in turn resulted in uncertainties for MBBS aspirants as well as resident doctors seeking admission to PG degrees. A large number of resident doctors on Tuesday protested on the premises of the Centre-run Safdarjung Hospital, even as police personnel were deployed to ensure maintenance of law and order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/call-off-stir-engaged-with-sc-to-solve-ews-quota-issue-centre/articleshow/88553403.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Girls confront pervert flasher, chase him away||NAGPUR: Two girls, stunned by a pervert’s obscene gesture, were initially taken aback but later fought back to scare him away before lodging a complaint at Bajaj Nagar police station on Monday. The alleged miscreant, who later turned out to be a married bank employee, fled after being hit by stones hurled by the survivors. The man, who was in the car, had allegedly exposed his private parts to the girls on the pretext of asking them an address before speeding away as the victims had put up an unexpected resistance. Led by senior inspector Dinesh Labde, the Bajaj Nagar team, with inputs by the girls and CCTV footage, managed to zero in on 31-year-old Mandar Dhongdi, a loan officer at a private bank, at his residence at Besa on Tuesday. Initially refusing to admit his wrongdoing, Dhongdi later broke down and spilled the beans during questioning. Police said the 19-year-old complainant, accompanied by a friend, was returning home on foot after enjoying some snacks at Gittikhadan layout. Dhongdi had pulled up his car near the two girls in front of Durga temple on the Cement Road. He asked the girls the way to reach Orange City Hospital chowk but later started misbehaving. Dhongdi was conversing with the girls when he started exposing triggering a prompt reaction from the girls. “It was a disgusting experience for a girl to meet such a pervert. I immediately alerted my friend who was beside me. Initially, it was embarrassing and numbing but we fought back strongly leaving him no other option but to flee,” said the complainant. “My friend immediately picked up some stones and hurled them at him,” she said. The girl’s friend said it was an instant reaction. “The stones which went inside the car left him unnerved. He fled at breakneck speed,” she said. The girls said many women in their localities have faced some or the other kind of harassment on roads but refrained from approaching the police. “The women and girls should not think twice before countering such perverts on roads with a strong spirit and also report the matter to police,” said the girls, adding, the time has come to protest loudly and fight back harassment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/girls-confront-pervert-flasher-chase-him-away/articleshow/88553378.cms||Soumitra Bose

Once we receive these, we will execute the vaccination drive in a planned manner. Health teams will sensitize parents, whose consent the school authorities will seek.”“Not only 15-18-year-old children will be safe after being vaccinated, but also their siblings will build a herd immunity and be able to better tackle virus attack as vaccination will lessen the severity,” she added. Over 8-lakh persons in the district are yet to get the second dose. “People who are yet to receive their second dose of vaccination should come forward and get themselves fully vaccinated. Amid the Omicron threat, residents should not take Covid-19 lightly,” she said.Councillor Mamta Ashu said, “The biggest challenge schools will face is the consent of parents. For this age group, we cannot force parents. In larger interest of society and to ensure that our children stay safe, parents should get their children vaccinated at the earliest as we have to eliminate this disease.”She added that to cover maximum children in the age group, special vaccination camps will be organized in schools. “Besides schools, children can visit any other camp too. Within a few months, board exams will start, so we do not want to bother teachers with this drive. We will deploy volunteers from NGOs and teams from health department and district administration to ensure full vaccination,” she said.Nodal officer, vaccination, education department, Dimple Madaan said, “We may give parents an option to register on Co-Win.

Five suspects, identified as Jeetendra Singh, Ravi Singh, Jaibali Singh, all hailing from Barseli village in Siddhi district of Madhya Pradesh, Prashant Khairnar of Dhule district and Chaitanya Mhaiskar of Begumpura in Aurangabad city have been arrested. They were produced before the court on Tuesday and remanded in two-day custody.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat mulls new law for CCTV installation and data sharing||GANDHINAGAR: If all goes to plan for the state government, the installation of at least one CCTV camera facing the street and providing its feed to local police for use in crime prevention and detection will be required by law by early next year. Highly placed sources said several senior IAS and IPS officers are being consulted to bring a draft to life to regulate and integrate the use of CCTVs across private and public buildings in the state. The draft is likely to be tabled in the budget session of the assembly. Sources close to the development said that so far, commercial establishments are covered in the police notification for installation of standard CCTVs. The proposed law will also cover residential societies and colonies. Along with involving departments such as urban development, roads and buildings and the like, the government has also sought legal advice to ensure that provisions of the proposed law are not challenged in court. “CCTVs have increasingly become go-to tools for crime prevention and detection. Thus, larger coverage will surely be helpful. The idea behind the draft is to ensure that camera quality, angles and other specifications such as storage, height, online access are standardized. If this is not the case, sophisticated tools such as AI-based software cannot process the data. Even today, many societies don’t have CCTVs or have data that is not useful,” said a senior state government official. “Other private places such as temples, schools and the like get connected to the police network with effective, high- quality CCTV camera networks.” “As of now, there is no integration of CCTV camera feeds of private and government establishments and local authorities such as municipal corporations. The government aims to have a central command equipped with sophisticated video analytics technology to link these, for which a legal framework is required,” sources added. Officials said that CCTV networks and laws of other states are being studied, with the state intending to follow the Karnataka model more closely. For bigger societies, the state authorities may ask for installation of one or more cameras facing the road and providing its feed to a cluster centre. “The intention is not to carry out unnecessary surveillance on the private lives of the citizens, but with the changing nature of crime, surveillance has also changed across the globe. We might go for a legal framework to enforce integrated CCTV camera networks, data maintenance policies and sharing of video feeds with law enforcement agencies,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/proposed-cctv-law-to-have-central-command/articleshow/88553397.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Pune||Pune to get 4k imported kits to check probable Omicron cases||PUNE: The district this week will get 4,000 imported RT-PCR kits, which are capable of detecting probable Omicron cases from the routine positive caseload. State-run BJ Medical College (BJMC) and Sassoon hospital is the main testing centre where these specialized kits will primarily be made available to carry out the second RT-PCR testing on daily positive samples with high viral load (having less than 25 CT values), prior to performing their genomic sequencing. The genomic sequencing causes a lot of expenditure when performed on every positive sample fitting the criteria of high viral load. Instead of sequencing all samples with a high viral load, officials will first put them through the imported RT-PCR kits that have an S gene drop. And only those samples which show the S gene drop will be prioritized for sequencing to confirm the presence of the Omicron variant. Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, civil surgeon, Pune district, said, “We have got the approval to purchase 4,000 RT-PCR kits with S gene drop or S gene target failure (SGTF) method that helps in early detection of probable Omicron cases from the daily caseload. For this, we have received Rs9.26 lakh from the state government. The procurement process is likely to be done this week.” Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, BJMC’s senior microbiologist and state coordinator for genome sequencing said, “BJMC-Sassoon is receiving Covid samples with high viral load for probable detection of Omicron from all over Pune district. Instead of putting all of positive samples for sequencing, we will first put them through these specialized RT-PCR kits having SGTF, and those found positive will be prioritized for sequencing.” State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, “Our aim is to carry out up to 1 lakh Covid tests across the state with specialized RT-PCR kits having SGTF strategy and observe the trend in 20 days.” Financial assistance of Rs4 lakh to Rs9 lakh has been sanctioned to every district to purchase the imported RT-PCR kits and conduct at least 100 Covid tests every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-to-get-4k-imported-kits-to-check-probable-omicron-cases/articleshow/88553399.cms||Umesh Isalkar

In little over a month, Sangli police have made two arrests from Peth Naka — a place near Islampur town along Pune-Bengaluru National Highway — after receiving information that the suspects were travelling in a private bus with drugs. In the recent case, a team from Islampur police station had set up a check point on the Peth section of the national highway and every private transport bus matching the details provided by the informant was checked. The Nigerian national, identified as Edward Joseph Edeh, had stepped out of the bus to get into a hotel when he was arrested by the police. Krushnat Pingle, deputy superintendent of police, said, “On Tuesday, we produced him in the court. The court remanded him in police custody till January 1. We suspect that the person arrested is a drug peddler and was transporting the cocaine that was found in capsule form in a black shampoo bottle.” “We have found that the peddlers communicate with each other using social media platforms. The last person we arrested was a student. Mostly, foreign nationals who have come to India for studying get into such work,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nigerian-national-held-with-163-gram-cocaine/articleshow/88551759.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Kill threat claim brings age-old family feud to fore||Vijayawada: The scion of Vangaveeti family expressing threat to his life has once again brought to fore the age-old rivalry between two major political families in city. Vijayawada was hit by political fights and mafia groups between 1970s and 1990s. The heirs of two rival families are active in rival political parties now, though they have never confronted with each other in last two decades. But the sudden statement of Vangaveeti Radha Krishna, former legislator and TDP leader, on the anniversary of his father Vangaveeti Mohana Ranga Rao, who was killed while he was on a fast on December 26, 1988, has revived the old memories. The 1980s and 1990s in Vijayawada saw the feud between the families of Mohana Ranga Rao, who was a Congress legislator, and Devineni Rajasekhar (Nehru), who was in the Telugu Desam then. Now, Radha Krishna is in the TDP and Nehru’s son Devineni Avinash is in the ruling YSRC. While Avinash shifted from Congress to TDP and later to YSR Congress, Radha Krishna moved from Congress to Praja Rajyam Party of Chiranjeevi and Jana Sena of Pawan Kalyan, before switching over to TDP. While the young leaders are busy in their political activities, their followers are allegedly involved in some private settlements and small time extortion. Political experts point out that though the scions of both families have not expressed anything against each other, their followers continue to nurse the grudge. The rivalry between the two families that often created major law and order problems in Vijayawada in 1980s and 1990s ended with the murder of Mohana Ranga Rao in 1988. A large portion of the state was under curfew for 45 days following Ranga’s murder. Those days were nightmares for many and posting in Vijayawada was considered a punishment for employees. The state returned to normalcy after a long time though several families suffered fear and insecurity for several months after Ranga’s murder. Police and Central security forces worked hard to restore normalcy in the city controlling mafia and rowdy gangs. The rule of law was so firm that the supporters of both Vangaveeti and Devineni families, including the so-called action teams from both sides, had given up or rather forced to give up weapons and violence. Perhaps with the past incidents in mind, the Central and state intelligence agencies jumped into action soon after Radha Krishna expressed threat to his life, on December 26. Meanwhile, there is a big debate in the political circles in the city on the future of the heirs of Vangaveeti and Devineni families. Though minister Kodali Nani ruled out the possibility of Radha Krishna returning to YSRC, people see greater possibilities on these lines. The swift action from government to provide security to Radha Krishna gave enough indications that it’s a matter of time before this former MLA comes back to the YSRC. But the big question is, will Devineni scion will continue in YSRC, if Radha returns to ruling party. Political experts point out that though the scions of both families have not expressed anything against each other, their followers continue to nurse grudge||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/kill-threat-claim-brings-age-old-family-feud-to-fore/articleshow/88553391.cms||Gopi Dara

He will be sent for training at a forest institute before we finally induct him into the service.” Ramgaonkar said Sonkamble is among the 12 candidates who were appointed on compassionate grounds. One of the recruits also includes the kin of Jankiram Masram, the caretaker of Tadoba elephants who was killed by Gajraj in November 2019. A day after Dhumne was killed while conducting a tiger estimation exercise, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced a prescribed compensation package of Rs 15 lakh to the next of her kin and a job in the forest department. Apart from this, the TATR Tiger Conservation Foundation had released Rs 5 lakh and also collected a huge sum through crowdfunding. Sonkamble’s job will be permanent in nature and will get all the benefits a newly-recruited forest guard gets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hubby-of-forest-guard-killed-by-maya-gets-job/articleshow/88553393.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Even Lok Sabha follows open voting, says Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar||MUMBAI: Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said on Tuesday, “We decided to defer the (speaker’s) poll to give due respect to the Governor’s views and ensure there are no legal or constitutional hurdles,” said . He added that an MVA delegation would meet the Governor once again to resolve queries and misunderstandings. “Even the Lok Sabha follows open voting for the Speaker’s poll,” he pointed out. The Indian Constitution provides no role for the Governor in the election of the Speaker to state legislatures, say legal experts. According to Section 178, the election of the Speaker is undertaken by members of the state assembly. However, the Rule 6 of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Rules says the date of the Speaker’s election has to be notified by the Governor. The post of the state assembly speaker has been vacant for the last ten months since Congress leader Nana Patole resigned from the position to take over as state chief of the party. Talking to reporters, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut took a dig at Governor Koshyari saying, “His appointment is not for rejecting the rights of the legislative House, government's recommendations and the people's will.” Last week, the assembly passed amendments to Rule 6 of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Rules for the Speaker’s election. The new rule allows for election of the speaker through a voice vote which will reveal who each MLA voted for rather than through a secret ballot which has been the norm. Governor Koshyari sought legal opinion on whether this change was unconstitutional. State leaders have pointed out that the Lok Sabha Speaker election follows the voice vote and the amendment had been cleared by the state assembly. The amendment also excluded the words “holding of the election” and included the words, “to elect the Speaker on the recommendation of the Chief Minister.” Officials say the change made it even more clear that the Governor has to act on the advice of the Chief Minister. The MVA and Governor Koshyari have long been on a collision course. A year after the government submitted a list of 12 nominees for MLC posts through the Governor’s quota, he has yet to clear them. Governor Koshyari also questioned the Thackeray government for not reopening Hindu places of worship during the pandemic. The MVA has also retaliated against the Governor by denying him the state airplane to fly to Uttarakhand. Earlier this month, the state cabinet cleared an amendment to the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, curtailing the role of the Chancellor which is held by the Governor, from picking pro-vice chancellors. The bill was passed by the assembly on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/even-ls-follows-open-voting-in-mumbai-dy-cm/articleshow/88554526.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena and Congress leaders hit out at Bhagat Singh Koshyari||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena and Congress on Tuesday slammed governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari after he did not give his nod for election of speaker of the legislative assembly. Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the governor has not been appointed to curb the rights of the legislature, the recommendations of the government and people’s sentiments. State Congress president Nana Patole accused Koshyari of “pursuing BJP’s agenda.” “We were planning to hold the election on Tuesday. We received a communication from Koshyari on Tuesday, saying it will be unconstitutional to hold the speaker’s election. To respect the views expressed by Koshyari, we decided to postpone the election, and now it has been proposed to hold it during the budget session of the state legislature,” Patole said. Patole said while Koshyari had objections over the speaker’s election, it was Koshyari himself who had sent two letters to CM Uddhav Thackeray over the prolonged delay in holding the poll. “We are all aware that in the past, the governor had insisted on holding the speaker’s election as early as possible,” he said. Raut said he would not comment on the governor’s response to the letter sent by the state government. “CM Uddhav Thackeray has sent a reply to the governor,” he said. Raut added, “The governor is learned and knowledgeable. But I don’t think there should be so much indigestion. If the governor is acting against the Constitution or if someone is pressuring him to do so, the state government will also have to take political steps.” Patole said the MVA had made certain amendments to the rules pertaining to election of speaker. “There is absolutely nothing illegal in the new rules, the laid-down procedure was followed while amending rules. We expect Koshyari to honour the constitutional post he is holding,” Patole added. He pointed out the process pertaining to the change of rules was communicated to the governor well in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sena-and-cong-leaders-hit-out-at-koshyari/articleshow/88554528.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Pune||Covaxin procurement continues to be a major challenge for private hospitals in Pune||PUNE: Procuring Covaxin was still a major challenge for the private hospitals in the region, claimed their senior officials. Around 20 private hospitals are offering paid Covaxin to the 18-plus beneficiaries in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) at present. More private hospitals are eager to resume vaccination for the 15-18 years’ group if the supply of Covaxin was streamlined. Jitendra Oswal, deputy director, Bharati Hospital Pune, told TOI, “There is no clarity on whether the government will assist the private hospitals in procuring the Covaxin doses or the hospitals will have to directly communicate with Bharat Biotech, the manufacturers. Earlier, August onwards, the government health officials used to assist in the order and delivery. We have no clue this time. Regardless, we shall organise the vaccination for children. The children with comorbidities will be given priority.” Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, the medical director at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said they would stay away from the children’s vaccination at their facility because of the procuring issues. “We shall continue with the ‘precautionary doses’ of the senior citizens from January 10, but not the Covaxin,” he said, adding that they had encountered issues with Covaxin procurement in the initial phase of the drive too, after which the vaccination drive was under way with Covishield only. Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said a meeting with the national body of the Indian Medical Association was lined up, wherein the issues of Covaxin would be addressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covaxin-procurement-continues-to-be-a-major-challenge-for-private-hospitals/articleshow/88553418.cms||Piyush Bhusari

A complaint in this regard was registered by Kunal Wagh, a resident of Vrundavan Nagar area of the city. At 10pm, when he was shutting down, two people had come to his stall and asked for something to eat. Wagh said that since he was closing the stall, he served them something which that could be cooked fast After serving them food, Wagh began closing down the stall. After the duo finished eating, Rs 50 was demanded from them by Wagh for the food. This infuriated the duo who then started abusing Wagh. They also called their two friends at the stall who came their with sharp-edged weapons. One of the four suspects smashed a bottle of beer on Wagh’s head and also ransacked his stall. Further, they took Rs 9,700 from his cash box and assaulted him. Wagh said he also lost his gold chain weighing 13 grams in the scuffle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/4-arrested-for-robbing-chinese-food-stall-owner/articleshow/88551781.cms||---

The boys had gone for a swim in the canal, however, they failed to gauge the depth of the water and drowned. A fire brigade rescue team rushed to the spot and brought out the boys, but they were declared dead by Nashik civil hospital doctors. The deceased are Siddhu Ambadas Dhotre (15), Nilesh Kashinath Mule (14) and Pramod Babanrao Jadhav (13). Panchavati police have registered a accidental death case. Panchavati fire brigade officials said they got a call at 2.05 pm and within three minutes, a rescue team, led by fireman S G Bhatwad, reached the spot. While one boy had already been taken out of the water, the rescuers — Govind Tupe, Harish Chaube, of Mahindra and Mahindra’s Igatpuri plant, and Vijay Katore — reached the second boy in the next two minutes. The third boy was untraceable. A boat was deployed and the third boy was brought out. PSI P A Nemane of Panchavati police station said the boys belonged to working class families. There was one more boy with them who had rushed home to alert people about the drowning. Calls were then made to the police and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-3-teens-drown-in-canal/articleshow/88551776.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lengthy waits, despair for scores of patients as cries go unheard||NEW DELHI: For 14-year-old Aradhya Yadav, Tuesday proved a long day as she waited on a stretcher with a plastered leg for a doctor to attend to her at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. But even after almost six hours of waiting, no doctor was available to see her. Reema Yadav, the teen’s mother, said that they reached the hospital from Badarpur around 6am but hadn’t seen a doctor till past noon. “Aradhya had surgery around a fortnight ago and we were scheduled to visit the hospital today for a follow-up. In 15 days, proper dressing hasn’t been done even once,” the mother said. “When I called our doctor from the hospital, I was told to come back later because nobody was available. He simply asked us to continue with whatever medicines Aradhya was having despite the course being over.” From a hassled father running anxious about his son’s treatment to a pregnant woman waiting on the pavement, patients and their caregivers found themselves helpless with hundreds of doctors at government hospitals on strike. At Dwarka, Markandey Sharma reached the hospital around 9am with his wife. They were asked to go elsewhere as the emergency ward was closed due to the strike. “My wife has been having intestinal problems and is finding it difficult to move. But at the hospital, we were asked to go somewhere else. We will probably head to the ESI Hospital because she needs immediate attention,” the desperate construction worker said. Many others similarly complained of travelling long distances only to be turned back at the hospitals. Kishandevi was there with her injured 24-year-old son. “We cannot afford treatment in private hospitals, but this is what we face in government hospitals. They asked us to come once the strike was over,” she grumbled. The Rohini resident at Safdarjung Hospital added, “A bus takes us two hours and using the motorcycle means spending for petrol. It is almost a 45km journey to and fro.” Mohammad Irfan of Shiv Vihar was pushed on his wheelchair from one area to another, his child on his lap, at the hospital for two hours before his mother and wife saw the futility of hanging around. “I can’t walk after an operation went wrong two years ago,” said Irfan. “I need regular check-ups, but today we found no one available here.” Attendants of in-hospital patients said there were announcements on Monday about the strike. Flustered Badarpur resident Mohit said, “My father is admitted here after a recent stroke. Last evening, doctors said that we could take the patient home because of the strike. How can we just take him home? He is in a poor condition. We don’t know what to do.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lengthy-waits-despair-for-scores-of-patients-as-cries-go-unheard/articleshow/88553415.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Kozhikode||K-Rail project: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, UDF on the same page, says V D Satheesan||KOZHIKODE: In a sign of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor falling in line with the official stand of the party on the K-Rail project, opposition leader V D Satheesan said that Tharoor has informed him that he is on the same page with the UDF on the issue and is convinced about the stand taken by the front. Satheesan told reporters in Kasaragod on Tuesday that he had shared with Tharoor the details of the study conducted by the UDF panel on the project and in the reply letter on Monday, Tharoor said that all the questions raised by the UDF were relevant and that he too had the same questions about the project. “Tharoor said in the letter that he had not taken a stand in favour of the project or against it but was waiting to study the project in detail. He expressed happiness that we conducted a detailed study about the project and shared the details with him. He has appreciated the stand taken by us,” Satheesan said. “There need not be any confusion over it. Shashi Tharoor is going to take a like-minded stand,” he said. Earlier, Tharoor had refused to sign the letter written by the UDF MPs to Union minister of railways seeking to issue a directive to stop the land acquisition for the scheme. KPCC president K Sudhakaran had said that Tharoor will not be in the party if he doesn’t fall in line with the party’s stand. Satheesan said that people’s committees were being formed in all the villages through which the proposed SilverLine rail project pass through and added that the UDF would launch an agitation against the project with their help. He took strong exception to CPM’s charges that the UDF has joined hands with communal forces to oppose the project and said that the CPM was trying to communalize all issues and asked whether Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad and CPI, which had expressed reservations about the project, were communal organizations. Satheesan said that the state government was evading from holding discussion about the project in the assembly as it does not have any answers. Tharoor’s tweet upsets leaders Meanwhile, the Congress leaders in the state are upset over Shashi Tharoor’s latest tweet in which he had tried to make a dig at Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath over the health index published by the Niti Aayog. Tharoor had tried to convey that Kerala stands better than UP in the health index. “If the likes of @myogiadityanath would learn not just health practices but good governance & inclusive politics from Kerala, the country would benefit. Instead they keep trying to drag the country down to their level!,” Tharoor had tweeted. But the Congress leaders are of the view that Tharoor has appreciated the performance of the LDF government through his tweet. Former KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said that Tharoor should not make comments ignoring the party’s policies and stand on each issue. “The party workers had worked hard for his victory in the last Lok Sabha election. The party high command should intervene in his case and to ensure discipline in the party,” Ramachandran said. However, the AICC and the high command have made it clear that it is up to the KPCC to sort out such issues. “The KPCC can settle such issues and there is no need for the party high command to intervene,” said AICC general secretary K C Venugopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/tharoor-udf-on-the-same-page-satheesan/articleshow/88552586.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Duplicate names, migration major barriers in Covid-19 jab target||PUNE: Many districts in the state have been unable to scale up the vaccine coverage and reach the desired numbers owing to duplicate names in voters’ list, and migration of people to cities. Officials said several districts in Marathwada, Vidarbha and even some parts of western Maharashtra were struggling to achieve the first dose vaccination target due to the absence of some of the beneficiaries — many of whom have taken vaccination in other cities. State health minister Rajesh Tope had said last week that local administration would be held responsible for slow vaccination. The voters’ list is being used as a reference point to target the number of eligible vaccine beneficiaries above the age of 18. Collectors of many of these districts such as Dhule, Hingoli, Nanded, Beed and Nandurbar, which is at the bottom in terms of vaccine coverage, have raised the issue, with many people not residing in these districts. “We conducted the Har Ghar Dastak programme. Some of the families said their members have moved to various cities. They had applied for cancellation of their names, but they continue to reflect in the list,” said an official. Duplicate names in both the districts is an issue and it can only be checked after reaching out to citizens and confirming that they have been inoculated. However, this is a time-consuming exercise, said a senior health official. A citizen said he had moved to Pune from Sangli, and re-registered as a voter here. He had applied for deletion of his name in the voters’ list in Sangli, but his name appears in the list in both the places. Election authorities said that there have been repeated announcements for deletion of names. “We have cleared a lot of applications for deletion. The state had even urged people to check and correct the names. Till November 30, the state had 8.9cr total electors, of which 4.68cr were male electors, and 4.27cr were female electors. “We had deleted over 24lakh names after scrutiny. It is the responsibility of citizens to delete the names if they are registered at two places,” said an election official. The local authorities had brought up this issue at the meeting with the state health minister. Officials have said the same needs to be checked during the door-to-door drive. The new voter list will be published on January 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duplicate-names-migration-major-barriers-in-jab-target/articleshow/88553422.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt drafting a stringent bill to curb cattle menace||GANDHINAGAR: The urban development department is formulating a bill to effectively curb the cattle menace in urban areas of the state. Although the state government does not intend to ban cattle altogether in cities, it is expected to make punishment more stringent for cattle roaming on the streets. The highlight of the new law will be that every cattle head in urban areas will have to be accounted for and owners will have to get a license for every cattle that they own. Minister of state, urban development Vinod Moradia said that if a cattle is impounded, stringent action will be taken against the owner. Owners will have to fulfill certain conditions while getting license for their cattle.“Among other conditions, the owners will be required to provide proof that they have land and other arrangements to keep cattle,” the minister said. The minister said that the new law will not entirely ban cattle in urban areas, but the punishment for leaving cattle on the roads will be made more stringent. Of late, the number of persons either injured or killed because of stray cattle has increased. A few days ago, a senior citizen was mauled to death by a stray ox. Similar instances have been reported from other parts of the state as well. The Gujarat high court has been repeatedly taking civic bodies to task over the issue of stray cattle loitering on the streets and posing a risk to the safety of those on the roads. Recently the high court asked the state government to form a policy to contain the cattle menace and implement it effectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-drafting-a-stringent-bill-to-curb-cattle-menace/articleshow/88553429.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Study on roadside pollution on BHU campus conducted||Varanasi: A study on roadside pollution on the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) campus conducted by a group of researchers suggested that deciduous trees plantation and improvement in the drainage system within the campus are essential to reduce the accumulation of pollutants in the topsoil near the sites of infrastructural development and busy roads. This results in a smaller stay time of the heavy metals in the topsoil, roadside dust and tree leaves. For this study, the magnetic susceptibility mapping of roadside pollution on BHU campus was done by the researchers Sayandeep Banerjee, Ankit Kumar, Virendra Rana, Sayan Maity and Hari B Srivastava of BHU’s Centre of Advanced Study in Geology. The study was published in the Current Science in October this year. The researchers claimed that this study presents the first quantitative assessment of roadside pollution on the BHU main campus, since its establishment in 1916. According to the study, to identify the heavy minerals/metals in the soil, dust and leaf samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used on selected soil and leaf samples in the Subcontinental Lithospheric Mantle Laboratory, Centre of Advanced Study in Geology, BHU. For mapping of roadside pollution, 106 locations were selected consisting of 75 along the crescent-shaped roads designated as the main traffic roads in the campus, and 31 along the radial roads connecting the semicircular roads using a GPS device for accuracy. A total of 212 samples of the topsoil were collected during pre-monsoon (106) and post-monsoon (106) seasons to estimate the variation in roadside pollution round the year. A few leaf samples from the trees along the roads at the same locations were also taken. The soil, dust and leaf samples were analysed under SEM using back-scattered electrons (BSEs) over carbon-coated sample surface. Subsequently, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis was performed on selected phases for a semi-quantitative chemical analysis to confirm the heavy mineral phases present in the soil and leaf samples. Significant increase in zones of high magnetic susceptibility was observed near the area around BHU main gate, Sir Sundarlal Hospital, Shri Vishwanath Temple, areas around Kendriya Vidyalaya BHU near the Nariya gate, approach road to Sear gate, adjacent region to the Hyderabad gate and the road connecting the Shri Vishwanath Temple and IIT BHU entrance. “The SEM and EDS analyses confirm the occurrence of heavy minerals like magnetite, haematite, ilmenite, zircon, pyrite in the topsoil of the BHU campus,” said Banerjee. He said the results of the study could be applied for environmental monitoring and prioritization of land use and other anthropogenic activities on the campus. The spatial distribution of the zones of high and low roadside pollution is controlled by the emission of selected heavy metals due to fuel combustion and/or construction works related to infrastructural development inside the BHU campus. According to a recent database, about 30,000 students are enrolled in BHU across seven institutes and 16 faculties (streams) and about 140 departments. Apart from the 76 hostels occupied by students, a few thousand faculty members and staff members across disciplines reside with their families in several residential colonies and flats, and guest houses on the campus, making it a township with a population of more than 50,000 people. A wide variety of flora and fauna also contribute to the campus ecosystem. Thus, regular environmental monitoring and assessment is necessary for the BHU campus. The researchers said the determination of heavy metals and magnetic pollutants is crucial because potentially harmful heavy metals can be absorbed in the human body through inhalation ingestion, and dermal contact because of the small size of the heavy metal particles. It should be noted that the micrometre-sized magnetic iron oxides may induce oxidative stress pathways, which leads to the formation of free radicals, and might cause DNA damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/study-on-roadside-pollution-on-bhu-campus-conducted/articleshow/88553998.cms||Binay Singh

It takes on average eight to 10 days for a report to be released, sometimes more. The person whose sample is being tested is thus forced to remain isolated at the centre till the report comes in. The state has two such centres — Cansualim primary health centre and TB hospital, Margao. A UK traveller, who arrived in Goa on December 14, has been stuck in the isolation facility since, as his genome sequencing report is yet to be received. “I tested negative on arrival and was permitted to go home, but asked to be in home quarantine,” he said. “Since I felt ill a day later, I went for a test, and the report was positive. That was December 16. I was not asked to go the isolation facility, and I remained in isolation at home. But on the eighth day of my arrival, the health centre tested me again and transferred me to the state facility.” He has now completed 12 days since testing positive, but he still can’t go home. “I have to return to the UK by mid-January,” he said, adding that he has no symptoms and neither do others sharing the facility, but they’ve only been grounded because of the report delay. For lack of local testing facilities, the directorate of health services sends samples for genome sequencing to a laboratory in Pune, and tests reports are sometimes delayed for months. It is only after the Omicron scare that it received some reports within 8-10 days. However, over 20 reports are yet to be received. Dr Nitish Narvekar, a consultant gynaecologist and clinical director of women’s services at King’s College Hospital, London, slammed the directorate of health services over the inordinate delays in receiving genome sequencing reports. Narvekar tested negative, but his son tested positive on arrival, and has been in an isolation facility since. The son is Goa’s first case of the Omicron variant. Narvekar, who returned to Goa to see his father, who has a heart disease, said that the wait was frustrating, and they were not allowed to leave even as he and his son’s RT-PCR tests have been negative. Health director Dr Ira Almeida said that they would allow the boy to go after 14 days, and that he will not be asked to undergo a test again. “We are following the protocol,” Almeida said. The boy has been at the isolation facility since December 17. Narvekar asked what protocol is being followed by the Goa health services, and also complained of lack of adequate facilities at the centre. Wards are unisex, and children are kept along with adults, he said. “Three wards have a common toilet. Tea is served in the morning, but no meals are provided,” he said. Almeida said that they do provide basic food, but travellers have been given the option of getting food of their choice. The directorate has further activated centres at Aldona and Curchorem for isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/genome-sequencing-report-delays-irk-travellers-stuck-in-isolation/articleshow/88554121.cms||---

Police officers, officials from the forest and revenue departments and fire brigade and members of wildlife rescue teams sealed the entire Market Yard areas from all sides to avoid any chaos due to people’s interference. A team of forest officials from Kolhapur and rescue team from Pune also reached Sangli city. A forest department officer said the process to rescue the animal was going on till late Tuesday night. Deputy conservator of forests Vijay Mane said, “We managed to block the animal in one of the lanes of the Sangli city Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Market Yard. Our six teams of forest department, wildlife rescuers, police, revenue department, fire-brigade and city administration are deployed across the Market Yard to prohibit any human interference. Section 144 has been imposed in the entire Market Yard area.” Clement Ben, chief conservator of forests (territorial) said, “Taking the bison out of the Sangli city area is risky both for the animal and humans beings. This is because the distance to the farmland is nearly 4km away from the Sangli city. Our teams have decided to trap the bison in a rescue vehicle. For this, a proper ramp is being created for the animal to enter the vehicle. Once trapped, our veterinary doctors will check the medical status of the bison and decide whether to keep it under medical observation or release it into its habitat.” Amol Jadhav, an animal rescuer and member of Nature Conservation Society in Sangli, said, “The bison was in the Sangliwadi area for the last three days. On Tuesday morning, it entered into city limits via the Irwin bridge, Gaonbhag, Vakharbhag, Ganesh market and railway station chowk route and got blocked in the Market Yard area.” Digambar Mane, a trader from the Sangli APMC Market Yard area, said, “The entire area was made free of human beings and all the traders were told to shut theur shops. Auction of turmeric, jaggery, vegetables and foodgrain worth crores of rupee takes place at the Sangli APMC market yard. There was no business on Tuesday because of the bison.” On December 10, a bison had entered Kolhaour city near Jamdar club adjacent to the Panchganga ghat. It had, however, went towards the farmland and and was again spotted at Bhuyewadi village, nearly 4km from Kolhapur city. On December 11, a 21-year-old youth from the Bhuyewadi village was gored by the bison when it was trying to escape after being spooked by a crowd trying to shoot the animal away from the agricultural fields. On December 17, a woman was injured in a bison attack at Sonyachi Shiroli village in the Radhanagari tehsil of Kolhapur. Again on December 26, a farmer was injured in a bison attack at Girgaon village in the Bhudargad tehsil of Kolhapur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bison-enters-sangli-city-rescue-ops-onamid-section-144-in-market-yard-area/articleshow/88551786.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

There are over 51 lakh such children in the state and they have the option of using Covaxin as per the Centre's guidelines. Parents need not worry as the state government has enough stock to start vaccinating children from January 3, officials said. According to them, as the vaccination drive had slowed down in October and November, a lot of doses are already in stock. “We have around 40 lakh doses of Covid vaccines, out of those around 17 lakh doses are Covaxin. This can be used to vaccinate children,” said a senior health department official. The vaccines will be distributed across the state, said the official, adding that more doses would be supplied by the Centre as per requirement. Since schools opened many children have been infected by the virus. Vaccination will now help to normalise education in schools and is expected to reduce hesitation among parents in sending kids to educational institutions. In November, 35 children below 18 years were found infected by Covid. After the schools started offline classes, the health health department scaled up sample collection from schools. When children were diagnosed with Covid in November, the parents raised their concerns and demanded the schools continue with online classes. Following this, the state government allowed schools to conduct both online and offline classes. “We have over 51 lakh children who belong to the 15-18 age group. We have enough vaccines to start the drive for children from January 3. We have also received guidelines from the Centre on vaccinating childrens,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, project director, health department. Parents, who were hesitant in sending their children to schools, are also waiting for the vaccination to start.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-has-enough-vax-stock-to-inoculate-children-from-jan-3/articleshow/88554005.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The incident took place when he was returning after a practice session of basketball. His father Sameer Bhatia said that Daksh was all set to participate in a national-level tournament for which he was practising hard. Doctors said that the accident was severe and the parents could not even see his face. He was taken to a hospital where he was declared brain-dead. The local social workers approached Sameer Bhatia and counselled him on organ donation. He agreed readily, seizing an opportunity to give a new lease of life to others and provide a long-lasting memory for his son. On December 27, his body was brought from Mehsana to Ahmedabad to retrieve his organs. The doctors got two kidneys and a liver which will soon be transplanted to patients at IKRDC. “It was the first instance where a patient who had died outside the campus was brought for the organ retrieval for us. It’s a matter of great pride for us that the donation was carried out a day after we completed the first year of our first cadaver donation,” said Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent, Civil Hospital. The State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO) officials said that despite it being a pandemic year, 2021 saw a huge jump in organ donation especially through institutional awareness and tireless work by several NGOs for the cause. Surat and Ahmedabad have recorded the maximum donations. Officials said that each cadaver donation reduces burden of retrieval from a live donor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/player-gives-new-lease-of-life-to-others/articleshow/88553458.cms||---

Both are natives of Alappuzha. They had escaped from the state after the murder and were held from Bengaluru on Tuesday. Meanwhile, district police chief G Jaidev said that the details of the arrested could be disclosed only after conducting their identification parade before Ranjith’s mother Vinodini and wife Lisha, who both had witnessed the murder. Earlier, five SDPI workers were arrested in connection with Ranjith murder. They were charged for destroying evidence and helping the accused. Meanwhile, the investigation team got the custody of nine accused who were remanded in the murder of SDPI state secretary K S Shan. Shan was knocked down from his bike by a car at Mannanchery around 7.30pm on December 18 and was stabbed by a group of assailants. He succumbed to his injuries at a hospital around midnight. BJP OBC Morcha state secretary Ranjith Sreenivasan, 44, was murdered in Alappuzha town around 6.30am on December 19 after around 12 armed men barged into his house and hacked him to death in front of his wife, mother and younger daughter. Both murders happened within a short span of time, prompting speculation on intelligence failure and lack of adequate precautionary measures on the part of the police. Those directly involved in both the murders escaped from the state and police teams are in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to nab the remaining accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ranjith-murder-2-sdpi-men-arrested/articleshow/88552606.cms||---

The CPM has started distributing leaflets supporting the project and alleging an unholy nexus among opponents of the project in its house-to-house visits.  KPCC president K Sudhakaran said the party would also distribute leaflets against the project in its campaign. The leaflets will highlight the threats to the state and its economy posed by the project. It will also organize district-wise meetings to counter the CPM campaign.  He said the party would rally those who stand to lose their land and properties to the project in its protests across the state. He said the project is going to be the biggest threat to the environment and the state is not going to gain anything from it. A meeting of KPCC office-bearers will be convened soon to finalize the action plan for this campaign. The KPCC has also decided to seek UDF support for it. The next UDF meeting will give a final shape to the campaign to counter the CPM strategies, he said. Besides the CPM door-to-door campaign, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has also decided to tour districts and directly interact with people to rally support for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/in-tit-for-tat-congress-too-to-go-door-to-door/articleshow/88553439.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Traders at odds with formula for shops||NEW DELHI: Business owners aren’t happy with the government’s decision to have shops in the markets opening on alternate days according to their odd or even numbering. They insisted this would not help crowd management because the congestion was created by illegal hawkers and encroachers. Trading bodies also expressed concern about further losses at a financially difficult time. New Delhi Traders Association of Connaught Place claimed that its members would comply with the “mini lockdown, assuming this is to contain the spread of Covid spread”. Atul Bhargava, president of the body, added, “The odd-even opening of shops, however, is not a solution. The focus should be on crowd management in the markets.” Bhargava also claimed, “As soon as the Covid cases started increasing, we directed members to implement no-mask-no-entry, social distancing and thermal checks. We are getting the entire market sanitised and have also requested New Delhi Municipal Council’s health department to do so.” Traders complained that two lockdowns had left them struggling in the absence of relief or subsidies from the government and Tuesday’s announcement of odd-even operations would adversely affect income because salaries and overheads like rent, taxes, utility bills still had to be paid. Many of them argued that the municipal corporations failing to curb encroachments and check illegal hawking was the main cause for the crowding in the markets. “Every lane in our market has hundreds of hawkers, most of them unauthorised,” alleged Nitin Gupta, president, Kamla Nagar Traders’ Association. “They take up the entire space on pavements, leaving no way for people to move around. We don’t have crowding inside shops.” Rakesh Yadav, president, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association, too was unhappy. He said, “With the implementation of the night curfew, our employees and labourers transporting or lifting goods at night are facing problems. We were okay with that, but this odd-even thing is too much at this point of time. Even with the shops closed, the hawkers could still cause congestion.” Brijesh Goel, chairman, Chamber of Trade & Industry, pointed out that in unplanned markets with unnumbered shops, implementing odd-even wasn’t feasible. “Trade associations cannot control crowds on the roads. They don’t have the power to do it,” he said. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said closure of trading activities and restaurants should have been the last resort because businesses weren’t in an “economically comfortable situation”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-at-odds-with-formula-for-shops-/articleshow/88553441.cms||Vibha Sharma

At the time of the incident, Rohini and two others were in the vehicle. No one was injured, but the the vehicle was damaged. A case of attempt to murder has been registered at the Muktainagar police station. “It was an attempt on my life and I am fortunate that I remained unhurt,” Rohini told TOI. Jalgaon superintendent of police (SP) Pravin Munde confirmed the incident and said police teams were working to arrest the assailants. Inspector Rahul Khatal of the Muktainagar police station said the assailants were on the run and efforts were on to trace and arrest them. Eknath Khadse told TOI that his daughter was returning home after attending a social function when seven armed people on three bikes forced the driver to stop the car. “They tried to open the rear door of the car. Rohini was on the rear seat. Fortunately, the door was locked. The men smashed the headlights of the car and also the windscreen. The driver of Rohin’s car showed presence of mind and managed to safely drive her home,” said Khadse. Khadse alleged that the suspects were associated with Shiv Sena and Rohini had managed to identify three of them. He added that he had informed deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, home minister Dilip Walse-Patil and NCP president Jayant Patil about the incident. Jalgaon Shiv Sena president Vishnu Bhangale said the police probe was on to identify the suspects behind the attack. “The police should verify the allegations made in the complaint. If such a thing has actually happened, it should definitely come to the fore,” he said. Eknath Khadse apprehended that the attack on his daughter could be a fallout of the differences between the two parties. “About 10 days agi, Rohini was heckled at during a scuffle between NCP and Sena workers in the local body elections. Though the issue was resolved, some Sena members had five days ago outraged the modesty of a senior NCP leader at her home. A police complaint was registered and the suspects were arrested. They got bail on Monday morning,” said the former minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/attack-on-rohini-khadses-car-in-jalgaon-probe-on/articleshow/88551807.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘CBI didn’t conduct proper probe in Walayar case’||KOCHI: Patron of Walayar Action Council patron CR Neelakandan said that the council will take legal recourse after perusing the chargesheet submitted by CBI at the Pocso court in Palakkad. The mother of the minor girls, who were found dead in their home in Walayar, said that she hopes to get a copy of the chargesheet soon since she has completed all the necessary legal procedures. The chargesheet reportedly says that the girls, aged 13 and nine, committed suicide due to the repeated physical abuse they endured. CBI’s reported findings corroborates what the state police had said. “Going by the reports on the findings in CBI’s chargesheet, we assume that proper investigation into the deaths of the girls was not done by the agency. We shared many details with the CBI and it seems the agency has not considered the same,” said Neelakandan. We had approached the court requesting that the investigation should be done under its supervision. As CBI took up the case, the court asked us to approach it if we had further complaints. Once we peruse the CBI chargesheet, we will return to court and continue the fight. In Sr Abhaya case, the chargesheet was revised four times by CBI to ensure punishment for the accused, he said. The 13-year-old girl was found hanging at her home in January 2017. Two months later, her sister was found hanging at the same house. Police arrested five in connection with the case. But, the local Pocso court acquitted some of the accused, which led to a huge uproar. Later, the government handed over the case to CBI following the request of the mother.

The man, who stays alone, was counselled after the team found out that he was battling depression after he lost his job at an automobile showroom during the lockdown, after he took a customers’ money for his personal use, to clear the debts. However, the matter worsened when his employer learned about his act and fired him from his job, and held his one-month salary and September month incentive.  This was the 29th person, with suicide tendencies, whose life was saved by the Mumbai Cybercrime police during the current year. In the latest case, the man has posted a two-page suicide note which was tagged to many people. “The Virar man is the 29th that our team has saved in 2021. The man planned to end his life after learning that his employer is going to deposit the cheque that was taken from him to compensate for the money he has taken from the workplace.

A police officer said the incident occurred at 4pm on Monday when the tailor from Thadagam was transporting a dozen yoga mats on his two-wheeler to Anaikatti after stitching work. “He was stopped at Mangarai police check post by cops Manikandan, 28, and Karthikeyan, 29, who were attached to the IVth battalion of the Tamil Nadu Special Police. Manikandan asked the tailor to show the bills for the mats. When the tailor failed to produce the same, the cop asked him to open the mats and took away one of them, before letting him go.” The officer said head constable Muthusamy, who was attached to Thudiyalur police station, was incharge of the check post on the day and he was sitting in the booth as a mute spectator when the incident took place. Pointing out that the yoga mats were made by tribal women of Anaikatti at a unit run by scientist turned social activist R Soundararajan, the officer said the unit owner had taken up the issue with superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinam, who directed deputy superintendent of police Rajapandian (Periyanaickenpalayam sub-division) to take necessary action. Meanwhile, the Thadagam police checked the CCTV footage at the check post and confirmed the incident. Subsequently, Muthusamy was transferred to the rural armed reserve police the same night, while Manikandan and Karthikeyan were sent back to the headquarters at Kovaipudur. Preliminary inquiry also revealed that one of the cops attached to the IVth battalion had taken bribe from a motorist through e-wallet. “DSP Rajapandian has sent a detailed report to the SP and the same will be forwarded to the Tamil Nadu Special Police officials for further action,” the officer said. He said Thadagam police sub-inspector Arumuga Nayinar had visited Soundararajan at his residence and returned the mat on Monday night itself. “The activist has appreciated police officials for their swift action.” The officer said they have decided not to post police personnel at the Mangarai check post for more than 15 days at a stretch to curb similar incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/3-cops-in-soup-after-taking-away-yoga-mat-from-tailor/articleshow/88553449.cms||---

The TPR of Vidarbha region was more than 0.5% for the third time in this week. An increasing number of positive patients, under-treatment patients and TPR above 0.5% for three days in a week together indicate a fresh surge of Covid-19 cases in the region. This could be the early onset of new wave too. As a result, all district administrations in Vidarbha have introduced fresh curbs on public events, gatherings and crowding. Nagpur district registered 44 cases including 34 from city, three from rural and seven from outside district, against a lone recovered patient on Tuesday. Now, the month of December has reported more cases than last four months. The next three days of the month are likely to increase the ultimate tally.

---||Coimbatore||‘Take speedy action on sexual harassment plaints from kids’||Coimbatore: The monthly meeting for the district chief education officers (CEOs) that was held on Tuesday featured a special session on effectively handling sexual harassment complaints from the students. The meeting was organized by the school education department officials, who asked the CEOs to ensure an internal inquiry immediately after receiving sexual harassment complaints and inform the ChildLine 108 and police for further investigation, instead of delaying action on such complaints. It is to be noted that a government school teacher was arrested in the district a few days ago after a section of girl students took to the road, demanding action against the teacher for sexual harassment. The students had reportedly lodged a complaint with the headmistress a week before staging the protest, but there was no action. Hence, the CEOs were asked to ensure speedy inquiry, after informing concerned authorities. The officials have also asked the CEOs to ensure appropriate intervention to bridge the learning gap among the students. Pointing out that the prolonged interval of physical classes was a major reason for the learning gap, they have asked the CEOs to provide the students additional training to improve the learning curve. The school education department officials have also asked the CEOs to do the needful to trace the students, who have been absent from the school for a long time and enrol them back to schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/take-speedy-action-on-sexual-harassment-plaints-from-kids/articleshow/88553476.cms||TNN

Stating that the industry is yet to recover from the earlier losses, they said the industry had been struggling for survival ever since the first closure due to the pandemic last year. The government could have considered the total number of Covid cases in a facility, or restricted the number of members at the centres, they argued. “This decision has come as a death warrant for us. It will completely destroy the already struggling fitness industry,” said Chirag Sethi, vice-president of Delhi Gym Association, an umbrella body of gyms in the city. “All gym owners are already under the burden of paying the older debt of rent, and the fixed electricity charges and other expenses. Now with this decision, we will be pushed to bankruptcy,” he added. The national capital has over 5,500 gyms and fitness centres. Urging the government to reconsider the decision, Sethi said the gyms were always the first entity to get closed and the last to open. “The gym owners have already suffered a lot due to the previous closures. We urge for the support of the government. We request Delhi Disaster Management Authority to reconsider the decision,” he added. Gym owners also claimed that gyms were the softest target. “While gyms are closed, saloons are not shut. This doesn’t make sense. We could have reduced the number of visitors or given them different time slots. We are not big brands. Where will we go and how will we pay our trainers?” asked Pawan Singh, the owner of a bodyshaper gym in New Ashok Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/-a-death-warrant-say-gym-owners/articleshow/88553483.cms||---

The campaign was undertaken as mosquito density, especially of culex and anopheles increases by February. The AMC will be visiting residential areas in the coming weeks. In all, the AMC's health team has collected Rs 4.38 lakh in fines from owners of these constriction sites where breeding was found. A majority of these constriction sites were in west zone with 69 premises, while there were 50 in east zone. In the posh northwest zone, 32 constriction sites were found breeding mosquitos. The team visited Gota, Chandkheda, Bodakdev, Jodhpur, Vatva, Naranpura, Shahibaug, Stadium, Sardarnagar, Nikol, Ramol and Vatva. “We realized that many were unaware of flaws in their existing designs. Design flaws help in mosquito breeding,” said a senior AMC health official. He said that AMC teams will visit residential areas after three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-fines-127-construction-sites-for-mosquito-breeding/articleshow/88553486.cms||---

This year, the number of dengue cases has hit 3,089 cases. These are cases reported from 125 private and government general hospitals that have been providing disease data to the AMC on a regular basis.  In 2019, the number of cases reported in the city was 4,547 cases. Interestingly, chikungunya cases increased to 1,725 cases this year, till December 25, which is now a matter of concern for the civic body. In 2019, there were just 183 chikungunya cases reported, while 923 cases were reported in 2020. “We fear that chikungunya numbers will rise further by the end of February. We will be intensifying our house visits and will inform families about Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding, which is now a cause of concern,” said a senior AMC health official. On the other hand, the number of malaria cases, which used to reach about 3,000 a decade ago, was just 987 this year. “There were only eight malaria cases reported in December, a clear sign of that the plasmodium parasite is now less worrying than the dengue and chikungunya viruses. No Zika cases have been detected till now,” the AMC health official said. Among waterborne diseases, the number of typhoid cases almost doubled this year to 2,154 from 1,338 cases last year. Some 64 cholera cases were reported this year in the city. “The number of jaundice cases doubled as well. There were 664 cases registered in 2020 while this year till December 25 we have recorded 1,433 cases,” the AMC health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dengue-chikungunya-cases-in-city-spiked-this-year/articleshow/88553485.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra assembly passes bill to amend Public Universities Act amid uproar||MUMBAI: The state legislative assembly on Tuesday cleared the Maharashtra Public Universities (Third Amendment) Act, 2021, which proposes to appoint the minister of higher and technical education as pro-chancellor and introduces changes in the process for vice-chancellor appointment. The opposition opposed the tabling of the bill and demanded that it be sent to a joint select commitee for further deliberations. But, the state government cleared the proposal based on a majority even as the opposition raised slogans inside the House. Speaking outside the House opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said they will approach the governor asking him to not give his assent to the bill. “We will also launch an agitation from January seeking repeal of the bill. The bill aims at politicizing the universities,” he said. Meanwhile, higher and technical minister Uday Samant said similar process has been followed by many states. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said there is no insult to the governor and this is not an attempt to water down his powers. As per the amendment, the selection committee will recommend five names for the post of vice-chancellor of which the state government will shortlist two and send them to the governor, who is also the chancellor of universities. The governor has to select one of the two names within 30 days. If the state does not approve any of the persons recommended, it may call for a fresh list either from the same committee or after constitution of a new one. Similarly, three names will be shortlisted by the state for the post of pro-chancellor and will be sent to the governor for his selection. The bill gives wide-ranging powers to the pro chancellor, from chairing the varsity’s senate to presiding over the convocation ceremony in the chancellor’s absence. It also empowers the state to nominate members on the senate management council. The bill makes way for constitution of the board of preservation and promotion of Marathi language and literature and the board of equal opportunity. A post of the director for the board of preservation and promotion of Marathi language and literature will also be created.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-assembly-passes-bill-to-amend-public-universities-act-amid-uproar/articleshow/88554562.cms||---

Real estate industry players, however, said the decline in prices had not been across the board, and developers were increasingly passing on significantly increased input costs, steel, cement, among others, on to homebuyers. “In our business, we have noticed a 4-5% rise in prices in the last 12 months. Customers have become much more discerning and are choosing reputed developers. However, there are indeed many developers who have a lot of inventory left, and also have to service debt. That is why they are having to make the choice to sell at lower rates,” said Rohit Gera, managing director of Gera Developments. JLL, in its recent residential market assessment across the Indian market, noted that in the quarter ending September 2021, Pune has the lowest level of unsold inventory across the seven major cities, at around three years, also noting that prices have not moved upwards by a significant degree, largely due to the realtors seeking to move stock along with incentives for customers. Knight Frank also noted that inventory levels in the Pune market remained low, albeit at around two years, but also added that home prices reduced marginally year-on-year in the September 2021 quarter, by around 1.5%. “Until June 2021, prices were largely moving down, and as the second wave of the pandemic eased, they rose once again. However, we have noticed a slight de-growth in prices year-on-year, till September. With the low levels of inventory, the situation is improving. But the increase in home prices depend on how much customers are willing to absorb the passing on of construction costs,” said Vivek Rathi, director of research at Knight Frank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/despite-low-overhang-levels-house-prices-largely-stable-in-pune-reports/articleshow/88553487.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Delhi||DUSIB to set up more night shelters to mind the gap||New Delhi: This is the second winter in a row when the homeless population of the national capital doesn’t have to just face Delhi’s biting cold but also the spectre of Covid-19. While the Delhi government is already running around 200 temporary shelters for the homeless, it is now hiking the number by 25%, keeping in mind the rising threat of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which manages these shelters, used to install around 70-75 temporary shelters every winter, but the number was increased to more than 200 last year to ensure social distancing after the pandemic outbreak. “This time, we have already installed 200 temporary shelters and a total 250 will now come up,” Bipin Rai, a member of DUSIB’s board, told TOI. “We have issued directions for maintaining social distancing at the shelters and also sanitisation of those coming there. We are providing breakfast, lunch and dinner,” Rai said. He said a lot of emphasis was also being given on the vaccination of the homeless population. “We have two separate vaccination centres for our temporary shelters itself,” Rai said. The number of temporary shelters was increased last year to ensure social distancing of at least six feet. As the shelters accommodate over 10,000 people every winter, the numbers had to go up to increase the gap. DUSIB starts a Winter Action Plan for the homeless people from November 15 every year, before the harsh winter sets in in the city. Pagoda tents are set up every winter as temporary shelters that are fire retardant and waterproof. These tents also have beds and mattresses and are set up at locations that see high concentration of the homeless population. The provision of providing three, instead of two, meals every day was also started last year. DUSIB has rescue teams, which bring many homeless people to the shelters. A DUSIB helpline number also remains operational 24x7 during the winter season. Those who want to help can download the Rain Basera mobile application from Google Play Store, on which they can upload photos of any area with homeless people. Officials said these homeless people would then be rescued by DUSIB’s teams. The Delhi government also deploys medical teams to carry out health check-ups of the homeless. The health department carries out regular inspections of shelters and extends health facilities, a government official said. While DUSIB manages the shelters, the urban development department of the Delhi government carries out coordination with various other departments, including Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Police, and revenue, public works, power and health departments, for providing various facilities at the shelters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dusib-to-set-up-more-night-shelters-to-mind-the-gap/articleshow/88553489.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The incident came to light when Anas’ phone number was found on the mobile phone of an accused who attacked a KSRTC conductor, Madhu Sudhan, a Mullaringad resident, for sharing a cartoon on Prophet Mohammed on Facebook. The attack allegedly carried out by SDPI and Popular Front of India activists for “blasphemy” took place on December 3. The conductor was attacked brutally after the vehicle he was travelling with his children was stopped. In connection with the case, police arrested four SDPI activists. During the probe, Anas’ number was found on the phone of the accused. According to Thodupuzha deputy SP K Sadan, a detailed inquiry revealed that the accused and the CPO were close friends for the last 11 years, and Anas had handed over details of RSS-BJP leaders from the police crime records. Following this incident, DSP K Sadan submitted a report to Idukki SP on December 16. Based on the report, the SP transferred Anas from Karimannoor police station to Idukki police headquarters and suspended him on Tuesday. DSP K Sadan told TOI, “Police would take department-level action against Anas. His mobile phone has already been seized for further investigation.” According to police, a detailed inspection will be conducted to find the connection between the CPO and SDPI leader. Police also decided to probe any relation with the recent incidents and details leaked by Anas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cop-suspended-for-leaking-details-of-bjp-rss-leaders/articleshow/88552715.cms||---
---||Delhi||The show can’t go on: Multiplex business dealt another body blow in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Till a week ago, multiplexes in the city were drawing movie viewers in good numbers. Things looked bright with major films lined up for release. Tuesday’s orders to shut down cinemas in the face of increasing Covid-19 cases, therefore, couldn’t have come at a worse time for the multiplexes or the mall where they are located. The decision has caused massive uncertainty and could lead to irreparable damage for the industry, railed Kamal Gainchandani, president, Multiplex Association of India. The period since March 2020 has been the most challenging period for Indian cinemas and, after being permitted to reopen, he said, the cinemas “demonstrated an ability to operate safely for the public and employees through enhanced ventilation systems, enhanced hygiene and other safety protocols”. “Not a single outbreak of Covid anywhere around the world has been traced to a cinema,” he asserted. The association said it accepted the necessity for preventive measures, but urged the authorities to consider double vaccination proof to enter theatres and to restrict seating rather than shut down cinema halls. “We ask the government to recognise the unique social, cultural and economic value of the Indian film industry, and to provide it the support it so desperately needs to survive this unprecedented period,” Gainchandani said. The shutting down of cinemas and early closing of restaurants will mean low footfall at the malls. Most malls were hoping to end the year on a high and were ready with their protocols. "The safety of our customers, partners and employees remains our primary priority,” said Pushpa Bector, executive director, DLF Retail. “Throughout the Covid period, we successfully provided customers with safe spaces and will continue to adhere to the guidelines laid down by the authorities.” New Year parties being cancelled has hit business at nightclubs, bars and lounges. A restaurant owner said a fortnight ago industry people were considering opening new outlets, but with this development, will be left trying to save their existing businesses. Some restaurants, like earlier, are pinning their hopes on food delivery income, and National Restaurant Association of India has written to Delhi government to allow delivery of cooked food during the curfew hours. The letter from Prakul Kumar, secretary general, NRAI, says, “We humbly request you to ensure that delivery of cooked food from restaurants continues without facing any problems/discontinuity. This will bring in the much needed relief to the industry at this critical juncture, and help prevent further business closures and job losses for millions of workers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-show-cant-go-on-business-dealt-another-body-blow/articleshow/88553504.cms||Amin Ali

It involves launch of a diabetes care improvement team project. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Doctors say the disease affects millions globally and it is linked to many other non-communicable diseases. The foundation and AIIMS’ doctors will together work towards creating awareness about the disease and measures to prevent it, officials said at the project launch on Tuesday, which was also the 69th birth anniversary of former finance minister Arun Jaitley. A remembrance ceremony was also held at the DDA park, Siri Fort, and the DDCA stadium. “Took Dad’s blessings & paid floral tribute to him at @arunjaitley Park, New Delhi. I miss him almost every day.

---||Delhi||SDMC to regularise illegal constructions in shops at fixed rate||New Delhi: In a one-time offer, South Delhi Municipal Corporation will regularise the unauthorised constructions done by shops in many markets at a fixed charge and make the property freehold for them. This will generate good revenue for the civic body and allow shopkeepers to have a clear title of the commercial property that will reduce their unnecessary harassment, said officials. The corporation has decided to levy 50% of the conversion charge at circle rate, Rs 5,00,000 for each division and amalgamation of shops along with an affidavit that they will either remove the unauthorised construction or get it regularised from the department, as a one-time opportunity for the shopkeepers to convert the property from leasehold to freehold. Over whether this move will promote unauthorised construction, SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said: “The person did construction without permission, we are penalising them, and this is just a one-time opportunity. The proposal was pending for a long time, it will ease the process for the shopkeepers to get their properties converted to freehold. This will not promote unauthorised construction as it is our market and we are giving them permission in a one-time offer”. Earlier, the corporation had come up with a proposal to give relaxations to the shopkeepers to sell their properties. But it did not provide the desired results. “Despite above relaxations, it has been observed that lessees are not coming forward for conversion of their property from leasehold to freehold. Huge rates of the damage or misuse charges and determination period for damage charges may be the main reasons,” said Gyanesh Bharti, SDMC commissioner, in a letter. In 2006, the Land and Development Office transferred markets to the unified municipal corporation with an aim that the corporation will act as a licensor in respect of commercial shops. At present, SDMC is the competent authority in 44 markets in south Delhi. In 2018, the south corporation came up with a proposal that damage charges on account of unauthorised construction in commercial land use of leasehold shops transferred from the Land and Development Office be charged only after the removal of the encroachment within six months. As per the rules of leasehold property, “the allottee shall not make any alteration in the transferred premises either externally or internally without obtaining the permission of the government in writing”. “The purpose of this policy is to ease the process of conversion to freehold and to generate revenue,” said Prem Shankar Jha, director, land and estate department, SDMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-to-regularise-illegal-constructions-in-shops-at-fixed-rate/articleshow/88553505.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Bodies of 3 men found on Belan bridge; kin claim murder, seek aid||Prayagraj: The mysterious death of two brothers and another person, whose bodies were found lying on the Belan river bridge late Monday night, triggered tension in the trans-Yamuna area of the Prayagraj district on Tuesday with the locals demanding government compensation for the kin of the deceased. While police claimed that all the three men were run over by a speeding unidentified heavy vehicle on Belan river bridge at Gajodharpur village under the limits of Koraon police station late on Monday night due to heavy fog, family members of the deceased persons and locals refuted the local police claim and demanded a high-level probe into the incident. Their family members asserted that all the three persons, who left their houses on Monday evening to collect money for their crops, were murdered and their bodies were thrown on Belan river bridge. The irate locals did not allow the police to take bodies for post-mortem. However, when senior police officers assured them that only a post-mortem will reveal the exact cause of the deaths and assured their family members of action, they allowed the bodies to be taken. SP (Trans Yamuna) Saurabh Dixit said, “The bodies have been sent post-mortem to find the exact cause of death. A panel of doctors has been set up to conduct the autopsy. The family members of the deceased persons along with the local blocked vehicular movement on the Belan river bridge for some hours. They were seeking economic assistance to the kin of the deceased and a joint team of police and district authorities are looking into their demand.” The SP added “When the local police reached the incident site along with some locals, they found a dense layer of fog enveloping the area. Fog might have resulted in a road accident which claimed the three lives. However, a group of locals along with the family members of the deceased persons had blocked the Belan river bridge road suspecting a foul play.” The incident, as per police, took place when three persons, including the two brothers — Vikas Kesarwani (25) and Akash Kesarwani (22) — along with another person, Kalwa Kol (20), all residents of Gajadharpur village, were going to Dramandganj to collect money for their sold crops. Their family members told the police that all the three had gone to Dramandganj on a bike to collect around Rs 3 lakh for selling the crops. When they did not return till late night hours, the worried family members started searching for them and found their bodies at around 2am on the Belan river bridge road. Police said that a probe was being conducted into the incident and help of CCTV footage was also being examined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bodies-of-3-men-found-on-belan-bridge-kin-claim-murder-seek-aid/articleshow/88554122.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Centre to buy 6 lakh MT of rice from Telangana, but stand-off unlikely to end||HYDERABAD: After weeks of allegations and counter allegations between TRS and BJP, with the former even threatening to dump paddy at India Gate in New Delhi, the central government finally sent a written assurance to the state that it will procure an additional 6 lakh metric tonnes of vanakalam (kharif) rice from Telangana. But the stand-off between the state and central government over paddy procurement looks to be far from having been resolved as the state has been demanding that the Centre procure at least 80 lakh MT of paddy. On Tuesday, Union food ministry under secretary Jai Prakash wrote to the Telangana civil supplies commissioner that the government of India has approved enhancement of procurement target of rice by 6 lakh MT of kharif crop. This assurance takes the revised total procurement target of raw rice of Kharif by the Centre under the central pool to 46 lakh MT from Telangana. The Centre has already made it clear that it will not procure parboiled rice of the yasangi (Rabi) season from Telangana. Telangana civil supplies corporation chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy accused the central government of meting out step-motherly treatment to Telangana.“Despite financial constraints, the TRS government in the last seven years has procured 6 crore metric tonnes of paddy, paying Rs 96,000 crore to farmers. Telangana stands first in paddy procurement in south India and second in the country after Punjab,” he said. “Why is the Centre treating Telangana so indifferently. As much as 85 lakh MT in Punjab and 55 lakh MT of rice in Haryana was procured by the Centre. What is the problem in procuring 80 lakh MT of paddy from Telangana,” he asked. On one side the BJP government at the Centre is playing political drama by refusing to solve problems of paddy farmers in Telangana and on the other, Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy is playing with the lives of farmers by asking them to cultivate paddy in yasangi, knowing well that the Centre will not procure it, Mareddy Srinivas Reddy said. Civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar said CM will respond to Centre’s decision to procure only 6 lakh MT of rice from Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-to-buy-6l-mt-of-rice-but-stand-off-unlikely-to-end/articleshow/88552706.cms||Roushan Ali

He said it reflects that both the TRS and BJP have a tacit understanding. Uttam who as former PCC president also demanded the state government to allot Rs 5,000 crore as bonus for procurement of paddy in the ensuing yasangi (Rabi) season. Terming chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as anti-farmers, he called upon the farmers to cultivate paddy in yasangi season and sought to assure that the Congress would see to it that the central and state governments procured paddy from them. “The Congress will stand by the farmers and fight on their behalf in the Assembly and Parliament,” he said. He said CM KCR should explain what is the use of Rs 2 lakh crore annual budget of the state if it did not address the issues of the farmers. “The TRS government has become so incompetent that it is unable to take action on the rice millers who have defaulted in giving back one lakh tons of rice,” he alleged. Uttam demanded the state government should give a bonus of Rs 500 per quintal of paddy on MSP as is being done in Chhattisgarh, in the Yasangi season as the broken rice problem would be there. “Why did the TRS government agree for procure 40 lakh tonnes of rice by the centre in the Kharif season. States smaller than Telangana were able to secure more procurement by the centre. While the centre has given a target of procuring 60 lakh tonnes of paddy in Telangana, till date the state government has procured only 54 lakh tonnes,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uttam-hits-out-at-trs-bjpover-sccl-coal-blocks-sale/articleshow/88552720.cms||---

Pointing out that Sunburn, in a different form, has begun in full-flow with thousands of party goers in attendance, Bhike questioned Sawant’s authority and the value of his assurance given to the people of Goa. “Sawant had categorically told people through the media that the Sunburn festival was not going to be held and that he himself had put a note on the file rejecting it. Despite his words, the party is going ahead in full steam, making a mockery of the chief minister’s statement,” Bhike said. He also hit out at the government for indulging in doublespeak. “The government advises citizens to take care and on the other hand allows such festivals which could turn out to be superspreader events,” he said, adding that the impact of the festival will be known over the coming weeks. “Sawant and his government of incompetents has proven time and again that the welfare of Goans is the last thing on their mind,” he said. Raising an alarm at the rising number of cases across the country, including Goa, in the wake of the Omicron variant, Bhike demanded that the state begin to strictly enforce mandatory protocol measures including at various party zones and that those failing to enforce them should be punished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sunburn-on-despite-cms-word-that-it-wont-be-held/articleshow/88554143.cms||TNN

---||Hyderabad||LKH MD withdraws quash plea from HC in quid pro quo case||Hyderabad: Lepakshi Knowledge Hub (LKH) MD Srinivasa Balaji, an accused in the quid pro quo case, also withdrew his quash petition from the Telangana high court on Tuesday. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan dismissed his plea as withdrawn. Earlier, Indu Projects’ Syam Prasad Reddy, the main accused and the promoter of the project, withdrew his quash pleas both in Lepakshi and Indu Tech Zone cases. They had filed these quash pleas in the HC five years ago and secured stay orders on the trial court process against them. Now, with the withdrawal of pleas, the stay on trial court proceedings too would disappear and it can now begin its process in respect of these accused. Justice Bhuyan also began hearing the petition filed by retired IAS officer BP Acharya, who was made an accused in the Lepakshi charge sheet. He is facing allegations that as then MD of APIIC he had violated norms in allotting 9,000 acres to Lepakshi in Anantapur district. According to CBI, it was with the help of Acharya that Syam Prasad Reddy could mortgage this public land and generate loans from banks. Appearing for Acharya, senior counsel T Pradyumna Kumar Reddy argued that the trial court erred in passing a cognisance order against him in 2021 under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. “The Act was amended in 2018 and when the cognisance was taken in 2021, one would think that the trial court acted in tune with the amended version. But the trial court had acted in accordance with the old Act, which is illegal,” the senior counsel said. The state refused to accord sanction to prosecute Acharya and also asked the Centre do the same. But the Centre has given sanction to prosecute. “Acharya has filed a review petition before the Centre which is currently pending. The CBI court took into cognisance the role of Acharya even when there was a stay order in favour of him in the case,” the senior counsel said. The argument would continue on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lkh-md-withdraws-quash-plea-from-hc-in-quid-pro-quo-case/articleshow/88552714.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Queues may be back outside metro stations||NEW DELHI: Serpentine queues of commuters waiting to enter busy Metro stations are likely to be back from Wednesday with the carrying capacity of public transport reduced to 50% and no standing passengers allowed from Tuesday. As part of the level 1 of the Graded Response Action Plan for the implementation of Covid restrictions (yellow alert), Delhi Metro and public transport buses have been allowed to operate with 50% of its seating capacity and no standing passengers. Para-transit like auto rickshaws, cabs, taxis, e-rickshaws, gramin sewa and phatphat sewa have been allowed to operate with two passengers at a time, while Maxi Cabs can carry up to five passengers and RTVs are allowed to carry up to 11 passengers at a time. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, said that in view of the latest guidelines, entry into Metro stations would be regulated by restricting the number of gates open for the commuters. Out of 712 gates, only 444 will be kept open as of now. In a tweet, DMRC also requested passengers to travel only if absolutely essential and keep some additional time for their travel. With the latest curbs, DMRC’s financial troubles are likely to deepen. When Metro services restarted in September last year after being shut down for 169 days due to the pandemic, Delhi’s transport lifeline saw around 6 to 7 lakh passenger trips a day. In September 2021, the average passenger trips per day stood at 28 lakh and despite the four-fold increase in footfall, the corporation expects to face a loss of around Rs 1,500 crore in the financial year 2021-22. When Metro trains were last allowed to operate with only 50% of its seating capacity and no standing passengers, DMRC was spending more on operations than what it was earning. From July-end, however, 100% seating with no standing passengers was allowed in the trains and a few months later, standing passengers with social distancing were allowed, which helped DMRC gain some of its financial health back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/queues-may-be-back-outside-metro-stns/articleshow/88553534.cms||Sidharatha Roy

In a twist of fate, the group had called up a teetotaler specifically to drive the car after the party, but he appeared to have dozed off, leading to the accident, police said.

---||Nagpur||9pm curbs for all in rural areas, only for wine shops, bars, clubs in city||Nagpur: Becoming probably the first district in the state to impose severe restrictions, collector R Vimala has stopped operation of restaurants, essential and non-essential shops, wine shops, bars, functions etc between 9pm and 6am in rural parts from Tuesday. The collector has also imposed similar restrictions on wine shops, bars and clubs in the city. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B is likely to implement similar restrictions in the city from Wednesday or Thursday. Vimala told TOI, “Cases are on the rise in the district. Nagpur was most affected district in the second wave. Therefore, District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) decided on December 25 to impose restrictions between 9pm and 6am for effective implementation of section 144. But I had to stay the order for two days as the state government order dated December 24 instructed giving adequate public notice before making stricter restrictions applicable. Accordingly, my order was properly publicized in three days. I don’t want to see any family losing any member to Covid-19. I urge all to follow Covid appropriate behaviour.” Medical shops, hospitals and activities related to medical and emergency services will remain open as usual. The civic chief did not implement similar restrictions in the city despite his order dated December 25 mentioning that restrictions after 9pm will come into effect after issuance of public notice by DDMA and its decision on the basis of local situation. On December 26, the collector had informed the state government about the decision taken by DDMA and sought permission for implementation of restrictions after 9pm. Vimala said, “Decision of government on our proposal is yet to be received. We are expecting communication from the government on Wednesday,” she said. NMC officials said an order for implementation of restrictions in city is likely to be issued on Wednesday or Thursday. “We need to maintain same restrictions in entire district to avoid confusion,” they said. Utter confusion prevailed in the city when excise department started sending messages to wine shops, bars and clubs to close at 9pm from Tuesday. Owners of restaurants, lawns, essential and non-essential shops started asking NMC officials, journalists, and corporators whether they too will have to shut at 9pm or continue till existing timings due to lack of communication from NMC administration. President of Pashchim Nagpur Nagarik Mandal Ravi Waghmare said, “It is a good move in the wake of weddings and New Year celebrations. Restrictions should be continued if cases are on the rise, or can be dropped from January 2 in case cases reduce. People, especially youth, are not at all following Covid appropriate behaviour, which is must for containing the virus. The administration is doing its job but it is also our responsibility to protect ourselves from the disease and also our district. NMC should also implement the restrictions in city.” Hotelier Jasbir Singh Arora said, “It is very unfortunate to see different rules for different districts in the state. Government should come up with similar guidelines for entire state. Views of public figures and associations should be taken before planning any changes.” The collector and civic chief had implemented restriction on number of attendees at functions etc in the entire district as announced by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/9pm-curbs-for-all-in-rural-areas-only-for-wine-shops-bars-clubs-in-city/articleshow/88553520.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Goa||Interstate buses run full capacity for New Year||Panaji: Despite rising Covid-19 cases in the state, tourists and Goans settled in neighbouring states have been arriving to Goa to celebrate the New Year this season. Buses of the Kadamba Transport Corporation limited (KTC) coming from Pune, Bengaluru, Solapur, Shirdi, Mumbai and Hyderabad are running full capacity, as a result, for the long weekend. “Bus bookings have been full, from the last weekend itself. The bus tickets for operations during the New Year’s long weekend on December 30-31 and January 1-2 are also sold out,” a KTC official told TOI. As of now, the corporation has not added any extra vehicles on the interstate routes. “We have not started to ply any extra vehicles owing to which we will continue to ply the existing buses on these routes. As per the demand, we shall take a call to add more vehicles on the interstate routes,” the official said. The trend is the same in bus bookings being made of trips returning from Goa to their respective states. The buses have also been pre-booked for January 2-3 since the same passengers will return to their homes “While the flow of passengers leaving Goa after the New Year is very high, the numbers for interstate bus bookings in the week following the New Year is low for both – to and from Goa,” the official said. Seats are available for private bus bookings, however, the prices of the bus tickets are skyrocketing as the weekend approaches. For private buses, the ratio varies between Rs 800 for a non-AC seater bus and goes up to Rs 2,500 for a luxury AC sleeper bus coming to Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/interstate-buses-run-full-capacity-for-new-year/articleshow/88554174.cms||Nida Sayed

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre was trying to save the corporate companies and leaving the farmers to their fate, he alleged. “The state BJP leaders and its MPs have failed to get any funds and projects for development of Telangana,” he said. TRS MLA Jeevan Reddy said BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and Congress chief A Revanth Reddy were inciting the farmers to cultivate paddy knowing well that the Centre will not procure it.

The latest punishment will be concurrent to the life term, which the convict was already undergoing. The convict committed the offence in Bhuvanagiri in 2014 before he was awarded the life imprisonment in a case registered at Hayathnagar. The convict, who is a resident of Andhra Pradesh, impersonated as a vigilance officer and went to the woman’s shop and claimed that she and her husband were indulging in fraudulent practices and extorted Rs 20,000. By claiming that he will take the woman to a higher officer to discuss the issue, he took her to another location where he outraged her modesty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/life-convict-gets-5-yr-jail-in-another-case/articleshow/88552759.cms||---

On Friday, Sai Nikhil Reddy, an engineering student, rammed his car into Das’ bike at Ghatkesar. The accident took place when Das was heading home to Edulabad village. His wife, Neeranjani, who was travelling with him, died on the spot. Cops ascertained that Reddy was heavily drunk while driving and soon after the mishap, he allegedly attempted to flee before locals nabbed him. Kalyan Chand (22), Das’ son, now runs pillar to post to get funds for the treatment of his critically injured father. “My father has a medical insurance of only Rs 3 lakh. The bill is expected to cross Rs 15 lakh. He sustained severe brain damage and multiple fractures on his left hand and left leg,” Chand told TOI. Chand and his younger brother Mahesh Goud (19) are now a worried lot as they are unsure of how they will pay the existing bills let alone their college fees. Despite all this, when Reddy and his family members had offered him a settlement, Chand refused the offer. He says he only wants justice. Chand is pursuing his B.Com final year while Mahesh is in his first year of the same course. Moreover, Chand was already mourning the demise of his grandmother after she succumbed to Covid-19 earlier this year. Police had registered a case under section 304A (causing death due to negligence) and 337 (endangering life) of IPC. Das’ family members are also demanding that cops register a case under section 304(II) of IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). Doctors said that Das is still critical and on ventilator support as he continues to vomit due to the severe head injury. “Even if my father survives, doctors are unsure if he can live a normal life. We don’t know the way forward,” an emotional Chand said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-victim-battles-for-life-son-runs-pillar-to-post-to-pay-bills/articleshow/88552754.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Hyderabad||DRI urges HC to cancel bizman’s bail in Rs 600cr gold fraud||Hyderabad: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), which is investigating irregularities in the gold import scheme, urged the Telangana high court on Tuesday to cancel the bail granted to Pradeep Kumar, managing director of Sri Krishna Jewellers, in a case of misuse of 1,800 kg of gold worth Rs 600 crore. Pradeep was already named as an accused in the case. DRI sleuths had arrested Pradeep under the Customs Act after charging him with violating the provisions of the gold import scheme. Justice K Lalitha sought a status report on the current stage of the probe and posted the case to January 4. Arguing the case of DRI, senior counsel B Narayana Reddy said that Pradeep misused 1,800 kg of gold. Though he was given bail two years ago by the HC on the condition that he should extend his cooperation to the investigators, he was not extending cooperation. On the contrary, he was tampering with the evidence and threatening the witnesses in the case, the DRI counsel said. He was also extending financial assistance to the witnesses in the case and handing out a warning that such assistance would stop if the witness opened his mouth, Narayana said. Pradeep was preventing the witnesses from appearing before the investigators and this was stalling the progress in the probe, the senior counsel said. “We collected a lot of electronic evidence and we have to confront the witnesses with this evidence,” he added. Justice Lalitha, who heard the matter, directed the DRI to come out with more details to show that the accused was indeed tampering with the evidence. Cancellation of bail was a serious matter, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dri-urges-hc-to-cancel-bizmans-bail-in-rs-600cr-gold-fraud/articleshow/88552758.cms||---

---||Delhi||AQI worsens despite drizzle in Delhi, dense fog likely for two days||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality deteriorated to the “very poor” category on Tuesday even as the city recorded light rain towards the afternoon. Track the pollution level in your cityThe weather department has speculated formation of dense fog in the next two days over some isolated areas due to a combination of moisture and mercury. On Tuesday, the city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 305 as against 285 on Monday and 459 a day before. AQI was better in the morning, but began to fall despite the rain towards the evening due to a sudden spike in moisture levels. According to the pollution monitoring agency, it may oscillate within the “poor” category over the next two days. Light rain is likely on Wednesday due to a western disturbance, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) stated. From Thursday to Saturday, winds are likely to be low, reducing ventilation of pollutants. From January 2, AQI is likely to improve due to relatively high winds, SAFAR said. Meanwhile, the weather department warned of intense fog during the morning hours due to high moisture content after the rain. “Also the mercury is low and, from Wednesday, the northern component of winds, which are cool, may arrive. So a combination of temperature and moisture may lead to radiation fog,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD). “Expect moderate fog on Wednesday. But there are chances of intense or dense fog on Thursday morning.” On Tuesday, 3.6mm rainfall was recorded during the afternoon hours that affected the day-time temperatures. The maximum temperature was 18 degrees Celsius as against 22.6 a day before. The minimum temperature was 9.4 degrees as against 10 degrees on Monday. According to IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 20 and 8 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-worsens-despite-drizzle-dense-fog-likely-for-two-days/articleshow/88553533.cms||---

Telangana Congress working president and MLA T Jagga Reddy threatened that Congress will launch agitations in a big way if the power tariff hike proposals were not taken back. “Poor and middle class sections of society will not be able to take the proposed 50 paise per unit hike. How far is it justified to impose nearly Rs 7,000 crore additional burden on the people of Telangana in the form of power tariff hike,” Jagga Reddy asked. “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should reconsider the decision of the government to allow discoms to seek power tariff hike from the electricity regulatory commission as people are already been burdened by increase in the prices of diesel, petrol and gas which has had a cascading effect on the prices of essential commodities and other items,” he said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SCLR extension flyover to miss deadline again, motorists fume||MUMBAI: With the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road (SCLR) extension flyover, that has been in the making for the last five years, set to miss yet another deadline, motorists and residents along the stretch are a harried lot with the daily traffic jams, and loud noise and dust due to the work. Work on the 3.8km SCLR extension bridge connecting LBS Marg to Western Express Highway began in 2016, with the original deadline of 2019. The deadline was later revised to March 2022, but the MMRDA is set to miss the revised deadline too as only 65% of the work has been completed. Motorists are angry as the time taken to traverse this stretch has more than doubled owing to the barricades and diversions. “The journey from Vakola to Santacruz station used to be 10 minutes, now it takes more than 30 minutes,” Bhayander resident Beena Nair complained. Khar resident Selwyn Barreto said, “It takes me one hour on a motorcycle to reach from Khar to places where the SCLR work is undergoing in the Vakola-Kalina belt. It is inexplicable.” Work on the Hans Bhugra Marg stretch in Santacruz (E) has become a major bane for motorists. Two lanes of the bridge have been converted into a one-way as there is no alternative route available to divert traffic. The other two lanes will take time to open for traffic as MMRDA has asked for acquisition of defence land, which comes in the alignment of this bridge. Residents along the stretch have stopped opening their windows to avoid dust and noise. Harmony building resident Shiv Sharma said, “The noise pollution caused by vehicles was there earlier too, but now it has become unbearable as motorists stuck in traffic jams keep honking incessantly.” The project was originally delayed because there was no right of way for construction of the bridge due to encroachments. Also, due to the bridge and the alignment of Metro 2B (D N Nagar to Bandra) overlap, the former’s design at this spot had to be tweaked which led to loss of several manhours. The Covid-induced lockdown also led to loss of crucial time due to acute shortage of labour and construction material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sclr-extension-flyover-to-miss-deadline-again-motorists-fume/articleshow/88554622.cms||Manthank Mehta

The PM quoted Swami Vivekananda to give a message to the students: “Every nation has a message to deliver, a mission to fulfil, a destiny to reach.” The PM said, “When you had come to IIT-Kanpur, you may have had a ‘fear of unknown’ in your mind. Also, your knowledge base was limited. IIT-Kanpur provided you with a large canvas. Now, you do not have ‘fear of unknown’. Your personality stands developed. You have gained a lot of experience. Your ideas have expanded. You must be feeling a change in you now from the time when you had come here to study. Wherever you will go, you will do value addition.

On one hand, you are getting a gift of Metro and on the other hand, the world of technology would get talented students passing out of IIT-Kanpur today. I congratulate you all and your parents and teachers. They have worked hard for you. Their contribution in your life has made you see this day. I congratulate you all.” Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, “We all know that the technical institutions of the country play a vital role in providing quality-driven education. And especially, with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the IITs have been given the status of institute of indigenous technology. The country has implemented the new National Education Policy 2020 to fulfil the vision of a “self-reliant India”. “The state government has contributed mutually with IIT-Kanpur on several projects such as being a technical partner in the Defence Manufacturing Corridor and setting up the Centre of Excellence in the field of AI. Now, the state government has also given approval for an upcoming School of Medical Research and Technology (SMRT) paired with a super-speciality hospital, which would enrich the health system of the state,” he added. Prof. Abhay Karandikar, Director, IIT Kanpur, said, “IIT-Kanpur has been contributing largely to all pillars of development of the nation, be it in the national or in the grass root level, and in that relentless journey, it is the students who have played a vital role along with the guiding faculties. On behalf of the institute, I congratulate all the students receiving their degrees and the awardees.” Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, Chairman, Board of Governors, IIT-Kanpur said, “IIT Kanpur’s vision is not only to produce skilled graduates but also better human beings who would contribute to the greater good of the society and the nation at large. “ After the formal inaugural session, PM Narendra Modi made an impromptu visit to the lecture hall to visit the students and interact with them personally. The students were taken aback with the sudden visit and the interaction. One student exclaimed, “We were overjoyed seeing Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji there suddenly. His presence and his words not only encouraged us, but also made our convocation day a memorable one for the rest of our life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/country-needs-push-for-next-25-yrs-pm-at-iit-k/articleshow/88554166.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

Director general of police (DGP), D Gautam Sawang, said the uptick in crimes against women reflects the efficiency of outreach programs launched by AP police. He said the women who used to suffer in silence earlier, are now coming out to complain with the help of initiatives like Disha app and Spandana program. Presenting the annual crime statistics on Tuesday, the DGP said that year 2021 has been a challenging one and yet a remarkable one for AP police. “We faced some unprecedented situations in policing during 2021 and also received many accolades at national level by topping the charts in many performance indicators when compared to other states,” he said. As many as 1.27 lakh cognizable offences were registered during 2021 as against 1.22 lakh cases in 2020. While the urban areas witnessed an uptrend in crimes, in rural areas the number of crimes has come down. Tirupati urban registered 58 per cent growth in number of cases followed by West Godavari and Visakhapatnam city with 42 per cent and 36 per cent growth rate respectively. Vijayawada city and Guntur urban police units were also not far behind with 30 per cent and 24 per cent growth in crime. In contrast to Visakhapatnam urban, the crime rate dipped by 30 per cent in Visakhapatnam rural police district. Srikakulam registered 22 per cent less crime and Anantapur witnessed 16 per cent dip. When it comes to major heads of crime, crimes against women increased by 21 per cent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Property offences hiked by 15 per cent, bodily offences increased by 6 per cent and crimes against SC/ST rose by 4 per cent. Interestingly, cybercrimes witnessed a down trend in the year 2021 with 18 per cent decline when compared to 2020. In crimes against women, harassment and outraging modesty of women are highest in number with 9,418 and 6,411 cases respectively out of total 17,736 cases registered. Majority of these cases are registered through outreach programs like Disha app and Spandana program. Apart from this, the crimes against women in other categories which are more serious in nature have also increased in the year 2021. The number of rape cases increased from 146 to 160, rape by cheating cases increased from 365 to 376 and cases under POCSO Act rose from 1802 to 2097. Sawang said the Disha initiatives launched by the state government have made police accessible to women. AP police have filed charge sheets in 90.2 per cent of the cases and the conviction rate stands at 75.0 per cent which is the best in the country said the DGP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/crimes-against-women-shoot-up-by-21-to-17736-this-year/articleshow/88552776.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Chandigarh||BJP’s Kamal Gupta, JJP’s Devender Singh Babli take oath as ministers in Haryana||CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar inducted an MLA each from the BJP and the JJP in his second cabinet expansion in two years on Tuesday. BJP’s Hisar MLA Kamal Gupta and JJP’s Devender Singh Babli, who represents Tohana assembly seat, joined Khattar’s team of ministers, raising it to full strength of 14, after being administered the oath of office by governor Bandaru Dattatreya. In Haryana’s 90-member assembly, now the BJP has 40 MLAs and JJP 10. With zero vacancy in cabinet, BJP-JJP alliance MLAs are now likely to be inducted as chairman or head of various boards and corporations. A two-time MLA and an old RSS member, Gupta was the first to take the oath in Sanskrit. Babli, a social worker-turned-politician, took the oath in Hindi. Gupta is considered a favourite of Khattar despite him facing serious charges during the Congress regime. At one point, the was also considered a probable Haryana legislative assembly speaker. He remained quite active during the assembly sessions, defending Khattar from the opposition charges. Babli was a Congressman who joined JJP after he was denied a party ticket. He had defeated former BJP president and now Haryana Bureau of Public Enterprises chairman Subhash Barala with a huge margin. Vij missing at swearing-inThe absence of home, health and family welfare minister Anil Vij during the oath-taking ceremony remained a talking point as other ministers, ministers of state and two Congress MLAs — Neeraj Sharma and Varun Chaudhary — attended the function. Sources said Vij left the CM’s residence around 3.45pm for Ambala, moments before Khattar left for Raj Bhawan. They said the likely reason for Vij’s absence at the oath-taking could be loss of some important portfolios as reshuffling will have to be done to accommodate the new ministers. The development comes a day after Vij called on senior BJP leaders and Union ministers in New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjps-gupta-jjps-babli-take-oath-as-ministers-in-haryana/articleshow/88553551.cms||---

The PM said, “It is one of the big achievements as we have been able to deliver the projects within the stipulated timeline and were able to commence the commercial operations of Kanpur Metro in just 2 years 2 months which is a milestone in itself”. “While I was travelling in a metro from IIT to Geeta Nagar, I felt enthusiastic and elated with the growth and development of the city,” said the PM adding that, “Today, Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the economic engine of India being the only state with five operational metro projects.” He said the inauguration of the nine-km-long Priority Corridor is a step towards making the lives of people better. MD UPMRC MD, Kumar Keshav said, “The city’s much coveted dream has been materialised into a reality. We are thankful to the people of Kanpur, who during these 26 months showed immense patience and extended cooperation in the successful commencement of revenue operations. The credit goes to the hardworking and dedicated team of UPMRC which left no stone unturned in achieving this feat within the stipulated time frame despite of Covid crisis.” “Carrying the legacy of providing world class metro services to the people, I am sure that our UPMRC team is going to achieve a similar feat for the upcoming metro projects in the state. Remaining corridors of Kanpur Metro, Agra Metro and proposed Gorakhpur Metro Rail Lite are some of the projects under the auspices of UPMRC which will surely be completed as per the set timelines, ” he said. UP ministers Satish Mahana, Ranvendra Pratap Singh Dhunni, Lakhan Singh Rajput, Nilima Katiyar, Ajit Singh Palwere present during the inauguration ceremony. It was a proud moment for the people of Kanpur as with the advent of metro services they will be relieved from the daily traffic snarls and pollution. Being an industrial city with a population of over 45 lakhs, the demographics of Kanpur have been evolving rapidly and commencement of Metro services will help decongest the roads. The metro, connecting residential areas and prominent institutions, will become the lifeline of the city in the long run. On November 15, 2019, the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had inaugurated the civil construction work of Kanpur Metro. The civil construction work had continued even during the lockdown period induced due to Covid pandemic due to which the work could be completed in record time. Between December 20 and 22, CMRS (Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety), had carried out thorough inspection of signalling, PA systems, CCTVs, viaduct, track and other basic facilities. The speed tests of the metro were also conducted to check the functionality and operational feasibility of the internal systems. The CMRS visit was successful and permission for revenue operations on the Priority section of Kanpur Metro was granted by him. It was only after this the metro service for people was launched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/up-among-fastest-growing-states-with-max-metro-services-pm/articleshow/88554181.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||India||'Take ‘credit’ for businessman's cash pile,' PM dares SP||KANPUR/LUCKNOW: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday traced arrested Kanpur perfume trader Piyush Jain’s Rs 284-crore unaccounted money trail to the “scent of corruption” in UP before 2017 and dared the Samajwadi Party leadership to “take credit for it”, just as they have been doing for every project completed by BJP. “Par ab woh muh pe tala laga ke baithe hain...credit lene nahi aa rahe hain (They are now tight-lipped and not coming forward to take credit for this, too)," Modi told a gathering at the Nirala Nagar railway ground after inaugurating the first leg of the Kanpur Metro. "Bundles of currency notes (seized from Jain’s premises) were the only achievement of the opposition (when it was in government),” he said, alluding to the scandal. Jain was arrested on Sunday after raids on his premises in Kanpur and Kannauj led to the huge cash haul, besides 25kg of gold and 250kg of silver. The PM’s salvo at SP comes two days after BJP claimed Jain had links with the party, a charge the latter promptly denied. Ex-CM Akhilesh Yadav’s party has positioned itself squarely against BJP in the high-stakes assembly polls early next year. Modi said parties whose “economic policies are driven by corruption and patronage to criminals” could not be expected to put the state on the path to development. “For previous governments, coming to power meant hitting the jackpot. They would then loot the state.” Pointing out that establishing the rule of law was the primary prerequisite for industrial investment, the PM said erstwhile state governments would let loose “mafia rule” instead, triggering the closure of even the existing industries. He said the people of UP were aware of how public money had been swindled in the name of projects. Modi said BJP’s “double engine government” was “compensating for that loss” by working at “double speed”, citing the country’s largest airport in Jewar, roads like the Purvanchal and Ganga expressways, the country’s rapid road transit system and a dedicated freight corridor as examples of this. “This government knows how to fix big targets and meet them,” he said, referring to timely completion of a project as the most proper utilisation of public money for the benefit of the people. He said piped water, which had eluded crores of houses in UP, was becoming a reality through Har Ghar Jal Mission. The PM said it was disheartening to see the opposition having problems with every step taken by the government. “Which is why they are opposed to steps taken for empowerment of women, be it the law against ‘triple talaq’ or increasing the marriageable age of girls.” UP, which had attained the dubious distinction of being the storehouse of illegal weapons, was now poised to have a defence corridor, Modi declared. The PM said before 2014, Metro rail was available in only five Indian cities. “Today, UP alone has five cities with Metro rail facilities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/take-credit-for-businessmans-cash-pile-pm-dares-sp/articleshow/88555176.cms||Pankaj Shah

He, however, said that despite formation of a separate state two decades ago, if the state continues to remain a gareeb rajya (poor state), it is only because of the BJP-led government at the Centre. He spoke to select journalists at his residence on Tuesday ahead of the second anniversary of the Hemant Soren-led regime, of which his party — Congress — is a key alliance partner. Excerpts:-  Those in power often call Jharkhand a poor state. As a finance minister, what were your priorities for fiscal management? If Jharkhand continues to remain a garib rajya, I totally believe it is because of the government at the Centre. It is because they are sitting on crores of pending dues to our state despite several demands from our end but to no avail. For example, Coal India, a central government entity, has acquired 53,000 acres of state government land for their different projects over the years. But we didn’t get rightful dues in return. As per our last assessment, some Rs 65,000 crore are pending to the state government since years. Similarly, around Rs 10,000 crore water dues are pending with different public sector undertakings (PSUs) to the state.  Ever since the coalition government came to power, it is crying crunch funds. But in several departments, allocated funds fail to get utilised often. We didn’t lie when we said treasury is empty after taking over. But during my tenure, I introduced few initiatives to bring in fiscal prudence and discipline to ensure that we don’t just spend, but in rightful manner to get desired results. Our focus behind spending every penny is pro-people, pro-poor.  Please elaborate steps taken for fiscal discipline. For the first time, we introduced outcome budget since last year, which is a reality check on the money spent and the desired result. This year too, we will publish the outcome budget while tabling next fiscal’s budget in the assembly. This apart, for the first time, we began the concept of ‘sinking fund’, under which our focus also shifted to savings. Like an individual saves money for bad times, the state government too must save, and not just spend. As a result, we managed to amass Rs 500 crore in RBI under sinking fund account.  While the state government and Congress accused the Centre over fuel prices, it is now shying away from decreasing VAT I have been saying from the beginning that the onus of regulating fuel prices rest with the central government and it must decrease. Our government never increased any rates. As far as petrol and diesel prices are concerned, by and large, it is still lesser compared to neighbouring states.  This means state will not reduce VAT of fuel despite other Cong ruled states doing so? The government will take call at an appropriate time.  Along with poverty, hunger is a major concern in the state Under this government, none died of hunger vis-à-vis the trend in previous government because we ensured that no poor is denied PDS. Although, some glitches on the ground may still exist, we are sorting out on case to case basis. Besides those covered under National Food Security Act, we provided ration card to 15 lakh more eligible people. There are instances where undeserving people have got ration cards, and we are conducting crackdown as well from time to time. Another biggest achievement of this government include clothing (dhoti-sari) scheme to poor, and launch of universal pension scheme. In two years, we have been working to fulfill the promises made to voters one by one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/if-jkhand-continues-to-remain-poor-it-is-due-to-the-centre-rameshwar/articleshow/88565179.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Tata-Amritsar Express to resume ops from Jan 3||Jamshedpur: The South Eastern Railway (SER) has announced that it will resume the Tatanagar-Amritsar Jallianwala Bagh Express from January 3, almost a month after it stopped the train service citing winter fog. The biweekly train takes 33 hours to reach its destination, covering four states and 25 stations. The abrupt withdrawal of the train service from November 29 till February 28 had upset many passengers from the Sikh community in Jamshedpur and Adityapur areas who take this train to and from Amritsar. Members of the Jharkhand Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (JGPC) and the Central Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (CGPC) launched demonstrations at the Tatanagar railway station, seeking restoration of the train service earlier this month. Reacting to SER’s announcement, JGPC chairman Sardar Shailendra Singh said, “We are extremely happy with the developments and for honouring our demand.” He added, “The resumption of the train will help scores of commuters who travel to Delhi Ludhiana and Amritsar among others.” In the same vein, Jamshedpur Vastra Vikreta Sangh president Anil Modi said readymade cloth traders of the two Jharkhand towns prefer to travel to Delhi and Ludhiana to get their stocks. The officials at Tatanagar station said booking would resume shortly. TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tata-amritsar-express-to-resume-ops-from-jan-3/articleshow/88552541.cms||TNN
---||Ranchi||In mineral-rich state, industries hit by delayed licence nod, power woes||Ranchi: With the country’s economy slowly recovering from the body blow dealt by the Covid-19 pandemic, industrialists and entrepreneurs of mineral-rich Jharkhand are now looking for support and hand-holding from the Hemant Soren government to get back on thse growth path. The entrepreneurs want the Soren government to show positive intent beyond policy documents and glitzy investment meets and shows to get things done. The micro, small and medium enterprises, which form a bulk of the state’s industrial workforce, remained upset with the government for its failure to issue time-bound factory licenses and consent to operate (CTO) certificates from the state pollution control board. More than 2,800 CTOs were pending clearances in the middle of this year and only a handful of the applicants have received their CTOs despite the CM’s directives in this regard to the state industries department. Soren, who stormed to power two years ago on development and employment planks, drafted a new state industrial and investment promotion policy to woo top-tier industrialists of the country at two investment roadshows in New Delhi earlier this year. Though he fetched investment assurances worth Rs 10,000 crore, Soren has failed to strike a chord with the state’s homegrown industries. At the same time, the industrialists are also upset with the government after it hiked the electricity duty. “While the duty was 5 paisa per unit in June this year, it is being charged at Rs 0.5 per unit now. At a time when many companies are still reeling from the losses due to the lockdown, the high electricity duty is causing a rise in production cost and production units are losing out on the markets,” a city-based industrialist said on condition of anonymity. The state’s industrial belts like Ramgarh and Hazaribag are also suffering from long and regular power cuts following the government’s long-drawn battle with the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) over pending bills. “Power cuts are happening daily for 12-14 hours. The government must sit with the DVC authorities for talks and resolve the issue once and for all for the sake of the industries and the general public,” another entrepreneur from Ranchi said. Apart from the power crisis, the Soren government has also not been able to weed out the red tape in providing time-bound approvals to new industrial units. Much like the erstwhile Raghubar Das government, the single-window system in the industries department is a non-starter while factory licenses are being delayed by as much as six months to a year despite the directive to clear them within 45 days. Currently, over 1,600 industrial units have shut down after the Covid-19 infection first surfaced in March last year in the state. However, the silver lining is that the state government is pushing for an industrial promotion board with the CM at the helm to provide one-stop help to the new industries. “To provide a better climate for industries and allow new units to come in, the government must sort out the issues of power, electricity duties and delayed clearances,” Philip Mathew, the president of the Jharkhand Small Industries Association, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-mineral-rich-state-industries-hit-by-delayed-licence-nod-power-woes/articleshow/88552571.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Rims set to get machine for genome study by January||Ranchi: The state health department officials on Tuesday said it will procure a genome sequencing machine in three weeks and install it at the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) to detect different strains of the Covid virus. The officials said they are working on a priority basis to get the machine amid growing concerns about the highly transmissible Omicron variant. It will be the first such machine for the state. Notably, the plan to procure the machine has been in the offing for long but was delayed due to bureaucratic hurdles. Since the past month, all samples of suspected Omicron cases have been sent to a lab in Bhubaneshwar for testing but no report has been received, so far. An official of the department said, “Under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962, equipment procured by a research institute are exempted from duty and Rims being a medical research institute, the machine bought by it and installed on its premises will ultimately benefit the state. If the state buys it, the customs duty will be burdensome.” State epidemiologist posted with the ISDP, Dr Praveen Karn, said, “The state government is working to improve the health facilities amid the rise in Covid cases and preparing for any possible third wave. Procuring the genome sequencing machine within the next two to three weeks to identify the Omicron strain is part of this policy.” Currently, the state has eight RT-PCR testing labs apart from TruNat Machines in all 24 districts along with Rapid Antigen Test kits. The government has also procured two COBAS 6800 machines, a fully-automated high-end machine to perform RT-PCR tests on bulk samples. The machine can test 1,200 samples in 24 hours and the government is planning to launch the machines within a few months. Dr Karn added, “Considering the incidents of Covid cases rising abruptly in the country, the state is also planning to develop new RT-PCR laboratories in seven districts — Bokaro, Ranchi, East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Gumla, Deoghar and Godda. This will facilitate better screening, testing and identification of patients. The state is trying to be better equipped with all necessary facilities required to tackle the pandemic.” Further, the state government has procured two COBAS 6800, the automated testing machine. COBAS 6800 is a fully automated, high-end machine for performing bulk RT-PCR testing. It can test around 1200 samples in 24 hours. The government is planning to launch the machine within a few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-set-to-get-machine-for-genome-study-by-january/articleshow/88552560.cms||---

It, however, added that there has been a visible improvement in the communal atmosphere as compared to the previous regime and some works were done according to people’s expectations but the government remained silent on several core issues. In a statement, the JJM said, “As compared to the previous government, there has been a visible improvement in the communal atmosphere in the state. The recent bill against lynching and mob violence is a commendable initiative. The government also showed a firm commitment to the rights of migrant workers during and after the Covid lockdown. Along with this, increasing the coverage of the public distribution system and the pension schemes was a step in the right direction.” The statement, however, said there has been no difference in the “repressive and anti-people attitude” of the police and the security forces. It also said Adivasis were also subjected to violence by the security violence. Stating that neither the victims were given compensation nor action was taken against the culprits in such cases, the JJM cited the example of the killing of an Adivasi, Brahmadev Singh, who was killed by security forces, while going to the jungle for the traditional hunting festival on June 12, 2021, at Piri village in Latehar district. “Not even an FIR was filed despite a written complaint filed by Brahmadev’s wife,” the statement says. “The lack of commitment of the government towards the protection of human rights is also exposed by the fact that the state human rights commission, women's commission and the information commission are lying defunct,” it says. On the Pathalgarhi cases, the statement says, “Even after two years of the announcement of withdrawal of all Pathalgadi cases, they are yet to be withdrawn. All the cases are similar, but the government has recommended withdrawal of only 60% of the total 30 FIRs.” Stating that both JMM and Congress, in their election manifestos, had promised action to release undertrials (tribals, Dalits, backward and minorities jailed in minor cases without conviction), the JJM said, “There is complete silence on this issue too. The Hemant Soren government had raised its voice against the inhuman arrest of Stan Swamy and paid him a tribute after his death, but it remained silent on the issues raised by Stan.” It further said the government had promised to repeal the amendments made in the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 (to weaken the social and environmental impact assessment) by the previous administration, but has not yet taken any action in this direction. “On the contrary, it is vigorously implementing the central government’s pro-corporate schemes. The government supported the movement against the three farm laws but it remains silent on its election promise of fixing the MSP for vegetables and fruits,” the mahasabha said. The JJM also accused the government of trying to forcefully acquire land for a hydel power plant at Luguburu Pahad (Bokaro) despite opposition by hundreds of local Adivasis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/visible-change-from-past-but-current-government-silent-on-core-issues-jjm/articleshow/88552519.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||ED attaches property worth Rs 1.46 cr of senior police officer||Ranchi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached immovable properties worth Rs 1.46 crore belonging to a senior state police officer, Santosh Kumar Dubey, and others under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 in a disproportionate assets case. Santosh is currently posted as the DIG of the Railway Police Force.S In a press statement dated December 23, the ED stated that the attached immovable properties are a residential plot in Ashok Nagar, Ranchi, worth Rs. 30,00,000, three commercial spaces and one residential flat in the Defence Colony, New Delhi, worth Rs. 72.72 lakh and one residential flat in Green View Heights, Ranchi, worth Rs. 43.85 lakh. The agency had initiated a money-laundering probe based on an FIR filed by CBI in July 2013 against Dubey, then senior commandant, RPF, and others under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The FIR alleged that the total joint income of Dubey and his wife Priya Dubey, an IPS office currently posted as IG (training) of Jharkhand Police, between 1998 and 2013 was Rs 1.57 crores. The value of the properties acquired by them comes around Rs 2.65 crore, which is much higher in comparison to their income from all lawful sources. He was found in possession of disproportionate assets to the extent of Rs. 1.48 crore, which was allegedly acquired through corrupt and illegal means. In the investigation under the PMLA, it was found that Dubey has acquired various immovable properties to the tune of Rs 1.46 crore in his name and his wife, Priya Dubey, and his father, late Shankar Dayal Dubey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ed-attaches-property-worth-rs-1-46-cr-of-senior-police-officer/articleshow/88552735.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Pankaj Nagar, the 23-year-old victim from Tigaon village, was attacked on Monday evening. Hours earlier, he and his neighbours had returned from the local police station after trading charges against each other for starting the fight over the overflowing drain. Six of Pankaj’s neighbours — Rahul, Pawan, Naresh, Simla, Dharamveer and Lalaram — were booked on murder and other charges. Four of them were arrested in Noida while two others are untraceable. Police said Pankaj and his neighbours would often have verbal fights over sewage entering their houses from the drain. On one of the occasions, the neighbours had even hurled bricks at Pankaj and his family members, his relatives alleged. “They then decided to approach the police over the issue. Both parties held each other responsible for the overflowing drain. They were counselled at the police station and both agreed not to fight over it anymore,” said an officer at Tigaon police station. But while returning from the police station, Pawan and Rahul, who are brothers, allegedly threatened Pankaj with dire consequences. Around 4.30pm on Monday, the 23-year-old was leaving his home on his bike when the six accused stopped him. They allegedly attacked him with sticks and when he fell to the ground, they stabbed him in the chest and stomach repeatedly with a knife. Pankaj was rushed to the Civil Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. “They were next-door neighbours. Their houses share a wall. They had a fight over waste water from the drain, which took an ugly turn. We are still trying to find out what prompted the neighbours to attack the young man,” said another police officer. Police sources said Pankaj's father was an assistant sub-inspector with Delhi Police. The six neighbours have been booked under sections 302 (murder), 148 (armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). The cops said they were conducting searches across Faridabad and other NCR districts to trace the two absconding accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/policemans-son-murdered-in-dispute-over-common-drain/articleshow/88553790.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Covid cases highest in 7 months, Maharashtra numbers maximum in 75 days||MUMBAI: Maharashtra reported a 75-day high in new Covid infections with 2,172 cases on Tuesday. Mumbai, which is largely driving the surge, saw its highest daily detection (1,333) in seven months. The silver lining was the low count of Covid fatalities-22 in the state and one in Mumbai. The state also didn't detect any new Omicron infections on Tuesday, thereby restricting the cumulative tally of the new variant to 167. The exponential rise in cases pushed Mumbai's daily positivity rate (PR) to 4%, a seven-fold increase from the PR on December 1. The city has not had such a high positivity rate since May when the second wave had started to recede. The city's daily positivity had dropped under 5% towards the end of January before it started to rise again from February and reached an average of 20% in March and April. On Tuesday, the addition of 2,172 cases in the state was a consistent jump seen for the seventh day. The state's Covid tally has reached 66,61,486. About 61% of the cases came from Mumbai, which has been observing a rise for nearly a week now. Monday was an exception when a marginal slump was seen due to low testing. A weekly comparison shows that from 1,300 cases reported in the first week of December, the numbers rose to almost 1,500 in the second week and roughly 1,900 in the third week. But between December 22 and 28, newly detected cases touched 5,478, an over 320% jump from the first week. Mumbai's cumulative Covid-19 tally has reached 7,73,031. The city's Tuesday surge is the highest since May 26 when 1,352 cases were reported, while the state's detection was the highest since October 14 (2,384). Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state is vigilant about the Omicron graph. "The doubling rate of the variant is very high, and it has been forecast that the cases may rise significantly in January and February," Tope said. Of the 167 Omicron cases, 91 have been discharged. Senior officials said so far Mumbai has been driving the surge by accounting for 50-55% of the cases. The state's positivity rate is also on a rise, after staying consistently below 1% for weeks - it has touched 1.08%. "(There's a) possible third wave in Mumbai as the numbers are clearly suggesting a rising trend. But all are mild cases and no major strain on healthcare as of now. It's important to be vigilant and cautious," said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force. "Cases in the state have tripled in just one week. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray may hold a meeting of the state taskforce on Wednesday to decide the future course of action," said an official. With New Year festivities around the corner, the government may bring in more measures to tackle crowding in public spaces Hospitalisations have started to show a gradual uptick. Active cases in the state breached 11,000 (11,492) while Mumbai's crossed 5,000 (5,803). Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that daily admissions have increased marginally, but no significant rise has been noted in ICU admissions or critical cases. "On Tuesday, around 70 people got hospitalised out of all the new positive cases," he said, adding that the city has more than 15,000 Covid beds ready. At SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, which is a dedicated Covid-19 facility, there were 76 admissions on Tuesday, including 22 international travellers admitted on suspicion of Omicron. Dean Dr Balkrishna Adsul said it was a near four-fold rise compared to last week. "However, there have been no new admissions to ICU, although critical cases start coming in about 2-3 weeks after a spike in cases," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-cases-highest-in-7-months-maharashtra-numbers-maximum-in-75-days/articleshow/88555269.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Chandigarh||Farmer movement was all omnipresent and omnipotent in Punjab||Bathinda: Already termed historic by many, the farm struggle has had far reaching impact beyond the agriculture sector. The movement brought the role of farmers in the society to the fore and social bonding during the stir increased mutual acceptance of different sections. The social engineering made people from all walks of life come out in the open and it is hoped that it will have a positive impact in Punjab’s villages bringing in harmony between castes and classes. The various trading community, commission agents, rice millers, mainly Hindus, supported the farmers in big way. The various employee organisations too supported the agitation in different ways. Villages and towns sent pinnis and gajrela to keep the protesters warm during the previous winter season. Students from various colleges and universities turned up in large numbers to support proteters. They managed the libraries at the protest sites at the borders of Delhi and in Punjab to inculcate reading habits among farmers, especially the older persons during their free time. They ran schools for unlettered and young children accompanying their mothers. Many of the youngsters, mainly from artistic backgrounds, also entertained the farm activists with patriotic, revolutionary and folk songs. The youngsters also made the agitation tech savvy and ran social media campaigns taking the thoughts and actions of protesting farmers to global audiences. The protest was everywhere — Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The biggest social impact of the farmer agitation was felt in the warming up of the relation between farmers from Punjab and residents of Haryana. The ill-will went for a toss as hordes of people from neighbouring state came out in open in providing support, leaving behind bitter talks revolving around contentious SYL canal issue. While farmers sat on protests at various places in Punjab, the logistics were provided by wide sections of society, ensuring deeper social bonding. “The shopkeepers near the protest sites were never angry even though their business interests might have harmed. They came out in support, providing various items. How the farmers could forget the gestures of people like Ram Singh Rana, who despite having no connections with the protesters, opened the gates of hotel for them. Provided every facility by spending crores and even faced the ire of the government,” said farm leader Buta Singh Burjgill, giving an example. “How can we forget the social leanings. We have lots of examples how people from various walks of life came forward to provide everything of necessity. People came to us with hope,” farm leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan said. With a large chunk of Punjab farm bodies, associated with the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, deciding to take the political root and contest the upcoming Punjab assembly elections, the impact of the stir could be deep and far varied. Haryana’s milk thickened sweet tea of friendship Chandigarh: The year-long agitation by farmers at the various sites on the Delhi border infused a sense of solidarity among the people of Punjab and Haryana as the people of both states battled together to get the three contentious farm laws withdrawn. Having tasted victory after over a year of struggle, farmers of the two states are determined to jointly take on more such battles in the future. The cooperation between them at protest sites at Singhu and Tikri on the Delhi border proved that the two states might have separated five decades ago but their bonding is still intact. The public display of affection and brotherhood by farmers of both states has also made it clear that the people of Punjab and Haryana have no enmity with each other on what has been termed to be the most volatile issues — Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) water. People from Punjab were serving food at langars (community kitchens) established at the protest sites on Delhi borders, but it was Haryana farmers ensuring a smooth supply of milk, and other food and cooking material needed. Before leaving the protest sites earlier this month after the Centre withdrew the laws, BKU Rajewal faction chief from Punjab Balbir Singh Rajewal said, “When we had reached for launching agitation at Singhu (on November 27, 2020), we had to take tea without milk but from next day, because of the people of Haryana, we never felt shortage of milk till the end of the protest after a year.” Not only did villages in Jhajjar and Rohtak districts, which were close to the Tikri border and villages of the Sonipat district adjacent to the Singhu border, ensured a regular supply of milk at protest sites, but also villages in Jind district. Some even stopped supplying milk to dairies to keep farmers camping at Tikri and Singhu well-stocked. Apart from milk, the Haryana farmers also ensured a supply of flour, rice, pulses, wood for cooking. Not a single major incident of disagreement between the people of the two states was witnessed during the entire agitation. As Haryana was a transit point for the Punjab farmers visiting Tikri and Singhu borders, people in Haryana established langars at several places on the roads. When the agitation suffered a setback due to violence at the Red Fort on Republic Day, people from Haryana infused a new lease of life by reaching in large numbers to the protest sites at Delhi borders. Farmers from Punjab reciprocated whenever there was any action against the farmers in Haryana by the state authorities, as was evident from incidents at Hisar and Karnal where the state authorities had taken action against the protesting farmers. Senior BKU leaders from Punjab came out in support of Haryana farmers and all groups worked together under the umbrella organisation, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, to iron out differences among the Haryana unions and Punjab groups, comprising 32 unions and BKU (Ekta Ugrahan). Even differences with Gurnam Singh Charuni, head of Haryana BKU Charuni group, were resolved swiftly. It was only because of that that the authorities in Haryana had to release the farmer leaders immediately, and in the Karnal incident, even a judicial probe was ordered because of pressure brought to bear by all of them together. Punjab’s finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal even released an emotive video on social media complimenting the people of Haryana for strongly standing up with the people of Punjab “like a younger brother”. “It has proved that both Punjab and Haryana are two branches of the same tree. People of Haryana have not only won the hearts of people from Punjab, but have bought it,” Manpreet had said. Sociologist and retired academician from Panjab University at Chandigarh, Professor Manjit Singh, said the farmers of both the states were apparently scared of losing land or thinking that they would become tenants of their own land and this feeling perhaps brought them together. “The farmers’ agitation was a new phenomenon and historic. This bonding between the farmers of these two agrarian states was crucial for the movement. Earlier, they were not active and were trapped in a kind of consumerism and were passive because of the influence of those in power,” Prof Manjit added. SYL issue rejected The emotive issue of SYL did not work, especially when the incumbent BJP in Haryana tried to create a divide by raking it up. Haryana BJP functionaries even started an ‘upvaas’ (fast) demanding SYL water from Punjab, but failed to gain any support. The people rejected the demand, terming it as “irrelevant” at the time. This despite the fact that SYL has been projected as the most contentious issue by politicians of both the state, even suggesting that it may trigger bloodshed over water. While Punjab-based political parties have been promising not to give a single drop of water to Haryana, their Haryana counterparts have been promising completion of canal and steady flow of water. Even nationally, this seemingly unending dispute, pending for more than four decades, and has been seen as a symbol of enmity between the two states. However, the cold reaction of the people deflated the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmer-movement-was-all-omnipresent-and-omnipotent-in-punjab/articleshow/88554393.cms||---

The health minister had called a delegation of resident doctors, who have been holding protests on the issue for nearly a month and told them the government was not able to do the counselling because the matter was before Supreme Court. "Government of India will submit a reply to the apex court before the scheduled date of hearing on January 6. I expect counselling to start at the earliest," the minister said. He also expressed regret over the alleged police brutality against the doctors who were holding peaceful protests Monday. FORDA president Dr Manish, part of the delegation, went back with a message from the minister to Safdarjung Hospital, a central government-run hospital that is the epicentre of the stir. Doctors demand written apology for police action against protestersThe minister told us that during the next hearing they will try their level best to ensure that counselling is held at the earliest. We told them that on Monday, the police had thrashed the resident doctors and abused them and we wanted an apology. He told us that we will get a written apology," Dr Manish told the resident doctors waiting at the hospital. The crowd of doctors, however, insisted on continuing the protest till their demands were met. "We have received verbal assurances earlier also. Now, we want concrete action. Until then, the protests will continue," said the doctors. Speaking to TOI, Dr Manish said they have not received any apology from the police while an FIR had been registered against them. "We have been told by the health minister that we will get an apology from the police and the FIR will be withdrawn," he said. He said for now they will continue with their protest and another meeting will be held late at night to decide their course of action. "All hospitals which are connected with FORDA will continue their protest," he said. Meanwhile, the AIIMS Delhi RDA has decided to take back the decision of strike on December 29. Meetings on the doctors' protests were also held at the police headquarters. The commissioner is monitoring the situation. Denying the allegations of doctors being manhandled, additional commissioner (Central Range) Suman Goyal said that no force or lathi-charge was used and insisted that they held the doctors in high regard. Delhi Police has registered an FIR under sections of rioting, causing obstruction in duty of police personnel, damaging public property and disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant at IP Estate police station. The complainant in the case is one of the cops and they have not named anyone as a suspect. Since Tuesday morning, Delhi Police had increased deployment inside Safdarjung Hospital. Doctors had earlier planned to march to the Supreme Court but the police stopped them. Two gates were closed to prevent any movement. District DCP Gaurav Sharma and the additional DCP also held a meeting with the doctors. They were told not to take the law into their hands and form a delegation. The meeting continued for an hour. Around 3 pm, 12 doctors met Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya which, however, didn't break the deadlock. Amid rain, the doctors continued shouting slogans in front of the emergency block. They were raising slogans seeking justice. Apart from Delhi Police, one company of SSB and ITBP each was present at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-assurance-to-doctors-fails-to-break-deadlock-in-delhi/articleshow/88555332.cms||Abhay Singh

They also complained that food was not delivered to them, and they were forced to call for food from home late on Monday evening. One of the patients took to social media to post the complaints online, including photographs of a choked toilet leading to a health scare. She said, “The rooms were not clean, bathrooms were dirty, and the cleaner just washed bathroom, leaving a bunch of hair on the drain cover, which stopped the flow of water.” She further wrote there were no dustbins in the rooms, and there was no control on the movement of Covid patients, who even moved outside the CCC. “Dinner was not served. The canteen staff told me they were not informed. When I complained to the doctor, he spoke to the canteen guy, and the doctor said I will have to go and pick up my food from the canteen, which I refused. I asked him what is the purpose of isolation?” she said. The woman also pointed out that no PPE kit was given to doctors, nurses, and housekeeping staff at the CCC. Officials admitted most of the complaints were correct, but regarding food they said the patient didn’t cooperate. “The food packs delivery is done in the corridor and patients are expected to pick them up. A whistle is blown to alert about food delivery. But she was expecting delivery in the room. The delivery boy can’t go up to each room,” said officials. They added that some patients may have taken extra food packs, leaving none for late comers. “Doctors also keep extra food packs for late night admissions. She called the doctor who asked her to come and pick it up. She didn’t go two floor downstairs but called for food from home,” they said. As for PPE kits, centre officials said kits are not must for doctors and nurses in a CCC but are available for housekeeping and medical staff when swab sample has to be taken. “Housekeeping staff may not wear, but they are given kits,” they said. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the issue had been resolved. “There were no complaints on Tuesday. The MLA Hostel Canteen is paid service while NMC provides free food packs. The hygiene issues were raised with public works department, which has the annual maintenance contractor. A security guard too has been deployed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patients-complain-of-food-hygiene-issues-at-mla-hostel-ccc/articleshow/88553288.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Business||Rising burnout in corner office: CEOs feel the heat, head for exit||MUMBAI: It’s becoming lonelier at the top with burnout of CEOs now looming as a real concern. Over the last two years, demands on CEOs have increased multifold. They are required to be resilient, adaptable and, at the same time, empathetic and caring towards employees. Nine out of 10 CEOs in a global study by Egon Zehnder (EZ) of about 1,000 leaders— of which 6% were from India—agreed that, in recent years, the CEO post has moved into the centre of a world that’s louder, with more diverse and diverging voices. The year 2021 looks likely to break the record for CEO departures. Already, CEO tenures have shortened over the last decade, shows an analysis of 214 companies. EZ’s analysis of 214 large, publicly traded companies worldwide found that half of them (48%) had appointed three or more CEOs in the decade from 2011 to 2020. As many as 39% of leadership transitions in the companies EZ studied were emergency departures — the CEO suddenly resigned or was fired, or caught the board off guard and did not extend contract. A significant number of CEO departures were due to serious illness or death. EZ India managing partner Pallavi Kathuria said this is the first time over the last two years that CEOs are talking about a burnout quite openly. “Increasingly, stakeholder pressure too is rising,” she said. “The last two years have been very exhausting for CEOs because they have to not just think about business performance, but also about motivating and engaging employees. The job of a CEO has become increasingly complex. There are many things that have been put on a leader’s shoulders because, ultimately, that’s where the buck stops,” said Kathuria. Tech products maker Boat’s CEO Vivek Gambhir said the continual flux, varied demands, multiple priorities and the constant juggling is making many CEOs exhausted and drained — both physically and emotionally. “CEOs need to develop more self-awareness and show vulnerability so that they can seek help when needed and not view themselves as superheroes. Many CEOs tend to isolate themselves. It is important to create a deeper belonging and instil a sense of the collective ‘we’ in the team so that it feels like everyone is in it together as opposed to the CEO taking on all the pressure,” said Gambhir. Kathuria said the pandemic has led people to think about their purpose in life and that’s also one of the reasons why CEOs are quitting. While less than half the CEOs in EZ’s study said they were fully aligned with their executive teams and boards, 80% believe there’s a need to transform themselves as well as their organisation. Sanjay Khosla, a senior fellow and adjunct professor at Kellogg School of Management, who is also an executive coach to CEOs, said the script has dramatically changed with the need for adaptability, resilience, humility and curiosity becoming far more intense. Successful leaders, said Khosla, ‘transform’, build a ‘team’ and build ‘trust’ in order to thrive. “Every leader has a choice —to be cosy, or to fly. I believe it is very dangerous to be cosy. Successful leaders transform, with their head in the clouds and feet on the ground,” he said. He added that collaborative work has become even more critical in this Zoom world. “I find individual superstars who say ‘I’ instead of ‘We’ have become even less effective.” At the same time, he said the need to have each other’s back is even more important in this world of reduced human contact. On the other hand, it could be a burden on organisations launching frequent searches for the elusive right-fit CEO. “CEO succession has always been complex. This is a role in which failure is very costly. Most of our clients are focusing on retention and grooming of their senior leaders. But that does not mean that organisations will not do CEO succession planning,” said Kathuria. With organisations demanding new CEOs to hit the ground running and falter less, Kathuria said EZ, as a leadership advisory firm, is trying to decrease the time it takes for a CEO to be onboarded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rising-burnout-in-corner-office-ceos-feel-the-heat-head-for-exit/articleshow/88555322.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Nagpur||CP adopts ‘test first, arrest later’ pattern to save force from Omicron||Nagpur: City police chief Amitesh Kumar has adopted a strategy to get all accused facing arrest to be tested with Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) before the person is taken into custody. This step was taken in view of the threat of the police force getting infected by Covid-19 as number of cases are spiking in Nagpur, and the threat of Omicron variant looms large. Kumar has also ensured that one of the costliest therapies to treat Covid, monoclonal antibody or cocktail drug, is also available for city police personnel. This therapy was administered to former US president Donald Trump too. The top cop has created a corpus fund from the welfare allocations to be able to purchase the drug, which costs around Rs66,000 for one dose. The drug, given to mild to moderately ill patients, has high degree of success in city hospitals where it has been used so far. “All the accused would be first tested for Covid before being formally taken into custody. If we find anyone positive, the person would be immediately shifted to institutional quarantine,” he said. “We are ensuring immunity boosters to all personnel on a war footing, including identifying those with co-morbidities for further precautions,” said the CP, adding the force has been substantially covered by vaccination drive too. In the first wave, 1,830 policemen had tested positive while 28 had died. In the second wave, 630 personnel had tested positive with four deaths. Chief medical officer of Police Hospital Dr Sandeep Shinde said 97% cops had taken the first dose while 98% has taken the second one. “Five teams for testing have been deputed at the offices of five zonal DCPs in the city. Apart from rapid antigen, RT-PCR would also be conducted on cops or the accused having symptoms. All those found positive would be quarantined,” said Dr Shinde. He added Vitamin C, D, zinc and other such medicines are being supplied to police stations and other units. Dr Shinde also said special ‘kadha’ is being procured from the Ayush department. “The 20-bedded police hospital is being kept ready with 21 jumbo cylinders for oxygen, two mini ventilators and other facilities. Nine ICU beds have also been created,” said the police hospital CMO. “We are advising police stations to monitor visitors or complainants with thermal scanners at the minimum,” he said. CP Kumar also said the force has been urged to follow Covid appropriate behavior stringently and develop various standard operating procedures (SOPs) of policing revolving around them. Dr Shinde also said masks and sanitizers would be distributed among cops engaged in bandobast duty for the New Year eve celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-adopts-test-first-arrest-later-pattern-to-save-force-from-omicron/articleshow/88553322.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chennai||Chennai: Anna varsity experts begin inspecting TNUHDB building||CHENNAI: A day after a four-storey building collapsed at Thiruvottiyur, experts from Anna University began inspecting the remaining blocks in the colony. The Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board (TNUHDB), formerly the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, has also ordered inspection all its buildings in the city that are more than 25 years old - 17,734 - before Friday. Those deemed dangerous would be demolished. The building that collapsed was 28 years old, while the general structural stability of TNUHDB tenements is 30 years. On Tuesday, the TNUHDB asked occupants of some blocks at Thiruvottiyur to move out till the experts' inspection is complete. As drilling at the collapsed building site commenced for study, there were vibrations in other blocks, occupants said. R Ravi, a resident, said cracks appeared on walls. "The occupants could feel the vibrations due to use of machines. Residents in some blocks were asked to vacate and were accommodated in marriage halls," he said. Several mini-vans made multiple trips to ferry household items even as residents scouted for rented houses and a few complained of rents being too high. TNUHDB officials said thatthey had asked residents of only some blocks to move out as per the suggestions of experts. "But, many others vacated along with their belongings," an official said. Residents of three blocks at the entrance are likely to be allowed to stay as there are no issues with the safety of the structures, he added. TNUHDB managing director M Govinda Rao said that regarding tenements across the city action would be taken based on the experts' report. "Structures identified as dangerous would be demolished for reconstruction. At the same time, steps would be taken to accommodate the residents during that period," he said. Chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday lauded Thaniyarasu, whose timely alert saved the lives of people in 24 units that collapsed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-anna-varsity-experts-begin-inspecting-tnuhdb-building/articleshow/88555377.cms||---
---||Nagpur||3rd wave to be shorter, not kids, but unvaccinated seniors more at risk: Study||Nagpur: A comprehensive comparative study of more than 1,763 patients of Covid-19 treated during two waves of the pandemic in last 18 months at KRIMS Hospital in Nagpur has indicated the third wave, if it comes, will be the shortest of the three. Going against the common perception that the wave will target paediatric population, Dr Ashok Arbat, senior pulmonologist and director of KRIMS, said elderly people who are yet to complete their vaccination will be more at risk in the third wave. “I am seeing many elderly people, especially from peripheries, who are yet to get vaccinated. Not kids, but these senior citizens will suffer if third wave hits,” said Dr Arbat. The 40-year-old hospital dedicated to treatment of lung-related ailments has analysed the data from more than 1,700 cases in Central India in detail, giving it scientific documentation of the pandemic. The analysis has given many surprising outcomes, like the mortality rate in first wave was higher than in the second wave. “Though there were more deaths in the second wave, the mortality rate was lower as compared to the first,” said Dr Arbat. According to the study, patients with hypertension and diabetes were the worst sufferers during both waves. “About 65% patients had both hypertension and diabetes, which means these are the highest risk factors. In the second wave, the virus targeted lungs and pneumonia was associated. This was deadly for many with BP and sugar,” said Dr Arbat. Predicting that the third wave is not going to be very severe, Dr Arbat said very few people will reach hospitals or testing centres. “Majority of the patients will recover without symptoms. Some will be okay after taking over-the-counter medicines. Only a few will see doctors, and even fewer will go for tests. Surge will be very limited if we stop testing asymptomatic people, and test only those who have some symptoms,” said Dr Arbat. However, the government policy is to test all high as well as low risk contacts of any positive patient. KRIMS is the only tertiary care centre in pulmonology in central India, where Covid-19 patients were managed by pulmonologists Dr Ashok Arbat, Dr Sameer Arbat, Dr Parimal Deshpande, Dr Swapnil Bakamwar, and Dr Gauri Ghadge. KEY FINDINGS OF KRIMS DATA First wave was 7-month-long while second lasted 4 months; which indicates third could be shorter 70% patients hospitalized in first wave; 34% in second wave; which means third could see fewer hospitalizations Weakness was prime complaint of 53.5% patients in 1st wave; it increased to 63.8% in second; indicates more patients will feel weakness in third 11.1% patients experienced sore throat in 1st wave, but only 5.5% had sore throat in second; indicates very few will have sore throat in 3rd Mortality was 8.2% in 1st wave as compared to 6.85% during 2nd wave; which indicates it will further decrease in third||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3rd-wave-to-be-shorter-not-kids-but-unvaccinated-seniors-more-at-risk-study/articleshow/88553351.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Though not a single one was constructed during his tenure, the condition of the existing ones is in a shambles. Now, Nagpur Citizens’ Forum has launched a campaign — ‘Right to Pee’ to draw attention of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). “The campaign has been launched to demand better public toilet facilities for women visiting commercial areas. It is one of the prime responsibilities of the NMC to provide clean, hygienic public lavatories in all market areas,” said the forum’s members. The campaign was launched from the Sitabuldi market area on Tuesday. Citizens responded enthusiastically to a signature drive on the first day, which was carried out by the forum’s members Rajat Padole, Rohit Kumbhare, Amit Bandurkar, Abhijeet Singh Chandel, Sameer Yelne, Rupesh Chaudhary, Shivam Umredkar, Vaibhav Shinde Patil, Sanket Mahalle and others. Young women and girls working in shops on Sitabuldi main road and bylanes extended support to the campaign. In the past, Sahyog Trust, another city-based NGO, had launched a unique protest ‘Occupying Men’s Toilet’ campaign to raise its voice against the unavailability of public toilets for women in the city. Even the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court had directed the NMC in this regard and yet the civic body has failed to implement the order. The number of public toilets in Nagpur city is inadequate as compared to its population. At present, the city has 68 public urinals and 56 pay and use toilets. Barring pay and use toilets, most urinals are in an extremely bad condition. Due to lack of maintenance, these toilets are littered with dirt and pose a serious health threat. Even the 15 toilets for women developed by Rotary Club of Nagpur were shut due to fund crunch. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari admitted that the number of public toilets is insufficient. But he was quick to blame non-cooperation of citizens. “Every year NMC keeps funds for constructing toilets in its zonal budget, but never finds government land for their construction. If land is available, the nearby citizens oppose the move,” said the mayor. Local corporators should convince such citizens and help the NMC to construct public toilets in their respective wards, he pointed out. This year NMC has identified a few places where eight to nine public toilets will be constructed, Tiwari said. Lack of public toilets in big markets like Sitabuldi, Mahal, Itwari are a big inconvenience to citizens. Young women and girls working in these markets suffer from health issues due to lack of toilets. “The city of Nagpur, which is developing as a metro city, lacks sanitation facilities. NMC and the elected representatives have deliberately ignored basic rights of the taxpayers,” alleged Rajat Padole, the coordinator of the ‘Right To Pee’ campaign. He pointed out that the situation in Nagpur was ‘disgraceful’ compared to public toilets in other cities. “Clean, safe and free toilets are the right of every tax-paying citizen,” said Padole. The campaign was started to make people aware about their rights. The Nagpur Citizens Forum launched the ‘Right to Pee’ campaign to survey public urinals and toilets in the city. The members of the forum are examining the situation by visiting the toilets in different parts of the city. A factual report will be prepared based on the information collected. Apart from this, referendums are being held in market premises and crowded places. The campaign is also trying to find out the complaints of women working in shops and offices regarding toilets. On this occasion, the forum has started a signature drive over the issue. Public awareness, referendum and signature campaign is the first phase of this campaign. In the second phase, public dialogue, agitations and gherao of elected representatives will be done in front of ill-maintained public toilets. The forum has also formed a committee to study sanitation and toilet facilities in other metros. It will prepare a report on how public toilets are maintained in other cities and submit the same to the NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citizens-forum-launches-right-to-pee-campaign/articleshow/88553362.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||E-vehicles in Maharashtra up 153% in 1 year, more than double in Mumbai||MUMBAI: It's boom time for electric vehicles in Mumbai and Maharashtra. While the state saw a phenomenal 153% rise in new e-vehicle registrations in the first nine months of the financial year 2021-2022, the city recorded a growth of 112% in the same period, the latest transport statistics show. Compared to 9,415 e-vehicles registered in 2020-21, the number of registrations skyrocketed to 23,786 in just nine months of 2021-22 (April 1 to December 27 this year). The total e-vehicles registered so far in Maharashtra is 57,386 and there are indications that it will cross a lakh-mark in a few months, officials said. The growth in e-vehicles was also a good 112% in Mumbai, the statistics showed. From just 48 new e-vehicles registered in 2017-18, the numbers grew to 132 in 2018-19, 642 in 2019-20 and 1,442 new registrations in 2020-21. In the nine months of 2021-22, the registrations have more than doubled at 3,059 new e-cars /e-two wheelers. The total electric vehicles in Mumbai now stand at around 6,000. The registrations were maximum in the island city, with Tardeo registering 1,920 e-cars/scooters so far. Anand Surve, who recently purchased an e-scooter, says it's convenient to charge the battery. "I remove the battery from the two-wheeler and take it to my second floor residence in Ghatkopar where I charge it for a few hours late at night. The next day, I just put it back on the scooter and it gives me good mileage the entire day." Also, fuel expense is around a rupee per km as compared to Rs 6-8 per km for diesel, sources said. Among the new registrations were cars and SUVs with a high range of 300 km for a single (full) charge and this was adequate for intra-city travel and also inter-city. Over a hundred housing societies in Mumbai now have e-charging points within the complex, with a concessional rate of Rs 5.50 per unit which is less than residential power charges. Akshay Sawant, who owns an electric car, said there was a need for more government subsidies and the cost of e-cars (and battery) was coming down. "The sales will go up only if prices of electric scooters or cars were at parity with diesel/petrol variants," he suggested. Transport expert Pranav Naik, "Our government needs to look at sustainability of this system by ensuring that electricity production is largely through sustainable sources and not coal, gas, and thermal as is the case now. They should also bolster public transport so more people travel in shared e-vehicles." City transport activist Gaurang Vora welcomed the growth of e-vehicles, saying there was visibility of e-scooters and e-cars with green number plates on the road. "Eco-friendly modes of fuel are the need of the hour. The government should facilitate more and more usage of e-vehicles by providing subsidies in its purchase. It will reduce pollution to a greater extent." A government official said plans were afoot for 1,500 new EV charging stations across the Mumbai region. The government also wants to ensure that 10% of new vehicle registrations by 2025 are electric vehicles, he said.. by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/e-vehicles-in-maharashtra-up-153-in-1-year-more-than-double-in-mumbai/articleshow/88555385.cms||Somit Sen
---||Delhi||Schools, gyms, cinemas shut in Delhi, graded curbs on shops||NEW DELHI: On a day when fresh Covid-19 cases in Delhi jumped by 50% in 24 hours, the level 1 (yellow alert) of the Graded Response Action Plan kicked in with strict curbs to stem the spread of infections. CM Arvind Kejriwal sought to assure Delhiites that the measures were aimed at curbing a rapid rise of cases and that there was no need to panic. The first level of GRAP would see schools, colleges, cinema halls, banquet halls, gyms etc close down, while public transport will run with restrictions. Delhi Metro restricted entry to stations shortly after the order even as some cinema hall owners said they were yet to receive a communication about the curbs. Delhi posted 496 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, up from 331 on Monday, with the test positivity rate climbing to 0.89%. If the positivity rate goes beyond 1% for two straight days, the level 2 (amber alert) of GRAP would come into effect, resulting in stricter restrictions.   After chairing a review meeting on Covid-19 on Tuesday, the CM said cases have been rising in the city over the past few days, just as in several other parts of the country. CM urges people to follow Covid norms to curb spread  The positive part this time is that there is absolutely no reason to be worried or scared, as the new cases that are coming up are mainly mild or asymptomatic in nature. In most cases, patients are not needing oxygen support, nor hospitalisation, ventilators or ICU facilities," he said, adding that people should not stress about the rising number of cases also because the Delhi government was "fully prepared" to tackle the rise. "Despite these preparations, we are inclined to encourage prevention over treatment later and we do not want anyone to suffer from fever, cough, or any other symptoms. We want to avoid the spread of this variant, no matter how mild it is," he said. Kejriwal said the government has been repeatedly appealing to the public to mask up whenever they step out. The CM said that the restrictions were being imposed "to prevent the virus from entering people's homes". He said the GRAP was formulated a few months ago to take appropriate action and impose restrictions depending on the level of spread of the coronavirus. "We developed this plan so that we wouldn't have to sit down and brainstorm our plan of action every time," he said, adding that GRAP ensures a scientific and systematic approach to impose a certain amount of restrictions at a certain percentage of Covid prevalence.  "I want the public to note that these restrictions are for their own safety. While I understand that people are frustrated with having dealt with Covid restrictions time and again for over two years now. But we have no choice but to take these measures to protect our health and our lives," he said. "It deeply pains us to receive news describing overcrowded markets accompanied with pictures and videos showing people roaming maskless in such crowds. If people don't take care of themselves, then how will anyone else be able to help them?" he said. The CM said the trend observed in around a month confirmed that the new variant was very mild and that in case any worrisome situation arises, he would inform the people on priority. With the level 1 of GRAP now in effect, schools, colleges and all educational institutions would remain closed, as would cinema halls, multiplexes, banquet halls, auditoriums, spas, gyms, yoga institutes and entertainment parks etc. While social, entertainment, religious, political and festival-related gatherings are not allowed, religious places would remain open with no visitors allowed in. Delhiites are allowed to take a walk, run or play at parks, gardens and golf courses and carry out yoga activity, but picnics are barred. Private offices can operate between 9am and 5pm, but only at 50% attendance, unless the office deals in providing essential services. While shops dealing with essential goods would be allowed to open on all days, those dealing in non-essential goods would open between 10am and 8pm on an odd-even basis, based on the shop number. Only one authorised weekly market has been allowed for every municipal zone and with 50% vendors. Restaurants can open between 8am and 10pm with 50% capacity and bars between noon and 10pm with 50% capacity. Hotels and lodges are allowed to operate, as are barber shops, beauty parlours and salons. Construction activities are allowed, and all industries and manufacturing units can operate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-gyms-cinemas-shut-in-delhi-graded-curbs-on-shops/articleshow/88555457.cms||---
