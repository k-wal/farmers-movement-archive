August 3, 2020||World||SpaceX capsule and Nasa crew make 1st splashdown in 45 years||CAPE CANAVERAL: Two Nasa astronauts returned to Earth on Sunday in a dramatic, retro-style splashdown, their capsule parachuting into the Gulf of Mexico to close out an unprecedented test flight by Elon Musk's SpaceX company. It was the first splashdown by US astronauts in 45 years, with the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to carry people to and from orbit. The return clears the way for another SpaceX crew launch as early as next month and possible tourist flights next year. Test pilots Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode the SpaceX Dragon capsule back to Earth less than a day after departing the International Space Station and two months after blasting off from Florida. The capsule parachuted into the calm gulf waters off the coast of Pensacola, hundreds of miles from Tropical Storm Isaias pounding Florida's Atlantic coast. ``Welcome back to planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX,'' the company's Mission Control said. The astronauts' ride home in the capsule dubbed Endeavour was fast, bumpy and hot, at least on the outside. The spacecraft went from a screaming orbital speed of 17,500 mph (28,000 kph) to 350 mph (560 kph) during atmospheric reentry, and finally to 15 mph (24 kph) at splashdown. Peak heating during descent was 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,900 degrees Celsius). The anticipated top G forces felt by the crew: four to five times the force of Earth's gravity. A SpaceX recovery ship with more than 40 staff, including doctors and nurses, moved in following splashdown, with two smaller, faster boats leading the way. To keep the returning astronauts safe in the pandemic, the recovery crew quarantined for two weeks and were tested for the coronavirus. SpaceX expected it to take a half-hour for the ship to arrive at the capsule and additional time to lift it out of the water onto the deck. The astronauts had plenty of seasick bags if needed while waiting in the bobbing capsule. A flight surgeon was going to be the first to look into the capsule, once the hatch swung open. After medical exams, the astronauts were expected to fly home to Houston for a reunion with their wives and sons. The last time Nasa astronauts returned from space to water was on July 24, 1975, in the Pacific, the scene of most splashdowns, to end a joint US-Soviet mission known as Apollo-Soyuz. The Mercury and Gemini crews in the early to mid-1960s parachuted into the Atlantic, while most of the later Apollo capsules hit the Pacific. The lone Russian ``splashdown'' was in 1976 on a partially frozen lake amid a blizzard following an aborted mission; the harrowing recovery took hours. SpaceX made history with this mission, which launched May 30 from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center. It was the first time a private company launched people into orbit and also the first launch of Nasa astronauts from home turf in nearly a decade. Hurley came full circle, serving as pilot of Nasa's last space shuttle flight in 2011 and the commander of this SpaceX flight. Musk monitored the descent and splashdown from SpaceX Mission Control in Hawthorne, California. Nasa turned to SpaceX and also Boeing to build capsules and ferry astronauts to and from the space station, following the retirement of the shuttles. Until Hurley and Behnken rocketed into orbit, Nasa astronauts relied on Russian rockets. SpaceX already had experience hauling cargo to the space station, bringing those capsules back to a Pacific splashdown. "This is the next era in human spaceflight where Nasa gets to be the customer,'' Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine said from Johnson Space Center in Houston shortly before the astronauts' return. SpaceX needs six weeks to inspect the capsule before launching the next crew around the end of September. This next mission of four astronauts will spend a full six months aboard the space station. Hurley and Behnken's capsule will be refurbished for another flight next spring. A Houston company run by a former Nasa official, meanwhile, has partnered with SpaceX to send three customers to the space station in fall 2021. Boeing doesn't expect to launch its first crew until next year. The company encountered significant software problems in the debut of its Starliner capsule, with no one aboard, last year. Its capsules will touch down in the U.S. Southwest desert. By beating Boeing, SpaceX laid claim to a small US flag left at the space station by Hurley and the rest of the last shuttle crew. The flag - which also flew on the first shuttle flight - was carefully packed aboard the Dragon for the homecoming. Also on board: a toy dinosaur named Tremor, sent into space by the astronauts' young sons. The boys recorded a wake-up call for their fathers Sunday morning, urging them to "rise and shine'' and "we can't wait to see you.'' "Don't worry, you can sleep in tomorrow,'' said Behnken's 6-year-old son Theo, who was promised a puppy after the flight. "Hurry home so we can go get my dog.''

August 3, 2020||Guwahati||Assam to conduct 50,0000 Covid tests on August 4||GUWAHATI: The Assam government will conduct 50,000 Covid tests on August 4, as the state looks to ramp up testing to arrest the surge in cases. State health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma while inaugurating the state‚Äôs second plasma bank in Tezpur Medical College and Hospital (TMCH) on Sunday, said, ‚ÄúIf we can continue doing 50,000 tests for each of the next 15 days, the positivity rate will reduce to 2-1%. We are on the right path and there is nothing to worry. Since we can identify the infected patients on the day of the rapid antigen tests, those people won‚Äôt be able to spread the infection further. Slowly the chain (of infection) will break". We work for a larger goal of humanity and not for a Model. Our commitment to fighting the pandemic is robust. üìåMo‚Ä¶ https://t.co/AJVU2jcBLR‚Äî Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) 1596359863000He added that the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state was because of an unprecedented number of testing. "The numbers (positive cases) have increased to some extent in the last few days. This is mainly because of more number of tests carried out in an unprecedented way. A state like Assam has done 43,000 tests in a day. We will conduct 50,000 tests on August 4. When the rate of testing increases, the number of positive cases also goes up proportionately," the health minister said. He, however, said considering the trend on the rate of positivity since July 25, the government was hopeful that the infection was slowing down comparatively. ‚ÄúOnce, 18 out of 100 people tested positive in the state. But now, this has come down to five,‚Äù the minister said. Dibrugarh and Sonitpur still have positivity rates of 10 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, the minister said, adding that they remained a concern. The positivity rate in Kamrup (Metro) is 4.5 per cent. ‚ÄúDibrugarh and Sonitpur have recorded the highest positivity rate in the last three days,‚Äù Himanta pointed out. He said the Sonitur deputy commissioner had been advised to conduct 2,000 tests a day so that the target of 50,000 tests in the district can be achieved in August. Himanta also said the state government received a proposal from the Dibrugarh deputy commissioner to lock down Dibrugarh town, which is under consideration. ‚ÄúLockdown without testing is a waste of time. When the district authority will get the testing infrastructure right, only then will lockdown yield benefits,‚Äù he added. The minister said the state government will take a decision on reopening schools by August 22. ‚ÄúQuarantine and isolation centres will be withdrawn from schools and colleges. But their reopening will depend on the situation in the respective districts,‚Äù Himanta said. Later, in a tweet, he stated that the mortality rate due to Covid-19 stands at 0.24% in Assam, the lowest in India, while the state‚Äôs recovery rate at 75% has been the 4th best in the country. Test per million in Assam is 27,544, which, Himanta said, was the 5th best in the country. ‚ÄúWe work for a larger goal of humanity and not for a Model. Our commitment to fighting the pandemic is robust,‚Äù Himanta tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-to-conduct-500000-covid-tests-on-august-4/articleshow/77322001.cms||Kangkan Kalita

He is the fourth important politician in Bihar who died of Covid-19 in the past two weeks. ‚ÄúHe breathed his last around 9.30pm. He was admitted to the AIIMS on July 30. Earlier, he was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 infection at a reputed private hospital in Patliputra Colony in the state capital,‚Äù CPM state secretary Awadhesh Kumar told TOI while confirming his death. Singh was a two-term MLA from erstwhile Chautham Vidhan Sabha constituency in Bihar‚Äôs Khagaria district. His death has caused an irreparable loss to Left movement in the state. Several top leaders of the CPI, CPM and CPI-ML mourned his death. ‚ÄúWe have lost an experienced and hardworking leader of the Left movement,‚Äù CPI-ML state secretary Kunal said while mourning the demise of Singh. Earlier on July 21, BJP MLC Sunil Kumar Singh (69) died of Covid-19 at the same hospital. He was the first legislator from Bihar to die of Covid-19. The BJP MLC from Darbhanga district was admitted to the AIIMS-Patna on July 13 after his sample test report was found positive. Just a day after the BJP MLC‚Äôs death, senior RJD leader and former chairman of the Danapur Nagar Parishad Raj Kishore Yadav succumbed to Covid-19 at the AIIMS-Patna. Again a day after Yadav‚Äôs death, one more politician died of the deadly infection on July 23. Former chief of Gaya district Board Bindeshwari Prasad Yadav alias Bindi Yadav, who was husband of JD(U) MLC Manorma Devi, died at a private hospital in the state capital due to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cpis-bihar-state-secretary-satya-narain-singh-dies-of-covid-19/articleshow/77322202.cms||---
August 3, 2020||India||After 3-month freeze, Ahmedabad‚Äôs 600-year-old heart is beating again||Loud, colourful and cheerful ‚Äì that‚Äôs Ahmedabad for you on a normal day. But when Covid struck, the city‚Äôs 600-year-old heart went into a three-month-long freeze. In April, all eyes were on the city‚Äôs west. The administration expected the virus to touch down there as people returned from abroad. While the first case was found there, the outbreak really started in the old Walled City. Jamalpur saw a surge. An 85-year-old woman who had returned from Saudi Arabia died of Covid at Panch Pipli in the Khamasa neighbourhood. Jamalpur and the other old parts, such as Kalupur, Dariapur, Shahpur, Khadia and Karanj, comprise only 5% of Ahmedabad‚Äôs area and population but make up its cultural and commercial centre. They also have centuries-old wholesale markets. For these reasons, Unesco declared the area a World Heritage City in July 2017. Read more from this seriesBy mid-April, three out of every four Covid cases were being reported from the Walled City and Danilimda. Imran Khedawala, MLA from Jamalpur-Khadia, was among the sick. Alarmed, the government ordered a freeze. Only women were allowed out for two hours in the afternoon to shop for essentials.The crowded Bhadra Square ‚Äî framed by the landmark Teen Darwaza ‚Äî was emptied. Cops and medics took over. Four months later, the old heart is beating again, albeit at a slower rate. Business is picking up around Teen Darwaza. The haggling is as fierce as ever but softened by masks. Shopkeepers have to bargain for physical distancing as well. Ahmedabad‚Äôs old city covers only 5% of its area but is a cultural and commercial centre.Trade body representatives say the textile business and the wholesale markets of the Walled City are reviving. The wait is now on for the foodie haunts in Manek Chowk and Bhathiyar Gully to reopen. ‚ÄúBusiness is nowhere near the pre-Covid levels, but we‚Äôre getting back,‚Äù says Moin Lakdawala, owner of an electronics shop on the nearby Relief Road. He recalls evenings in April and May that were spent poring over lists of patients. ‚ÄúWe wanted to know if there were cases around our homes. Thankfully, the case numbers are low now.‚Äù The city‚Äôs central zone, which includes the Walled City, now accounts for only 17% of cases, down from the peak of 76%. Former hotspots like Danilimda, Khadia, Jamalpur, and Dariapur have been reporting fewer than 10 cases a week. Vipul Mehta, deputy municipal commissioner of the zone, confirms the decline in cases, adding that door-to-door surveys and intense testing led to the turnaround. Gyasuddin Shaikh, MLA from Dariapur, says gaining the community‚Äôs trust has made a difference. ‚ÄúNow, people know the importance of preventing another Covid wave.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are cautious now. We use sanitisers and wear masks,‚Äù says Dipali Soni, a resident of Jethabhai Ni Pol whose apartment complex was a micro-containment zone for a while. ‚ÄúWe pray that we can celebrate Diwali with the usual fanfare this year.‚Äù (This story is part of a series in association with Facebook.

August 3, 2020||Kolkata||US-based Bengali prof uses AI to restore earliest surviving film of India||Kolkata: An assistant research professor at the University of Maryland, has used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to restore what is largely recognized as the earliest surviving film to be shot in India. In May this year, Aniket Bera had used AI to colour clips of ‚ÄúPather Panchali‚Äù. Although the silent film‚Äôs title states that this is Calcutta, the footage was shot in Banaras. The good news is that this step has promise to bring about a change in automatic video restoration of old films that are on the verge of being lost forever. Aniket Bera According to the British Film Institute website, this film dated 1899 appears under ‚ÄòPanorama of Calcutta, India, From the River Ganges‚Äô title in the Warwick Trading Company‚Äôs catalogues. ‚ÄúThe same catalogue shows other films - now lost - from around Calcutta, which were presumably shot by the same cameraman on the same trip, and may explain the confusion‚Äù, the website states. British film historian Denis Gifford has credited this film to John (‚ÄòMad Jack‚Äô) Benett-Stanford, who had recorded the only film of the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. India's Oldest Video from 19th Century Restored (8K, 50 fps and Color) using Artificial Intelligence Bera‚Äôs technique used for this restoration of this two-minute-long film is similar to what he had used in ‚ÄúPather Panchali‚Äù. ‚ÄúBut this was extremely hard since the video quality was very old and the frames per second were extremely low. The quality has been improved manifold with the resolution of 8K and 50 fps (10 times higher than original),‚Äù said Bera, who was born and brought up in Delhi with roots in Vidyanagar village of South 24 Parganas district.  For this automatic video restoration, Bera first used ‚Äúupscaling‚Äù. This automatically improved the resolution and removed the noise based from the video. ‚ÄúThe original FPS (frames per second) is just 10 and makes the video look very choppy and abrupt. The AI interpolates learns, analyzes and predicts how the frames would have existed in reality when they were filmed. The AI upgraded 50 FPS makes the video look super smooth. As for the colourisation process, AI imagines these colors based on what it thinks the original color would look like after the AI has been trained on 1000s of old videos,‚Äù Bera added. The colorization, he admitted, has room for improvement.  For this video, it took approximately six-seven hours for the upscaling and four-five hours for the FPS improvement. ‚ÄúApproximately, it takes only 10 hours. Colourization will take three-four hours. Restoration is a very labour-intensive work and can take months, years and cost many man-hours. Using an AI system like mine, anyone can do this sitting at home and spending a few hours with virtually no cost. Videos of all old movies, films and documentaries can be restored this way!‚Äù he said.  Film scholars and directors see hope in this use of AI. Film scholar Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay said, ‚ÄúColourisation can be problematic but this is a fundamental contribution to film and social history and will go a long way towards restoring jewels on the verge of extinction.‚Äù According to director Atanu Ghosh, ‚ÄúThough old videos have various kinds of issues, this AI experiment can open new doors if it is proved to be a cheaper, viable and technically convenient alternative.‚Äù  On being asked if AI can help restore the audio, Bera said, ‚ÄúThere is some recent work in AI that can automatically clean audio and even restore it. I personally don‚Äôt know much about this area but this is a hot research topic as well.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/us-based-bengali-prof-uses-ai-to-restore-earliest-surviving-film-of-india/articleshow/77322212.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
August 3, 2020||World||Pompeo says Trump to take broad action on Chinese software||NEW YORK: President Donald Trump plans to take action on a what he sees as a broad array of national security risks presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday. Pompeo's remarks followed reports that Microsoft is in advanced talks to buy the US operations of TikTok, which has been a source of national security and censorship concerns for the Trump administration. ‚ÄúThese Chinese software companies doing business in the United States, whether it's TikTok or WeChat ‚Äî there are countless more ... are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus,‚Äù Pompeo said on FOX News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures. ‚ÄúCould be their facial recognition patterns. It could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends, who they're connected to. Those ‚Äî those are the issues that President Trump has made clear we're going to take care of.‚Äù Trump had said on Friday that he would soon ban TikTok in the United States. A federal committee is reviewing whether that's possible, and its members agree that TikTok cannot remain in the US in its current form, because it "risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,‚Äù said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. ‚ÄúWe all agree there has to be a change...everybody agrees it can't exist as it does," Mnuchin said Sunday on ABC News This Week with George Stephanopoulos. As speculation grew over a ban or sale of the social media's US business, TikTok posted a video on Saturday saying: ‚ÄúWe're not planning on going anywhere.‚Äù TikTok's catchy videos and ease of use has made it popular, and it says it has tens of millions of users in the US and hundreds of millions globally. Its parent company, Bytedance Ltd, launched TikTok in 2017. It bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the US and Europe, and combined the two. It has a similar service, Douyin, for users in China. But TikTok's Chinese ownership has raised concern about the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials as well as censorship of videos critical of the Chinese government. TikTok says it does not censor videos and it would not give the Chinese government access to US user data. ‚ÄúThe President, when he makes his decision, will make sure that everything we have done drives us as close to zero risk for the American people,‚Äù Pompeo said. ‚ÄúThat's the mission set that he laid out for all of us when we get -- we began to evaluate this now several months back. We're closing in on a solution. And I think you will see the president's announcement shortly.‚Äù The debate over TikTok parallels a broader US security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the US stop buying equipment from those providers to be used in US networks. Trump has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei over concerns that the Chinese government has access to its data, which Huawei denies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pompeo-says-trump-to-take-broad-action-on-chinese-software/articleshow/77322711.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Business||App companies quizzed on data sharing, political ties||NEW DELHI: Companies running recently banned Chinese apps have been served a questionnaire with around 80 queries seeking information such as whether owners are associated with any political party and if the firm is required to share data under China's law. The government's actions are based on concerns that data was being shared with Chinese agencies, including the People's Liberation Army. It comes in the wake of China delaying vacating territory intruded upon by the PLA in Ladakh. India-China border stand-off: Complete coverageThe questions have been divided into sections such as "company", "ownership", "services & security", "privacy policy" and "data-related information". The section on ownership asks if the company's owners, directors or "any other members" associated with the firm or its parent entity, subsidiaries or holding company has links with a political party. The government has asked for the citizenship details of owners and management of the parent and subsidiary companies in case the Indian operations of the app are controlled by a company established in India. In a question linked to the decision to ban Chinese apps like the popular TikTok, the government has asked if in the event of the majority or controlling shareholder being based out of China, is the company expected to share its data under Chinese law or any other rule or regulation. The questionnaire seeks details on the financial and technological relation between the parent company and its Indian arm and differences in permissions sought from users in India as compared to those in other locations. The government has asked about incident response, version update and disclosure with regard to providing information to India's cybersecurity response cell Cert-In. Given the Chinese practice of providing direct financial support to firms, the queries seek a response on "subsidies" provided for services offered through the app. Other questions include whether the app's policies are consistent with India's Information Technology Act, 2000, and whether users have raised any concerns, if data like IP addresses, browsing history, location and time zones, network type and service IDs and screen resolutions are being collected.

August 3, 2020||India||Govt plans personal health IDs, e-records for citizens||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to announce the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) on August 15, which has been envisaged as a complete digital health ecosystem with personal health IDs for every Indian, digitisation of health records as well as a registry of doctors and health facilities across the country. The proposal has received in-principle cabinet approval and the final nod is expected by the end of this week, top official sources said. ‚ÄúThe PM is expected to announce launch of the mission as part of his Independence Day speech on August 15,‚Äù a source said. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesThe digital platform will be launched with four key features ‚Äì health ID, personal health records, Digi Doctor and health facility registry. At a later stage, it will also include e-pharmacy and telemedicine services, regulatory guidelines for which are being framed. The platform is voluntary as it will be up to an individual to get enrolled on the app. Health records will be shared only after authorisation by the individual. Similarly, it will be up to hospitals and doctors to provide details for the app. The government, however, feels the utility of the app will ensure widespread participation. Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage‚ÄúThe implementation of NDHM is expected to significantly improve efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of health service delivery overall and accelerate India‚Äôs progress towards achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.8 of universal health coverage, including financial risk protection,‚Äù National Health Authority (NHA) chief executive Indu Bhushan said. The NHA, the implementing agency for Ayushman Bharat, has created the platform, which will be available in the form of an app and website. The initiative is seen as another flagship measure in the healthcare sector after health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat (Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana) and will be initially launched in select states and expanded in a phased manner.

Privacy is taken care of in the design where the ownership of data remains with individuals and consent is required to access it. The individual will have a choice to allow a medical practitioner or facility to access the data even for a limited period of time. People will also have a choice to link their unique health ID with Aadhaar if they wish to. This ID will be applicable across states, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and pharmacies. ‚ÄúNDHM is not a mandating system. It will be an empowering system. It is 100% voluntary in nature but is designed in a manner that it is going to have so many benefits that we feel there is no reason to say no. No one can access someone‚Äôs data without consent and there are no exceptions to it, including the government. It is also completely seamless and portable,‚Äù an official said. The Digi Doctor option will allow doctors from across the country to enrol and their details, including their contact numbers if they want to provide them, will be available. These doctors will also be assigned digital signature for free which can be used for writing prescriptions. Similarly, health facilities will be assigned a unique electronic identifier. This will have a two-fold function ‚Äî it will ensure that all health facilities are mapped and will also be the identifier that the facility can use for all its clearances and audits. The theme of NDHM is ‚ÄòMaking India a Digital Health Nation‚Äô through a national digital health ecosystem. The technology platforms are ready, including the cloud infrastructure, and NDHM will be rolled out immediately after the launch, the official said.

August 3, 2020||India||Prashant Bhushan, aides launch multi-pronged response in SC contempt cases||NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Supreme Court‚Äôs hearing on contempt proceedings against Prashant Bhushan for his alleged ‚Äòcontemptuous‚Äô remarks against present and former CJIs, he and his sympathisers have launched a multi-pronged response to dissuade the court from going ahead with contempt cases. A bench of Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari on July 22 had initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against Bhushan for his tweets ‚Äî one accusing the Chief Justice of India of riding a stationary heavy bike without mask or helmet while keeping courts under lockdown; and the other attributing role to four former CJIs in the alleged destruction of democracy in last six years of undeclared emergency. On July 24, the same bench had asked Bhushan to be prepared on August 4 to defend the 2009 contempt proceedings drawn against him for insinuating that half of 16 former CJIs were corrupt. It had refused to adjourn hearing on this old case till September or when the physical hearing in court resumed. Justice Mishra retires on September 2. On July 27, a statement was released by 131 persons, many of whom were in the past represented by Bhushan in court, expressing solidarity with the activist lawyer and criticising the SC for taking recourse to contempt proceedings for his tweets. Days later, another release was issued by Bhushan‚Äôs office saying 11 former judges of the SC and HCs have endorsed the statement by the 131 persons. Next, a joint petition in Supreme Court was filed by eminent editor N Ram, former minister Arun Shourie and Prashant Bhushan challenging the constitutional validity of Section 2(c)(i) of the Contempt of Court Act, which made ‚Äúpublication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which scandalises or tend to scandalise or lower or tends to lower the authority of any court‚Äù an offence. The trio, who had come together along with Yashwant Sinha to question the Rafale fighter jet purchase deal in 2018, in their petition through advocate Kamini Jaiswal said the provision violated a person‚Äôs right to free speech guaranteed under Article 19 and right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. On Saturday, Bhushan himself filed another writ petition through Jaiswal seeking stay of the suo motu contempt proceedings initiated on July 22. He faulted the SC Registry for listing before the bench a contempt petition which had no approval from either the attorney general or the solicitor general, as needed under the Contempt of Court Act. He said since the petition itself was defective and could not have been listed before the court, the initiation of suo motu proceedings too was afflicted by the defect. He sought a stay on these proceedings. He also sought dropping of the 2009 contempt proceedings against him saying these proceedings had a chilling effect on his right to free speech and violated his right to free speech. On Saturday, Bhushan‚Äôs office said that the statement of 131 persons expressing solidarity with the activist lawyer has now been endorsed by former judges of the Supreme Court ‚Äî Justices Ruma Pal, GS Singhvi, Ashok K Ganguly, Gopala Gowda, Aftab Alam, J Chelameswar, Vikramjit Sen and Madan Lokur. It also said former HC judges AP Shah and Anjana Prakash too have endorsed the Bhushan-solidarity statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prashant-bhushan-aides-launch-multi-pronged-response-in-sc-contempt-cases/articleshow/77323282.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

August 3, 2020||India||June deadline over, MHA seeks 3 months to frame CAA rules||NEW DELHI: The home ministry has told a parliamentary standing committee that it will need three more months to frame Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) rules. Though CAA was passed by both Houses of Parliament on December 11 and a notification issued fixing January 10, 2020, as the date from which the Act would come into effect, the absence of rules has held up implementation of the law that seeks to confer citizenship to minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who were forced to migrate to India for fear of religious persecution in their home country. According to the manual on parliamentary work, rules for legislation should be framed within six months of the date of the President‚Äôs assent or the standing committee on subordinate legislation should be approached for extension of time. The six-month period for framing CAA rules ended in mid-June. If the three-month extension sought is from then, it gives the home ministry time until mid-September to frame the rules. With the Supreme Court now resuming hearings on a full scale, the Centre is hoping the pending challenge against CAA will also be taken up. This may also provide some clarity for framing the rules and procedures. Sources said additional time to frame CAA rules was sought from the parliamentary panel last week, as the ministry was preoccupied with other matters, including managing the Covid-19 crisis, for the past few months. The enactment of CAA had sparked widespread protests and sit-ins across the nation and also sparked off communal riots in Delhi in February||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/june-deadline-over-mha-seeks-3-months-to-frame-caa-rules/articleshow/77323331.cms||Bharti Jain

August 3, 2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Fatality rate 5th worst in country, Punjab on toes||CHANDIGARH: Given the high number of Covid-19 deaths in the state, Punjab does not seem to be doing enough for early detection and care of critical patients. Although Punjab is placed at the 18th spot among states with highest number of positive cases, it has the fifth highest fatality rate in the country as on July 31, indicating that a high number of the infected people are succumbing to the virus. Maharashtra and Gujarat, with a fatality rate of 4%, and Delhi and Madhya Pradesh, with 3% mortality rate, are the only states ahead of Punjab, where 2.4% of people infected with the virus have died. Punjab‚Äôs fatality rate is even higher than the national average of 2%. Coronavirus has killed 405 people in Punjab, of which 256 deaths were reported from July 1 to August 1. On an average, eight people died daily during the period. With 2.4%, the fatality rate in urban areas is higher than in rural areas, where 1.9% of infected patients died. The male mortality has been recorded higher than the Covid-19 female mortality rate across all ages in the state. The virus proved fatal for 2.5 patients, while fatality rate among female patients stands at 1.8%. What has intrigued many is that less number of people have died in many states with significantly higher number of positive cases than in Punjab. With just 82 people losing their lives out of 24,743 infected with the virus, Kerala has the lowest fatality rate in the country. In Bihar, 312 people of 54,508 found positive died while 101 people out of 41,727 infected lost their lives in Assam. Similarly, out of 33,479 cases in Odisha, 225 died. Amritsar and Kapurthala districts have the highest fatality rate of 4% in the state, followed by Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Pathankot, where 3% of patients tested positive have died. Health experts have related the high death rate to poor access to healthcare fatalities, especially in rural areas, lack of timely detection of patients and proper management of patients. The state health officials have attributed delay on the part of patients in approaching health facilities and high prevalence of non-communicable disease as reasons for higher fatality rate. Due to limited access to health facilities, especially in rural areas, people go to unregistered medical practitioners. It has come to light that in some of the cases, people who died due to Covid-19, had first gone to unregistered medical practitioners and approached the health facilities at the last moment. Taking a corrective measure, the state government has now imposed a ban on unregistered medical practitioners treating Covid-19 patients. An analysis of 204 deaths done by the health department reveals that 65 people infected with the virus have died in the age group of 60-69 while 45 deaths are in the age group of 50-59. In the age group of 70-79, 30 people have died while the death toll in 40-49 group stands at 27. Three deaths each have been reported in the age groups of 0-9 and 10-19. Barring in 25 cases, all the deceased had underlying health conditions such as end-stage kidney disease, cancer, HIV besides uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure. Punjab health department spokesperson for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar maintained that co-morbidity and people coming late for treatment are the major cause of high death rate in Punjab.

August 3, 2020||Mangaluru||Fishing opens, but many fishermen return empty-handed||Karwar: Fishing activity in coastal Uttara Kannada began on Saturday after a gap of one-and-a-half months. However only a limited catch was available and majority of fishermen returned empty-handed without catching any fish. On Saturday and Sunday about 60 mechanized fishing boats, besides many purse siene boats, went for fishing in the Arabain Sea from Karwar port. But almost all the boats retuned empty without fish. Many fishermen said they were hoping for a good catch this time as the climate was good. ‚ÄúContrary to our expectation, we did not get any fish. Already we have incurred heavy losses due to lockdown,‚Äù said Vinayak Harikatra, a fisherman. He said maintaining boats and paying salary to workers has become very difficult for many fishermen. The fishermen said they are baffled by one problem after the other. Repeated cyclones affected their business last year.

Chandrakant Tadvi (32) and his Mahesh (30) had left from their homes for some borewell-related labour work in Vadadla village on Dabhoi Road. When they were returning after work, a car registered in Valsad rammed them from behind. Eye-witnesses told police that the duo was flung several metres away and their bike veered off the road. Both died on the spot due to head injures that resulted in heavy blood loss. Police said that the driver of the car lost control over his vehicle as one of the tyres burst. The car‚Äôs front body was also damaged, but the passenger escaped unhurt.

August 3, 2020||Patna||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Union minister seeks CBI probe, Congress defends Maharashtra govt||PATNA: Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput‚Äôs alleged suicide has become a major political issue in poll-bound Bihar with netas cutting across party lines demanding a CBI probe into the matter. On Sunday, Union minister R K Singh said investigation into the late actor‚Äôs suicide should he handed over to the CBI to end the ongoing spat between the political bosses and the police officers of Bihar and Maharashtra. Singh, who had earlier served as Union home secretary, said, ‚ÄúThe dispute between the Bihar police and the Maharashtra police over jurisdiction of investigation and allegations about non-cooperation will come to an end once the case is handed over to the CBI. I think it‚Äôs proper to recommend a CBI probe as the actor‚Äôs family has expressed dissatisfaction over the investigation carried out so far by the Mumbai police.‚Äù Singh, the BJP MP from Ara in Bhojpur district, added, ‚ÄúThe grievances Sushant‚Äôs family are genuine. The Mumbai police did precious little after the incident. They didn‚Äôt lodge any formal FIR even after interrogation of a number of suspects. Instead, they started raising a hue and cry after a Bihar police team visited Mumbai for investigation on the basis of an FIR lodged at a police station in Patna.‚Äù Singh‚Äôs reactions came hours after Congress incharge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil defended the Maharashtra government, saying, ‚ÄúThe Bihar police should focus on the investigation rather than indulging in mudslinging and accusations. I must thank the CM of Maharashtra, state Congress president Thoratji, home minister Anil Deshmukhji and others for taking a serious view of the Sushant suicide case.‚Äù He, however, added police officers from both the states should exchange information with each other to unravel the truth.Gohil‚Äôs utterances, however, evoked sharp reaction from JD(U). ‚ÄúThe Congress should first withdraw its support to the government in Maharashtra. The allegation against Nitish Kumar government that it was turning the issue into a political one is not only surprising but also shameful,‚Äù JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/union-min-seeks-cbi-probe-cong-defends-maha-govt/articleshow/77321597.cms||Ramashankar
August 3, 2020||Patna||‚ÄòWebinars serve limited purpose‚Äô||PATNA: The Covid-19 pandemic may have disturbed the day-to-day activities of individuals for more than six months, but it has proved to be a blessing in disguise for many writers and poets, claim academics. According to litt√©rateur and Sahitya Akademi Award winner, Arun Kamal, the lockdown has given the writers an opportunity to revisit old compositions that were left incomplete due to paucity of time. ‚ÄúAll the catastrophes and pandemics, including Covid-19, have nourished the poets and thinkers,‚Äù Arun says. Another litt√©rateur, Ram Bachan Ray, feels that writing continues even in the shadow of grief. He says, ‚ÄúMental agony may affect creativity to some extent, but it cannot stop it completely. More and more writers are participating in webinars these days and sharing literary creations with each other.‚Äù Former head of English department in Patna University (PU), Shankar Ashish Dutt, points out that the lockdown has let academics and scholars indulge in creative activities. ‚ÄúWebinars conducted by institutions and literary organizations have enabled them to connect with the rest of the world quite economically,‚Äù he adds. PU Hindi department head, Tarun Kumar, however, observes that the impact of webinars is quite limited as most scholars are yet to get accustomed to the digital world. Bihar Public Service Commission former member, Shiv Jatan Thakur, also says the benefits of webinars being organized all over the world cannot be availed properly because of poor internet connectivity. He adds that the Covid-19 pandemic has restricted literary activities and prevented dissemination of ideas and publication of journals. PU Urdu department teacher, Shahab Zafar Azmi, maintains that the pandemic has robbed the scholars of the opportunity to have face-to-face interactions and share ideas. ‚ÄúWebinars and videoconferences only serve a limited purpose,‚Äù he says. Patna College psychology teacher, Sheo Sagar Prasad, has a different take on creativity amid the pandemic. He says, ‚ÄúPeople can hardly be creative if they are under mental trauma and stress. The spike in number of Covid cases and lack of medical facilities have only aggravated their mental agony.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/webinars-serve-limited-purpose/articleshow/77321352.cms||B K Mishra
August 3, 2020||Patna||Nine more private hospitals get nod to treat Covid patients in Patna||PATNA: Nine more private hospitals have started admitting Covid-19 patients after getting permission from the Patna district administration. These hospitals have created separate isolation wards and reserved 20-25% of their beds for Covid patients. Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said altogether 32 private hospitals have so far been given permission to admit Covid patients. ‚ÄúAll these hospitals have started treating Covid patients. At least 200 Covid patients are currently undergoing treatment at various private hospitals. We are monitoring the functioning of private hospitals. All these private hospitals have been asked not to deny treatment to any patient. Teams of dedicated doctors have been formed at the private hospitals for the treatment of Covid patients,‚Äù Agarwal said, adding the private hospitals would also be given permission to run Covid isolation ward, if required. Anup Institute of Orthopaedic, Atlantis Hospital, Buddha Cancer Hospital, Shamford Hospital, Rainbow Hospital, Curis Hospital and Shri Vinayak Trauma Centre Hospital are among the nine hospitals which have received permission for treatment of Covid patients in the city. Paras HMRI regional director (east) Dr Talat Halim said the 30-bed Covid ward at the hospital is full to its capacity. ‚ÄúTwo patients are on ventilators. They are, however, recovering well. Three patients have been kept on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the remaining on oxygen support,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe are taking extra precautions in the Covid ward. At least three Covid patients have so far been discharged from the hospital. The hospital has so far not recoded any Covid death,‚Äù Dr Talat added. An official of Nestiva Hospital, Gardanibagh, said eight Covid patients, all in the age group of 60-70 years with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension, have died at the hospital. Fifteen patients are currently undergoing treatment at the hospital and two of them are on ventilator support,‚Äù he added. An administrative officer of Sahyog Hospital at Patliputra Colony said altogether 12 Covid patients have so far been admitted to the hospital. ‚ÄúOf them, two were discharged after testing negative for the virus. A 70-year-old man died at the hospital three days back due to Covid,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nine-more-pvt-hospitals-get-nod-to-treat-covid-patients/articleshow/77321281.cms||Faryal Rumi
August 3, 2020||Patna||Now, Gaya‚Äôs Covid positivity rate shows declining trend||GAYA: The Covid-19 positivity rate in Gaya keeps fluctuating thereby necessitating recalibration of the response to meet the challenge. As against an average of nearly 10%, the positivity rate for several days in the last week of July exceeded 20%. Once again it has shown a declining trend and is hovering around 10%.  Explaining the sudden spurt in positivity rate in the last week of July, district magistrate Abhishek Singh said that there is nothing worrisome and the high positivity rate for several days in the last week of July was on account of focussed testing and effective contact tracing. ‚ÄúThe strategy has paid dividends,‚Äù claimed Singh.  According to the DM, as on Saturday evening, altogether 25,120 tests were conducted in the district and out of these 2,132 tested positive. The DM put the number of active cases at 804 and also said that, as on date, 36 Covid patients needed hospitalisation and oxygen support. Another 86 are under institutional isolation. Singh put the number of active cases under home quarantine at 699.  However, according to stories doing the rounds, several persons officially under home isolation need oxygen support and they do it privately in order to escape hospitalisation on account of perceived lack of care in the hospital and the lack of hygiene therein. Those availing oxygen support during home isolation include family members of some medical professionals. The first doctor victim of Covid-19 in the state, Dr Ashwini Nandkuliar, was from Gaya town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-gayas-covid-positivity-rate-shows-declining-trend/articleshow/77321629.cms||Abdul Qadir
August 3, 2020||Lucknow||UP: Jaunpur brothers bring holy water from 151 rivers, soil from 16 sites||LUCKNOW/AYODHYA: A septuagenarian brother duo from Jaunpur have brought their most prized possession to Ayodhya for the 'bhoomi pujan' -- holy water of 151 rivers and pious soil from 16 shrines in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka -- which they had been collecting for 51 years for the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple. Their over five-decade-old toil concluded on Sunday, when they handed over their worldly possession to Champat Rai, the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary. ‚ÄúI feel complete‚Ä¶ The purpose of our life has been achieved,‚Äù said Radhey Shyam Pandey, the elder one who retired as a government school teacher. Recalling how the journey began, younger sibling Pandit Triphala said: ‚ÄúTo us, Ram is a family member who was not getting his due. Scriptures say truth wins ‚Äì a fact which was established in 2019, when the court cleared the roadblocks in the way of temple construction. I am here to give all the positivity and goodness I gathered over the years.‚Äù What makes their contribution truly remarkable is that initially they walked long distances on foot for their cause. Then they took to cycling. In old age, they used their hard earned money to travel by air to get the religious material. Also, Pandit Triphala, an author and poet, suffers from congenital blindness. Ayodhya local and health sector social worker Prashant Shukla, who facilitated the brothers‚Äô meeting with trust officials, revealed that they brought water from 151 rivers, three seas, and pious soil from 16 places. ‚ÄúThey went to Sri Lanka to bring sea water and Nepal to fetch soil from PashupatiNath Temple,‚Äù said Shukla. The list of places include different Jyotirlings, Shaktipeeths, Somnath, Tripur Sundari Temple, Mahakaleshwar, Parshuram Mahadev, Eklingnath‚Äôs temple among other places. The list also includes Sheeshganj Gurudwara, Digambar Jain Temple. Asked to comment on the significance of their contribution, mahant Girishpati Tripathi of the Tewari Mandir said: ‚ÄúA verse in the Ramcharitmanas (jay din Ram janam shruti gavahi, teerth sakal tahan chali aavahi) tells us that the day any celebration related to Ramlalla (baby Ram) is organized in Ayodhya, religious places get attracted to the city.

Three days ago, the district administration initiated rapid antigen test drive in commercial areas in Hubballi. However, fearing seal-down and other measures, many traders downed the shutters and went home. Members of traders‚Äô associations and industry and commerce bodies met deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil on Saturday and conveyed their feelings and fear. This resulted in a positive response from the district administration, and the DC assured them that if a positive case is detected, shops will be sealed down only for two days instead of seven days and no forcible test will be conducted on traders. Shankaranna Munavalli, former president, Karnatak Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, ‚ÄúAntigen tests are required to break the chain of Covid-19, but tests should not be carried out forcibly and traders should not be harassed.‚Äù Mahendra Laddhad, president, KCC&I, said, ‚ÄúWe have urged the DC to see to it that traders are educated before conducting the tests. The DC said stern action will be initiated if any cases of harassment are brought to his notice.‚Äù DC Nitesh Patil said, ‚ÄúIf we conduct tests, identify positive cases early on, and isolate them, we can minimize the spread of Covid-19. The number of positive cases are coming down. We have decided to carry the antigen test drive at least for a week. The seal-down will be for 48 hours and not seven days. No officials will force traders for a test. But I appeal to to traders to come forward and take the test and cooperate with the medical team.‚Äù Traders, who have incurred huge losses during lockdowns, said, ‚ÄúAfter a long gap, we have opened our shops and gradually started business. Now, if our shops and other establishments are closed again, how do we run our business and homes?‚Äù they asked. District minister Jagadish Shettar said there is no question of harassing traders. He appealed to traders to get the test done voluntarily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dc-appeals-to-traders-to-get-tested-voluntarily/articleshow/77320582.cms||J Abbas Mulla
August 3, 2020||Business||At Rs 6 lakh crore, banks‚Äô fresh FDs in Q1 double from last year||MUMBAI: Banks have seen money in fixed deposits (FDs) increase by Rs 6.1 lakh crore during the period April to July 3. This is more than twice the Rs 3 lakh crore of FDs added by banks during the same period in the previous financial year. An increase in FDs is an indication that investors expect interest rates to come down further. It is also reflective of risk-aversion. From the deposit numbers of the large banks that have declared their results so far, it is seen that the share of FDs is either rising or is steady. In the case of HDFC Bank, which has seen deposits grow 24% year on year in the first quarter, the current account-savings account (CASA) ratio slipped to 40.1% from 42.2% in March. For Axis Bank, the CASA ratio, which was 41.2% in March, is now 40.9% at the end of the first quarter. Kotak Mahindra Bank has shown a marginal improvement with the CASA ratio rising to 56.7% from 56.2%. ICICI Bank‚Äôs CASA for the first quarter was 41%, down from 42.7% for FY20. State Bank of India (SBI) has also shown growth from 45.1 to 45.3%. For FY20, bank deposits accounted for 52.6% of household savings, followed by life insurance (23.2%), currency (13.4%) and mutual fund holdings (7%). Given the slowdown in insurance and mutual fund savings, there is a strong likelihood that the share of bank deposits in household savings could rise. However, gross numbers for the banking system show that there is an overall decline in the share of FDs in total deposits. According to a report by CARE Ratings, time deposits account for 89.4% of aggregate deposits (89.5% share in July 2019), growing at a slower pace compared to demand deposits, which account for the balance 10.6% (10.5% share in July 2019). Since the Covid-19 pandemic broke, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been systematically easing liquidity in the system. This has resulted in banks ending up with surplus liquidity. This, in turn, has forced banks to bring down deposit rates. SBI‚Äôs best deposit rate for non-senior citizens is 5.4%. Despite bringing down interest rates, SBI has added Rs 1.8 lakh crore to its deposit base between April and June 2020. To deal with the surplus liquidity, the RBI has undertaken term (fixed-rate) reverse repo auctions in order to allow banks to park any excess funds with the central bank. There are indications that deposits‚Äô growth is tapering off in the second quarter. Deposits‚Äô growth dipped marginally by 20 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) to 10.8% (as of July 17, 2020) compared to previous fortnight ended July 3. However, the growth rate continues to be robust, indicating that there is scope for further reduction. The banking system daily average liquidity stood at Rs.6.5 lakh crore during the last two fortnights ended July 17, 2020 and July 3, 2020, said CARE.

August 3, 2020||Business||Union Bank cuts home loan interest rate to 6.7%||MUMBAI: Union Bank of India has slashed interest rate on home loans for salaried to 6.7%, which is lower than the general category mortgages of State Bank of India (SBI), which has traditionally offered the lowest interest rate. Union Bank charges 6.7% for loans up to Rs 30 lakh for salaried borrowers with a credit score of at least 700, which must include a woman applicant. For loans above Rs 30 lakh and up to Rs 75 lakh, the best rate is 6.95%. For larger sized loans, interest rates begin at 7%. For salaried borrowers, where a man is the sole borrower, the rate is 6.75%, which is also the rate for non-salaried borrowers. SBI‚Äôs home loan rates for women borrowers for loans up to Rs 30 lakh start from 6.95%. Last month, LIC Housing Finance had reduced interest rates to 6.9%‚Äî its lowest ever. Another public sector lender, Bank of Baroda, has home loans starting from 6.85%. Market leader HDFC currently charges 6.95% for loans up to Rs 30 lakh where the borrower is a woman. For loans up to Rs 30 lakh to Rs 75 lakh, the interest rate rises to 7.2%. Home loan rates are expected to dip further in coming weeks with the Reserve Bank of India widely expected to cut its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) in its next bi-monthly policy review to be announced on August 6. Since banks have to mandatorily link the reference rate for the home loans that they offer to the repo, any change by the RBI will bring down the cost of funds for borrowers. While there has been a drop in property sales during the lockdown, lenders are also trying to grow their market share by attracting existing borrowers from other lenders through refinance. Union Bank of India, which has acquired Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank, has increased its branch network following the merger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/union-bank-cuts-home-loan-interest-rate-to-6-7/articleshow/77321564.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Business||In a first, govt retires benchmark gilt within 3 months||MUMBAI: Initiating a shift in approach to borrowing from the market, the government on Friday auctioned a new 10-year bond, in less than three months from the last one it did on May 11. This was the first time that a new benchmark has been was introduced in less than three months of the previous one, compared to an average validity of a benchmark gilt of 8-10 months. On Friday, the new benchmark was auctioned at an annual interest rate of 5.77%. It will be issued on August 3 with the name ‚Äò5.77% GS 2020‚Äô. The drastic reduction in the duration of the benchmark 10-year bond, which plays a major role in fixing the rate of interest by banks, was necessitated by the government‚Äôs massive borrowing programme this year, mainly due to its enhanced spending requirement due to the ensuing pandemic, bond market players said. In India, the yield on the benchmark paper, also called the ‚Äò10-year yield‚Äô in market parlance, is the benchmark relative to which most rates of interest and also the yields for government as well as corporate bonds are fixed or traded. The government plans to borrow Rs 12 lakh crore in this fiscal, which is 54% more than the Budget estimate of Rs 7.8 lakh crore. The introduction of a new 10-year government security (G-sec) was necessitated by the RBI‚Äôs informal limit for each gilt at Rs 1.2 lakh crore, bond dealers said. Given the huge supply of government papers this year, the 10-year benchmark yield is now down to around 5.8%, from as high as 7.25% in January 2019. ‚ÄúWhile announcing the issuance of a particular security under the market-borrowing programme of the central government, two aspects are looked into. First, the amount of gross issuance of the government for each of the fiscal year, current and future. Second, what is the outstanding amount of a particular security in a fiscal year?‚Äù a chief of debt investment at a domestic institution said. ‚ÄúThese two are done with an objective of not only to keep that borrowing under a particular fiscal year within an acceptable limit but also to evenly spread out the repayments within a particular year,‚Äù the investment professional said. RBI data showed that before the 10-year paper was issued in May 2020, the shortest period for which a paper was the benchmark G-sec was six months, which was for the 10-year gilt issued in May 2013. And the longest duration for which a paper was a benchmark was the one issued in January 2018. Bond market players said that with the increase in the size of the economy and also that of the borrowing programme of the government over the years, the RBI has gradually stepped up the limit of a particular fiscal year gross issuance and also issuance under each security. This move has ensured average life of any new 10-year to about 8-10 months in the recent past. RBI data showed that till about FY2014, the upper limit for issuance under 10-year G-secs was around Rs 80,000 crore. Since FY15, it has been pegged at Rs 1.2 lakh crore. For the May 11, 2020 paper, bonds worth Rs 1.04 crore have already been issued. This year, a quantum jump in the government‚Äôs borrowing programme owing to the Covid-19 pandemic has compelled the RBI to announce issuance of a new 10-year benchmark within three months, a bond market player said. ‚ÄúThis move is to ensure orderly redemption schedule within a particular fiscal year.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-a-first-govt-retires-benchmark-gilt-within-3-months/articleshow/77321482.cms||Partha Sinha
August 3, 2020||Amritsar||Covid-19: Fatality rate 5th worst in country, Punjab on toes||CHANDIGARH: Given the high number of Covid-19 deaths in the state, Punjab does not seem to be doing enough for early detection and care of critical patients. Although Punjab is placed at the 18th spot among states with highest number of positive cases, it has the fifth highest fatality rate in the country as on July 31, indicating that a high number of the infected people are succumbing to the virus. Maharashtra and Gujarat, with a fatality rate of 4%, and Delhi and Madhya Pradesh, with 3% mortality rate, are the only states ahead of Punjab, where 2.4% of people infected with the virus have died. Punjab‚Äôs fatality rate is even higher than the national average of 2%. Coronavirus has killed 405 people in Punjab, of which 256 deaths were reported from July 1 to August 1. On an average, eight people died daily during the period. With 2.4%, the fatality rate in urban areas is higher than in rural areas, where 1.9% of infected patients died. The male mortality has been recorded higher than the Covid-19 female mortality rate across all ages in the state. The virus proved fatal for 2.5 patients, while fatality rate among female patients stands at 1.8%. What has intrigued many is that less number of people have died in many states with significantly higher number of positive cases than in Punjab. With just 82 people losing their lives out of 24,743 infected with the virus, Kerala has the lowest fatality rate in the country. In Bihar, 312 people of 54,508 found positive died while 101 people out of 41,727 infected lost their lives in Assam. Similarly, out of 33,479 cases in Odisha, 225 died. Amritsar and Kapurthala districts have the highest fatality rate of 4% in the state, followed by Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Pathankot, where 3% of patients tested positive have died. Health experts have related the high death rate to poor access to healthcare fatalities, especially in rural areas, lack of timely detection of patients and proper management of patients. The state health officials have attributed delay on the part of patients in approaching health facilities and high prevalence of non-communicable disease as reasons for higher fatality rate. Due to limited access to health facilities, especially in rural areas, people go to unregistered medical practitioners. It has come to light that in some of the cases, people who died due to Covid-19, had first gone to unregistered medical practitioners and approached the health facilities at the last moment. Taking a corrective measure, the state government has now imposed a ban on unregistered medical practitioners treating Covid-19 patients. An analysis of 204 deaths done by the health department reveals that 65 people infected with the virus have died in the age group of 60-69 while 45 deaths are in the age group of 50-59. In the age group of 70-79, 30 people have died while the death toll in 40-49 group stands at 27. Three deaths each have been reported in the age groups of 0-9 and 10-19. Barring in 25 cases, all the deceased had underlying health conditions such as end-stage kidney disease, cancer, HIV besides uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure. Punjab health department spokesperson for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar maintained that co-morbidity and people coming late for treatment are the major cause of high death rate in Punjab. He said steps have been taken for providing timely and proper treatment to patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/fatality-rate-5th-worst-in-country-punjab-on-toes/articleshow/77328587.cms||Vinod Kumar
August 3, 2020||Patna||Universities & colleges hardly prepared for online education in Bihar||PATNA: Even as the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) on Sunday launched an online survey on the preparedness of higher education institutions to undertake online education, universities and colleges in Bihar have hardly anything substantial to offer their claim. However, in response to the AIU‚Äôs initiative, they have started working out the details of their requirements for proper implementation of online education for their students. The last date for submission of a response regarding the survey is August 15. In a letter addressed to the vice-chancellors, the AIU has observed that many institutions are facing issues relating to infrastructures in terms of continuous supply of electricity, availability of devices to the students, networking and bandwidth, capacity building of teachers to teach online and for students to learn online. The survey would also include the assessment of problems relating to online assessment and evaluation of the students, online internships and placements, collaborations and counselling of students. Welcoming the AIU‚Äôs initiative in the context of NPE 2020, Munger University vice-chancellor Ranjit Kumar Verma said for proper dissemination of online education, every college must plan for at least four smart classrooms with such features as interactive white boards, LED/LCD panels and digital podiums besides the usual projectors, speakers and wireless microphones. Besides, every college must have trained and permanent IT personnel along with good internet connectivity, if optimal utilization has to be ensured, he said. Verma further observed that each university must have its own educational multimedia research centre (EMMRC) and a foolproof system to provide necessary resources to colleges. Digital collaboration is now a necessity, he added. Patna University computer centre chief K P Singh said the university must have a ‚Äòlearning management system‚Äô software along with high-speed internet connectivity for introducing online education to its students. And, more importantly, all the teachers of the university must be well-trained in utilization of technological devices and also in the conduct of online classes, he said. Singh further pointed out that all the PG departments and colleges must have e-library and e-books and uninterrupted supply of electricity and Wi-Fi connectivity. Patna Science College physics teacher and PU central library‚Äôs assistant director Ashok Kumar Jha felt the dire need of making university teachers and students computer literate before introducing online education. He said all the postgraduate departments of PU were provided with smart classes during PU‚Äôs centenary celebrations a couple of years ago, but they are yet to be utilized by the faculty members. Strangely enough, some departments have not even installed smart classes as yet, he said. The NPE also envisages rigorous training to the teachers to use online teaching platforms and tools and become high-quality online content creators, Jha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/universities-colleges-hardly-prepared-for-online-education/articleshow/77321334.cms||B K Mishra

They ply their boats in rivers, tributaries and water reservoirs on their own,‚Äù Nishad said. Nishad, who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Muzaffarpur, said over a dozen districts such as Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, East Champaran, Begusarai, Khagaria, Madhubani and Samastipur have a sizeable population of fishermen. ‚ÄúThey have virtually been pushed to the brink of poverty. They didn‚Äôt get any financial help from the government. Several families were managing to survive by doing other jobs. But majority of them were still engaged in their traditional occupation,‚Äù he added. He, however, admitted that the cooperative society for fishermen has provided some financial assistance to some boatmen but that is like a drop in the ocean. ‚ÄúSince fisheries have come under the agriculture department, the losses to fishermen should be compensated by the government as farmers,‚Äù the VIP leader said. The ponds and chaurs (water reservoir) were auctioned by the government. However, a number of families had to face huge financial losses due to floods as fish were washed away, he added. State agriculture minister Prem Kumar couldn‚Äôt be contacted for his comments despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vip-demands-govt-help-to-fishermen/articleshow/77320825.cms||Ramashankar
August 3, 2020||Patna||Friendship Day: Many miss face-to-face fun||PATNA: In the time of pandemic, many residents have developed friendship with their next-door neighbours while providing essentials to the sick, having a long chit-chat and playing games from their balconies to beat the lockdown blues. For kids and youngsters, virtual chats, gifts and cards helped them express fondness for their buddies on the Friendship Day on Sunday. Many kids tied the handmade friendship bands to trees and plants at their homes on the occasion. Akshay Gaurav (23) of Digha celebrated the day by catching up with his friends on virtual platform. ‚ÄúLast year, we had lots of fun. But this time due to the pandemic, we held a small virtual party, played games and reminisced about the good old days. It was simple and quite memorable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn the last few months, we understood the true meaning of friendship. The pandemic has shown who are your true friends. Most of the time we spent in confinement, but immediate neighbours turned out to be my true companions. Almost every evening we spent time talking about the current news, sharing recipes and playing games,‚Äù said Shweta Mishra of Kadamkuan. Rupesh also spent most of his time talking to neighbours through the balcony. ‚ÄúWhen our area was sealed after a few Covid-19 positive cases, our neighbours helped us in providing with essential things,‚Äù he said. Nikita Tiwari, a Class VII student and resident of SK Puri, said she saw her school friends only during online classes. ‚ÄúI make friendship bands for my friends, but tied to plants at home this time. I talked to my friends over the phone,‚Äù she said. Many residents compiled the old pictures with their friends and posted on social platforms. ‚ÄúEven though I send virtual cards and posted old pictures with my friends, nothing can substitute the fun we used to have during the Friendship Day, especially tying friendship bands, watching movies and having food together,‚Äù said Soma (29) of Ashok Rajpath. Shubham Kant also connected to his friends through live chat through mobile applications. ‚ÄúI had a group chat first with my school friends and later with my college friends. Many are living in different parts of the country and a few of them even abroad,‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, the shops selling gift items and friendship bands had a disappointing day. Guddu Singh, owner of a card and gift shop at Patna Market, said, ‚ÄúNot a single card was sold this time. We even informed the customers that we would deliver the gifts or cards to their friends, but in vain,‚Äù he said. The other gift shops also faced the similar situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/friendship-day-many-miss-face-to-face-fun/articleshow/77321426.cms||Faryal Rumi
August 3, 2020||Patna||Bihar: Telemedicine centre set up at Bhagalpur hospital||BHAGALPUR: In a bid to provide 24x7 medicare facilities to corona patients on phone and through WhatsApp, a telemedicine centre has started functioning on the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH), a Covid-dedicated hospital. The hospital has released the cell phone number 9430995093 and base phone number 0641-2401078 for availing the telemedicine facility. The objective is to provide health services on phone to corona patients, who are either in home quarantine or are living in isolation centres and need advice of experts about their health condition, treatment procedures and medicines to be taken besides day-to-day mapping of their condition, said JLNMCH principal Dr Hemant Kumar Sinha. ‚ÄúDoctors posted at JLNMCH, Mayaganj, besides those at JLNMC at Naulakha Kothi in Khanjarpur, will advice treatment procedures to the callers,‚Äù added Dr Sinha. Explaining the telemedicine procedure, the JLNMC principal said that ‚Äòtelehealth‚Äô or ‚Äòtelemedicine‚Äô involves the use of electronic communication and software to provide clinical services to patients through telephonic conversation. ‚ÄúIt is a technology based medicare services provided by expert doctors to patients for improving the healthcare system especially in situation of medical emergencies and pandemics,‚Äù said Dr Hem Shanker Sharma, associate professor in the department of medicine and nodal officer for Covid-19 care centre at JLNMCH. A control room number 0641-2421073 at sadar hospital has also been released by the district health officials for assisting Covid patients and those having Covid symptoms. It may be worth mentioning, according to statistics, the number of corona patients in Bhagalpur district increased to 2,638 (2,030 recovered and 32 deaths) whereas in Banka it increased to 681 (428 recovered and two deaths).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/telemedicine-centre-set-up-at-bpur-hosp/articleshow/77321585.cms||Kumar Rajesh
August 3, 2020||Business||Bandhan promoters to sell 21% for $1.4bn in block deals||MUMBAI: Bandhan Financial Services, the main promoter of Bandhan Bank, has mandated four brokers to jointly sell nearly 21% in the bank, or about 34 crore shares, through block deals on Monday. The deal size could be as much as $1.4 billion (about Rs 10,400 crore), making it the biggest block deal in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) space. According to the term sheet of the deal, the stake is being offered at a floor price of Rs 311 per share, which is at nearly 10% discount to the stock‚Äôs closing price of Rs 345 on Friday on the NSE. Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, JM Financial and J P Morgan have been mandated to manage the deal. The book for the deal opened on Sunday evening and was fully subscribed by late evening, broking sources said. After the deal, promoters‚Äô stake in the bank will be down to about 40%, according to shareholding pattern on the BSE. Under the RBI‚Äôs rules, the main promoting company of a bank should reduce its stake in the lender to a maximum of 40% within three years of starting operations, a condition that the bank had failed to meet despite some serious efforts made by its promoters. From being a microfinance lender, Bandhan transformed itself into a full-fledged bank exactly four years ago. In March 2018, the lender was listed on the bourses and in September that year, the RBI had imposed several restrictions on Bandhan Bank, including a ban on opening new branches since its promoters had failed to comply with the shareholding norms. In January 2019, Bandhan Bank acquired Gruh Finance from HDFC and, post-merger, promoters‚Äô stake was down to 61%. At Rs 10,400 crore, the Bandhan Bank block deal will be ahead of the Rs 10,200-crore deal in HDFC in 2012 in which Citibank was the seller.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bandhan-promoters-to-sell-21-for-1-4bn-in-block-deals/articleshow/77321335.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Business||Companies focus on consumer-connect amid Covid||MUMBAI: The lockdown due to Covid-19 presented a big challenge to several brands and their messaging. People were forced to stay at home. ‚ÄòWalkaroo‚Äô from VKC footwear was all about moving feet. But during the lockdown, the brand had two choices: Either fade into oblivion, or think out-of-the-box and hyper-engage with consumers. It picked the latter and created a digital campaign urging youngsters to remain active by helping around the house and exercising. The brand realised that while the young generation was immobile in one sense, their levels of restless energy would not diminish. Similarly, Byju‚Äôs ‚Äòlive classes‚Äô replicated the ‚Äòclassroom‚Äô environment, which was different from the pre-recorded videos. Nike, on the other hand, gave free access to premium training programmes through its training app. Consumer behaviour, attitudes and belief systems have undergone dramatic changes. Brands have been forced to evolve. Several aspects of marketing are being reversed. Staying relevant is all that matters. Subramanyeswar S, group chief strategy officer at MullenLowe Lintas Group, said consumers would dissect brands more than ever before. This means brands will need to create a meaningful difference in their day-to-day lives. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer about brand loyalty, but consumer loyalty,‚Äù he said. The tenets on which brands are built are no longer valid, he added, adding, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for authentic action, not words. People want brands to be understanding, trusted partners, like a family member.‚Äù From extensive qualitative research, MullenLowe Lintas Group found that the consumer decision-making cycle during such times gets protracted and this opens up hyper possibilities for brands to engage with them. ‚ÄúFrom just comparing, buying and enjoying, as they used to earlier, they‚Äôll now go through multiple stages of researching, comparing, postponing, and even justifying, after the purchase. Hence, brands need to pay equal attention to post-purchase engagement, in addition to the usual pre-purchase and during-purchase engagement,‚Äù said Subramanyeswar. Longitudinal studies done by ITC along with Purple Audacity reveal that consumers are grappling with multiple paradoxes ‚Äî safety versus financial security, or thoughtful spending versus feel-good purchases, for instance. The manifestations of these paradoxes have impacted their choices. Consumers are picking brands providing tangibly superior safety reassurance. At an individual level, a consumer is said to be undergoing polarising emotions at the same time, and is using different coping mechanisms alternatively. A consumer whose salary was cut was now spending thoughtfully, but that has not stopped her from satiating certain food cravings and indulgences. The impact of using a mixed set of coping mechanisms is expected to continue to drive mercurial consumer behaviour. Hemant Malik, divisional chief executive of ITC‚Äôs foods division, said the company‚Äôs recent communication campaigns on Aashirvaad and Yippee, among others, are powered by some of these new consumer trends and insights that have emerged from such longitudinal studies. Another critical change is how value-for-money is not good enough. ‚ÄúDuring the good times, consumers stood by their brands and paid a premium for every new variant or additional feature. They‚Äôll now sacrifice variety or customisation in favour of simplicity. Brands need to go beyond the hype and engage consumers with solutions that fit their needs, as no product is ideal in the current situation. Consumers will not just seek value-for-money but value-for-experience, as that is emotionally reassuring and elevating,‚Äù said Subramanyeswar. Consumer confidence too has hit a roadblock. ‚ÄúAs needs beat wants, sacrifice becomes a part of people‚Äôs vocabulary. Consumers whose bold optimism earlier made them purchase an iPhone even when their salary was one-fourth the cost of the phone, will drastically cut down on spends or postpone purchases. We are seeing them reduce all types of spending by eliminating, postponing, decreasing or substituting purchases,‚Äù said Subramanyeswar. Perfetti Van Melle India, the maker of confectionery brands Centre Fresh and Alpenliebe, lost business as a category as footfalls disappeared from the streets. Gradually, business is limping back to normal. Rajesh Ramakrishnan, MD of Perfetti Van Melle India, said, ‚ÄúConsumers are still gravitating towards brands they trust, but they are paying a lot more emphasis on value. In the past, it was okay for a consumer to pick up larger packs. Now they think twice before buying them. Since we are largely present at Re 1 and Rs 5 price points, our products are being picked up as an affordable treat in these difficult times. The kids at home need to be kept engaged, and our portfolio provides the families those moments of happiness.‚Äù Ramakrishnan said the company is now getting towards 80-85% of pre-Covid level in sales, and is also gearing up for new product launches in the coming months. ‚ÄúLife has to go on. We all need to adapt and recalibrate to the current reality,‚Äù said Ramakrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-focus-on-consumer-connect-amid-covid/articleshow/77321654.cms||Namrata Singh

August 3, 2020||Chandigarh||Govt schools on a new high, as teachers opt for them over pvt ones||Ludhiana: With government schools getting ‚Äòsmarter‚Äô teachers have started enrolling their wards in the them. Three teachers of the Government Senior Secondary School Shahpur have got their wards admitted into government schools. Shahpur school is the first in the state that has maximum number of teachers enrolling their wards in the government schools this year. Mathematics teacher Parveen Akhtar has enrolled her nearly five-year-old daughter Fatima Mariam in pre-primary class at Government Primary School Maksudra. English mistress Rajwinder Kaur has enrolled her three-year-old daughter Japkeerat Kaur at Government Primary School Shahpur and computer faculty teacher Sukhmanjot Kaur has also enrolled her three-year-old daughter Sifat Kaur Bajwa at Government Primary School Shahpur. Rajwinder said, ‚ÄúEducation is the third eye of a man. It aids man to move from darkness to light. My husband and I are government employees and we think that government schools are much better than private schools. Policies like ‚Äòfree and compulsory education‚Äô and education to the girl children are made possible only because of government schools. I am glad my daughter is pursuing her education in a government school. We need to appreciate more the work done by our government schools.‚Äù Sukhmanjot also believes that the quality of education in government schools is better nowadays than CBSE schools. ‚ÄúPre-primary follow the same syllabi, which leading private schools are following. Moreover, I wanted my daughter to get rooted with her own culture. I had studied in a CBSE school and I felt that least attention was paid towards mother tongue. And in government schools I observed students are grounded and rooted. Also, I want her to learn about the co-existence with the children from different financial backgrounds. By this she can learn the ground reality of our society. It is near my work place, so it is also convenient for me. Also, it is free of cost, which means no extra burden of hefty fees and the mid-day meal provided by school is fresh and tasty and her head teacher Baljeet Kaur, a hard working woman, always making sure that everything is neat and clean. Even during lockdown She called us regularly and kept us updated about homework and take oral tests. Actually, it is my principal Davinder Singh Chhina who suggested that I get my daughter admitted in a government school, I am really thankful to him, because I can see visible changes in my daughter. From next academic year, I will definitely get my son admitted in a government school as well.‚Äù Principal Chhina said he is proud that three teachers from his school decided to enrol their wards in government schools. ‚ÄúMy teachers have reposed faith in government schools. This time our schools have witnessed an 11% increase in enrolment than the previous session. Now, we have 187 students and last year there were 168 students. Great results of the school, development of school and online studies of the students are the reasons that students are attracted to government schools from other villages as well. Out of 19 new students, 10 are from private schools.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-schools-on-a-new-high-as-teachers-opt-for-them-over-pvt-ones/articleshow/77322654.cms||Mehak Jain

Mass congregations were prohibited this year due to the full lockdown on Sunday. Apart from this, the usually brimming Noyyal river is dry this year, an unusual sight during Aadi Perukku. The term ‚ÄòPerukku‚Äô itself means brimming and overflowing water bodies due to the monsoon. Officials said the river is dry due to restoration work. A few people still visited Perur ghat of the river and made offerings and prayed. In Salem, banks of the Cauvery were deserted. ‚ÄúEven during drought in the past, we would visit the river bank and make offerings. This is the first time we could not step out,‚Äô‚Äô said K B Rajapathy from Mettur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/aadi-perukku-festival-a-muted-affair/articleshow/77322665.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Coimbatore||Corpn zonal assistant commissioners empowered to give building permit||Coimbatore: The city corporation has delegated the power of providing building and planning permission for buildings up to 2,000 square feet within its limit to the zonal assistant commissioners (ACs). In a letter dated July 31, corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar has said that he has empowered the zonal assistant commissioners with the power to grant the permission for the buildings constructed in 2,000 square feet of land. He, further, bestowed the duty of monitoring the submission of building planning applications, payment of fees among others to the zonal assistant town planning officers (ATPOs). The zonal office was, also, given powers to initiate necessary action against the unauthorized buildings and the buildings that were built with deviation of rules. Until recently, all the powers lay in the hands of the corporation commissioner and the order means that public need not visit the corporation main office at Town Hall for any building related works if the building does not exceed 2,000 square feet. While those seeking permission to construct residential buildings between 2,000 and 7,000 square feet still have to approach the main office, those seeking permission to construct commercial buildings above 2,000 sq ft and residential buildings above 7,000 sq ft have to approach the Local Planning Authority (LPA).Earlier, the public will have to submit the hardcopy of the related documents including land patta, survey document and building plan at the zonal office even though they had uploaded it online. Post which, ATPOs would do field inspection to make sure that the building could be constructed at the available land without any violation. Post which, they would make recommendations to the Town Planning Officer (TPO), who in turn would scrutinize the documents before recommending it to the commissioner for approval. ‚ÄúNow, the ATPOs will be recommending it to the ACs and he, in turn, would grant permissions. It would save a lot of time both to the officials and public,‚Äù said a source privy to the development. Even though the norm says that the approval should be given within 30 days, at times, it would take to 2 to 3 months considering the overload of pending files. Welcoming the move, a city-based activist K Kathirmathiyon said that the move would not just reduce the work burden of the officials but also would help the public in getting the approval on time. Citing the Tamil Nadu combined development and building rules 2019, he said, ‚ÄúThe official who is granting plan approval is the competent authority to issue building completion certificates. So, in this case, the zonal ACs themselves could issue the complete certificates.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-zonal-assistant-commissioners-empowered-to-give-building-permit/articleshow/77322663.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Lucknow||UP: Diyas bring ray of hope, brighten up many lives||LUCKNOW: When over one lakh earthen lamps are lit in Ayodhya on August 5 to mark 'bhoomi pujan' of much awaited construction of Ram Temple, the occasion would also brighten up lives of 10 members of a self-help group (SHG) at Devai gram in the temple town. Reason: the state government has ordered procurement of nearly 80,000 earthen lamps from the SHG. Known as ‚ÄòPrajapati Swayam Sahayata Samuh‚Äô, the SHG was constituted nearly five months after BJP came to power in UP in 2017. Prajapati is a caste which forms a large chunk of people from the Kumhar (potter) community. According to officials in the rural development department, the financial status of the SHG was dismal and needed a fillip from the state government, especially after novelcoronavirus induced lockdown. ‚ÄúAfter constituting the group, its members started manufacturing diyas,‚Äù said mission director, state rural livelihood mission (SRLM), Sujit Kumar, confirming that the group has been given the order to manufacture 80,000 earthen lamps for August 5 function, which is scheduled to be attended by PM Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. As the time progressed the SHG was in a position to supply earthen lamps in large quantities. As a matter of fact, things started changing for this SHG in 2019 itself when the group received an order to make 90,000 earthen lamps which had to be lit up in ‚ÄòDev Deepawali‚Äô in Ayodhya. The group purchased an electric potter wheel to meet the target. The order, sources in the rural development department said, fetched over Rs 1.25 lakh to the group. ‚ÄúThis not only raised the morale of its members, but also improved the financial condition of the group,‚Äù an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/diyas-bring-ray-of-hope-brighten-up-many-lives/articleshow/77323075.cms||Pankaj Shah
August 3, 2020||Chennai||Dengue awareness: Chennai corporation tells those with fever to visit camps||CHENNAI: Though only around five dengue cases have been recorded in the city in July, Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has instructed its field workers to give special instructions to houses with kids to take all possible precautions to prevent mosquito breeding. In case symptoms such as high fever are seen, the child should be rushed to the nearest fever clinic without delay. The instructions were issued after a child in Adambakkam in Alandur zone died of dengue around 10 days ago. GCC sources said the report submitted to them said the girl was intially self-medicated for fever and there was a delay in taking her to a hospital. The family had not taken her to a fever clinic conducted by GCC either, a senior GCC official said. GCC has already deployed malaria workers to conduct inspections at vulnerable spots in the city. In addition, door-to-door survey workers have also been asked to instruct residents to avoid storing water in drums or other containers which could lead to breeding of mosquitoes, GCC sources said. The real impact of dengue will not be felt as hospitals are focussed on Covid-19 duty and those that aren‚Äôt, are unwilling to take in many regular patients, a GCC official said. ‚ÄúSchools continue to remain shut and children will be home. So if there is dengue breeding in the neighbourhood or the house, they are at a higher risk. That is why parents should take note of fever, other symptoms,‚Äù a senior official said. Awareness campaigns have also begun, especially through the newly revamped social media profiles of the civic body. The posts tell residents to avoid storing water in open wells and drums and to cover them if needed, dump water that collects, stagnates on waste sites, coconut shells and also properly dispose of the waste in dustbins. Fogging larvicides in vulnerable areas will also start in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dengue-awareness-corpn-tells-those-with-fever-to-visit-camps/articleshow/77321672.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Kochi||A Good Samaritan grieves child‚Äôs death||Kochi: To Babu Varghese, an autodriver in Aluva, 3-year-old Prithviraj, who swallowed a coin and later died, was a stranger till Saturday morning. However, on Sunday he was crying his heart out on hearing of the child‚Äôs death. If not for Varghese, the mother would have been sent back without her child being admitted to Alappuzha medical college, and left stranded with no help on Saturday night. On Saturday morning, Varghese came across the family near Aluva government hospital. The family hired him to return home in Kadungalloor as doctors told them to wait for the coin to pass on its own. ‚ÄúThe mother told me that the doctor sent them home after an x-ray saying that it would naturally pass. However, she also told me that the doctor said that they should take the child to some other doctor. Hearing this, I got worried and insisted on a second opinion at general hospital, Ernakulam, and I took them there,‚Äù Varghese said. When the family was waiting for diagnosis at Ernakulam general hospital, Varghese realised that the family was penniless and took the child and bought him snacks. ‚ÄúHe was on my shoulders, playing with me. Such an active boy he was. When doctors referred them to Alappuzha medical college, I told them that the family was poor. So they graciously arranged a free ambulance,‚Äù said Varghese. He gave the family Rs 500 before sending them off in the ambulance. Around 7pm, Varghese got a call, saying that the child was sent away from the medical college too. ‚ÄúI offered to pick them up. It was raining heavily, and I dropped them at their house at around 12:45pm,‚Äù said Varghese. Udayan, the child‚Äôs relative, said, ‚ÄúThe child had some discomfort in the night. By morning, his condition worsened. He was taken to hospital at around 6am and 10 minutes later he died. The autodriver and other patients there know that the child was not given the care he deserved.‚Äù Varghese, meanwhile, said that he was not ready to accept the technical explanations of doctors. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt accept that it was not possible to keep the child overnight at the medical college. Even if the death was not due the coin, what was the hurry to send them home. Had they kept him in observation for 12 hours, he would have been alive now. Had it been a wealthy family they would have taken the child to a private hospital and waited for the coin to pass. The economically weak like us rely on government hospitals and this is the treatment we get. I was shattered when I heard the news,‚Äù said Varghese. Varghese has a daughter who sustained an accident last year, thus making it impossible to walk on her own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-good-samaritan-grieves-childs-death/articleshow/77320518.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Ahmedabad||Pocso accused gets bail to marry survivor in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: A sessions court at the Mirzapur rural court campus granted regular bail to a 26-year-old Pocso accused so that he could wed the victim with much fanfare. This was the request not only from the accused, but from the survivor and her family too. In this case, the accused and the girl, both residents of Shantipura village in the outskirts of Ahmedabad, eloped in 2017. The girl was a minor then. Her father lodged an FIR. The man was booked for abduction, molestation, rape under Indian Penal Code as well as under provisions of Protection of Children From Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The couple returned few months ago during the lockdown and the accused was arrested on the basis of the FIR registered by the girl‚Äôs father. However, the situation changed in three years. The families of the accused and the survivor settled the dispute and decided to arrange a wedding for them with traditional celebration. The accused filed a bail plea and the girl and her father too filed an affidavit. They submitted before the court that it was not a case of abduction and rape, but they were in love and they lived together as husband and wife. They even got married by performing religious rituals, but since the rituals took place during the lockdown period, it was a simple wedding. But, now since the differences between the families have been resolved, the accused may be released on bail so that the families could arrange the wedding again according to the social tradition with much fanfare. The state government opposed the bail plea citing gravity of charges. But the court said that the victim was missing for a long time. She is adult now. The affidavit suggested that a compromise has taken place, and the victim and her father have no issue if the accused is released on bail. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pocso-accused-gets-bail-to-marry-survivor/articleshow/77321701.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Coimbatore||Cops arrest three over death of Lankan gangster||COIMBATORE: Sri Lankan underworld kingpin Maddumage Chandana Lasantha Perera alias Angoda Lokka was living in Coimbatore in disguise till he died under questionable circumstances on July 3, police have found. A Sri Lankan who was living with Lokka in Coimbatore, a woman from Madurai and a man from Tirupur who helped him obtain Aadhaar card were arrested on Sunday. Almost a month after his death, the probe by the Coimbatore police has put to rest speculations over Lokka‚Äôs whereabouts. There were rumours that Lokka was feigning his death so that he could move around in disguise. According to police, Angoda Lokka was wanted in Sri Lanka for multiple offences. In the wake of a spate of killings in the island nation between Lokka and his rival gangs, he went underground since 2017. Police are yet to find when Lokka came to India or Coimbatore, but he has been living in Cheran Managar for the past few months along with Amani Dhanji, 27 of Colombo. ‚ÄúLokka had obtained an Aadhaar card with a fake identity as R Pradeep Singh, age 35,‚Äô‚Äô a police officer said. Lokka had obtained Aadhaar card with the help of T Sivakami Sundari, 36, from Madurai and S Dhiyanesawaran, 32, from Tirupur. Amani, Sivakami Sundari and Dhiyanesawaran have been arrested. They were booked under 10 counts including criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, impersonation, giving false information and harbouring an offender. On July 3, Amani Dhanji brought Angoda Lokka to a private hospital in an unconscious state where doctors declared him to dead and informed police. The dead body was sent to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem. When police sought details of the deceased at CMCH, Sivakami Sundari told the Peelamedu police it was Pradeep, her relative. The body was handed over to her. Sundari and Amani took the body to Madurai and cremated there. Since July 3, the day ‚ÄòPradeep‚Äô died, gangsters in Colombo lost contact with Lokka. The information was leaked to the Sri Lankan police, who approached Coimbatore police. Simultaneously, Sri Lankan media started reporting that Lokka was cremated in Coimbatore on July and that one of his sisters was made to see his body through a video call by his associates here. Though a postmortem was done, police said the cause of death could be ascertained for sure only after a thorough lab test. ‚ÄúThe samples were sent to the regional forensic science laboratory. Only after toxicology report comes, cause of the dead could be ascertained,‚Äù said a senior police officer. Questions over the cause of death remain unanswered, and police do not rule out murder. During the probe, Amani Dhanji denied poisoning Lokka, police said. According to a statement, Amani said that Lokka developed chest pain and collapsed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lankan-gangster-was-hiding-in-coimbatore-till-his-death-cops/articleshow/77322667.cms||A Subburaj

On the eve of Rakshabandhan, several women in Amreli, tied ‚Äòrakhi‚Äô not with a promise to get protection but to protect. Women affiliated with Bal Bhavan tied ‚Äòrakhi‚Äô to several trees considering them as their brothers. However, the women promised to protect the trees. The unique celebration of Rakshabandhan was organized by Bal Bhavan and Community Science Centre where forest officials were also present. The celebration was inspired by state government‚Äôs Gujarat Council on Science and Technology and the several ‚Äòrakhi‚Äô which were tied also bore their logo. Students who participated by maintaining social distance took pledge for protection and conservation of environment. ‚ÄúTrees are very necessary as they are the only source of oxygen on our planet. Currently, in the times of pandemic, people have realized how important oxygen is so trees should be given importance,‚Äù said Nilesh Pathak, director of Bal Bhavan. He added that this was the first such event where trees were made brother and the women tied ‚Äòrakhi‚Äô around their stem for their protection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/women-in-amreli-bond-with-trees-promise-to-protect-green-cover/articleshow/77320363.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Chennai||Chennai: Anna University develops early Covid-19 alert device||CHENNAI: Researchers from Anna University have developed a Covid-19 early warning system to help those at risk by monitoring their vital parameters such as temperature, oxygen saturation rate, heart rate and respiratory rate. This low-cost wearable health device sends the data to a server for analysis. The server uses a machine learning algorithm to calculate scores for each user and classify them according to their health conditions. If there are any abnormal variations in these biomarkers, the system generates an alarm so that the user can immediately consult doctors. ‚ÄúBy this approach, we can reduce the number of deaths due to Covid-19,‚Äù says K Rathnakannan, an associate professor of the department of electrical and electronics engineering in Anna University. He and his students of embedded systems technology have developed the low-cost smart wearable health device (SWHD). Based on machine learning algorithms, each of the four measurements will be converted on a scale of 0 to 3 developed by Royal College of Physicians in the UK. ‚ÄúIf the cumulative score is above 7, the smart device will recommend a RT-PCR test,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIn a hospital environment, without compromising social distance, doctors and nurses can monitor the health conditions of the admitted patient from a relatively safe distance,‚Äù he said. The team also developed an app for doctors to enable them to monitor up to 20 patients on their phone. ‚ÄúIt will reduce the stress level and burden of the doctors and nurses,‚Äù he said. The team is now preparing to test the device at city hospitals. Anna University vice-chancellor M K Surappa said the device would be useful to the general public as people will be alerted early about any symptoms. ‚ÄúWe want to conduct further tests at hospitals to validate the results. It could spur the development of many such devices in future,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/anna-univ-develops-early-covid-19-alert-device/articleshow/77321705.cms||A Ragu Raman
August 3, 2020||Delhi||18 vehicle scrapping units closed in Southwest Delhi||NEW DELHI: As many as 18 vehicle scrapping units have been closed in Nangli and Dhichaon Kalan areas in Southwest Delhi. ‚ÄúDelhi Pollution Control Committee had earlier issued directions to ensure the closure of unauthorised units, which were causing air pollution in the areas,‚Äù said a municipal official. Meanwhile, local enforcement teams of municipal corporations have been directed to keep an eye on illegal vehicle scrapping units cropping up because of the closure of the Mayapuri market. ‚ÄúA joint survey of the Nangli Sakrawati area was conducted to find out the scale of the problem. Raids were carried out in two phases by teams comprising officials from BSES, DJB, DPCC and the south corporation. The power and water connections of all the 18 units have been snapped,‚Äù the official added. The pollution control committee has also issued showcause notice to owners of all the 18 units for levying environment compensation, while prosecution has been launched under Air and Water (prevention of pollution) Act. Experts, however, say that in absence of a proper scrappage policy on ‚Äòend-of-life‚Äô vehicles, such illegal units will continue to mushroom. Last year, DPCC had written to the authorities stating that polluting units that were shuttered by the committee in Mayapuri might have shifted to other non-conforming localities. The areas of concern were west, northwest and northeast districts. ‚ÄúInformation has been gathered that several illegal vehicle dismantling units, which have stopped their activities in Mayapuri Industrial Area, Phase-II, are trying to resume their illegal activities in Matiala, Najafgarh, Karawal Nagar and Kanjhawala,‚Äù the letter had stated. DPCC had fined 122 polluting industrial units and issued closure notices to 41 others at Mayapuri then. Of the 122 units, 108 had paid a total fine of Rs 3.4 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/18-vehicle-scrapping-units-closed-in-sw-delhi/articleshow/77338310.cms||Paras Singh

August 3, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Kodiyeri Balakrishnan gets open invite to join RSS||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP spokesperson B Gopalakrishnan has invited CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan to RSS. The open invite comes as part of the tit-for-tat statements made by leaders to establish who stands closer to RSS and who keeps a clear distance from the Sangh. ‚ÄúKodiyeri Balakrishnan was most welcome to join RSS. It would help him do penance for all the anti-national activities, allegedly done by him so far,‚Äù Gopalakrishnan said. It would also help him clear doubts whether to turn to India or China, he added. Accusing one another for being closer or in the good books of RSS is one of the common political slurs used against one another by leaders of communist, Marxist party and Congress in the state. In the latest such live episode, Balakrishnan termed opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala as the new darling of RSS, only to invite the trite counter allegation from the Congress camp that it was chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who had struck a quid pro quo deal with RSS when he fought an election in the 1970s. As usual, second line leaders in both the parties have picked a fight, probing the political lineage of leaders in both parties. Referring to reports that CPM politburo member S R Ramachandran Pillai was an RSS worker during his school days, Gopalakrishnan said an opportunity was awaiting Kodiyeri to live a value-based life like that of Pillai by joining RSS. ‚ÄúSince SRP has proudly said that he had been an RSS man in the past, it would inspire other members in AKG Centre. RSS point of view is, it‚Äôs an ensemble of those who are presently with it and others who are to be with it in future,‚Äù Gopalakrishnan said. On Saturday, BJP state president K Surendran had said that RSS was not looking for someone from Congress to assume charge of RSS sarsangh chalak. Gopalakrishnan had hit the headlines in the past for his comment that had Gandhiji been alive in the present world, he would have joined RSS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kodiyeri-gets-an-open-invite-to-rss/articleshow/77320548.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Mumbai||‚ÄòPharma co expenses towards freebies for docs can be claimed as biz deductions‚Äô||Mumbai: Tax issues surrounding the ‚Äònexus‚Äô, between pharma companies and doctors, where the latter are sponsored for conferences, at times replete with sightseeing and gala dinners, or expensive gifts, refuse to die down. Judicial precedents, in several cases, have been in favour of pharma companies with the costs relating to such freebies being allowed as business deductions. The Mumbai bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) recently passed an order in favour of Medley Pharmaceuticals, an Andheri based company. The crux of the tax issue dealt with re-opening of the assessment for the financial year 2011-12, owing to a change of opinion by the succeeding I-T officer. Based on legal technicalities such as no fresh ground material available on record, the re-opening was quashed by the ITAT. However, the ITAT also went on to analyse the allowability of sales promotion expenses aggregating to Rs 6.2 crore for the pharma company. A break-up showed that Rs 2.4 crore was towards product reminders; conference expenses and travel costs ran into Rs 2.7 crore and additional doctors‚Äô expenses were of Rs 1.1 crore. The ITAT made some pertinent observations regarding the code of conduct issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI) and a circular issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). It said that the MCI code of conduct, which debars freebies, is meant to be followed by the medical fraternity alone and does not apply to pharma companies. Amended on December 10, 2009, the code prohibits medical practitioners and their professional associations from taking any gift, travel facility, hospitality, cash or monetary grant from the pharmaceutical and allied health sector industries. The CBDT circular dated August 1, 2012 says that any expense in providing freebies in violation of the Medical Council‚Äôs code shall not be allowed as a business deduction. ‚ÄúWe are further of the considered view, that even otherwise, the enlargement of the scope of MCI regulation to the pharmaceutical companies by the CBDT is de hors any enabling provision either under the I-T Act or under the Indian Medical Council Regulations,‚Äù stated the ITAT. As the code of conduct itself does not cover pharma companies, they cannot be debarred from claiming expenses incurred in this regard (towards freebies), it observed. Some other earlier judicial decisions, including that of Mumbai ITAT‚Äôs, have adopted a similar stand. The ITAT also examined an alternative contention, and held that a circular which imposes a burden on the taxpayer can only apply prospectively. Thus, this circular would not apply to the financial year covered by the litigation heard by it. BOX: What the ITAT observed: 1. The code of conduct laid down by the Medical Council of India does not cover pharma companies 2. CBDT‚Äôs circular denies deductibility of expenditure, which violates the code of conduct, and pharma companies are not covered by it 3. CBDT‚Äôs circular cannot have a retrospective effect 4. Expenditure incurred by a pharma company towards ‚Äòfreebies‚Äô can be claimed as a business expense||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pharma-co-expenses-towards-freebies-for-docs-can-be-claimed-as-biz-deductions/articleshow/77322723.cms||---

According to top officials privy to the information, the customs department has found enough evidence against the accused to invoke the acts so that actions, including attachment of property and awarding of detention, can be initiated against the accused. However, the acts would only be invoked at later stages of investigation, sources said. Cofeposa would enable customs to impose preventive detention against the accused for purposes of conservation and augmentation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities while Safema enables them to conduct the forfeiture of illegally acquired properties of smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators. Top sources said customs is in the process of making a foolproof case so that maximum punishment can be awarded to the smuggling syndicate. ‚ÄúWe would be making a report that will be foolproof and can pass the test of any regulatory body, including the Cofeposa board. For this, details of their assets and the depth of their involvement in the smuggling would be assessed,‚Äù said an official. Customs are pushing for a quick extradition of Faisal Fareed and Rabins Hammed based in Dubai. ‚ÄúWe are trying to get a red-corner notice issued as early as possible so that they can be brought back to the country.

August 3, 2020||Coimbatore||Allow us to kill crop-raiding wild boars: Nilgiris farmers||UDHAGAMANDALAM: Farmers in the district are disappointed over the state government not extending the permission to shoot and kill wild boars that cause crop damage to the Nilgiris forest division. Pointing out that wild boar menace was more in hilly areas, they urged the state to include the Nilgiris in the government order that allows forest officials in the nine forest divisions in the state to shoot and kill wild boars that raid farmlands. The government order on culling wild boars came following a public interest litigation seeking court‚Äôs direction to the state to take immediate steps to control wild boar population, which was on the rise, and protect farmlands from the animal raid. The government order dated June 4 allows forest officials in forest divisions of Thiruvannamalai, Thirupathur, Vellore, Hosur, Coimbatore, Madurai, Salem, Hasanur and Sathyamangalam to kill wild boars that raid farmlands. According to the NGO Nellikolu Trust, which focuses on farming in the hill district, the Nilgiris has been experiencing wild boar menace for the past several decades. ‚ÄúWe wonder how the hill district, which sees a lot of farming activities, was left out in the government order. Wild boar menace is yet to be curtailed in the district. We request the government to bring the Nilgiris in the ambit of the order that allows culling of wild boars,‚Äù a representative of the trust said. Guru Swamy Baddal, district forest officer, said they used to receive many complaints from farmers regarding wild boar menace, which seems to be comparatively less this year. According to him, the district has been facing more problems with monkeys, gaurs and leopards. ‚ÄúThe permission to cull wild boars is granted on a trial basis. However, we will write to the government to include the Nilgiris forest division in the order and grant permission to cull wild boars causing menace,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/allow-us-to-kill-crop-raiding-wild-boars-nilgiris-farmers/articleshow/77322688.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan

August 3, 2020||Aurangabad||Approach us directly: HC to people with Covid-related grievances||Aurangabad: In an unprecedented move, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has said that the public can approach it directly to raise grievances against government authorities, private hospitals or others in issues related to Covid-19 care/treatment or management. Referring to reports of lapses in pandemic management in some districts that come under its jurisdiction, the court said the affected individuals may give their grievances in writing either by post or email or through an advocate. The two-member bench of Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar, during the latest hearing on criminal suo motu public interest litigation (PIL), has listed out six broad categories under which people can lodge their complaints. It includes grievances related to no supply of necessary items within containment zones, no supply of ration at fair price shops, absence of a centre created where the infected persons or their relatives can go to get hospital admissions, officers or authority not helping in getting admissions, hospital refusing admissions and doubts that necessary treatment was not given and the medicines and injections which are supplied by them or government were not actually utilized by the doctors. ‚ÄúCare is to be taken by these persons (complainants) to see that every complaint or grievance is supported by an affidavit which can be sworn in before the superintendent of the district court or assistant superintendent of tehsil court or even before the notary public. This Court will consider those complaints for taking action against the concerned,‚Äù judges said. The court once again asserted that it has taken suo motu cognizance to see that all authorities from all the districts which are under its jurisdiction ‚Äúbecome active and they remain active till the virus is active.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis Court expects that every order made by this Court is communicated to the authorities from all the districts which are under the jurisdiction of this Court. These orders need to be communicated to private institutions like private hospitals as action can be taken against them under the provisions of Special Enactments,‚Äù the court said. Reflecting upon its earlier order, the court said it wants affidavit of all the authorities to show that there is installation of CCTV systems in isolation centres and private hospitals where treatment is offered for Covid-19. The judges also appreciated the initiative taken by Aurangabad municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey to carry out large-scale antigen testing for Covid-19 during the nine-day curfew imposed in July. The court has scheduled the next hearing on the suo motu PIL on August 4, where government agencies are expected to submit necessary affidavits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/approach-us-directly-hc-to-people-with-covid-related-grievances/articleshow/77322721.cms||Prasad Joshi

August 3, 2020||Kozhikode||Notice to probe officer in Nileshwaram Pocso case for not registering case against the doctors||Kozhikode: Kasaragod district judge has issued a show-cause notice to the investigating officer in Nileshwaram sexual-abuse case for not registering a case against the doctors who did medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) on the survivor. The judge, who is also the chairman of juvenile justice committee, said there is a dereliction of duty on the part of the police officer. The 16-year-old girl was allegedly sexually abused by her father along with five other men over two years. In the notice issued to the circle inspector of Nileshwaram police station on August 1, the judge said: ‚ÄúTwo medical practitioners had examined the victim and confirmed that she was pregnant. Therefore, the two doctors were aware that she became pregnant while she was a juvenile.‚Äù The judge said as per Section 20 (1) of Pocso Act, any person who is aware of the commission of an offence should report it to the authorities, failing which the person is liable for imprisonment up to six months or imposed a fine. ‚ÄúThe two medical practitioners were duty-bound to inform police regarding the crime then and there,‚Äù the notice said. The judge asked the officer to explain his action within three days as to why disciplinary action should not be initiated against him. The accused in the case, including the father of the girl, was arrested on July 19 after the girl told the police that she was continuously abused for two years. The girl had also stated that MTP was carried out on her. Two days ago, police had unearthed the foetus from the premises of the house where it was buried. ‚ÄúThere is a serious lapse on the part of police not to register a case against the doctors. The girl was first subjected to scanning by a doctor who administered some medicine on her,‚Äù said C Shukkur, former government pleader, Kasaragod. ‚ÄúShe was later admitted to a hospital after she started bleeding and MTP was done on her by another doctor. The doctors should have informed police about the pregnancy,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/notice-to-probe-officer-in-nileshwaram-pocso-case-for-not-registering-case-against-the-doctors/articleshow/77320592.cms||---

August 3, 2020||India||Govt: 1 crore migrants back home, just 2.4 lakh outside||NEW DELHI: Close to one crore migrant workers have reached their home states since the coronavirus-induced lockdown was imposed across the country, and only 2.4 lakh migrants remain outside, new Union labour ministry data suggests. The data, released by the chief labour commissioner on July 16, bases its calculations on information provided by only 25 out of 36 state governments and Union Territories administrations, who updated information about migrant workers and shared the details. This is only the second time the Union labour ministry has released migrants‚Äô information since May, when the government launched a ‚ÄòNational Migrant Information System‚Äô under which it directed all states to register migrants‚Äô details on the online portal. States like Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, which are understood to account for sizeable populations of migrant workers, have not shared any updated data. Even though the chief labour commissioner had sought exhaustive information about the migrants inlcuding their names, age, mobile numbers, occupation, details of migrants‚Äô current and native address, bank, Ujjwala and Aadhaar details of workers, the data available in public domain remains sketchy and limited to those who have returned home and those who have stayed back in destination states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-1-crore-migrants-back-home-just-2-4-lakh-outside/articleshow/77323366.cms||Swati Mathur
August 3, 2020||Ahmedabad||PSI moves Gujarat HC for bail in graft case||AHMEDABAD: Suspended police sub-inspector Shweta Jadeja has approached the Gujarat high court for bail after a sessions court last month denied her regular bail in connection with a graft case. Jadeja has sought bail claiming her innocence; saying that her incarceration would damage her reputation at her native village; she would abide by all bail condition; and she has highlighted infirmities in accusations mentioned in the FIR related to payments. Jadeja has also claimed that the complainant against her, Kenil Shah, who is an accused in a rape case, had in the past tried to coerce the victim to extract suitable statement. However, the Supreme Court‚Äôs intervention thwarted his efforts to get the FIR quashed. Her bail plea is likely to be heard by the HC next week. While opposing her bail plea, the city crime branch had submitted before the sessions court that the preliminary investigations revealed that there were three transactions that had taken place and the accused PSI had also purchased a mobile phone, for which complainant Kenil Shah‚Äôs security in-charge had paid from his credit card. Jadeja was arrested last month after the police received complaint against her that she had already extorted Rs 20 lakh in February and Rs 15 lakh recently from the complainant for sparing him from PASA charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/psi-moves-hc-for-bail-in-graft-case/articleshow/77321796.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Chandigarh||No talks, just start work: Haryana oppn||Chandigarh: As the Supreme Court (SC) has asked the political heads of Punjab and Haryana to put their heads together to resolve the unending dispute of Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, the apex court‚Äôs observations have once again added some warmth in this nearly five-decade-old dispute. As per the observations made by the SC on July 28, both the states should hold talks at the highest political level for an amicable settlement of the issue. However, the senior political leaders of all the opposition parties in the state of Haryana are against any kind of talks with Punjab. According to them there is no need to talk, when the apex court has already given its verdict in Haryana‚Äôs favour and directed for completion of construction work under supervision of central agencies. While talking to TOI on the issue, leader of opposition in Haryana assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the state should not enter into any kind of negotiations on the issue, as SC had already decided in Haryana‚Äôs favour. ‚ÄúThere is no point of discussion at this stage. Haryana should not agree on anything less than implementation of SC verdict,‚Äù the former CM said. Senior INLD leader Abhay Chautala said had the state government been serious on the issue, the work of SYL would have been completed much earlier. ‚ÄúI firmly believe that the Haryana CM should show a tough stand and should not accept anything less than starting of construction activities of SYL canal. Unfortunately, the Haryana CM could not even meet the Prime Minister in the past five years on the issue. Rather he had de-notified the Dadupur-Nalvi canal, which was a major source to recharge groundwater,‚Äù Abhay added. The Haryana CM should ask the Centre for military or paramilitary for completion of the SYL canal, he added. President of Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), ruling alliance partner, Nishan Singh said their party‚Äôs stand on SYL from Day 1 was that there should be no compromise on Haryana‚Äôs share of SYL water. The dispute between Punjab and Haryana on water sharing has been pending before the apex court since 1996. The SC has passed several directions to construct the 212-km canal that was to link Satluj in Punjab to Yamuna in Haryana. While Haryana has completed its portion, the dispute started after Punjab stopped construction on its side. BJP state president O P Dhankhar said he welcomed the Supreme Court offer to negotiate on SYL issue between the governments of both states. Dhankhar said Haryana Government was eagerly waiting for Punjab chief minister Amrinder Singh to show big heart and give the rightful share of the water as per the agreement. There was no delay on the part of the Haryana government for holding dialogues, he said, adding that resolving the issue through dialogue would increase the stature of Capt Amrinder Singh as well||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-talks-just-start-work-haryana-oppn/articleshow/77322738.cms||Ajay Sura

August 3, 2020||Kochi||Gold demand slips, yet why prices rising?||During the first half of this year, global demand for gold was down 6% on an annual basis at 2,076 tonnes due to the pandemic. However, during the same period, price of the yellow metal was up by 17% in US dollar terms. So, how did the price shoot up even with weak demand? Perhaps the best explanation was offered in a recent report of the World Gold Council (WGC), the global marketing arm of gold producers: ‚ÄúThe global response to the pandemic by central banks and governments, in the form of rate cuts and massive liquidity injections, fuelled record flows of 734t into gold-backed ETFs (gold ETFs). These flows helped lift the gold price, which gained 17% in US dollar terms over the first half, hitting record highs in many other currencies.‚Äù How far will prices rise? The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) price of a troy ounce (31.1gm) of 24-carat gold was US$1,974.70 on Friday morning. ‚ÄúLooking at the current trend, LBMA prices might range from $2,300 ‚Äì$2,400 in the next three to six months. In the long term as well, gold prices are looking up,‚Äù said T B Ramakrishnan, managing director and chief executive officer of Sharewealth Securities Ltd. ‚ÄúPrices are fuelled by the ‚Äòsafe-haven‚Äô demand for gold, as investors ‚Äì individuals, institutions or central banks ‚Äì have been increasingly investing in gold. During the last two to three years, the central banks of India and China have increased their gold holdings. Russia doubled it. Apart from the demand from investors and central banks, dwindling supply also helped the prices go up,‚Äù he said. Extrapolating the estimates of LBMA price, if gold prices continue with the same momentum in the short term, prices in Kerala might go up to Rs 46,000-Rs 48,000 per 8gm sovereign (22 carats) the next three to six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gold-demand-slips-yet-why-prices-rising/articleshow/77320616.cms||Shenoy Karun

August 3, 2020||Chandigarh||Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar opens 10 women‚Äôs colleges today, Baroda gets 2||CHANDIGARH: Ahead of the by-election in Baroda assembly constituency, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will on Monday inaugurate two women‚Äôs colleges here ‚Äî one in Bhainswal Kalan village and the other in proper Baroda. The move is also being seen as yet another attempt to make a dent in former CM Bhupinder Hooda and his son Deepender Hooda‚Äôs bastion. These two colleges are among the 10 new government women‚Äôs colleges that Khattar will inaugurate online as gift to the girls of the state on Raksha Bandhan. Incidentally, there has been a long-pending demand for girls‚Äô colleges in this area, as those keen on studies have travel to Gohana or Sonipat for the purpose. Although the government as well BJP leaders termed the move a routine affair and denied it has to do anything with the impending Baroda by-election, the Congress leaders alleged the ruling party is indulging in ‚Äúpolitics of education‚Äù. ‚ÄúThese gimmicks would not work for them. People have already made up their mind. So far as the colleges are concerned, everyone knows the contributions of Congress as well Krishan Moorti Hooda ji, Bhupinder Hooda and Deepender Hooda,‚Äô‚Äô said Geeta Bhukkal, former minister and MLA from Jhajjar constituency. ‚ÄúThey have not given colleges to many other constituencies and two to this constituency, which will run in borrowed buildings. So, you can well imagine the intention of the ruling BJP-JJP alliance,‚Äù she added. Meanwhile, higher education department officials confirmed the development and informed that all the arrangements have been made and the colleges would become operational from the current academic session itself. The other places where colleges will be inaugurated are Chhatar village in Uchana Kalan, Agroha in Hisar, Goriwala in Sirsa, Isserwal in Bhiwani, Morni Hills of Panchkula, Partap Nagar in Yamuanangar, Ladana Chaku village in Kaithal and Firozpur Jhirka of Nuh. A day prior to the inauguration, Khattar also held online interactions with around 500 women and girls across the state. A group of orphan girls also called on Khattar at his Chandigarh residence to tie the sacred thread on the eve of Raksha Bandhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khattar-opens-10-womens-colleges-today-baroda-gets-2/articleshow/77322759.cms||Manvir Saini

August 3, 2020||Chandigarh||Will protect state‚Äôs claims, say all parties in Punjab||Chandigarh: The Supreme Court asked the chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana last week to attempt a negotiated settlement of the Satluj-Yamuna link (SYL) canal issue that has defied any solution for decades, despite several rounds of litigation. However, most political parties in Punjab support the view that the state has no surplus water to share. Congress MP from Patiala Preneet Kaur said, ‚ÄúCongress has always stood for protecting the rights of the state and it was Captain Amarinder Singh as chief minister during his previous term who passed the Punjab Termination of Agreement Act 2004 to prevent any state waters being shared with neighbouring states. Our party has been firm in protecting the state‚Äôs rights over its waters and will fight tooth and nail if any attempt is made by the states or the Union to deprive us of what is rightfully ours.‚Äù Reacting to Haryana BJP unit president OP Dhankhar‚Äôs statement on the apex court‚Äôs directions on the SYL case, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar said Haryana can‚Äôt claim right over river water as per riparian principle. ‚ÄúPunjab‚Äôs first responsibility is towards its own people, particularly its farmers, and it is unfortunately not in a position to share its limited water resource with other states,‚Äù he said. With his own party at the helm in Haryana, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said the interests of Punjab farmers and Punjabis should be put at the forefront while engaging into talks with neighbouring states over the project. ‚ÄúThere should not be any second thoughts when it comes to protecting the rights of the Punjab farmers and the Punjabis as a whole. We need to protect the rights of Punjab farmers over the use of canal water but both states must speak in constructive manner as per the directions of the Supreme Court. As the matter is subjudice and the Supreme Court has asked the states to engage in dialogue I will not speak more on it,‚Äù said Sharma. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema added: ‚ÄúOur stand on the issue is very clear that the state cannot share even a single drop of water with any other state. But one must look into the reasons for the SYL issue to have come thus far. We must examine who gave the approvals for the SYL project to be initiated in the first place and who has been playing politics over the issue. It is the wrong policies adopted by the Congress and the SAD which has brought the SYL issue to its present situation.‚Äù SAD (D) functionary Parminder Singh Dhindsa said Punjab had only one major natural resource, which was primary for the survival and the existence of the state. ‚ÄúAll other states with natural resources, be it coal of any metal, sell these resources. but in case of Punjab water is being given free to the other states. The clause in the agreement under which water was shared with Rajasthan, it is clearly mentioned that appropriate compensation for punjab will be decided at a later stage. But to date the state has not received even a single penny‚Äù The former finance minister added, ‚ÄúThe subsoil water is going down and Punjab is totally dependent on the surface water to sustain its existence. Under these circumstances the state cannot share even a single drop of water with any neighbouring state. It will be a complete injustice to the state if this happens. Even under the riparian laws that are accepted across the globe Punjab has full rights over the waters flowing from its territory.‚Äù (With inputs from Patiala and Bathinda)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-protect-states-claims-say-all-parties-in-punjab/articleshow/77322740.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Nagpur||‚ÄòLapses in safety procedure caused explosion killing 5 workers‚Äô||Nagpur: The preliminary investigation by the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health has revealed the explosion which killed five labourers on the spot was caused by serious lapses in safety procedures at Manas Agro Industries and Infrastructure Limited, erstwhile Purti Power and Sugar Limited. Bela police have registered offences against Nashik-based SP Engineering, and Wadgaon-based contractor Sanjay Ingale. No action has been initiated on Manas Agro.An explosion in the bio-digester in the sugar and ethanol manufacturing plant of Manas Agro at Bela in Umred tehsil had killed five labourers on the spot at 2.15pm on Saturday. The funeral of the five labourers, residents of Wadgaon and Salai villages, was held on Sunday.Bela police station PI Shivaji Bhandwalkar told TOI, ‚ÄúAn offence under section 304(a) of IPC was registered against SP Engineering, which was doing the maintenance work. Also, Sanjay Ingale has been booked, as he had engaged the labourers.‚ÄùAsked about any action on Manas Agro, Bhandwalkar said, ‚ÄúIt was the responsibility of contractors to ensure safety in work and also of labourers. Further investigation is on.‚ÄùSP Rakesh Ola said, ‚ÄúDocumentary evidence, including agreement between the company (Manas Agro) and contractor, will be collected. We will also seek reports from experts in industrial safety and health; and factory inspectors before arriving at any conclusions regarding fixing of responsibility behind the incident. Subsequently, as per the need, we would try to make arrests and put the accused through the necessary interrogation processes.‚ÄùUmred MLA Raju Parwe said offence should have been also registered against Manas Agro for not following standard operating procedures. ‚ÄúManas Agro has sought 15 days time for giving compensation to families of deceased,‚Äù he said.Union minister for road transport and highways and city MP Nitin Gadkari had founded Purti Power and Sugar Limited and developed the plant at Bela in 2000. He is not in the company for last few years. One of his family members is wholetime director in the company.Immediately after the explosion, the team of Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health rushed to the spot on Saturday. An official told TOI, ‚ÄúThe top of bio-gas generator exploded as there were combustible gases in it. Executing welding work on top of it with combustible gases inside is serious lapse in safety procedures. The company should have thoroughly checked and ensured there were no gases in it before starting welding works. Detailed investigation requires time and we will take appropriate action within 90 days against all responsible under The Factories Act 1948 and The Maharashtra Factories Rules 1963.‚ÄùAs per the department, methane is produced in the bio-digester and used as fuel in boilers at ethanol and sugar manufacturing plants.

August 3, 2020||Kanpur||Shells of outdated cartridges found at Bikru ambush site||Kanpur: In a surprise finding, slain gangster Vikas Dubey and his aides are said to have used American Winchester .30-06 cartridges, which the United States Army had used in World Wars I & II, the Korean War, and the war in Vietnam, in the Bikru ambush killing eight policemen, including deputy SP Denendra Kumar Mishra. The startling fact came to light following recovery of empty shells of 11 American Winchester .30-06 cartridges from the scene of crime on July 3. The recovery has foxed police which have launched a probe as to from where did Vikas and his henchmen procure the cartridges ‚Äî which are no more in use in the country. Police officers suspect that the gangster and his aides probably used the cartridges in Springfield rifles. The cartridge was introduced in United States Army in 1906 and later standardized; it remained in use until the late-1970s, said forensic experts. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äò.30‚Äô refers to the caliber of the bullet in inches. The ‚Äò06‚Äô refers to the year the cartridge was adopted, 1906,‚Äù said a senior forensic expert. He added that the .30-06 remained the primary cartridge used in U.S. Army‚Äôs rifles and machine guns for nearly 50 years before being replaced by the 7.62√ó51 mm NATO and 5.56√ó45mm NATO, both of which are in current use. ‚ÄúThe .30-06 cartridge could be fired from the bolt-action M1917 Enfield rifle, the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle, the semi-automatic M1941 Johnson rifle, the Famage Mauser, the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), and numerous machine guns, including the M1917 and M1919 series. It served the United States in both World Wars and in the Korean War, its last major use being in Vietnam,‚Äù the expert added. In the morning after the Bikru ambush, police investigators had found 72 live and empty cartridges, including 11 empty American Winchester shells. Police had also recovered several cartridges of AK 47 and 9 mm pistol, revolvers and country-made guns. ‚ÄúGoing by the inputs provided by forensic experts, we are now investigating as to how and from where gangster and his aides had procured American Winchester .30-06 cartridges,‚Äù said IG Zone Mohit Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/shells-of-outdated-cartridges-found-at-bikru-ambush-site/articleshow/77322766.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
August 3, 2020||Kolkata||No shower, sauna at gyms as owners lay down new SOP||KOLKATA: Trainers not to touch members, locker use restricted, no sauna or shower chambers and members divided into tiny groups over multiple slots throughout the day. In the new normal era, these are some of the fresh set of standard operating procedures that gym owners and trainers are likely to follow when gyms and yoga centres reopen next week. On Sunday, representatives of gym owners and trainers in Kolkata met at a south Kolkata facility to discuss the challenges ahead and the possible ways to overcome them. They came up with a set of SOP in the absence of fresh guidelines on SOPs from the centre. ‚ÄúThe major challenge on hand is to ensure social distancing and boost the confidence of members and offer a safe workout environment maintaining all caution. Hence, we have decided to open our facilities in phases. There will only be 20 members per slot who need to come in their workout gears and leave in the same. Small enclosed areas like locker rooms, sauna chambers and showers will be shut for now,‚Äù said Neeraj Surana, operational head of Rush Fitness. Gyms have also been flooded with requests from members for refund of four months‚Äô unused time, but the gym owners unanimously decided not entertain such pleas. Members who return to their fitness regimen and decide on renewals will be given an additional 25% usage days/months. A monthly fee of Rs 300 or a daily Rs 10 per member will now be charged for sanitization since every gym has to be sanitized for 10 minutes every hour. ‚ÄúWe have taken a huge hit because rentals have not been waived by landlords. Our clients will have to agree to share the load with us in these times, else we will not survive,‚Äù read a statement by the Gym Owners‚Äô Forum, which is a body representing 100 top gyms in the city. It was also decided that not more than 10 people for a 1,000 square feet space and 15-18 for a 2,000 square feet space will be allowed at a time. Each member will be allowed just an hour by appointment. ‚ÄúThough the prime timings are, 6am-9am, we will encourage members to use the afternoon slots as well as many are working from home these days and can negotiate time,‚Äù said Gagan Sachdev, owner of the Karma Fitness Studio chain. Ronodeep Maitra, who owns the Endorphins chain of gyms, said they had also cancelled all group classes and massage sessions for the time being. Some players like Core Gym said they would allow the use of lockers but in a restricted manner. ‚ÄúWe have three locker blocks, of which only one will be operational during a slot,‚Äù said Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-shower-sauna-at-gyms-as-owners-lay-down-new-sop/articleshow/77321882.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
August 3, 2020||Chandigarh||Uncertainty over exam irks students||Kurukshetra: Delay in terminal semester examinations and appointment of a regular vice-chancellor (VC) has irked students, scholars and officials of Kurukshetra University. The tenure of former vice-chancellor Prof Kailash Chandra Sharma came to an end four months ago on March 31. In the absence of a regular VC, the varsity is struggling to take decisions on important issues, a few officials said. One of the key issues faced by students and scholars is uncertainty over examinations. ‚ÄúIt appears higher education is not a priority for the state government as thousands of students in terminal semesters are facing uncertainty about final examinations. In a meeting headed by the ad-hoc KU VC, the Haryana government decision of not holding terminal exams was endorsed in a hasty manner on June 24. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked officials to hold exams. This is a sign of mismanagement at KU,‚Äù a student said. Former vice-president of KU campus students executive council (KUCSEC) Namita Nandal said, ‚ÄúIt is already too late for this session and the varsity or state government should take a final decision at the earliest. At this stage, it is not feasible to hold exams due to the Covid-19 crisis and students should be promoted. It is important for the university to have a regular VC.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/uncertainty-over-exam-irks-students/articleshow/77322761.cms||Jaskaran Singh
August 3, 2020||Goa||Goa works on action plan to house homeless, decision later this week||PANAJI: The North Goa and South Goa collectorates have begun work on an action plan to take care of homeless individuals, including a proposal to house them in shelter homes. The report, which has yet to be finalised, will be placed before the government and the state executive committee (SEC) later this week. Meanwhile, the government has also asked urban local bodies to conduct a survey in collaboration with local NGOs to identify the homeless and destitute in Goa‚Äôs 14 towns. ‚ÄúWe are working on a report but we have not reached a stage where we can say that we have finalised anything,‚Äù said South Goa district collector Ajit Roy. The death of two homeless individuals in Margao due to Covid-19 sparked panic in the commercial capital and prompted authorities to look at ways to prevent the spread of the virus among street dwellers. Many homeless live around the Margao railway station, near the bus stands and in gardens in the towns. ‚ÄúUrban local bodies have been sensitised about the issue and have been asked to conduct a survey within their jurisdiction. Organisations like CRY will be helping out,‚Äù said an official. In March, the government attempted to shelter the homeless at the Margao railway station but the initiative was shut down as the move affected freight movement. This time around deputy collectors have been asked to identify temporary shelter homes for street dwellers and beggars where they can be safely housed and fed. Moves are also on to test the individuals for Covid-19 to ensure that the virus does not spread in shelter homes, said a government official. ‚ÄúThe report (action plan for homeless) will be ready and submitted to the chief secretary when the meeting is convened,‚Äù said a senior official with the north Goa collectorate. Several rounds of meetings have been held over the last two weeks to discuss the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-works-on-action-plan-to-house-homeless-decision-later-this-week/articleshow/77323158.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Kolhapur||Covid centres to have RT-PCR labs||KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur district administration has decided to set up Covid testing laboratory and tele-medicine facilities in each of its Covid Care Centres. At present, there are 35 Covid Care Centres in the district. They are considered to be at the grassroot level of the three-tier Covid management infrastructure. The screening and treatment of those testing positive for the contagion is carried out at these centres. Every Covid Care Centre has six doctors and six nurses along with supporting staff for disinfection and serving meals. In next few days, RT-PCR testing machines will be installed in 16 labs set up across the district and, subsequently, in all centres. The administration is planning to increase daily testing count to 5,000 by installing RT-PCR testing facility in these centres. At present, around 800 swabs are tested on a daily basis in the existing government and private laboratories. Since the labs are mostly in Kolhapur city, it takes time for transportation of swabs and generation of results. District guardian minister Satej Patil said, ‚ÄúWe are planning to increase the facilities at the Covid Care Centres. Currently, these centres have 5,268 beds, of which, 245 have oxygen cylinders fitted to it. We are going to set up the RT-PCR machines for which lab technicians and experts have been hired for the same. The aim is to speed up the testing and thereby to break the chain locally.‚Äù In addition, the administration is also planning to hire 44 general physicians. They will serve as consultants in tele-medicine cell to be set up at the Covid Care Centres. These doctors will be in touch with Covid-19 positive patients who are kept under home isolation. So far, around 268 asymptomatic patients have been allowed to stay in home quarantine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-centres-to-have-rt-pcr-labs/articleshow/77322767.cms||---

It states that as per Section 376 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, activities and businesses mentioned in the Act could not be undertaken without permission of the municipal commissioner. NMC has asked the shopkeepers to obtain Form A from its zone offices and submit the filled up form with required documents for obtaining the licence. The notification states that if shopkeepers and other notified professionals fail to obtain a licence then they will be fined as per provisions of the Act and civil and criminal cases will be filed against them. Traders have vowed to oppose the move tooth and nail. Ashwin Mehadia, president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), said that shopkeepers were already having an extremely difficult time due to the lockdown and now NMC wants them to spend time in seeking permissions instead of attending to their business. ‚ÄúNMC is doing its best to harass us. It is issuing backdated local body tax (LBT) notices to us. Government should let us do business and collect tax from us. Don‚Äôt kill the golden goose. We will oppose this anti-business step of NMC and not take it lying down,‚Äù he added. Vijay Zalke, NMC standing committee chairman, slammed the civic administration for harassing traders. ‚ÄúShopkeepers already have goods and services tax (GST) registration, gumasta licence and udyog aadhar. How many permits are they supposed to obtain? This is nothing but harassment of traders. This notification has been issued without permission of the standing committee and general body. Mundhe should use his emergency powers to reduce Covid-19 cases and not harass citizens,‚Äù he told TOI. Vijay Waghmare, a shopkeeper, said that making licences compulsory would only enrich the touts and lower NMC officials. ‚ÄúExperience shows that we will not get these licences easily. We will have to catch hold of a tout and pay him a hefty sum. The NMC junior officials and clerks will get their share from him. Already we are impoverished due to the lockdown and now the commissioner has come up with this hare-brained idea,‚Äù he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shopkeepers-will-now-need-an-nmc-licence/articleshow/77322769.cms||Ashish Roy
August 3, 2020||Kolkata||Dropbox at KMC‚Äôs birth & death cert office||Kolkata: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has resumed services at the special birth and death registration office using contactless dropboxes for applications.The office located opposite the civic headquarters resumed services last week but only a few applications are being entertained for issuance of birth or death certificates under special registration rules. The office was shut down in the third week of July after one of the staffers of the office died of Covid-19.According to new rules, the photocopies of documents attached with the applications are scanned and the applicants with requisite documents are called after a week to receive the certificates.The civic brass has deputed 12 KMC health department employees to look after the special registration certificates‚Äô wing. However, the number of applicants getting the certificates is being reduced to follow strict Covid-19 rules, which do not allow crowding in a public space. ‚ÄúWe became extra careful after one of our colleagues died of Covid-19. We are carefully scanning all documents and limiting the number of visitors to adhere to the Covid-19 norms,‚Äù said a KMC employee attached to the special registration counter. Same rules are being followed at the KMC birth and death registration wing at the headquarters to avoid crowding. At this wing, the KMC staffers have kept several dropboxes for submission of photocopies of birth and death related documents. ‚ÄúAfter scanning the documents, we are calling in the applicants. We are not allowing more than 20 applicants during the office hours to avoid crowding,‚Äù said a KMC health department official.Before the pandemic hit Kolkata, the health department would allow over 100 applicants daily to stand in a queue with valid documents who would be issued birth or death certificates. ‚ÄúNow under the changed circumstances we can‚Äôt allow long queues as that may breach the social distancing protocol,‚Äù said a KMC official.An official said the civic body is yet to roll out online birth and death registration application facility as the work to integrate a software for such (online) application was hit due to the pandemic. ‚ÄúWe have developed an online system and will launch it after the Covid-19 situation eases,‚Äù a civic official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dropbox-at-kmcs-birth-death-cert-office/articleshow/77321885.cms||Saikat Ray
August 3, 2020||Kolhapur||Sugar mills seek extension of buffer stock scheme||Kolhapur: The Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation, an association of the co-operative sugar mills in the state, has demanded extension of the sugar buffer stock scheme that expired on August 1. The one-year scheme helped increase the cash-flow, thereby helping the mills clear the dues of farmers against the backdrop of increased production. The central government had set aside Rs 1,674 crore for creating a buffer stock of 40 lakh tonne. It also helped keep the price of sugar in the open market under check. This time, however, the sugar mills‚Äô body has demanded the buffer stock be increased by an additional 10 lakh tonne and the scheme deadline be extended by one more year. Managing director of the federation Sanjay Khatal, in a letter written to the Union ministry of food and public distribution, said, ‚ÄúBanks have started recovery of money they lent to the mills against the sugar inventory. The pressure from banks will force the mills to sell the sugar from the stock at lower prices, thereby, once again creating liquidity issues. We are working out plans for guarantee from the state government against the money lent by the co-operative banks. We are going to witness a bumper production of sugar, around 10 million tonne in Maharashtra. We, therefore, request the government to extend the buffer stock scheme for one more year so that the mills can be in a sound position to pay the farmers.‚Äù If the ministry heeds to the request of the sugar body, then the proposal will be tabled in the Union cabinet which will then allocate funds to implement the scheme. Meanwhile, rural development minister Hasan Mushrif and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetti have also demanded the extension of the buffer scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sugar-mills-seek-extension-of-buffer-stock-scheme/articleshow/77322773.cms||---

Barring two or three districts, all 33 districts have been attacked. Crops are getting damaged,‚Äù Gehlot told reporters after returning to Jaisalmer from Jaipur on Sunday evening. He said, ‚ÄúLocusts were seen in Jaisalmer-Barmer on a large scale in 1991-92. Last year also the farmers faced large attacks.‚Äù The CM said, ‚ÄúThe Kharif and Rabi crops were damaged last year. Now the Kharif crop could be damaged again. How long can farmers tolerate crop damage due to locusts? They should get full compensation. I hope the Prime Minister will pay attention to this.‚Äù Gehlot said he mentioned in the letter that locusts come to India via Africa and other countries, including Pakistan, and breed here on a large scale. Locusts have reached in most parts of the country. When this happened last time, nobody remembers. Gehlot said he raised the issue of the crop loss due to locust attacks in a video conference of chief ministers with Modi. ‚ÄúModi took interest in the matter and sought information about the affected districts,‚Äù the CM said. Chief whip Mahesh Joshi, sports minister Ashok Chandna and Congressmen Neeraj Merwani and Devendra Yadav reached Jaisalmer with the CM on Sunday evening. A cabinet meeting was called in Suryagarh hotel later in the night.

August 3, 2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case: Bihar IPS officer in Mumbai, told to quarantine by BMC||MUMBAI/DELHI/PATNA: Days after a Bihar police team reached Mumbai to probe the Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case, a turf battle has broken out between law enforcement officers from the two regions, with even ministers weighing in to control the investigation. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said the Bihar team had exceeded their brief: the law requires an offence to be probed by police and courts within whose jurisdiction it has been committed. With the Bihar cops‚Äô attempt to access documents linked to the alleged suicide of Sushant‚Äôs ex-manager Disha Salian (28) stonewalled, the Bihar government sent Patna city SP Vinay Tiwary to Mumbai to ‚Äúremove obstacles‚Äù. However, the IPS officer was reportedly forced into quarantine. Patna IG Sanjay Singh confirmed to TOI that Tiwary had been stamped with a mandatory quarantine by BMC. He said they will look into the matter on Monday. Amid turf battle, Bihar DGP says Rhea is ‚Äòabsconding‚ÄôChief minister Uddhav Thackeray met chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, police commissioner Parambir Singh and DGP Subodh Jaiswal on Sunday evening in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput case. ‚ÄúHe just wanted to take a review of the investigation and technicalities as one more state (Bihar) is also involved in the probe of the case,‚Äù said a senior official. The view that the Sushant case deserved a deeper, more independent probe continued to find takers, especially among politicians and the bureaucracy in Bihar. Union minister R K Singh who served as Union home secretary and is BJP MP from Ara, said, ‚ÄúGrievances of Sushant‚Äôs family are genuine. Mumbai police did precious little after the incident. They didn‚Äôt lodge a formal FIR even after interrogation of a number of suspects.‚Äù Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14. An FIR has been registered in Patna on a complaint filed by Rajput‚Äôs father K K Singh against actor Rhea Chakraborty under sections including abetment of suicide. Bihar police may up the ante in coming days and get a lookout notice issued against Chakraborty. State DGP Gupteshwar Pandey said on Sunday, ‚ÄúShe is absconding. She has her own sources in Mumbai for helping her out there.‚Äù That those questioning the probe were divided on political lines was evident. Singh‚Äôs reactions came hours after Congress incharge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil defended Maharashtra government, saying, ‚ÄúThe Bihar police should focus on the investigation rather than indulging in mudslinging‚Ä¶‚Äù Maharashtra state home minister Anil Deshmukh said that the Mumbai police were moving in the right direction.

August 3, 2020||Jaipur||Cong begins to fulfil our long-pending demands: BTP||Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot‚Äôs announcement of August 9 as a public holiday in the state to mark the World Tribal Day is one of the several demands negotiated by the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) before it extended support to the ruling party in the present crisis. The BTP has extended blind support to the Congress in the Rajya Sabha polls in June took a U-turn by declaring it to abstain from floor test at the onset of the present crisis given them the power to bargain with Congress. The negotiation between the two parties ended with agreement on fulfilling 8-10 demands which were part of the tribal party‚Äôs election manifesto. The BTP‚Äôs two MLAs are crucial for the Congress government which is facing a number crunch to prove its majority in the assembly.‚ÄúThe ruling party has fulfilled our long pending demand of declaring a holiday on World Tribal Day. It is just the beginning of our demands to see the light of the day. CM Ashok Gehlot promised our leaders while seeking support that all our demands will be fulfilled once the crisis is over,‚Äù said Rajkumar Roat, BTP MLA from Chorasi over the phone from Jaisalmer.The BTP which came into existence in 2017 contested the assembly elections on 11 seats in 2018 purely on the local issues against the Congress and the BJP. They won two seats‚ÄîRajkumar Roat from Chorasi and Ramprasad from Sagwara and stood second on another two seats gave a significant challenge to the bi-polar politics in the tribal region. They recorded a 0.7% vote share in the assembly polls.Since the beginning, they were seen with the Congress and in their first meeting with the CM Gehlot handed over their demands in lieu of their support for the party. The party feels that their equation with the Congress went into trouble with the merger of six BSP MLAs in September 2019 as it has taken its tally to a comfortable majority mark of 106 out of 200 seat assembly. The party again came back to them before the Rajya Sabha polls and promised to consider their demands after the RS polls.‚ÄúAfter RS polls, our party leaders realised that Congress is not giving any word on the demands. The sense of betrayal was natural, however, the meetings with our leaders the ruling party showed resolve to fulfil our demands which are about tribal rights.‚Äù Said Roat.The party‚Äôs national president Mahesh Vasava based in Gujarat issued a whip to its MLAs in the state to abstain from voting in the event of any floor test on July 13. It was followed by mistreatment of a Roat by the police in Jaipur revelled by him in a self-shot video which was largely shared by the BJP twitter handles. Later, he called the incident an outcome of ‚Äòmiscommunication.‚Äô It almost marked the end of BTPs relations one and a half relations with the Congress. A senior Congress leader from Dungarpur and one cabinet minister rushed to the rescue of a party. Here begin the backdoor negotiations between CM Gehlot and BTP leaders, including its state president Vela Ram Ghagra and the two MLAs. It, however, didnt took long for the Congress ‚ÄúOur party is committed to supporting Congress in the event of a floor test or any way round. Our association with the party is purely issued-based and will progress with every promise fulfilled by them,‚Äù said Roat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-begins-to-fulfil-our-long-pending-demands-btp/articleshow/77322770.cms||Shoeb Khan
August 3, 2020||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Again, it‚Äôs raining cave-ins as monsoon gains momentum||AHMEDABAD: What is the average life span of repairs on a cave-in in Ahmedabad? Till the next monsoon. Such ulcers emerge unannounced, halt traffic and drain the city‚Äôs already dry coffers. This monsoon, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had reported at least one cave-in every six days and the average cost of repairs is Rs 4.38 lakh. In 2019, 66 major cave-ins were repaired at a cost of Rs 2.89 crore. Officials said that this year there have been more than 20 cave-ins in the city. On Tuesday, a major cave-in was reported on the 132 Feet Ring Road near Ramol. Officials said the cave-in badly disrupted traffic movement. Two years ago, the AMC told the high court it had approached IIT Gandhinagar and IIT Powai, to help develop a cave-in forecast system, which would mainly rely on the age and health of underground sewer and stormwater drains to project which lines could be damaged. Last year, the AMC announced plans to use the strip wound lining (SWL) method to prevent cave-ins. In this Japanese method, cameras are used to assess damage inside drainage lines and seal small cracks and fractures could potentially cause cave-ins in the future. This project is yet to be pursued. A senior officer said cave-ins are caused by leaks in drains and this is mainly because there are illegal connections or blockages. Officials said that there are several spots in the city that been reporting cave-ins more than once a year, every year. Another officer said a cave-in was recently reported on the 132 Feet Ring Road near Samras Hostel, and this was a spot where there had been cave-in in 2019 and 2019. The 66 cave-ins this year have been major ones, with smaller ones and road subsidence incidents not being included. An elected AMC official said that concerning road subsidence incidents, contractors are supposed to make sure they compact the soil after they dig it up for repairs, but in 90% of cases the contractor will finish the job in a hurry just before the monsoon and the hole is filled with earth without ensuring proper soil compaction. As a result the first rain causes the mud to settle and causes a cave-in. AMC standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt said that the city has several old drainage and stormwater lines that need repair. We are examining all these lines and tenders for retrofitting have also been issued. ‚ÄúOld lines develop punctures and leaks and these cause cave-ins,‚Äù Bhatt said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/again-its-raining-cave-ins-as-monsoon-gains-momentum/articleshow/77321895.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

August 3, 2020||Nagpur||MSEDCL cable laying work not as per norms: Consumer body||Nagpur: Norms have been allegedly violated in yet another work of laying electric cables. The Grahak Kalyan Parishad, a non-profit organization working for consumers‚Äô rights, has alleged substandard work in cable laying work being done by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) in Sitabuldi.The MSEDCL, through a private firm, is laying underground cables in west Nagpur for the last one month. One of the sites is between Laxmi Talkies and Jhunka Bhakar centre in Sitabuldi. But it is not being done as per the Indian Standard (IS), claimed the council‚Äôs member Mohammed Shahid Sharif. According to information procured from the MSEDCL‚Äôs Congress Nagar division, the underground cabling work is being carried out under the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) of Government of India and standard operating procedure needs to be followed as per IS-1255 (1983) specifications.On Tuesday, Sharif come across that a private agency M/s Ceinsys Tech Limited, owned by a former state minister, was assigned the job. ‚ÄúOn inspecting some sites, we observed that the norms are not being followed. This was brought to the notice of MSEDCL top officials and we also stopped the work,‚Äù he said.In the joint inspection conducted by the Parishad and MSEDCL, it was found that the excavation of trench was not done as per the norms laid down under IPDS. The trench dug up was found to be 2.5-ft deep while norms stipulated it to be 4.5-ft deep. Even the RCC done for covering the cable was of substandard quality. In the past too, Civic Action Guild Foundation (CAG), a non-profit organization from Dharampeth, had exposed substandard work in cable laying work done by MSEDCL across the city. The NGO had also submitted a complaint to the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office and had claimed that MSEDCL was laying underground cables by ignoring the Indian Standard norms. Like CAG, Sharif too exposed that the private agency is not using sand while laying the cable. ‚ÄúAs per IS 1255, it is necessary to place 75mm sand bed under the cable and 75mm above it. This was totally missing at the site,‚Äù he said.The back filling was carried out with the excavated soil containing material not permitted in the norms and this might damage the cable in the near future.The consumers‚Äô rights body also hinted at large-scale corruption in laying underground cable works across the city. Sharif wondered how the NMC‚Äôs Dharampeth zone is allowing cable laying works during monsoon. ‚ÄúIn the past, several high court orders have prohibited road digging works during the rainy season,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/msedcl-cable-laying-work-not-as-per-norms-consumer-body/articleshow/77322778.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The step comes in the wake of D‚ÄôSouza and his wife testing positive for the novel coronavirus, which he disclosed in a Facebook post on Saturday. Ivan has had busy public engagements since last Monday, culminating with the two-day visit of KPCC president D K Shivakumar to the district on Friday. District health and family welfare officer Dr Ramachandra Bairy said that surveillance teams are in touch over telephone with D‚ÄôSouza. As per established protocols, any person who has been in contact with a person testing positive for the virus for more than 15 minutes, and without wearing a mask will be deemed a primary contact, Dr Bairy said, adding the surveillance teams as per information given by D‚ÄôSouza, have zeroed in on 20 people so far. ‚ÄúWe are also going through the video footage, wherever available, to cross-verify the same,‚Äù Dr Bairy said. Those deemed primary contacts will be asked to voluntarily undergo 14 days of self-isolation, he said, adding if any symptoms of the disease surface between days 5-10, they need to get themselves tested.

As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the showers will continue over the next few days. IMD-Mumbai had predicted heavy rainfall in the Kolhapur district and issued an orange alert for three days. According to local authorities, heavy rain had lashed the ghat sections on Sunday, but in the interior areas of the district, the showers, though continuous, were not as heavy as expected. In the region, an orange alert has also been issued for Satara for the next three days. Sangli, however, is expected to remain dry. Good rainfall over the next couple of days will help the dams fill up and the farmers will be able to resume paddy transplantation activities which were halted due to the long break in the rain. Also, the farmers who have cultivated ragi and soyabean on the shallow land will also be relieved as the rain will help rejuvenate the crops. Heavy rain had lashed the region continuously for almost a week during the corresponding time last year. It had led to the unprecedented floods in Kolhapur and Sangli districts. The floods wreaked havoc between August 5 to August 11. With the rains back again this time, citizens fear a likely repeat. Anticipating the rain, officials have started water discharge from the dams along the rivers in both the districts. Koyna dam in Satara district has started releasing water. Discharge from the Almatti dam was around 2,000 cusecs. The discharge from the dams helped the river water level to remain constant. The Panchaganga river water was around 11.2 feet by Sunday evening. The flood warning level of the river is 39 feet and danger mark is 43 feet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rain-returns-orange-alert-in-kolhapur-satara/articleshow/77322780.cms||---

The child of the survivor has been sent to an orphanage. Justice Bharati Dangre declined to release the accused, saying, ‚ÄúThere is every likelihood he will exert pressure on the girl once being released on bail.‚Äù The accused was arrested in a 2018 case filed in Pune and charge-sheeted in September 2019. He is one of three accused of gang-rape and the survivor had given birth to a child in November 2018.

August 3, 2020||Ludhiana||Hosp asks +ve pregnant woman to leave, go home on her own||Ludhiana: A four-month pregnant corona positive woman was suddenly asked to leave by the civil hospital and go home on her own. Entire family of the woman was home quarantined, but her husband had to leave the house to get his wife back home who had to wait at the gate of the civil hospital for over an hour. On Saturday, the sister-in-law of the woman tweeted to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh about it. Speaking with The Times of India on phone, the 21-year-old resident of Kohara said her sister-in-law (brother‚Äôs wife) had tested positive for Covid-19 on July 24. Two days later, they were approached by the health department and she was shifted to Ludhiana civil hospital and their entire family was home quarantined despite all of them testing negative. She added, ‚ÄúOn August 1, my sister-in-law called up my brother, saying the hospital staff had asked her and three other positive women in the ward to leave and go home. She was standing at the gate of the hospital when she called. Since we all were under home quarantine, we were unable to pick her up from there. As she was pregnant, she was scared to use public transport. Therefore, I called 104 Covid helpline and was given contacts of some officials. I talked to all of them, but no one helped us. Thereafter, my brother went and brought his wife home. Now, she is under home isolation.‚Äù ‚ÄúI tweeted this to CM Captain Amarinder Singh to highlight how irresponsible the officials are. If a corona positive person breaks isolation, a case is registered, but no action is taken when health staffers ask a patient to reach home on her own. Is this the way our health officials are trying to stop the spread of coronavirus?‚Äù she fumed. Despite repeated attempts, chief medical officer Rajesh Bagga could not be contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hosp-asks-ve-pregnant-woman-to-leave-go-home-on-her-own/articleshow/77320753.cms||Payal Dhawan

Now as soon as a person tests positive, he would receive a message on his mobile with a link. The patient has to fill an online form, apprising whether he would prefer home isolation or admission in a hospital. For this, the administration has also prepared a portal. Divisional commissioner Dr Sudhir M Bobde held a meeting with health officials and district administration at Kanpur Municipal Corporation‚Äôs control room. He informed that the administration patients will have to fill a form on this portal. Doctors attached to it have been trained and would be in operation round the clock. Doctors would seek medical details of infected persons, who opt for home isolation. If a patient feels uneasy during home quarrantine, he can contact the control room number 18001805159. A medical team would arrange the admission at a government hospital or a private nursing home. The divisional commissioner said the RRT team would keep the list of infected persons. The RRT team would be constituted police station wise so that infected persons should be contacted without any delay. If the infected person fails to fill the form, the control room would contact him and help in filling the form.

August 3, 2020||Ludhiana||45 deaths, 1,050 cases in past 7 days||Ludhiana: As many as 45 deaths and over a thousand Covid-19 cases in the last seven days have sent alarm bells ringing in Ludhiana. The spurt in cases has also reduced the doubling rate of cases in the district.As per the state media bulletin released on Saturday evening, the district witnessed 45 deaths in a week‚Äôs time, which is around 39.5% of the total deaths taking place in the state during the same period. Jalandhar and Amritsar districts are at number two and three, while Fazilka, Faridkot, Fategarh Sahib, Ferozpur, Moga and Mansa recorded zero deaths in those seven days.The bulletin suggests that Ludhiana had a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3% in the last seven days ‚Äî higher than the CFR for 14 districts of Punjab and more than the value for the state. Kapurthala and Amritsar had recorded 4% CFR in the last seven days.The situation is also worrying with regard to the rise in the number of cases in Ludhiana district. The bulletin suggests that the district recorded in the last seven days a whopping 1,050 cases, which is about 24% of total cases reported in the state during the period. Patiala, Jalandhar and Amritsar, had reported 491, 474 and 420 cases, respectively.Ludhiana had also the highest number of active cases at 1,153 compared to other districts during the period, with Patiala and Jalandhar at second and third spots with 829 and 656 active cases, respectively. The doubling rate ‚Äî the number of days it would take for the cases to double based on the last seven days‚Äô growth rate ‚Äî was 13 for the district on August 1, whereas it was 16 on July 18. Given the rise in Covid deaths and positive cases in the last around 10 days, one can safely say that the peak has started, said civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga. ‚ÄúPeak of the pandemic has started, which is why cases are witnessing an increase and more deaths are occurring. We are taking all measures to provide top healthcare services to the patients, but the best solution to the problem is that people start taking preventive steps like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and hand hygiene, and go out only if very necessary,‚Äù said the civil surgeon.Meanwhile, many residents feel that the administration needs to deal with the violators of Covid-19 safety norms with iron hands.‚ÄúSoft approach has not helped much in the fight against Covid, so it is time authorities acted tough against those not wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, etc. Fine for not wearing the mask should be increased to Rs 20,000 and there should be cases against them for subsequent violations,‚Äù said Narinder Singh, a Pakhowal Road resident. BOXShortage of beds for serious patients As per the latest media bulletin, the number of beds occupied in Level 3 facilities (meant for serious patients) in Ludhiana is 75, whereas the total availability of such beds in the district is 76. That means, there is just one bed left for serious patients. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said in a meeting with senior officers on Saturday, the private hospitals have been asked to reserve and declare 50% of such beds for patients.Cured percentage As per media bulletin of Saturday, cured percentage for Ludhiana district is 63% and 65% for the state. On July 28, the cured percentage for Ludhiana was 64% and 65% for the state .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/45-deaths-1050-cases-in-past-7-days/articleshow/77320760.cms||Shariq Majeed
August 3, 2020||Delhi||Why smog towers may not fix Delhi‚Äôs problem||NEW DELHI: Installing a smog tower in the capital may take another ten months, with a fresh MoU signed by IIT-Bombay with the central government. The work will be carried out using expertise from University of Minnesota and IIT Delhi. At present, Delhi has only one smog tower ‚Äì a 20-ft-tall device, which was installed at Lajpat Nagar in January by a local traders‚Äô association. Track the pollution level in your cityHowever, experts call this solution impractical and unfeasible, with an analysis carried out by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) claiming that at least 25 lakh such smog towers will be required to clean Delhi‚Äôs air. Delhi requires permanent solutions as the capital inhaled toxic air for 241 days in 2019, the analysis adds. Tanushree Ganguly, Programme Associate, CEEW, said the money being spent on these smog towers could be used elsewhere, with attention in particular required towards thermal power plants. ‚ÄúIn no way should such unproven technologies be encouraged. The focus in the region should instead be on ensuring that the thermal power plants around Delhi comply with the emission norms notified in 2015. Also, the money could be better utilised on an augmented and reliable transit system and scientific management of waste in the city.Cutting down emissions is the only way to tackle air pollution,‚Äù added Ganguly. The smog tower at Lajpat Nagar was installed at a cost of Rs 7 lakh, with an additional amount of Rs 30,000 required each month for its maintenance. To install 25 lakh such towers, the amount required will be 2.5 times of Delhi‚Äôs annual budget, states the CEEW analysis. The tower apparently cleans 2,50,000 to 6,00000 cubic metre of air each day. However, CEEW states its impact is limited to a 50-metre radius. Organisations are calling the government to look at more concrete options, stating that ‚Äòband-aid‚Äô solutions can be more damaging than useful in the long run. Jhatkaa ‚Äî a campaign-driven organisation ‚Äîhas started an online petition, asking the Supreme Court, Central Pollution Control Board and Ministry of Environment if this was the best use of taxpayers‚Äô money when there is evidence that smog towers are not a solution to tackle PM2.5. ‚ÄúThey are costly to maintain and run and will also give people a false sense of complacency and assurance, impacting real change,‚Äù said Meghna, a campaigner at Jhatkaa.org. Anumita Roy Chowdhury from Centre for Science and Environment says global practice also shows that no major country has used smog towers as a way to control air pollution. ‚ÄúPrivate entities have installed them, but no government is using it as a regulatory measure to improve air quality. There is also not enough data to support its effectiveness,‚Äù added Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-smog-towers-may-not-fix-citys-problem/articleshow/77320777.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to forest officials, Ganesh Bhupendra was sleeping in the front room of their house in Dharamkhetar village with his mother. His father stays in the farm to ward off crop damage by nilgais. As it was hot, Ganesh‚Äôs mother had kept the door of their house slightly ajar, which made it easy for the leopard to enter the room. The leopard caught hold of the boy‚Äôs head in his jaws which made a startled Ganesh burst out crying. Hearing her son‚Äôs cries, the mother woke up and pulled the boy by his legs. Forest officials said that as the leopard may not have had a proper grip of the boy‚Äôs head, it loosened its hold and fled to a nearby maize farm. Hearing her cries, neighbours too rushed in for help. ‚ÄúThe boy has received stitches above his right eye and injury on his head. He is being treated at SSG Hospital in Vadodara,‚Äù said in-charge range forest officer V G Makwana. On July 29 too, leopard had attacked a 13-year-old boy in Chatha village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mom-pulls-boy-back-from-leopards-jaws/articleshow/77320470.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Goa||Goa: Infection intensifies, moves beyond containment zones||PANAJI: Covid-19 cases were being detected from certain pockets‚Äî hutments, building or residential areas‚Äîof towns and villages in early July. However, this is no longer true. Cases have spread beyond the limited area, signifying the heightened pace of infections in midst of monsoon when other viral infections are also on the rise. For instance, Margao, which has crossed 100 confirmed cases, has infections detected from all over the town. The conditions in Mapusa, Ponda, Dharbandora or Porvorim that have more cases detected during the last 15 to 20 days, is not different from Vasco and Cortalim though their caseload may be comparatively low. ‚ÄúWe may not have 300 or 400 actives cases as reported in Vasco or Cortalim, but the underlying point is that now Covid-19 is everywhere,‚Äù a health officer in North Goa said. In Margao, the initial cases came from Moti Dongor, a slum area of the commercial town, but now cases are being detected from all over the town, a health officer said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sign that the virus is everywhere,‚Äù the officer said. Another official said that the pattern of the spread of the infection in Margao is similar to that in Vasco in June. ‚ÄúPeople have thrown caution to the wind. Forget about observing social distancing norms, there are many who do not hesitate to organise celebrations such as birthday parties,‚Äù he said. Primary health centres at Ponda and Dharbandora, which have seen infection in industrial workers, health workers and their families, have now people testing positive from various parts. A health officer said that they have 12 new cases detected in Dharbandora on Sunday, but nine cases of industrial workers were outside his jurisdiction. ‚ÄúThey prefer to do testing in Dharbandora as the caseload here is less compared to Margao or Ponda,‚Äù he said. While he said that there has been a dip in cases in the last two to three days in his jurisdiction, he is not confident that the situation will not change in a few days since the virus has spread. Panaji‚Äôs suburbs, which have witnessed a spike, have cases reported from Socorro, Penha-de-Franca and Salvador de Mundo, three panchayats that comprise Porvorim. The cases have been found in upmarket residential buildings, Vijaynagar, as well as other corners of Porvorim. The authorities are contemplating declaring Vijaynagar a micro containment zone with rise in cases there, an officer said. Chief officer of the Mapusa Municipal council, Kabir Shirgaonkar, said that though they have not detected more cases in the city‚Äôs slum area, Ganganagar, the cases reported during the last few days have come up in various other parts of the town. Meanwhile, Cuchelim, a closely-packed area near Tivim industrial area, continued to be sealed as test reports of some are still awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/infection-intensifies-moves-beyond-containment-zones/articleshow/77323166.cms||Bindiya Chari

However, due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, the community restrained from stepping out of their homes for the celebrations. Speaking to TOI, Christine Lazurus, an ex- MLA from the community said: ‚ÄúWe have restricted our celebrations to our homes this year considering the current situation. Instead of meeting our family and friends in a common place outside our homes, we took part in virtual celebrations by organising zoom calls.‚Äù Nearly 8,000 Anglo Indians from the twin cities, settled in Lalaguda, Tarnaka, Mettuguda and Bolarum among other places, practise Christianity and comprise of Roman Catholics and Protestants. Earlier, the association heads used to organise celebrations to reflect on the community‚Äôs tradition of conducting events dedicated to food, music and dance. Their celebrations also reflected on the community‚Äôs contribution in serving the nation and carefully preserving the pre-independence sense of British identity. ‚ÄúThe community has risen from dire circumstances through determination and perseverance and slowly made progress. Now, the entire community is well-educated and are very well settled. They are all leading a stable life.

August 3, 2020||Bhopal||Pragya mocks Cong for its stand on Ram temple||Bhopal: Mocking the Congress for its move to celebrate Ram Utsav ahead of ‚Äòbhoomi pujan‚Äô of Ram temple at Ayodhya, BJP leader and Bhopal MP Pragya Singh Thakur took a jibe at the grand old party saying ‚Äúthose who questioned the existence of Lord Ram is now talking of celebrating the occasion.‚Äù Thakur said that every Hindu remembers how Congress tricked to stall the construction of Ram Temple. She referred to Congress leader Kamal Nath's remarks on Saturday to host recital of Hanuman Chalisa at his residence ahead of the bhumi pujan ceremony at Ayodhya. The BJP leader also attacked Congress Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh for his remarks on muhurat of bhumi pujan. "The Pitthoo (parrot) of the Congress says that every Hindu is for Ram temple. Wow, all remembers the deceit of stalling the temple decision in the Supreme Court," tweeted Thakur, on Sunday. The two Congress veterans - Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh - have welcomed the construction of Ram Temple. Nath being an ardent devotee of Lord Hanuman asked the party cadre and leaders to recite Hanuman Chalisa at the homes. "It represents the fulfillment of the long-awaited dream of the people. It has become possible due to the collective agreement of all people in the country. This is possible in India only," Nath had said in a video message on Saturday. Just a few hours later, Digvijaya Singh tweeted on the issue, "Lord Ram is the nucleus of our faith and the entire country is running by his grace only. We aspire that a grand Ram Temple is built in Ayodhya soon. Late Rajiv Gandhi also wanted it to happen." In another tweet, Singh, however, wrote that the muhurat (auspicious time) when the foundation of the temple will be laid on August 5 is 'inauspicious'. Congress meanwhile retorted to Pragya‚Äôs remarks saying, ‚ÄúSeveral leaders associated with the BJP like Subramanian Swamy, have accepted that it was Rajiv Gandhi and former Congress Prime Minister late PV Narasimha Rao who were instrumental in paving the way for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The BJP is only publicising and politicising the issue for personal gains," said Congress state media coordinator, Narendra Saluja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pragya-mocks-cong-for-its-stand-on-ram-temple/articleshow/77322809.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Delhi||Hunger competes with virus as budget hotels fight for survival in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shoeb went back to his native place Kishanganj after Shelton Hotel in Paharganj was shut down because of the pandemic, but the 23-year-old cook has now been calling his manager frequently to inquire when he can return and join work. As of now, there‚Äôs no clarity on when Delhi‚Äôs hotels will be back in business. The same kind of desperation is being felt by 20-year-old Mohammed Tausif, who comes from the same place as Shoeb. ‚ÄúI returned to Delhi around two weeks ago. There are hundreds of hotel employees who are finding it difficult to sustain their families. Much more than the disease, hunger will kill them,‚Äù Tausif added. Paharganj used to be a commercial hub bustling with life with cafes and entertainment centres teeming with tourists. But nowadays it‚Äôs a pale shadow of its former self. Posters of closure and locked gates dominate the scene. Apart from the iconic German Bakery, many smaller cafes have permanently closed down. ‚ÄúThere are no customers. I have grown up in Paharganj, but have never seen it so lifeless,‚Äù said Vinod Kumar, a trader at Baoli Chowk. Krishna Cafe, which was across his shop, went bankrupt and shut down permanently. ‚ÄúThe place used to be full of foreigners. Last month, they came and moved out all their goods. Hotels and cafes running out of rented premises have either closed down or are on the verge of closure,‚Äù he added. The local association of hotels said there were close to 650 big and small lodging houses in the area employing over a lakh people directly and indirectly. Daljeet Chadha, the head a hotel association and owner of a budget hotel on Ara Kasha Road, said every unit like his with 20-25 rooms gave livelihood to many. ‚ÄúMany of us have taken the premises on lease. With over four months of closure, how are we expected to keep paying the lease amount and bills?‚Äù he asked. The hopes of many employees rose briefly after Delhi government announced that hotels would be opened in Unlock 3.0. But they were dejected after the LG didn‚Äôt give his nod to the proposal. Many hotel owners told TOI that they had made arrangements for sanitising luggage, procuring disinfection machines and buying masks to keep everyone safe. ‚ÄúIf people coming from the airport and railway stations are being scanned on landing, how will it be risky to provide them lodging facilities?‚Äù asked Mahendra Gupta, the owner of Sopan Heights Hotel and vice-president of Delhi Hotels and Restaurants Association. There are around 2,600 budget hotels across the city, with most being concentrated in Paharganj, Karol Bagh and Mahipalpur. While each unit directly employs 20-25 people, they indirectly help provide livelihood to suppliers of food, milk, newspapers and laundry services. ‚ÄúEven with no operations, we are spending up to Rs 1 lakh as fixed charges for maintenance, electricity bills and salaries,‚Äù said Gupta. Pawan Mittal, who owns Hotel Star View near Imperial cinema, said he had asked his employees to return after the announcement was made. ‚ÄúMy staffers had been calling me for the past month asking when they could return. I had to ask them to stay put. We have already purchased disinfection equipment. The government is making us pay commercial taxes and utility bills, but not allowing us to function,‚Äù he added.

August 3, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: At 15, Sunday toll lowest in about 2.5 months; total 4,000||NEW DELHI: Delhi‚Äôs Covid-19 death toll crossed the 4,000 mark on Sunday, while the number of deaths reported due to the viral infection in the last 24 hours was 15, one of the lowest in more than two and a half months. The capital reported 961 new cases on Sunday, while 1,186 patients recovered in the last 24 hours. Though the total number of Covid-19 positive cases reached the figure of 1,37,677 on Sunday, the number of those who have recovered stands at 1,23,317. The city‚Äôs recovery rate has climbed to 89.5%. The number of active Covid-19 cases was 10,356, the lowest in more than two months. ‚ÄúDeaths in Delhi come down to 15. Less than 1,000 cases. Lets all keep working hard to ensure that the downward trend continues (sic),‚Äù chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted. After the peak of 28,329 active cases on June 27, the numbers of both active and new cases have shown a sharp decline. On Monday, the city had recorded 613 new cases, the lowest in two months. The chief minister, however, has been cautioning Delhiites not to get complacent and continue wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing. As on Sunday, most of Covid-19 positive patients ‚Äî 5,663 ‚Äî are recuperating in home isolation and 2,886 are admitted in hospitals, apart from 685 in Covid care centres and 161 in Covid health centres. Total 10,692 Covid beds are vacant in hospitals, 5,389 in Covid care centres and 393 in health centres. However, 4,170 beds in Covid care centres are being used as quarantine facilities for travellers who came by Vande Bharat Mission and Bubble flights. Delhi had recorded its first and the country‚Äôs second Covid-19 death on March 13, when a 68-year-old woman from Janakpuri succumbed to the infection. It took another 79 days for the death figures to cross the mark of 500 and about three months to reach the figure of 1,000. The city, however, crossed the figure of 2,000 Covid-19 deaths in about a week from then and breached the 3,000 mark in about a fortnight from then. The biggest spike in the number of deaths also came at a time when Delhi was witnessing a spike in the number of active cases and new cases every day. The graph started dipping from June-end and for the total number of deaths to reach from 3,004 to 4,004, it took almost a month. The city‚Äôs fatality rate, at present, is 2.9%.

August 3, 2020||Mumbai||Portion of demolished SNDT bridge in Mumbai reopens, bringing relief to motorists||MUMBAI: A part of SNDT bridge over a nullah at Juhu Tara Road which had been demolished, was reopened to traffic on August 1. The bridge was open only for light vehicles and height barriers had been placed. The bridge was shut last year in June following an audit after Himalaya bridge crashed at CSMT in March 2019. The audit pointed out that the structure had to be shut as steel portions of the bridge had been exposed. But after a hue and cry by residents and elected representatives, a fresh audit found it could be opened to light vehicles, with a slab being cast over, as part of it was taken up for reconstruction. Civic officials opened up the reconstructed part on Saturday. ‚ÄúThere was a delay in work as we were unable to find labourers due to Covid-19 outbreak in the city. The part temporarily kept open with height barriers will be taken up for repairs now. We plan to complete it by the year-end,‚Äù said an official. Khar resident Zoru Bhathena, who uses the route frequently, said there seemed to be a significant amount of work left. ‚ÄúBEST double-decker buses on the route should resume now,‚Äù he added.

August 3, 2020||Bhopal||Pyare had used B‚Äôwood actor‚Äôs name to register his hsg society||Bhopal: Local newspaper owner Pyare Mian, accused of raping and sexually exploiting minor girls, had fraudulently added the name of a veteran Bollywood actor and another eminent person in the list of members to get his housing society registered. Pyare had later rented out the apartment terrace to a telecommunication company for setting up a mobile tower. Later, he removed the names of the celebrities and made his family members and servants members of the society. These facts were revealed by Shyamla Hills police on Sunday which is investigating the fraud and forgery case registered against Pyare Mian, his two wives, son and an advocate. Police said that Pyare Mian and his family members extorted Rs 1.25 crore from the telecom company and submitted fake audit reports of society for a duration of eight years in 2019 through his lawyer, who was later made accused in the case by police. Pyare Mian is presently on remand taken by Shyamla Hills police. He will be produced before the court on Monday. SP (South) Sai Krishna S Thota said that Shyamla Hills police had registered a case on charges of fraud and forgery against Pyare Mian, his wives Badrunissa and Tanveer Fatima along with son Shahnawaz for making a fake housing society in the name E-Block Lake View Welfare Society and renting the terrace of the E-Block at Ansal Apartment to a telecom company to set up their mobile tower. During investigation, Pyare Mian revealed that he purchased three flats in E-Block in the name of Badrunnisa, Tanveer Fatima and Shahnawaz. In the same block the telecommunication company has their flat and their mobile tower was built on the terrace in 2002. SP Thota said that Pyare Mian revealed that in 2010 his wife Tanveer Fatima sent a legal notice to the telecom company through an advocate asking them to remove the tower from the terrace. Pyare Mian started creating hurdles in tower operation by blocking the way to the terrace and snapping the electricity. He used to hurl abuses on the company employees to mount pressure. When the company officials contacted him to resolve the dispute, he demanded money from them for the tower otherwise he would create problems for them. This way he extorted Rs 1.25 crore from the company in the name of rent. SP Thota said that when the company told Pyare Mian that they cannot sign an agreement with an individual but the housing society, then Pyare Mian formed the fake E-Block Lake View Welfare Society using the name of the actor and another eminent person without their knowledge. A few days later he removed the names of the actor and the eminent person and added the name of his family members and servants in society. In 2019 his advocate and accused in the case Sahabuddin Jamali filed fake audit reports of the society for a duration of eight years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pyare-had-used-bwood-actors-name-to-register-his-hsg-society/articleshow/77322826.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Trichy||Perambalur‚Äôs low count attributed to quarantine strategy||Trichy: With as many as 524 positive cases reported so far, including 207 active cases, Perambalur remains the district with the lowest number of Covid-19 cases in Tamil Nadu. Enforcement of mandatory quarantine for those returning from hotspot districts has worked well for the district in preventing large scale local spread.Beginning June, rigid screening has been conducted at the district borders, mainly focussing on returnees from Chennai, Thiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Chengalpattu districts. This has helped the district administration contain the local spread. Since June, Perambalur has managed to keep the positive cases in single digits on many days and there have even been days when the district reported zero cases.That the district has a low population compared to other districts has worked in its favour. Perambalur has a population of about 6 lakh people, but only V Kalathur and Labbaikudikadu towns are densely populated, health officials said. Even Perambalur town has a low population density. As the district has very few large-scale industries, officials said that influx of people from other districts was low during the lockdown. But with Perambalur natives working in other parts of the state and outside Tamil Nadu returning, four quarantine centres were established in the district. Quarantine centres in Perambalur, Veppanthattai, Veppur and Alathur blocks helped accommodate the returnees from hotspots. The returnees who tested negative were sent home under the condition that spent the next seven days under home quarantine. People returning from places that are not hotspots were told to under 14 days of home quarantine. ‚ÄúWe do not have any active clusters now, the cases presently turning positive are mostly family contacts. Fever camps conducted in the rural hamlets have also helped us to identify cases,‚Äù R Geetharani, deputy director of health services, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/perambalurs-low-count-attributed-to-quarantine-strategy/articleshow/77322813.cms||Deepak Karthik

August 3, 2020||Bhopal||Lack of demand, finance hit business||Bhopal: Industries in Madhya Pradesh, like any other parts of the country, continue to be under severe stress. Once in a century pandemic, after the global slowdown has hit the industries badly with most struggling to survive. Though post lockdown, the industries in Madhya Pradesh may have started functioning, albeit with reduced strength, partial or non -functioning of industries in many regions of the country coupled with a general drop in demand and consumption have impacted their performance badly. ‚ÄúThe whole eco -system is affected. You cannot run your unit in isolation till the units in Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat among others do not run in full swing,‚Äù said industrialists. The latest quarterly survey of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) assessed the sentiments of manufacturers for Q-1 and revealed a ‚Äúbleak status‚Äù for Q-1 (April-June 2020-21) compared to previous few quarters of 2019. High raw material prices, high cost of finance, uncertainty of demand, shortage of skilled labour and working capital, high logistic cost, low domestic and global demand due to lockdown across all countries to contain spread of coronavirus, excess capacities due to high volume of cheap imports into India, lack of financial assistance, unstable market, complex procedures for obtaining environmental clearances, high power tariff, are some of the major constraints which are affecting the future plans also, the survey said . Though the survey is not Madhya Pradesh specific, the industrial scene in the state is no different from other parts of the country, an office bearer of the FICCI commented. Pithampur Industrial area, one of the biggest industrial estates of MP, is under tremendous stress. There are about 850 units in the industrial area. Auto sector, comprising almost 25% of the estate, is one of the worst affected industrial sectors of the country. Sales of two, three and four-wheelers have nosedived during the pandemic. There were zero sales in April and May. President of Pithampur Audhogik Sangathan Gautam Kothari said, ‚Äúthe industrial units in Pithampur function at 20% to 50% strength.‚Äù Revealing an interesting statistic, president of the Mandideep Industry association Rajeev Agrawal told TOI, ‚Äúthe number of trucks carrying raw material has gone down considerably from about 500 daily to about 375 which sums up the industrial scene.‚Äù State chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry Anurag Shrivastava said, ‚ÄúI still see light at the end of the tunnel as people are learning new and positive things because people are locked down. We will ourselves have to figure out the best way to revive,‚Äù he said. Referring on the wish-list of industries, he said that few things all need from the state government was waiving off fixed power charges and relief in minimum wages payment to labourers. ‚ÄúBesides, we also want the government to consider waiving loan interest rates or extend flexibility as long as the industrial units are performing.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/lack-of-demand-finance-hit-business/articleshow/77322836.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

August 3, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: Residents, RWAs in tussle over closed gates||NEW DELHI: Even as the Covid-19 lockdown is being relaxed in phases, most residents‚Äô welfare associations (RWAs) are trying to play safe by controlling access to their areas to avoid the viral spread. But some residents are opposed to keeping most colony gates closed even in daytime. In some colonies, arguments have erupted after Delhi high court, on July 17, directed in a case filed by residents of N Block in Greater Kailash I that the gates should not be closed in daytime and without following guidelines. Some RWAs of GK-I & II, CR Park and Safdarjung Enclave claimed that they had to open the gates following similar demands from a few residents. ‚ÄúThe majority of residents is in favour of keeping the gates closed. We offered to give keys to those who wanted a specific gate open, but it didn‚Äôt work out,‚Äù said M K Gupta, president of S block RWA, GK-I. ‚ÄúWe finally opened the gate but wrote to the SHO of the local police station for enough force to regulate entry of unwanted people. The RWA doesn‚Äôt have so many guards,‚Äù he added. Vikram Badhwar, a resident, however, disagreed with him. ‚ÄúYou can find two-three guards sitting at each gate that‚Äôs open. Why can‚Äôt they be sent to other gates?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúWe raised our voice only after writing to the RWA twice for opening gate No. 3.‚Äù Closing a gate may be important for some senior citizens to avoid unnecessary traffic and honking, but roads are meant for commuting and barricading them is not legally correct, Badhwar said. ‚ÄúWhy should a person make a detour every time to reach the main road when there is a road right in front of his house?‚Äù An RWA member, however, claimed that only two guards were deployed at two entry gates while a third one made the rounds inside the colony. Many RWAs complained that more than convenience, some people had made opening a gate a prestige issue. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt mind putting others at risk,‚Äù a member said. Sangita Thukral, president of CR Park (M&P blocks) RWA, said, ‚ÄúThe association had problems with just two-three residents. We have five gates for 2,500 residents living in 27 houses in M, P, N and G blocks and 21 houses in Pocket 52. Out of these, one gate is used for entry and an open area for exit to check entry of unwanted people.‚Äù But, she alleged, a few people are also using the gate between M Block and GK II, putting ‚Äúthe security of residents living on this street at risk‚Äù. Members of most RWAs argued that keeping all gates open during Covid-19 would mean inviting trouble. B S Vohra, president of an umbrella group of east Delhi RWAs, said gates had been put up in colonies for people‚Äôs safety. ‚ÄúOften outsiders coming to local markets park their vehicles in residential colonies, creating trouble for locals.‚Äù Pankaj Agarwal of Safdarjung Enclave RWA, however, said restrictions should end during Unlock 3.0 ‚Äúas people have started going out in numbers‚Äù.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/residents-rwas-in-tussle-over-closed-gates/articleshow/77322061.cms||Vibha Sharma
August 3, 2020||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‚ÄòCovid-19 spread not uniform in all families‚Äô||AHMEDABAD: The virus that the experts warn about due to its high infection rate, is surprisingly not affecting families that have members with infection, claim a review study by IIPH Gandhinagar (IIPH-G) published in Quarterly Journal of Medicine by Oxford University Press. The study titled ‚ÄòSecondary Attack Rate of COVID-19 in Household Contacts: Systematic Review‚Äô is authored by Dr Komal Shah, Prof Dileep Mavalankar and Prof Deepak Saxena from IIPH-G. ‚ÄúThe assumption that everybody is susceptible to coronavirus may not be true. It is said that a few minutes of exposure to the coronavirus outside will get us infected. If that is the case, then why not everybody in the same household is getting Covid-19 (after one member gets infected)?‚Äù Prof Mavalankar said on Sunday. ‚ÄúThere are some families where all the members are infected, but they are not in majority. There are even homes where one person has died of Covid-19, but no other member is infected,‚Äù he added. Dr Shah told TOI that they took into consideration 13 global papers, including one from India, to conclude. ‚ÄúWe surely need more data and more understanding of the phenomenon. We know that it‚Äôs happening, but we don‚Äôt know why it is happening. IIPH-G has launched a ground-level study in Ahmedabad for the same,‚Äù she said. The paper argues that the secondary infection rate in households having at least one person infected varies from 4.6% to 49.6%. ‚ÄúThe rates were unaffected by confounders such as population of the country, lockdown status and geographic location. Review suggested greater vulnerability of spouse and elderly population for secondary transmission than other household members. It was also observed that quarantining and isolation are most effective strategies for prevention of the secondary transmission of the disease,‚Äôstated the paper. Prof Mavalankar also pointed at the ‚Äòimmunological dark matter‚Äô that claims that about half the population is not susceptible to the infection according to a theory propagated by Prof Karl Friston. He pointed at the example of central Ahmedabad that recorded a surge in cases in beginning of the infection but then the share got diminished over the months. City-based experts said that the claim requires more ground-level study and more testing of the family members of the positive patients to understand infection and spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-19-spread-not-uniform-in-all-families/articleshow/77322115.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Goa||Experts urge comorbid patients to seek help sooner||Panaji: The Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital‚Äôs head of pulmonary medicine has said that patients with comorbid conditions such as renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer or heart disease run a 50% higher risk of succumbing to Covid-19. ‚ÄúIt is advised that such persons take maximum precautions to keep the infection at bay,‚Äù said Dr Durga Lawande. A team from her department is deployed at the ESI-Covid hospital in Margao. While Goa‚Äôs fatality rate is less than 1%, the lowest in the country, the steadily-rising Covid-19 deaths have heightened concerns and fears. As of Sunday, 53 persons have died of the virus. Lawande also said that persons with compromised immune systems must ensure that they access medical help without delay, so that they can be saved before it‚Äôs too late. ‚ÄúGoa offers better medical care compared to other states,‚Äù Lawande said. ‚ÄúThere are beds available in the Covid hospital, unlike in other places, where patients contract the disease and, even if they have severe symtpoms, can‚Äôt get admission to a hospital.‚Äù She added that taking precautions and keeping oneself safe by observing social distancing norms and other measures are essential and the only option till a vaccine is discovered. She stressed that even a person who doesn‚Äôt have any serious health conditions must seek medical help on contracting the virus if there are any signs of their health deteriorating. Meanwhile, consultant ENT and head and neck oncology surgeon at Healthway Hospital, Dr Pawan Rane, said that a situation can be salvaged even if a persons with comorbid conditions gets the infection. ‚ÄúGet in touch with your physician or call the helpline. High-risk patients are best monitored at a designated Covid hospital,‚Äù he said. If it‚Äôs not possible to get admitted, isolate yourself and monitor for signs for breathlessness, he said. ‚ÄúIt is advisable to use a pulse oximeter.‚Äù The health minister also said that for cancer patients, the priority must be to survive the virus first and then fight the cancer. He said that cancer patients must continue treatment while simultaneously protecting themselves from Covid-19. A person with compromised immune systems must ensure that they access medical help without delay, so that they can be saved before it‚Äôs too late.

August 3, 2020||Jaipur||Over 6,200 active Covid cases are under home isolation||JAIPUR: More Covid positive patients in the state are under home isolation than in hospitals. Currently there are only 150 patients who are undergoing treatment in ICUs of different hospitals. Since the state government has allowed home isolation, asymptomatic patients are opting for it. ‚ÄúCurrently, we have 6,255 Covid positive patients under home isolation across the state,‚Äù said a senior health department official. Out of the 12,000 active cases, 52% are under home quarantine. A 68-year-old man, Adarsh (name changed), who tested positive said, ‚ÄúIt is much better to get treatment at home. However, you need a family member who is your caregiver and a medical officer who remains in touch.‚Äù While the state has witnessed a sudden spike in cases, the health department officials allow home isolation only if the patient has a separate toilet facility attached to his room. When a person tests positive, health department‚Äôs medical officers examine the health of the patient for categorising him as an asymptomatic, mild, severe or high risk patient and take the decision accordingly depending on the guidelines issued by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). ‚ÄúThose who are asymptomatic and does not need hospitalisation are kept under home isolation. We are following the ICMR guidelines. In Jaipur, more than 500 patients are under home isolation,‚Äù said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer, Jaipur-I. Officials said medical officers are constantly keeping a watch on the health of patients under home isolation. Besides, patient and his or her caregiver have also been asked to keep monitoring their health. However, the department officials claimed that they are also admitting patients to covid care centres and dedicated hospitals depending on their condition. Asymptomatic patients who do not have sufficient space for home isolation or who come under high risk category have been admitted to covid care centres under care of doctors. However, those who come under severe category and their condition have deteriorated are undergoing treatment in ICUs. ‚ÄúWe have 150 patients in ICUs who are in need of critical care,‚Äù said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-6200-active-covid-cases-are-under-home-isolation/articleshow/77322843.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Delhi||Delhi: Iconic bridge gets signature lighting||NEW DELHI: The Signature Bridge will now appear with a new look every evening, thanks to a theme-based lighting system that can showcase thousands of different patterns and customised lighting on special occasions. Sanjay Goel, the managing director and CEO of Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) that is executing the project, said there would be special lighting on not only the main platform and pylon of the bridge but also on its cables and even the approach roads. ‚ÄúA state-of-the-art technology has been used to give this aesthetic theme-based lighting at the bridge, which has thousands of different patterns that will keep changing every day and can be customised for occasions, particularly at the observatory,‚Äù Goel said. ‚ÄúThere will be separate focus lights on the cables, which will show different patterns every few minutes. One can see similar kinds of lighting in other international cities,‚Äù he added. Apart from being an important link between northeast Delhi and the rest of the city, the Signature Bridge has also been planned as a tourist spot by Delhi government and though delayed, work on different aspects of the project are going on. ‚ÄúAnother part of the project is 70% complete and we are expecting to ready by November a ramp that will ferry tourists from the approach part to the main deck, without disrupting the traffic on the bridge,‚Äù Goel said. ‚ÄúThere will be a small parking, caf√© and toilet near the approach area where tourists can have tea before taking the ramp along the approach road right up to the pylon,‚Äù he said, adding that the ramp is coming up along the bridge and veers towards the other side from below the bridge. In the area near the pylon, DTTDC is creating selfie points in an enclosed area but those who want a 360-degree view of Delhi from the observatory deck atop the bridge will have to wait. There are two inclined and two vertical elevators to access the four-storey viewers‚Äô gallery. ‚ÄúThe work is 100% complete and it is the first oblique lift in the country at 60 degrees, which goes to the top of the observatory. Right now we are using a service lift but a permission is needed for allowing tourists to use the lifts,‚Äù the CEO said. The point where tourists will shift from the oblique to the vertical lift has slight ‚Äúdifficulties‚Äù that are being modified to make the experience easy and user friendly, Goel added. A permission is required from the labour department‚Äôs inspector of lifts to ferry tourists. ‚ÄúOnce we get the permission, we can use the lifts for tourists. However, the lift is inside the pylon and the available area is less. We have to see how many tourists can go at one time and how long they can stay at the deck,‚Äù Goel said. The deck can accommodate up to 50 people at a time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iconic-bridge-gets-signature-lighting/articleshow/77322128.cms||Sidharatha Roy

August 3, 2020||Jaipur||Most critical patients ignored or hid symptoms: Doctors||JAIPUR: At least 150 Covid-19 patients are currently admitted to ICUs with 15 of them being on ventilator support. Doctors claim that patients are getting admitted with severe complications as they initially hide their symptoms. In just three days, 14 patients with complications have been admitted to ICUs. Doctors also claimed that one of the major reasons for Covid-19 mortalities is delay in getting treatment. ‚ÄúPatients are brought to the hospital with complications who require aggressive treatment. It is seen that initially, patients ignore the symptoms and hide their medical condition, which is quite wrong. They do it to ignore hospitalization but now government is allowing home isolation for patients with mild symptoms. So, they should consult the doctors in case of onset of mild symptoms,‚Äù said Dr Ajit Singh, additional superintendent, SMS Hospital. Even doctors working in the field have realized that people do not want to get the Covid-19 test done, especially those who are asymptomatic. ‚ÄúWe have to face problems while collecting samples from suspected Covid-19 patients, especially those who are asymptomatic as they say that they are fine. It is seen that they do not have any fear of Covid-19,‚Äù said Dr BL Meena, chief medical health officer, Bikaner, which is one of the worst-affected districts in the state. In a death audit conducted early in July, the health department had found that 78 patients who were tested positive for Covid-19, were actually brought dead to the hospital. Out of those 78 deaths, the death audit of 41 was conducted and it was found that in 10 cases, the family took late decision to rush the critical patient to the hospital. If five cases, the patients did not get treatment from the hospital on time. In 16 cases, no delay was found. In another five cases, deaths occurred due to non-Covid reasons such as suicide but they also tested positive for the virus. However, in other five cases, the deaths were not auditable as they belonged to other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/most-critical-patients-ignored-or-hid-symptoms/articleshow/77322848.cms||---

Tele-medicine started by NWR in its hospitals has been facilitating employees where they are getting doctors‚Äô advice and prescriptions. This has been done to minimise human contact during Covid times. Pushpa Lata (80), mother of a retired guard from Jaipur division of NWR, has been reluctant to visit the central railway hospital here. ‚ÄúWe have to book an appointment over phone. Thereafter on the day of appointment, we discuss health issues with the doctor. The doctor tells us to send previous test results and prescriptions through WhatsApp. Thereafter, any member of the family can go and get the medicines based on his prescription. This is a good initiative,‚Äù Lata said. Many senior citizens who are either retired railway employees or their dependents are everyday using the tele-medicines. ‚ÄúOnly in the cases of emergency, they are admitted or sent to our empanelled hospitals,‚Äù said a doctor at the hospital. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/telemedicine-facility-aids-nwr-staff/articleshow/77322847.cms||---

Babu‚Äôs wife, Jenny Rowena, called it a ‚Äúreal harassment‚Äù as NIA had come to pick up literature that was present in their house during last year‚Äôs raid. On September 10, 2019, Pune police raided the house in Delhi and seized laptops, books and other electronic materials. Rowena, also a DU teacher, told TOI, ‚ÄúAn NIA-Delhi team came to search for articles specifically related to the defence committee for the release of G N Saibaba. It took an external drive too. Even a permission letter for an event, which has been in the public domain, has been taken.‚Äù Babu‚Äôs custody ends on August 4 and the family will move a bail application. Babu, an English teacher, is the convener of the defence committee for Saibaba, a DU teacher with 90% disability who has been charged under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the case. The NIA team of 12 officials conducted the raid between 7.30am and 9.30am. They even spoke to Babu‚Äôs 17-year-old daughter. DU Teachers‚Äô Association (DUTA) has demanded a fair investigation and safeguards for his family.

August 3, 2020||Vadodara||Mock test questions erased from data base||VADODARA: A day after M S University‚Äôs attempt to conduct online exams crashed miserably, it has come to light that even questions that many teachers had set for the mock tests too have vanished from the database. Saturday turned out to be a test on embarrassment for MSU officials themselves after their plans to conduct mock test of nearly 4,000 students for two days crashed before it could click start. This test was supposed to a precursor to the semester-end exams that were scheduled to begin from August 5. Thousands of students could not even login on the portal that the university had developed even as the portal itself crashed. While the officials played victim of cyber attack, university‚Äôs ill-preparedness in organising such online exam in which over 17,000 students were scheduled to appear has become a topic of discussion. One of the faculty members of science complained that questions that an external faculty member had uploaded on the previous night are no longer visible on the portal. ‚ÄúThe count of the total number of questions is less than what it was earlier,‚Äù said another faculty member of science faculty. A commerce faculty teacher too had similar experience to share. ‚ÄúThe questions that were uploaded are not seen,‚Äù said the teacher. Hundreds of teachers had submitted thousands of questions for the online test using the user id and password allocated to them. But when they re-checked the set of questions using the code of the papers, the questions had simply vanished. Sources in the computer centre too confirmed that there has been damage to the database due to damage to the server. ‚ÄúMany teachers had uploaded their questions on the previous day or night before the mock test. The complete backup of this database could not be taken. Some unidentified professional agencies and hackers were already trying to disrupt the system from Friday evening,‚Äù said an official. Meanwhile, all eyes on its next move as both mock test and semester-end exams have been postponed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mock-test-questions-erased-from-data-base/articleshow/77320510.cms||---

The work will start from February and is scheduled for completion by mid- 2023. The NHAI will build an 8 km long 6-lane flyover between DND to Jaitpur along the Yamuna and the second package from Jaitpur to Ballabhgarh (25 km) via the existing bypass will be made a six-lane signal-free stretch. This two stretches will have six lane service roads for local traffic. NHAI officials said the third package from Ballabhgarh to Sohna (26 km), which is a Greenfield stretch, will be awarded this week. The construction work on the Sohna-Mumbai stretch is in full swing and the first stretch from Sohna to Dausa is scheduled for completion by November next year. ‚ÄúWorks have been awarded for about 1,000 km out of the 1,250 km. The bituminous work has started on certain portions,‚Äù said an official. The plan to extend the expressway to DND was included later. This will bring huge relief for commuters to get out of the capital by avoiding the congested Gurugram and Faridabad highway links. ‚ÄúThe commuters can take this road to head towards Agra and Jaipur. A new link would also be approved to provide direct connectivity from the expressway to Jewar airport,‚Äù said an official. Meanwhile, to ensure there is no fund crunch in execution of the Expressway project, the NHAI Board has approved setting up of a SPV, which will be fully-owned by the highways authority. ‚ÄúWe have started work to set up the SPV. If the model becomes successful, we will go for this model for financing of large highway projects,‚Äù NHAI chairman S S Sandhu told TOI. Sources said while NHAI will put Rs 5,000 crore as equity in the SPV, the special entity will raise the Rs 40,000 crore as loan. The loan will be repaid from toll revenue. The NHAI may also give a few more tolled stretches connecting this expressway to the SPV to recover the investment. ‚ÄúBy November 2021, one can drive from Delhi airport to Dausa. By that time we will complete the elevated road on Gurugram-Sohna stretch. So, one can take the Gurugram expressway from Delhi airport or Dhaula Kuan to Rajiv Chowk and from there can take the elevated road to reach Sohna,‚Äù an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/work-awarded-for-new-delhi-mumbai-e-way-link/articleshow/77325295.cms||Dipak K Dash

Ahmedabad has 251 BRT AC buses. The metro rail systems are also air-conditioned. Experts are now reworking air-conditioning systems to ensure better ventilation. ‚ÄúThe fear of an air-conditioning system seeding a mass infection cannot be dismissed,‚Äù said a senior AMC official. ‚ÄúSeating has to be redesigned too.‚Äù Surat, Rajkot, and Vadodara have already sent signals to bus operators about massive cuts in operational costs. These cities are planning to improve their footpaths and establish better parking facilities, anticipating an increase in the use of personal transport. An interesting trend is that the sales of petrol and diesel in Gujarat have reached up to 70% and 75% of the pre-Covid levels respectively. At the same time, there has been a drastic drop between 73% and 92% in passenger traffic in all forms of public transport. Many citizens have opted for personal transport. Scores of people such as students, the elderly, and women have preferred to stay back home. Autorickshaws, shared autos, and dial-a-cab operators are running at 30% capacities in Ahmedabad and Surat. All told, city and intercity bus businesses are losing crores every month, making it difficult for operators to meet even staff expenses. Pranav Shah, regional director, Gujarat, Federation of Automobile Dealers‚Äô Association, said: ‚ÄúMore than 85% of vehicle inquiries come from people who earlier used cabs or public transport.‚Äù Shah further said: ‚ÄúThis has caused a rise in demand for two-wheelers. However, two-wheeler buyers are the ones whose incomes have been massively impacted due to the lockdown.‚Äù In Ahmedabad, Vadodara, and Rajkot sales of cars, bicycles, and two-wheelers are increasing. In Rajkot, Harish Chandra, the CEO of a car dealership, said: ‚ÄúIn July, we achieved pre-Covid-level car sales in the mid and luxury segments, while entry-level cars sales have surged by 5%.‚Äù Shyam Raichura, a two-wheeler dealer in Rajkot, said: ‚ÄúThe demand for two-wheelers in July surged past January and February numbers by 25%.‚Äù In Vadodara, a two-wheeler showroom owner, Tapan Parikh, said: ‚ÄúWe sold over 200 vehicles over the past three months and half of them were bought by our customers on loan.‚Äù Another surprise is the sale of bicycles which is gradually going up. In Vadodara, Kuntal Parikh, a bicycle shop owner, said: ‚ÄúThe demand is up by 30-40%.‚Äù In Ahmedabad, the bicycle-sharing model has seen a surge in rentals from 2,000 a month during the pre-Covid months to 8,000 by July, said Arjit Soni, the founder of MyByk. The overall mobility of cities has gone down. Transport experts said that Ahmedabad recorded a 60% mobility drop, while Surat registered a 35% dive. In Ahmedabad, Ashok Punjabi, a member of the autorickshaw drivers‚Äô action committee, said: ‚ÄúWith the new two-people per auto rule, the shared-rickshaw culture of the city has taken a major hit.‚Äù He further said: ‚ÄúOur average earning of Rs 600-700 per day has come down to Rs 200.‚Äù AMTS chairman Atul Bhavsar said, ‚ÄúThe number of passengers per bus has been restricted to 18. We usually paid Rs 40 per km to operators, but now we pay just 30% of this sum for idle buses.‚Äù (Inputs from Himanshu Kaushik, Nimesh Khakhariya, Melvyn Thomas, Niyati Parikh, Sachin Sharma)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/virus-changes-travel-mass-transits-appeal-masked/articleshow/77322192.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Patna||Bihar police to get lookout notice against Rhea Chakraborty: DGP Gupteshwar Pandey||PATNA: Bihar police may get a lookout notice issued against actress Rhea Chakraborty, who has been absconding since Bollywood actor late Sushant Singh Rajput‚Äôs father K K Singh lodged an FIR against her in Patna, alleging that she abetted his son to commit suicide besides cheating him financially, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey said on Sunday. ‚ÄúThe state police would go to the extent of getting a lookout circular issued against Rhea and other accused in the case to prevent her from leaving the country. She is absconding. She has her own sources in Mumbai for helping her out there,‚Äù Pandey told TOI. The state police headquarters has also sent Patna City SP (central) Vinay Tiwary to Mumbai to lead the four-member Patna police team already there since July 27 to investigate the case. Tiwary, an IPS officer, reached Mumbai at around 4pm. But the Mumbai civil administration quarantined the Patna SP on the grounds of Covid-19 protocols. Sources said a woman IPS officer will also be sent to trace Rhea and liaison with Mumbai police to procure all necessary documents for carrying out the investigation in Sushant‚Äôs suicide case. The Patna police team visited Malwani police station to collect details of Sushant‚Äôs former manager Disha Salian‚Äôs mysterious suicide a few days before the actor from Patna was found hanging at his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14. A senior IPS officer said the state police would have to write to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for a lookout notice against Rhea. ‚ÄúIt is the MHA which finally issues the circular so that the intelligence bureau of immigration keeps surveillance on every exit point, especially at airports, in the country for those against whom a lookout circular is issued,‚Äù he said. DGP Pandey said Mumbai police were yet to share even a single document with the Patna police team. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want any special favour from Mumbai police. Besides medico-legal documents like forensic, inquest and postmortem reports, we need statements of people recorded by the Mumbai police. We want to know what information they had shared with Mumbai police,‚Äù the DGP said. A senior IPS officer said the state police headquarters would send a woman IPS officer who could liaison with her counterparts in Maharashtra police to make things easy for Patna police team members, who are conducting investigation in Mumbai in a virtually hostile environment. He said the woman officer hails from Maharashtra. When asked, DGP Pandey told TOI that she would hopefully be sent to Mumbai soon. ‚ÄúHowever, we have not taken a final call yet,‚Äù he said. Pandey said Tiwary was sent to Mumbai to meet senior police officers there. ‚ÄúI am not very sure, but they may share important medico-legal documents with him,‚Äù Pandey said. The DGP said Tiwary will also monitor the course of investigation and give task to Patna police team in Mumbai every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-police-to-get-lookout-notice-against-rhea-dgp/articleshow/77322142.cms||Debashish Karmakar
August 3, 2020||Lucknow||UP: Diwali bonanza comes early for Ayodhya potters||JAISINGHPUR (AYODHYA): When an unknown number rang on Ravindra Prajapati‚Äôs cellphone on July 25, he dismissed it as spam. When he picked up the phone in the second go, the leader of 40 potter families in Jaisinghpur, about 30km from the temple town, was dancing in joy. Prajapati was given a mammoth order of making 1.50 lakh earthen lamps for the bhoomi pujan of Ram temple. For these potters, it came as an advance Diwali bonanza. ‚ÄúIt is a bonus‚Ä¶‚Äù he shouted and called the community to share the happiness. ‚ÄúThanks to Ram Lalla, this off season opportunity has brought smiles for all of us,‚Äù Prajapati said. ‚ÄúBhoomi pujan is a historic moment and we have urged the people of Ayodhya to celebrate the moment by lighting earthen lamps,‚Äù said Champat Rai, the general secretary of Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. Soon after the call, potters in Ayodhya got into action. On Sunday, potters of Jaisinghpur dispatched over 75,000 earthen lamps to mark the return of Ram from ‚Äòsecond exile‚Äô (the lord had been in a makeshift tarpaulin roof since the demolition of Babri Masjid. Now he has been moved to his original abode on janmabhoomi premises). ‚ÄúMen, women and children across 40 families in our village have been working overtime to complete the order,‚Äù said Rajesh Prajapati, whose family has made over 25,000 lamps. His relative Poonam said the order came as a blessing in disguise. Rainy season, however, threw a major challenge before potters. ‚ÄúThere was no sunlight. Also, the humidity content in the air is high. Both the things prolonged the drying up process. So, the freshly made lamps were dried under the fan. In fact, pedestal fans were also deployed to speed up the process,‚Äù said Rakesh.

August 3, 2020||Bhopal||State moves down to 15th position in positive cases||Bhopal: The state capital recorded a positivity rate of 13% in the last week of July. This was the highest rate of growth in corona-hit cases in the entire state during this period, said additional chief secretary of health Mohammed Suleman on Sunday. The 13% positivity rate is far above the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation to keep the rate below 5% to contain the spread of the disease. It is exactly due to the high rate that the government has increased tests in Bhopal where 51,129 tests per million population is being conducted as of now. This means that out of every 100 people tested at least 13 were found positive in recent times. Talking about the covid-19 management in the state with mediapersons, Suleman said, ‚ÄúThe death rate in the state was 10% in April, but it has now reduced to 2.7%. In April we had 2400 general beds, now we have 26000 general beds,‚Äù he said. In April only 600 tests were being done on per million population, which has now increased to 9334 tests per million, he informed. The state has also moved down to become the 15th state with largest number of positive cases. It is only the 10 districts of state which have the maximum number of positive cases and have contributed to 71% of the total case load of the entire state. Among the districts, with the positivity rate above 5% in 7-day days are Bhopal (13%), Barwani (10%), Indore (8.3%), Jabalpur (7.7%) and Khargone (7%). No wonder, the government is focusing more on testing in these districts. Interestingly, Bhopal has now not only outnumbered Indore in having highest number of active cases, but when it comes to positive persons per million population, here too a whopping 3122 patients out of every 10 lakh population have tested positive in state capital as compared to only 2655 in Indore. Suleman said that since the treatment capacity in terms of number of beds and ICU beds has increased in the state, the current occupancy of general beds is only 22% and ICU beds is 29.9%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/state-moves-down-to-15th-position-in-positive-cases/articleshow/77322856.cms||Amarjeet Singh

August 3, 2020||Mumbai||BMC to zoom in on education for kids with lecture playlist||In an ambitious effort to get children back into classrooms, BMC has launched an online education initiative using its best teachers for each subject in all four mediums ‚Äì Marathi, Hindi, Urdu and English. Live Zoom classes, which start next week, will be accessible to state government school children via YouTube, which will stay online as a knowledge repository. ‚ÄúAnyone in Maharashtra can access it, so you can go revisit the lecture at any time anywhere,‚Äù said joint municipal commissioner in charge of education Ashutosh Salil. ‚ÄúWe are opening our umbrella to the whole state.‚Äù There are around 10,000 teachers on BMC payrolls, working with 1,100 schools here. ‚ÄúBeat officers work closely with headmasters and teachers and are identifying schools with a track record in say 10th grade Algebra or 9th grade Biology,‚Äù said Shubham Pareek, a Fellow working on policy and projects at BMC. If the lecture is not deemed good enough, another teacher will record the subject and it will be uploaded on the channel playlist. The next day‚Äôs timetable will also be posted. While the idea of curated remote learning will be fantastic in a world where every child has a device and internet connectivity, education officials are aware of the lack of access and are trying to find ways to get around the problem. Blended learning, which involves use of worksheets, notebooks, and supervision by senior students, are some possibilities. ‚ÄúOur teachers have been identifying senior students who have been mentoring younger students in slums or neighbourhoods,‚Äù said Salil. ‚ÄúWhile I am a great advocate of technology, we cannot rely on it entirely. The access problem will not go go away.‚Äù Data shows that 50% children do not have access to devices, or have to share a device between siblings and parents, said Shaheen Mistri of Teach for India, which works closely with BMC schools. ‚ÄúPost-lockdown, once their parents return to work, we anticipate that problem getting worse,‚Äù says Mistri. ‚ÄúBut the YouTube channel is a great step. We strongly recommend that we find the best teachers from within and outside the system to make it work. Teaching online requires different skills ‚Äî you have to exaggerate movement, be more animated and find ways to keep kids engaged,‚Äù she added. While online education has been happening via WhatsApp and Zoom, it has been random and ad hoc depending on the teacher‚Äôs network access, availability and ability to work the medium. This system will be supervised from the top. BMC had been broadcasting well-taught classes via satellite to its other schools. This is the first time it will be in entirety, and through the school year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-to-zoom-in-on-edu-for-kids-with-lecture-playlist/articleshow/77322612.cms||Namita Devidayal
August 3, 2020||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 300 sailors await return from UAE||AHMEDABAD: More than 300 crew members of several cargo and merchant ships, which have remained docked at ports in the United Arab Emirates, are awaiting Vande Bharat mission flights to return to Gujarat. A majority of the crew members are from Salaya in Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar and Kutch districts. These crew members work on various harbours and are engaged for loading and off-loading cargo. Some also travel with ships to other destinations from ports of the UAE. With cargo handling having come to a standstill, these crew members are left with little funds to return and are awaiting Vande Bharat flights. NRG businessman Bharat Joshi, who has so far facilitated the return of 1,550 stranded persons from various parts of the UAE back to Gujarat, says he visited the ships and found the crew members and workers did not have adequate money to return to Gujarat by chartered flights. ‚ÄúThese workers got in touch with me over social media and sought help. They say that the merchant ships are not returning to Gujarat any time soon and they do not have adequate money to bear costs of tickets of chartered flights. The government should operate more Vande Bharat flights from the UAE,‚Äù Joshi said. ‚ÄúI am from Jamnagar and there are more than 300 of us here who are waiting to return to Gujarat. We are appealing to the government to take us home through Vande Bharat mission flights. There is no work or money,‚Äù said Hussain Mohammed, a crew on one of the ships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/300-sailors-await-return-from-uae/articleshow/77322193.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Jaipur||Rakhi shopping takes a big hit in city due to pandemic||Jaipur: The presence of Covid-19 has affected everything and festivals are no different. The markets which are otherwise crowded on the eve of Rakshabandhan, failed to lure crowds despite a Sunday. Women in limited numbers were seen in the markets to select the best rakhi, sweets and chocolates for their brothers. However, many women have prioritised social distancing this year and have preferred to send their rakhi by post or online despite living in the same city. On Sunday, the Walled City markets including Purohit ji Ka Katla and Chandpole, where rakhis are sold in wholesale, had a limited number of customers. ‚ÄúAb darr to hai par tyohaar bhi manana hai (Though we have fear still festival needs to be celebrated,‚Äù said Sangeeta Sharma, who was getting some pairs of rakhis for her brothers at Chandpole. Shimona Sharma, a housewife living in Pratap Nagar, who has an 8-month-old child, has preferred to send her Rakhi online to her brother and cousins even though they live in the Pink City. ‚ÄúI have been advised to take proper precaution because of my infant son and also for my ageing father-in-law and mother-in-law. I think my cousins and brother understand this and I would like to tell them that I want them to be safe as well,‚Äù Sharma added. Meanwhile, the pandemic has also enhanced demand for customized rakhis. ‚ÄúWe are making rakhis having pictures of brothers pasted on them and on order we are delivering them to the doorstep of the brothers. Compared to previous years, we have got good number of orders,‚Äù said Ramesh Sharma, a maker of customized rakhis. On the other hand, a limited number of people were seen at sweet shops which have curtailed the quantity of sweets they are preparing. ‚ÄúEvery year prior to rakhi I order 100kg of mawa (milk extract), but this year I have got only 25kg as customers are very few,‚Äù said Vikram Agarwal, owner of a sweet shop at Vaishali Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rakhi-shopping-takes-a-big-hit-in-city-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/77322862.cms||---

Investigators had collected around 1,000 samples from healthcare workers in R-North (Dahisar), M-West (Chembur) and F-North (Sion, GTB Nagar, Matunga) wards. The first study found 57% sero-prevalence in slums and 16% sero-prevalence in non-slums. Investigators said it will be interesting to see results of frontline workers as it is known to be indicative of the general spread of the virus among people. An investigator hinted that while one may think more healthcare workers will be infected, the results are likely to spring a surprise. Authorities appealed to people to participate in the second phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/study-findings-on-frontline-staff-likely-this-week/articleshow/77322613.cms||Richa Pinto
August 3, 2020||Jaipur||Rs 3,024 crore for dept under ‚Äòrebel‚Äô Pilot not cleared by state finance wing||JAIPUR: The finance department has not yet released the state finance commission (SFC-V) grant of Rs 3,024 crore to the rural development and panchayati raj department, which came under the ministry held by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, for the 2019-20 period. This was revealed in a presentation given by the rural development and panchayati raj department on issues it had with various departments to the state-level development and coordination committee, headed by chief secretary Rajeeva Swarup, on July 30. Under the head, 'inter-departmental issues', the presentation stated that the fund was part of the state finance commission (SFC-V) grant. The finance department is under the ministry held by chief minister Ashok Gehlot. It also pointed out that Rs 1,883.25 crore from the central share was pending as the state share of Rs 1,262.53 crore for implementing MGNREGA, Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana (PMAY-G), National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), National Rural Economic Transformation Project (NRETP) and Border Area Development Programme (BADP) schemes has not been released.

Under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY-WC), bills amounting to over Rs 45 crore are pending at treasury and bills amounting to Rs 90 crore pending for sending to treasury, the presentation pointed out. This would delay the second instalment of Rs 116 crore from the Centre.

August 3, 2020||Jaipur||Sister of slain kar sevaks to attend Ayodhya function||JAIPUR: Nearly 30 years after two brothers, both kar sevaks, were killed in police firing in Ayodhya, their sister Purnima Kothari has been invited to the foundation stone-laying ceremony of Ram Temple. The family, which is associated with business, spent their childhood in Bikaner before they migrated to Kolkata. On the eve of Raksha Bandhan, TOI spoke to Purnima who has been offering rakhi to her two brothers ‚Äî Ram Kothari and Sharad Kothari ‚Äî who were killed in police firing in Ayodhya on November 2, 1990, when the kar sevaks were returning after offering flags at the disputed land. ‚ÄúWe spent our childhood in Bikaner and still have many relatives there. Even after 30 years, I still believe my brothers will come and see me,‚Äù said Purnima in choked voice while talking to TOI over phone from Kolkata on Sunday On her invitation, she said, ‚ÄúI am associated with various Ram Bhakt groups and they all are happy to know that I have been invited to witness the foundation stone-laying ceremony. I also believe had my brothers were alive they would have certainly attended the event,‚Äù she said. Recalling the incident when her brothers decided to go to Ayodhya in 1990, she said, ‚ÄúI was 19 years old when my father first asked my brothers not to go there. My father opined that we belong to business family so we can always contribute monetarily. However, my elder brother Ram told my father that they have to go for Lord Rama. And while my father asked my youngest brother to stay back, he said he will follow his elder brother Ram Kothari wherever he goes.‚Äù Purnima has been offering rakhi in front of the photos of her brother every year at their Kolkata-based house. ‚ÄúEven after 30 years I still have intact memories of my childhood and sometimes I believe that my brothers have gone somewhere and will come back. On Rakshabandhan, I only tie rakhi to my cousins in person while to my two brothers I offer to their photos and pray,‚Äù she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sister-of-slain-kar-sevaks-to-attend-ayodhya-function/articleshow/77322858.cms||Ashish Mehta

August 3, 2020||Trichy||Social distancing goes for toss in front of Tasmac outlets in Trichy||Trichy: Several Tasmac outlets in parts of Trichy city are always seen crowded by tipplers without maintaining physical distancing as authorities are not enforcing safety measures. Although Tasmac officials claim that liquor sale has been down by 30% in the district during the lockdown, there is persistent footfall at most of the liquor outlets here, particularly between 7pm and 8pm. Of the total 177 Tasmac outlets in the district, 60 are in the city. Wooden barricades are set up in front of Tasmac outlets to ensure distancing, but the measures were followed only during the initial days, say locals. Tasmac outlets in densely populated Gandhi market, Rockfort, Thennur and Marakkadai witnesses dozens of tipplers thronging the counters to buy liquor at a time.‚ÄúA month back, authorities had sealed a bakery for not maintaining social distancing. Going by that precedence, officials should have sealed several Tasmac outlets in the city where social distancing is ignored,‚Äù said T Senthil Kumar, a resident of Palakkarai. The liquor outlets that start their business by 10am are supposed to down their shutters by 8pm, but serpentine queues at the counters at the last minute cause chaos.Tasmac employees or police personnel are supposed to control the crowd at Tasmac shops, but it is rarely enforced. Daily wagers usually throng the Tasmac shops near Gandhi market after completing their work and had even caused bottlenecks in commercial streets recently. The liquor outlets located in residential areas like Babu road in Rockfort give residents the jitters visiting grocery stores nearby or returning from work. While Saturdays see a heavy rush, the situation is no different during closing hours. ‚ÄúWe will request the city police to enhance surveillance at the crowded shops and inform our employees to ensure social distancing,‚Äù said R Parthiban, district manager, Tasmac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/social-distancing-goes-for-toss-in-front-of-tasmac-outlets-in-trichy/articleshow/77322854.cms||Deepak Karthik

Over 3.5 lakh more people have been marooned compared to 49,05,007 till late Saturday evening. An embankment of Tirhut canal breached in Mohammadpur Kothi panchayat area under the Sakra police station in Muzaffarpur early Sunday morning, inundating several adjoining villages near Pilkhi under Muraul block. The over 50 feet wide breach was caused due to the pressure of floodwaters in the canal which is connected to Burhi Gandak river. NDRF teams have been deployed in the area for relief work. The floodwaters have inundated 113 blocks. While 13 people have died so far, 4,03,269 people have been evacuated to safer places as 31 NDRF and SDRF teams are carrying out rescue and relief operations in the affected areas. The Mahananda was rising as well as flowing above the danger mark at Taiyabpur in Kishanganj and Dhangaraghat in Purnia. Similarly, Burhi Gandak, Kamla Balan, Ghaghra, Kosi and Khiroi rivers either showed a rising trend or remained steady. These rivers, however, were flowing above the danger mark at all flood gauge stations in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Khagaria, Madhubani, Siwan and Darbhanga districts. Bagmati river was above the danger mark at almost all flood gauge stations in Sitamarhi, but had a falling trend at most places. The Ganga was rising at Buxar, Digha (Patna), Munger and Bhagalpur, but remained below the danger mark. The Patna Meteorological Centre has issued yellow alert (thunderstorm with lightning and rainfall likely at one or two places) for the north Bihar districts on Monday and orange alert (moderate thunderstorm with lightning and heavy rain likely at one or two places) for all the districts on Tuesday.

August 3, 2020||Ahmedabad||Vegetable traders back on the roads in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Vegetable traders of the city are back on the roads again with the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) authorities continuing to deny permission to trade at the Jamalpur APMC market. This led to heated arguments between police and the traders on Saturday. The traders had on Saturday forcibly entered the market. Later, police made the traders vacate the premises. Bharat Khamar, the president of the Ahmedabad Vegetable General Commission Agent Cooperative Society, said that the traders then went to Jetalpur and conducted business on the service road outside the APMC. Khamar said that the government has relaxed Covid norms and the night curfew has been lifted as well. So he wondered why the APMC and civic authorities are reluctant to give permission for trading at Jamalpur. The traders were shifted from Jamalpur in April and since then have been trading from Jetalpur. Khamar said that Jetalpur shopkeepers are not renting out their premises and so vegetable traders are carrying out transactions on the roads. He said that the traders are willing to follow the odd-even formula and restrict trade but the authorities are not willing to grant permission. A trader said that he like others was asked to shift from Jamalpur to Jetalpur till August 1. When there was no communication from the authorities, the traders rushed to Jamalpur only to be met by police. On the other hand, police told the traders they had been clearly informed that the APMC is closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vegetable-traders-back-on-the-roads/articleshow/77322196.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Online hiring needs better preparation, say experts||CHENNAI: Students need better than the routine preparation to get selected in a virtual hiring process, said recruiters. Recruitment managers say it will be difficult for companies to understand a student‚Äôs body language and background in an online interview. ‚ÄúThe duration of the interview will be shorter. Only if students are able to impress in the first few minutes, the interview will last longer,‚Äù a top recruiter from the IT industry said. Though virtual, these interviews will no way be casual. ‚ÄúOur recruitment process ‚Äï from evaluation to onboarding is 100% digital now,‚Äù said Suresh Bethavandu, vice-president and global head, talent acquisition at Cognizant. ‚ÄúBut it can sometimes take more effort to articulate one‚Äôs thoughts and highlight achievements/capabilities virtually. So virtual hiring calls for better preparation,‚Äù he said. Prasad Srinivas, director of Analog Devices India, said Covid-19 will have an impact on campus hiring this year. ‚ÄúNothing can replace a face-to-face interview because it gives an opportunity to look at the person, have an open conversation and look at the student‚Äôs body language. Online interviews will always be a limitation, but there are sophisticated tools that would help to assess a candidate‚Äôs technical knowledge, aptitude and competence,‚Äù he said. For logistics tech firm Fourkites, the company will hire up to 60% of the numbers selected last year. ‚ÄúWe have got the dates from colleges and will begin recruiting in October. The evaluation process will be through video interviews, and hence the challenge would be more in exhibiting their soft skills,‚Äù said Neeraj Sharma, VP, HR, Fourkites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/online-hiring-needs-better-preparation-say-experts/articleshow/77322224.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Coimbatore||CMCH to begin plasma therapy on Covid patients||Coimbatore: The Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) is likely to start plasma therapy on Covid-19 patients with moderate symptoms from next week on a trial basis. The health department has asked willing plasma donors to register with the hospital from Monday. P Kalidas, CMCH dean, said, ‚ÄúWe have necessary equipment to collect plasma from donors. We are in the process of enrolling recovered patients who are willing to donate plasma. We are planning to form a separate team to carry out this task. If everything goes well, we will start plasma therapy within six to seven working days after obtaining permission from higher officials.‚Äù Plasma is separated from blood by way of plasmapheresis. The hospital management has placed orders for plasmapheresis kits, which are expected to arrive in a few days. A Mangayarkarasi, medical officer, CMCH blood bank, said, ‚ÄúTo start with, we will perform plasma therapy on patients who are moderately ill to prevent them from getting worse. For this, we need plasma donors and are in touch with blood donor organizations for the same.‚Äù The therapy is not required for asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms. ‚ÄúThe plasma should be donated within 15 days after a Covid-19 patient tests negative for the virus or within 28 days of onset of symptoms. In the case of women, only those who have neither given birth nor had miscarriage or abortion would be allowed to donate. The donor should also satisfy all the criteria that are required for blood donation,‚Äù the medical officer said. Pointing out that several patients, who have recovered from Covid-19, from the first batch were willing to donate plasma, she said they were not eligible for donation now. ‚ÄúWe did not do plasma therapy then, as there wasn‚Äôt any demand.‚Äù While the hospital authorities are confident of finding donors to meet the demand for plasma, coordinators of blood donor organizations said awareness need to be created on the same among the public. P Nagaraj, coordinator of blood donor organization Makkal Needhi Maiam, said, ‚ÄúIn general, people are hesitant to donate blood. Because of Covid-19 scare, blood donation has come down. In addition to it, people are hesitant to reveal they were infected or recovered from the virus. In that case, it would be difficult to ask them to donate plasma. But things would change once we start to sensitize the public.‚Äù Nagaraj, along with two other organizations, have decided to work together to help CMCH get plasma. There are, however, always exceptions. Deepakumar, 36, who is undergoing Covid-19 treatment at a private hospital, said he would donate plasma as soon as the government hospital starts accepting the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-to-begin-plasma-therapy-on-covid-patients/articleshow/77322216.cms||Nivedha Selvam

She was 62. Kamal Rani had tested positive on July 18 and was being treated at Lucknow‚Äôs Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences. According to a statement from the hospital, ‚Äúshe died of multi-organ dysfunction at 9:30am‚Äù. Kamal Rani‚Äôs death coincided with UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh testing positive for the virus. He has gone into quarantine in his Lucknow home. Overall, six ministers in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet have so far contracted the virus. Former Lucknow deputy mayor Abhay Seth and former minister Ghura Ram died of Covid-19 within 10 days of each other in July. CM Adityanath termed the demise of Kamal Rani, a Dalit MLA representing Kanpur‚Äôs Ghatampur assembly constituency, an ‚Äúirreparable loss‚Äù to his government and the people she served. President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Narendra Modi posted tweets hailing her as a grass roots leader. ‚ÄúHer life was devoted to social service and she played a vital role in strengthening BJP in the state.

August 3, 2020||Jaipur||Subsidised food at Rs 8 soon||JAIPUR: The state government will launch its ambitious Indira Rasoi scheme on August 20 to provide food at subsidised rates to poor. These kitchens will be set up at 358 locations of 213 urban local bodies after spending Rs 100 crore on the scheme. In a review meeting, chaired by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Rs 8 was fixed per plate for poor. An official said, ‚ÄúTo develop the infrastructure, the state government will provide Rs 4.87 lakh to each operator. Every year, Rs 2 lakh grant will also be provided. The cost per plate will be Rs 20, however, it will be provided on subsidised rates. The consumer has to pay only Rs 8 per plate.‚Äù As per the strategy, these kitchens will be established near bus stands, hospitals and railway stations. The municipal corporations, councils and municipalities are on the task to earmark locations. After the change in regime, the Congress government is all set to overhaul the Annapurna Rasoi scheme launched by former chief minister Vasundhara Raje to serve food at subsidised rates across the state. The reason for the move is that the existing Congress government wants to provide food to the poor, after spending money in a transparent manner. ‚ÄúThe monitoring of the scheme will be done using IT technology. Those beneficiaries who have mobile phones will receive a coupon via SMS. CCTV cameras will also be installed for monitoring,‚Äù said another official. In previous tenure, the state government spent approximately Rs 240 crore to provide food at 495 locations in 191 urban local bodies. After coming to power, on UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal‚Äôs direction, a team of officials went to Chennai and Bengaluru to study the Amma Canteen and Indira Canteen schemes, respectively. The team in its report had submitted that the government can provide food to the poor at subsidised rate after making the expenditure on the existing scheme half.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/subsidised-food-at-rs-8-soon/articleshow/77322869.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Mysuru||Despite easing of lockdown, few venture out in Mysuru||Mysuru: Even as the lockdown restrictions were lifted on Sunday, the movement of people and traffic was less in Mysuru city, while the two famous temples of the district, the Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi hills and Sri Srikanteshwara Swami Temple in Nanjanagud, remained shut for devotees. A majority of the commercial establishments in the city remained shut today, as less people ventured out. The roads had a deserted look with the public preferring to stay indoors. Yathiraj Sampathkumar, executive officer, Sri Chamundeshwari Temple, said the temple was shut on Sundays even before the Sunday lockdown announcement. Similarly, Nanjnagud Temple was also shut today morning after daily puja rituals were performed. As Monday is Shravana full moon day, the temple will remain closed to devotees as per the directions of the district administration, to ensure that there will not be any rush. However, the Malai Mahadeshwara Swamy Temple on MM Hills was opened for devotees on Sunday, after a break of nearly four months. ‚ÄúThe temple was opened as usual at 7 am for devotees,‚Äù said authorities. Devotees can have darshan on all 7 days of the week, said Jayavibhava Swamy, secretary, Sri Malai Mahadeshwara Swamy Kshetra development Authority, MM Hills. According to the authorities, mass feeding has been restarted in the temple. Nagamail bhavan of the temple was thrown open for the devotees to stay. However no prasadm is given to devotees and the barrin of utsavs at the temple continues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/despite-easing-of-lockdown-few-venture-out-in-mysuru/articleshow/77320696.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Kolkata||Beliaghata, Kankurgachhi are among Kolkata‚Äôs biggest containment-zones||KOLKATA: The latest additions to the containment zone list 48 hours ago have brought Beliaghata-Phoolbagan-Kankurgachhi belt back under the scanner. At present, the area has as many as 11 containment zones ‚Äî spread across posh complexes, slums, mixed zones and even markets. Just like Bhowanipore-Ballygunge in the south, this zone has continued to be part of the containment list with fears of spread of virus to neighbouring areas like Maniktala (now on the list) and Ultadanga (on earlier lists). So, the Beliaghata-Kankurgachhi-Phoolbagan belt is now one of Kolkata‚Äôs biggest containment zones, with each area reporting over 50 active cases. According to police and KMC, while they have received success in Ultadanga‚Äôs Telengabagan and Karbagan, the same cannot be said about Suren Sarkar Street that presently has four containment zones. While the area coordinator has pointed to its proximity to Salt Lake that has reported hundreds of cases, the fact remains that this area ‚Äî a mix of slums and flats ‚Äî has multiple access points. The residents from different strata of society have resumed work after the Unlock-1. The police, though, said they were not looking at ‚Äúone-pill solution‚Äù to the rising Covid cases. ‚ÄúIn the initial days, controlling crowds at markets like Rashmoni Bazar and Chaulpatty had helped in checking the virus spread. Now that Covid has reached apartments, we are choosing the highest affected zones by rotation ‚Äî one by one ‚Äî instead of shutting down the entire area and concentrating on controlling the disease,‚Äù said an officer at Lalbazar. The police have already barricaded slums, apartments and even markets that can possibly spread the virus. ‚ÄúThe mixed areas have received maximum attention and our maximum manpower,‚Äù said a police officer. KMC has now proposed to carry out antigen tests at specific locations to stop the spread of the disease to neighbouring areas. Anindya Raut, the borough chief, said he was open to trying the ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù containment policy. ‚ÄúInstead of shutting down everything, we can then concentrate only on the affected buildings. That‚Äôs out focus are now,‚Äù he said. Beliaghata resident Anubrata Mitra, who is a resident of Raja Rajendra Lal Mitra Road, said when he had returned from Delhi, locals had requested him to go for a two-week quarantine. ‚ÄúThat was the time when Beliaghata strated recording Covid deaths. The timings of the markets were regulated and people were following lockdown rules. I had gladly quarantined myself as that was the need of the hour. But now, except at the containment zones, there is hardly any self-restraint,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/beliaghata-kankurgachhi-are-among-kols-biggest-c-zones/articleshow/77322226.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
August 3, 2020||Vadodara||Brave army brothers in Galwan get rakhis from sisters across India||VADODARA: Despite being miles away from their families, the wrists of hundreds of soldiers standing guard at Galwan on Indo-Chinese border will not miss the rakhis on Monday. Women from eight states have sent the soldiers colourful rakhis on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan to help these brothers who are braving the tough weather and Chinese army aggression feel loved and protected. ‚ÄúThe soldiers posted at Galwan border gave a great sacrifice to protect our borders. They ensured that we remained safe so we decided to extend our gesture for our army men,‚Äù said Sanjay Bachav, a teacher at Baroda High School, Bagikhana. ‚ÄúWe collected rakhis over the last few weeks and were overwhelmed by the huge response we received despite the danger of Covid virus still looming large. Apart from Gujaratis, women from other states too sent rakhis for the soldiers,‚Äù Bachav told TOI. Bachav with some of his students packed the rakhis and sent them by courier to not just Galwan but also Kargil and Siachen. ‚ÄúWe sent over 12,000 rakhis this year, of which over 3,000 were for Galwan. Phone calls have started coming in from the soldiers who received the rakhis,‚Äù Bachav added. ‚ÄúI got a call from an army man posted in Kargil on Saturday. He thanked us for sending in rakhis for the soldiers despite the pandemic. They have been serving our nation selflessly and by sending rakhis we send in a message that we are all a one big family,‚Äù said Himali Patel, a chartered accountant and former student of Bachav. Bachav ensured that every rakhi was sanitized several times before packing. He began sending in rakhis to the army men four years ago. ‚ÄúThese soldiers are away from their families but they also love to celebrate festivals like all of us. So I decided to send them rakhis and forge a bond with the men who protect us day in day out,‚Äù Bachav added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/brave-army-brothers-in-galwan-get-rakhis-from-sisters-across-india/articleshow/77320536.cms||Tushar Tere
August 3, 2020||Lucknow||Patients‚Äô arrival at hospitals in advanced stage led to 60% Covid-19 deaths in city||Lucknow: At least 60% of 101 Covid-19 patients, who have died in the city till August 1, were brought to the hospital in advanced stage of the disease. The common factors in all these deaths were that patients came with breathing problems and died of respiratory failure as by that time novel coronavirus had severely damaged their lungs. According to experts, this points to the fact that an important and identified symptom of the disease ‚Äì breathlessness or short breath ‚Äì is being overlooked by people either due to ignorance or self-denial or even fear of disclosing their status for various reasons. Breathlessness occurs as novel coronavirus mainly attacks lungs, resulting in hypoxemia (critically low blood oxygen levels in the body) which, if not addressed timely, leads to respiratory and multi-organ failure. TOI analysed the data procured from hospitals and found that 62 victims (60%) came to the hospital in the advanced stage of the disease. Of these, 36 died within 24 hours of admission. Further, 38 had no comorbidity and 31 were in the age group of 41-60 years. ‚ÄúThese deaths indicate that people couldn‚Äôt realise that they have been infected by the virus. Short breath is a sign that a person is breathing faster to get more oxygen. It occurs in Covid-19 because the virus hits the lungs. Serious symptoms may surface later,‚Äù said virologist and former head of SGPGI‚Äôs microbiology department Prof TN Dhole. ‚ÄúIn most cases, patients had no idea that breathlessness is a symptom of Covid-19. They considered fever and cough as the only symptom,‚Äù KGMU spokesman Prof Sudhir Singh said, emphasising on the need for a massive awareness campaign particularly for the economically weaker sections. Prof Kausar Usman from KGMU‚Äôs medicine department, who is also involved in Covid-19 care, said: ‚ÄúSelf-denial (it cannot happen to me) or self-diagnosis (this is happening because of some other cause) are responsible for the delay. In some cases, patients initially thought that breathlessness was because of humid weather or due to a heart condition.‚Äù ‚ÄúSelf-denial generally occurs when people have no comorbidity. They believe that they are fit. And, the tendency of self-diagnosis is most among those with health condition. They attribute all symptoms to it,‚Äù he added. Besides breathlessness, loss of taste is also an indication of Covid-19. Prof Santosh Kumar from pulmonary medicine department of KGMU said some people did not report early out of fear of being kept in ‚Äòisolation‚Äô in the hospital. ‚ÄúPeople can keep an oximeter at home to measure oxygen levels regularly. Normal oxygen saturation level is between 95%-100%. If it remains low for some time, seek medical assistance immediately. If you can‚Äôt afford oximeter, watch out for numbness in limbs or difficulty in getting up to walk which are also signs of low oxygen levels,‚Äù Prof Dhole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/patients-arrival-at-hospitals-in-advanced-stage-led-to-60-covid-19-deaths-in-city/articleshow/77323187.cms||Yusra Husain
August 3, 2020||Jaipur||Machine at JMC helps to maintain social distancing||Jaipur: Maintaining social distance has been a major issue at all the government departments which is now being resolved by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC). JMC has installed a machine at the Citizen Helpline Centre where birth and death certificates are made to identify people who are violating the social distancing norms. Citizen Helpline Centre is visited by hundreds of people every day, so the authorities felt the need to install a machine over there, said sources. Additional commissioner, JMC, Arun Garg, said, ‚ÄúWe installed the machine a few days ago and till now the results have been good. The machine can detect any one getting closer than four feet and will circle it on the screen at the helpline centre hall. The moment it is shown on the screen, immediately announcement is made on the loud speaker connected to the machine ‚Äì ‚Äòmaintain distance‚Äô. This is a welcome step and to a large extent it has helped us in preventing crowds.‚Äù It is still in experimental phase and after a month JMC is planning to install it in every zonal office in the city. People belonging to different zones have to get their certificates from zonal office, but relatives of people died or born at SMS hospital have to get it from JMC‚Äôs Lal Kothi headquarters. Since the outbreak of pandemic, there has been a decline in the number of people coming to the helpline centre for getting a certificate. Everyone was applying online for the certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/machine-at-jmc-helps-to-maintain-social-distancing/articleshow/77322871.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Chandigarh||Most MSMEs not eligible for Centre‚Äôs credit scheme||CHANDIGARH: For the Centre‚Äôs much-hyped Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme, only 12 % of Punjab‚Äôs nearly 15 lakh micro, medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) were found eligible clients by the banks. Even among those approached, 25% have either opted out or are yet to respond. As per the figures available till July 18, 2020, almost 19% of the eligible borrowers have opted out of the scheme, and another 6% are yet to respond. Resultantly, merely 7% of the total MSMEs have so far consented to avail of the scheme. The scheme is on till October. RBI Chair at Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) Prof Satish Verma said, ‚ÄúWhile the scheme has been widely touted to benefit the cash-strapped, functional, indebted MSMEs, a huge proportion have either opted out or not responded. It raises doubts about the scheme‚Äôs structural design. As it is, Punjab‚Äôs share in the scheme of Rs 3 lakh crore comes to a minuscule 1.44%.‚Äù The credit scheme was a part of the Rs 20 lakh crore financial stimulus package announced on May 13, 2020, by the Union finance minister. It promises to provide collateral-free, government-guaranteed, and pre-approved working capital term loan to the enterprises that were non-NPA as on February 29, 2020. Verma points out that the problem lies with the fact that the loan facility amounts to 20% of the combined outstanding loans of the enterprise. However, only the enterprises with up to Rs 25 crore outstanding loans and Rs 100 crore turnover are eligible to avail it. Essentially, the scheme is intended to infuse liquidity into the small enterprises to enable them to meet their outstanding bills and to ensure an uninterrupted supply line of raw materials. ‚ÄúImportantly, many enterprises have been reeling under financial stress for quite a long period and may have accumulated NPA loans over time. On the other hand, the enterprises that somehow managed their own resources seem to have been doubly penalised; first for getting accommodation from informal sources, which have their own costs, and second for being ineligible for the loan available under the scheme at lower rate of interest. Still, slow down can be a reason for some eligible borrowers to opt out,‚Äù added Verma. ‚ÄúMaking loans collateral free has been touted as the incentive for the eligible enterprises under the scheme. In reality, however, the loan is not collateral free; rather it is a loan without additional collateral. Third, the government guaranteed feature of the loan should incentivise banks to extend loans liberally. On the contrary, it is alleged that intensive documentation is undertaken by banks while sanctioning the loan as the banks too have a share in default rate.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe conditions put up to avail the scheme were not very exciting for most units and that is why it has failed to generate the expected response. The Centre should have been more liberal in extending benefits for MSMEs that have been struggling with finances,‚Äù said the owner of a medium-sized unit in Amritsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/most-msmes-not-eligible-for-centres-credit-scheme/articleshow/77320967.cms||Vibhor Mohan
August 3, 2020||Jaipur||JDA to launch four housing schemes on August 15||Jaipur: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) is planning to launch four more housing schemes in the state capital after the successful endeavour to attract buyers in recently launched projects. A total of 1,500 plots will be developed in these four schemes, which will be launched on August 15. Allotment of about 1,500 plots in the housing schemes will be done through lottery and auction. The civic body will develop colony named as Hiralal Shastri Nagar in zone-14, Gokul Nagar in Prithviraj Nagar Scheme (North zone), APJ Abdul Kalam Nagar in zone 11. Around 200 plots of Nilay Kunj Scheme which were developed earlier in zone-9 will be allotted after re-planning. To sell the plots in its developed schemes, the JDA recently had reduced the reserve price of uninhabited land in its region by 10% to 37%. The decision was taken by the higher authorities looking at the slump in prices in the region and also for many years, they were unable to auction the plots. The JDA is confident to selling the plots in these schemes, looking at the previous response. As these schemes will not be developed in far-flung areas, many buyers are expected to show interest to buy plots at these locations. A senior official said, ‚ÄúThe move is expected to boost the revenues, that will be utilised to develop infrastructure.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs the market condition has improved, the JDA will also fill its coffers after auctioning plots in its old scheme,‚Äù he said. As JDA has many schemes in far-flung areas, not many residents have applied to buy those in the past as the authorities failed to provide even basic facilities. Due to lack of power and water, the sites of these colonies continue to wear a deserted look. An official source said, since 2005, the civic body has launched 38 housing schemes, but most of those are still unoccupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-to-launch-four-housing-schemes-on-august-15/articleshow/77322867.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Hubballi||Pandemic, conflict with China result in sales of rakhis drying up in twin cities||Hubballi: The souring of relations between India and China following the face-off in Ladakh recently has had a trickle-down effect, affecting everything from electronic gadgets to the rakhis that sisters tie around the wrist of brothers as a reaffirmation of their relationship on the occasion of Rakshabandhan. Many women in Hubballi-Dharwad are refusing to buy China-made rakhis that are on sale in the retail markets, and insisting on purchasing those made in India. Furthermore, the Covid-19 crisis having sent the economy plummeting, most women were found opting for modestly priced rakhis. Proprietor of Mahalaxmi Lace and Embroidery on Ullagaddimath Street in Hubballi Sachin Jadhav said that there was a marked dip in the sales of rakhis across twin cities. Moreover, he said that the disruption in the supply chain owing to the Covid-19 crisis and the standoff between India and China, had resulted in shops having minimal stock of the rakhis. ‚ÄúIndia-made rakhis could not be supplied across the country owing to the lockdown, while we do not have enough of the China-made ones either. Chinese rakhis were more colourful and hence, more popular among customers,‚Äù said Jadhav, ruing the slide in the business for the embroidery industry in the festive season. Owner of another embroidery store Venkatesh Dalabhanjan observed a growing trend among women to purchase the required raw materials, and make the rakhis at home. He said that the rejection of Chinese rakhis had opened a window for the Indian manufacturers to cash in on. ‚ÄúBut the Covid-19 crisis has meant that they could not capitalise on this chance,‚Äù he said. Sources in the embroidery and lace industry said that even small retail outlets sold rakhis worth Rs 5,000 in the run-up to Rakshabandhan. ‚ÄúThis time, sales have dipped by 60 to 70%, on average,‚Äù a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/pandemic-conflict-with-china-result-in-sales-of-rakhis-drying-up-in-twin-cities/articleshow/77319487.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The DC will have a discussion with Kasaragod district collector D Sajith Babu soon. Majority of the employees from Kasaragod working in private sectors in Mangaluru have been asked to either report to duty or resign. Many have already resigned to find job in Kasaragod and they have started an online campaign with the hashtags #Opentheborder and #Savemyjob requesting Kasaragod district collector to allow them to commute daily between Kasaragod and Mangaluru. ‚ÄúAs per the order, we are not allowed to come back to Kasaragod for the next 28 days if we go to Mangaluru. About 90% of us have no facility to stay in Mangaluru. I heard that some have already lost their jobs,‚Äù Prithwiraj JS, a daily commuter wrote to Kasaragod DC. Harinarayana Holla, a service engineer in a tools company in Mangaluru, told TOI that he has requested the authorities concerned to provide permission for people of Kasaragod, who are employed in Mangaluru, to attend to work in Mangaluru and return home in the evening on daily pass. When contacted, Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner KV Rajendra said he will discuss the issue with his Kasaragod counterpart. ‚ÄúIt is a very serious issue. We will definitely try to solve it through a conference,‚Äù he added. District minister Kota Srinivas Poojary said there is a need to clear the heaps of soil dumped on roads connecting Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod during lockdown. Meanwhile, Kasaragod DC in an FB post stated that various issues related to inter-state border will be discussed with Kerala revenue minister E Chandrashekharan on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/workers-entry-new-dakshina-kannada-to-confer-with-kasaragod-officials/articleshow/77320528.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Mysuru||Heart-shaped paddy farm a tourist attraction in Chikkamagaluru||Chikkamagaluru: Although it is not unusual to find people from cities visiting popular tourist destinations stop by fields of flowers, and take photographs and selfies, a paddy farm owned and cultivated by two brothers in a small hamlet in Chikkamagaluru has turned into quite an attraction among locals and visitors alike. Bamikonda is a hilly hamlet, not too far from Kalasa town, with the few houses dotting the slope of the undulating terrain. It is here that the paddy farm of Krishna Gowda and Vishwanath Gowda is nestled. What makes this paddy farm unique is the shape that the crops have been hemmed into: A heart. Interestingly, that their paddy farm was shaped as attractively remained unnoticed by the brothers themselves till it started gaining in popularity. ‚ÄúWe really did not notice the shape of the field. We shaped our farm in this way to ensure to retain water and fertility of the soil. Someone clicked a few photographs, uploaded them on social media, which went viral. The shape can be distinguished only from a distance, Krishna told TOI. The brothers‚Äô ancestors settled down in Bamikonda nearly a century ago, and started cultivating paddy at the foot of the hill. Both Krishna and Vishwanath have been tilling the land with bullock-drawn carts. Divin Mudigere, among the first travellers to have stumbled upon this vista, said, ‚ÄúOne gets to Bamikonda by a road that is in terrible shape, more so during the monsoon. But it was a great moment for me, to capture the scene in front of me.‚Äù Meanwhile, owners of resorts and homestays in Mudigere taluk in Chikkamagaluru are more than pleased with the addition of another tourist attraction, albeit a remote one. Owner of a hometay in Bamikonda Abhi Ballal told TOI that Krishna and Vishwanath were his neighbours. ‚ÄúThey had no idea that the paddy farm would draw visitors,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/heart-shaped-paddy-farm-a-tourist-attraction-in-chikkamagaluru/articleshow/77319884.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Dehradun||Two years after Nainital Mall Rd collapse, govt sanctions Rs 82 lakh for its repair||Nainital: Almost two years after a 20-metre long stretch of Nainital‚Äôs Mall Road collapsed into the Naini Lake, the state government has finally sanctioned money for its repair work. According to the district administration, an amount of Rs 82 lakh has been sanctioned to build the retention walls as well as to repair the cracks in the road. ‚ÄúA proposal amounting to Rs 82 lakh was prepared and sent to the government for approval. The amount was sanctioned and the tender will soon be floated,‚Äù said Nainital‚Äôs district magistrate Savin Bansal. The DM added that the administration is hoping that the work will begin by September after the monsoon eases. ‚ÄúThe process of floating tenders and inviting technical bids will be completed in a few days and we expect the work to commence by September. The rains are also expected to subside in a month and therefore, the work will start after monsoon ends,‚Äù Bansal said. ‚ÄúThe repair work will include inserting poles into the lake as deep as 20 metres and using sandbags to prevent loosening of rocks,‚Äù said PWD‚Äôs executive engineer, Deepak Gupta. He said that the PWD has also prepared a bigger plan for repairing the 190-metre stretch of the Mall Road and another proposal worth Rs 42 crore has also been sent for approval. ‚ÄúA study was done in collaboration with IIT Roorkee, and a proposal has been sent to the state government for repair work and strengthening of 190 metre portion of the road. While we are waiting for the approval, the work on the damaged portion will start by September,‚Äù Gupta added. As reported by TOI earlier, the Mall Road that runs around the Naini Lake had collapsed in August 2018. Consequently, traffic movement on the stretch had to be stopped for over a month. However, soon after its collapse, the administration had temporarily put some pillars and sandbags to prevent further damage and built a road over it. But barely a few months later, cracks had started to reappear. Experts had said that heavy traffic movement and loosening of rocks beneath the road could be the reasons for the damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-years-after-nainital-mall-rd-collapse-govt-sanctions-rs-82-lakh-for-its-repair/articleshow/77319316.cms||Prashant Jha
August 3, 2020||Bengaluru||Year-end Class 1-9 exams may be cancelled for Karnataka board schools||BENGALURU: With the pandemic having caused massive loss of class hours, year-end exams may not be held for class 1-9 students of all schools following state board syllabus, as per a comprehensive plan on continuous learning. It will probably be unveiled this week. The programme, Vidyagama, targeted at students of government, aided and unaided state board schools, seeks to promote guided self-learning among kids by getting every institution to set up virtual classrooms based on the geographical location of its students‚Äô homes. It will benefit 44 lakh students of government schools and 14 lakh from aided ones. The number of students in unaided schools was not immediately available. Mid-term exams are also likely to be cancelled, according to highlights of the Vidyagama project report accessed by TOI. Students from classes 1-5, 6-8 and 9-10 will be grouped together in each area. A group of 20-25 children will be mentored by a teacher from the same locality. The mentors will conduct four formative assessments even if schools continue to remain closed, according to Vidyagama, which is expected to be announced by minister for primary and secondary education S Suresh Kumar this week. It requires the mentor teacher to divide her class based on children‚Äôs accessibility to technology ‚Äî students who have continuous internet facility, those with mobiles but no internet and those without any gadget. Each group will have a different mode of learning. While teachers can reach students with internet accessibility through WhatsApp groups and recorded videos or online classes, those with mobiles will get SMSs or voice calls. For those without gadgets, parents will be asked to collect worksheets from schools and will be guided on how to assist them in self-learning. Teachers will be asked to visit homes of children at least once a week. While the mentor teacher will conduct classes for all subjects in primary classes, in higher grades, she will teach her own subject and coordinate with other teachers for her group of children. Subject teachers have to hand over worksheets /other learning material to the mentor teacher. Meetings of the student-teacher groups will be held at community centres, religious places or under trees with social-distancing norms in place. The headmaster of each school will be responsible for allotting mentor teachers and monitoring the system. Schools are directed to take help from the community, NGOs, volunteers or even higher grade students. While TV classes will continue for high school students, lessons for classes 1-10 in Kannada and English medium will be recorded by experienced teachers and uploaded on YouTube channels. The programme‚Äôs objective is to help students self-learn and to ensure they don‚Äôt depend only on gadgets or teachers. A class-wise and subject-wise ‚Äòannual programme of work‚Äô has been prepared at the state level to ensure uniformity in schools. It should be ensured that mid-day meal provisions reach students‚Äô homes. The mentor teacher also has the responsibility of enroling any out-of-school student without asking for documents. Special care will be taken for children with special needs. While many school teachers are reaching out to their students through ‚Äòvatara shale‚Äô (classes in vatara, cluster of houses in a single building) to prevent a learning gap, the government‚Äôs new plan will streamline the system and ensure all schools follow suit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/year-end-class-1-9-exams-may-be-cancelled-for-state-board-schools/articleshow/77320727.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

August 3, 2020||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Despite free pass, Old Mahabalipuram Road residents made to pay toll fee||CHENNAI: Despite having a free pass to cross toll gates on Old Mahabalipuram Road, residents who have subscribed to FASTag are made to pay the toll fee. The scanning device at toll plazas on OMR detects FASTag stickers on car windshields and the money is deducted from the users‚Äô bank accounts linked to FASTag. At present, OMR has a centralised toll system run by state-owned IT Expressway Limited (ITEL) and has five toll plazas. A car has to pay Rs 54 for a two-way journey. However, cars of local residents were exempted from paying this user fee. On application, residents are provided with local resident passes (LRPs) -- a radio-frequency tag they can affix on the car windshields or side glasses. Equipment fixed at toll lanes scans these RFID tags and it allows users to cross the toll without paying any fee. But after FASTtag, Union road transport ministry‚Äôs electronic toll collection system, was made mandatory for travel on national highways, many OMR residents started affixing FASTag stickers right next to the LRP stickers on their car glasses. FASTag, which was used only in NH toll plazas, was recently expanded to OMR toll gates after repeated requests from the public to move to cashless transactions. The toll plazas on OMR, which were shut in April due to Covid-19 lockdown, resumed fee collection from Wednesday. ‚ÄúSince the toll started to function again, users with LRP are made to pay a fee just because they have FASTag stickers on their cars,‚Äù said G Satish, a resident of Semmanchery, who was one of the first persons in OMR to get a LRP. So users have to either remove the FASTag stickers for now or paste the LRPs near their steering wheels or at a different spot on the car, he said. An ITEL official said efforts were underway to come up with a common RFID sticker for residents using both the tags. Residents can approach the ITEL office for assistance, he said. But banks are demanding a higher fee for installing such a system and soon it will be integrated, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/despite-free-passomr-residentsmade-to-pay-toll-fee/articleshow/77322235.cms||Ram Sundaram
August 3, 2020||Dehradun||Now, Nepalese town mayor stakes claim over no-man‚Äôs land near Uttarakhand border||PITHORAGARH: The mayor of Bhimdutt nagar palika in Kanchanpur district of Nepal has claimed that a patch of no-man‚Äôs land near the India-Nepal border in Champawat district of Kumaon is actually Nepalese territory. The mayor, Surendra Bisht, also alleged that the area which adjoins the Brahmdev area in Nepal has ‚Äúfor years been administered by the community forest committee (van samiti) of our nagar palika.‚Äù He further added that the nagar palika had put up wooden fencing in the area years ago which has recently been replaced as it had become old. Saplings have also been planted in the area, as per the mayor. As per sources in Champawat district, a sum of Rs 45 lakh has been spent on the fencing exercise and planting of saplings by the Nepalese nagar palika. When queried on how Nepal is staking claim on land that has been deemed as no-man‚Äôs land, Bisht said, ‚Äú A joint survey of the land should be undertaken to sort out the issue. That will make the picture clear. We agree that border dispute is not good for both countries and it should be solved soon.‚Äù The border row at Tanakpur in Champawat district had erupted sometime ago when Nepalese nationals were alleged to have encroached upon the area at border pillar number 811, deemed as no-man‚Äôs land. After Indian security agencies objected and registered a complaint with Nepal, Nepalese officials had come to the spot for inspection. Officials from both countries are now expected to meet each other in the coming week to discuss the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-nepalese-town-mayor-stakes-claim-over-no-mans-land-near-ukhand-border/articleshow/77319324.cms||Prem Punetha
August 3, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Civic volunteer murdered during Hastings brawl, three held||KOLKATA: A 36-year-old civic volunteer attached with Maidan police was allegedly murdered near the Hastings Mazar on Saturday after he had tried to stop an argument between horse carriage operators. The victim, Irshad Hossain alias Md Sunny, a resident of MM Ali Road in Ekbalpore, was himself the owner of some horses used to pull the carriages. Three persons, Safed Rahaman alias Saiba, Ajoy Roy and Abhisek Singh, have been arrested so far in connection with the murder. The civic volunteer, who is survived by his parents, wife and two daughters, was allegedly hit with a brick on his head in the wee hours of Saturday. He succumbed to his injuries later on the same day. According to joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma, there was a dispute between Danish and Rahaman of Hastings over the use of the road leading to the mazar. ‚ÄúIn the past few days, slum dwellers from Strand Road and those from Watgunge had been arguing over the issue,‚Äù said Sharma. ‚ÄúAs an argument was on, Sunny and Danish‚Äôs father Md Firoj reached the spot in the early hours of Saturday. Though Sunny was not on duty, he had gone there to feed his horses and wash his cart. Meanwhile, Rahaman called some locals to come to his rescue. Sunny, Firoj and at least five others objected to the presence of so many people, who had no connection with the business, at the spot. Ajoy Roy of Watgunge and a friend of Rahaman became furious suddenly and had a scuffle with Sunny, Firoj and Danish. During the scuffle, Abhisek Singh, a resident of St Georges Terrace Road and a friend of both Rahaman and Roy, hit Sunny on his head with a brick. As he fell on the ground, the accused fled away,‚Äù said DC (south) Meeraj Khalid. Soon, some seniors rushed to the spot hearing the commotion. ‚ÄúAround 12.30am, Sunny said he was feeling unwell and was shifted to SSKM Hospital. He died while being shifted to the trauma care unit. Arrangement has been made for his post-mortem that will ascertain the exact reason behind his death,‚Äù added Khalid. The arrested trio have been charged with murder by Maidan police. Firoj is the complainant, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-volunteer-murdered-during-hastings-brawl-3-held/articleshow/77322252.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
August 3, 2020||Bengaluru||Source of infection in over 65,000 patients in Karnataka unknown||BENGALURU: As the Covid-19 cases in Karnataka surge, the source of infection for one in every two patients who have tested positive remains a mystery, prompting authorities to shift strategy to increasing isolation. As of Saturday night, the government was unable to pinpoint the source of the virus in 65,099 of the 1.3 lakh cases in the state, while the remaining contracted an infection either through a contact or had a history of domestic or international travel. ‚ÄúThe number is not surprising given the government has diverted a significant percentage of resources to manage beds and coordinate, while ignoring tracking and tracing,‚Äù one expert working with the government said, without wanting to be named. However, many experts said the government should not waste resources in finding the source anymore, but focus on enhancing testing capacity. While the Sunday health bulletin showed an increase in total cases, the government did not immediately release data on transmission source, which will come Monday. Dr CN Manjunath, member, Karnataka Covid-19 task force, had earlier explained said the inability to pinpoint the source of infection clearly indicates that these patients were infected somewhere in the community. He had even said that in the long-run this would work as a stimulus for herd immunity given the low fatality rate. ‚ÄúHowever, it is too early to say anything concrete now,‚Äù he had said. Experts also pointed out the government must conduct more sero-surveillance studies to understand this and data must also be collected on infection-per-case ‚Äî how many people could be infected for every one positive case ‚Äî rate to manage the infrastructure and resources better. Of the 65,099 patients, 15,896 ‚Äî 13,092 with ILI and 2,804 with SARI ‚Äî have known comorbidities, and investigations are on to identify the source of transmission. Dr Giridhara Babu, member, ICMR task force on research and surveillance, said: ‚ÄúIt would be critical for the government to now ramp up testing capacity and identify all the people who may have been infected. Once this is done, they must all be isolated to prevent the infection from spreading as it is clear there is some local transmission.‚Äù While there is no clear break-up of where the unidentified cases are from, a senior official said that a majority of cases could be from Bengaluru. BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said: ‚ÄúWe understand the problem, which is why we are working on increasing our testing capacity. Just yesterday we did more than 10,000 tests and we hope to ramp this up to 50,000 a day soon. Besides this we are identifying vulnerable populations across wards and they will be put under surveillance.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/source-of-infection-in-over-65000-patients-in-karnataka-unknown/articleshow/77321003.cms||Chethan Kumar
August 3, 2020||Agra||Rakhis tie postal dept to its glorious past again, keep humble postmen on toes on Sunday||AGRA: Just three years shy of his retirement, Ummid Singh, 57, found himself occupied again, and happy too. ‚ÄúLast two weeks reminded me of the good old days of the post offices,‚Äù says the humble postman, while rushing to distribute the rest of the lot of envelopes containing brightly-hued rakhis. Like Ummid, lakhs of employees of India Post in Uttar Pradesh and several other northern states were on the streets busy distributing rakhis on Sunday. ‚ÄúSunday comes every week. But the joy of delivering rakhis to the families expecting it is precious. All the hard work is rewarded when people thank you with a smile,‚Äù says another postman-- a younger one-- Pushpendra Singh, 29, in Agra. Raksha Bandhan will be celebrated today. Amid curtailed social gatherings due to the pandemic, women thronged post offices to send rakhis to their brothers. For most of the younger lot, it was first of its kind experience. While for the grey-haired, it was like the return of the good old days. Most of the rakhi mails were sent through speed post service-- a quicker version of ordinary mail. Chief post master general of UP, KK Sinha, said, ‚ÄúAll 15,109 branch post offices and more than 1,600 delivery post offices were open on Sunday. And they will also work on Raksha Bandhan,‚Äù he added. RB Tripathi, assistant director post services (Agra region), said, ‚ÄúDue to the pandemic, the number of rakhi mails have increased significantly. We are making all possible efforts to ensure that all the mails reach their destination by Monday. Top authorities also took the decision to continue operations on Sunday.‚Äù Senior postmaster Jitendra Singh said, ‚ÄúFor the last two weeks, our teams have been working overtime to ensure that rakhis are delivered on the same day. Our postmen will continue delivering mails on Raksha Bandhan also.‚Äù The department also deployed the red-coloured mail motors for inter-district operation amid the restricted movement of rail and flights. According to the department officials, before the Covid-19 pandemic, the mail motors were used to deliver mail from the post office to railway stations and also for cash circulation within the district. ‚ÄúI will go home only after all the rakhi envelopes are distributed. People of Agra‚Äôs Rajpur Chungi area, where I work, treat me as a family member. I am happy to serve on Sunday. I just want that rakhi sent by a sister is on her brother‚Äôs wrist on Raksha Bandhan,‚Äù Ummid said. ‚ÄúWe are using face masks, gloves and sanitizer provided by the department to save ourselves from Covid-19 infection. People request me to have a cup of tea, but I politely refuse,‚Äù he said. While Pushpendra says, ‚ÄúI cover densely populated Sarai Khawaja and Arjun Nagar areas of Agra. I have been working 12 hours a day for the last one week to deliver these posts, mostly rakhi envelopes. As compared to previous years, workload on Raksha Bandhan is much more due to Covid-19 pandemic. In some parts, families don‚Äôt even have the house number. I somehow managed to deliver over 50 rakhi mails to such homes. Just mobile numbers written on the envelopes helped us a lot.‚Äù Meanwhile, special rakhi envelopes launched by the postal department were selling like hot cakes. The waterproof envelopes were available in yellow and pink colors for just Rs 10. Krishna Kumar Yadav, director of postal services, Lucknow headquarters region, told TOI that more than one lakh articles (rakhi envelopes and related items) were booked from Lucknow and around 2lakh articles were being delivered in the district. ‚ÄúInstead of sending sweets to their brothers, women have sent sanitisers, masks and giloy as gifts,‚Äù he said. Ratan Singh, deputy postmaster of Meerut city, said, ‚ÄúAll our offices operated on Sunday. This year, the workload was much higher as compared to the previous years. Our operations will continue on Raksha Bandhan on Monday.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rakhis-tie-postal-dept-to-its-glorious-past-again-keep-humble-postmen-on-toes-on-sunday/articleshow/77321009.cms||Deepak Lavania
August 3, 2020||Goa||Sakhali housewife turns poultry farmer during lockdown||PANAJI: The lockdown compelled many people to look towards agriculture in a bid to grow their own greens but meat-eaters that were depending upon the scarcely available chicken in the market had to make do with whatever was sold at the time. Sakhali-based Pallavi Mainkar, a housewife, however, thought differently. She purchased 100 poultry birds from the Old Goa-based ICAR-CCARI Krishi Vigyan Kendra for Rs 10,000 during the lockdown and reared them for 45 days. While few birds were used for self consumption, she managed to sell majority of the birds netting a profit of Rs 13,200. Mainkar already had a cow shed in her premises and was supposed to start a cattle farm in March. However, owing to the lockdown, her family was forced to drop the idea. Instead of letting the shed remain shut, she decided to source chickens from the ICAR-CCARI and accommodate them inside the shed. ‚ÄúThe cost for feed came to Rs 10,000. After rearing the chickens for 45 days, a total of 80 adult male birds were sold for Rs 400 each,‚Äù Mainkar said. These were sold to locals during the lockdown for consumption. This was the Cari Nirbheek (Aseel Cross) breed of chicken that was reared. Aseel is well known for its pugnacity, high stamina, majestic gait and dogged fighting qualities. The standard weight varies from 1.5 to 2.2 kg for cocks and 1.5 to 1.7 kg for hens. Age at which the birds were purchased was two months. The annual egg production is approximately 160 eggs a year. Chickens retained by Mainkar have been laying these eggs which are being sold for Rs 110 per dozen. ‚ÄúThere are many proven technologies that can be used by the citizens for their livelihood so that people can be self employed as well as improve the chicken production in the state,‚Äù director of ICAR-CCARI, EB Chakurkar said. Dr Sanjay Udharwar, animal scientist at the ICAR-CCARI who guided Mainkar through the purchase of the birds said that others in the state can learn from this success story. ‚ÄúThis will serve like a model which if anyone wants to replicate, can do so. Along with agriculture, if such components are added, it will give subsidiary income to farmers,‚Äù he said. The health of the birds is being monitored by the ICAR-CCARI scientists and medical advise is also being provided whenever the birds show signs of poor health. ‚ÄúThe birds have been vaccinated with three vaccines Lasota, Gambora and Pox vaccine,‚Äù Udharwar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sakhali-housewife-turns-poultry-farmer-during-lockdown/articleshow/77323198.cms||Nida Sayed

August 3, 2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Covid-19 recoveries cross 50,000, but rate still below national average||BENGALURU: Karnataka, which has seen a surge in cases which has taken the caseload to more than 1.3 lakh, now has another milestone, albeit a happy one: The number of recoveries has now crossed 50,000. On Sunday, the state reported a record 4,077 discharges, the highest single-day figure yet, taking the total recoveries to 57,725. However, only 43% of people have recovered in the state, much below the national average of 65%. Medical education minister K Sudhakar, while pointing out that the state has crossed the milestone, said: ‚ÄúMy appeal to people: Do not panic, take precautions and keep up the guard. Together, we can defeat this pandemic.‚Äù An analysis of the discharge data from July 1 to August 2 shows that a total 49,807 patients recovered, with a majority of them having been discharged in the past week. Ten of the last 33 days saw more than 1,000 discharges each day, six saw more than 2,000 and three more than 3,000. Dr Giridhara Babu, member, ICMR task force on research and surveillance, said: ‚ÄúThe pace of recoveries had slowed earlier, but it will improve in the coming days and a new equilibrium will be achieved in the coming weeks.‚Äù Sudhakar too had earlier projected recoveries to increase in August, and officials TOI spoke with said they were hopeful the gap between discharges and total cases will decrease by the end of the month. As on date, the state compares poorly with four other states with more than 1 lakh cases. Recoveries in Maharashtra stand at 62%, while it is 76% in Tamil Nadu, 89% in Delhi and 51% in Andhra Pradesh, which just last week overtook Karnataka in total cases. Compared to Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu, cases in Karnataka began to peak late and recoveries will show an increase in coming weeks. However, Karnataka has been battling an increase in acute cases which require more number of days to recover, thereby affecting the overall recovery rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/recoveries-cross-50000-but-rate-still-below-national-average/articleshow/77321051.cms||Chethan Kumar

August 3, 2020||Agra||Visiting Ayodhya was painful earlier, now there is a sense of satisfaction, says Sadhvi Ritambhara||Agra: One of the leading voices of Ram Janmabhoomi movement, Sadhvi Ritambhara on Sunday said that there was a sense of satisfaction as a Ram temple in Ayodhya will soon be a reality and the ‚Äúpain‚Äù temple activists went through will soon be forgotten. She will be present at the bhoomi pujan ceremony to mark the beginning of the Ram temple‚Äôs construction in Ayodhya.

Criticizing the opposition parties, Ritambhara said, ‚ÄúThe previous governments had been arranging flights for people of minority community to make them visit their holy places. But Hindus were deprived from worshipping their god at his birth place-- the Ram Janmabhoomi.

Although the Cauvery is gushing, the complete lockdown on Sundays and Covid-19 preventive measures have restricted people from visiting the river. Several residents offered their prayers at the corporation water taps that dispense Cauvery water. Aadi Perukku is one of the oldest and significant festivals celebrated in the Cauvery delta marking the commencement of yearly cultivation in the agrarian hamlets. Since the arrival of the Cauvery water infuses happiness, local people, particularly, newly-wed couples offer special prayers to the river wishing for prosperity in their lives. Families perform offer fruits and prayers on the banks of the Cauvery thanking the nature to sustain prosperity in the agrarian sector. However, owing to the complete lockdown imposed on Sundays, Amma Mandapam ghats, Thillainayagam ghats and Aiyalamman ghats were deserted. Thousands of people used to throng the river banks on Aadi Perukku for an ideal family time. But this year, people offered prayers at their houses. Residents on Sunday said that this year‚Äôs Aadi Perukku was unprecedented as they have never seen the Cauvery banks so deserted. ‚ÄúEven during the recent droughts, we visited the Cauvery to offer prayers. Although the river is brimming now, Covid-19 has prevented us from celebrating Aadi Perukku on the river banks,‚Äù N Amuthavalli, a resident of Eda Street, said. Even in 2017‚Äôs drought, the civic body had dug borewells on the river bed to help people celebrate the festival. The lockdown has also hit street vendors who depend on the festive crowd for selling flowers and pooja items. Rag pickers who were making revenue by recovering and selling the tonnes of clothes dumped in the river were also hit by the complete lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/lockdown-dampens-aadi-perukku-fete-in-trichy-residents-offer-prayers-at-water-taps/articleshow/77322886.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Many dried up trees may collapse, cause serious accidents: Survey||Nagpur: A survey carried out by an environmentalist from city has found that there are many fully-grown trees across Nagpur that have dried-up and pose serious threat to citizens. Recently, environment activist Manish Chandekar carried out a field study in different areas and found completely dried up trees along roads and at traffic junctions in areas like Civil Lines, Trimurti Nagar, Ranapratap Nagar Square, Law College Square and others. ‚ÄúBecause of choking, poor maintenance and old age, these trees have become completely dry and are on the verge of collapsing. Spot visits have revealed that if such trees collapse they can cause serious accidents and damage human lives and property,‚Äù said Chandekar. Following the survey, the activist has appealed to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to either cut or transplant these trees. ‚ÄúNew trees should be planted at the same location and it should be made sure that they are watered and protected regularly,‚Äù he said. As per experts, if a tree is a real threat to life and infrastructure, the same should be immediately reported to NMC‚Äôs garden department which can take a proper call after inspection. Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of NGO Green Vigil Foundation, said, ‚ÄúThe main reason of drying of trees is lack of water and nutrient intake. Sometimes fungal attack also causes decay of trees. However in Nagpur, many trees have dried up due to choking. Another probable reason of drying of trees could be nailing advertisements on them wherein the xylem and phloem carrying water and nutrients get punctured, making the area prone to fungal attack.‚Äù TOI has repeatedly reported about the damage concretization of roads is causing to age-old trees in the city. Many trees have collapsed due to severe choking around its base. Blaming concretization for the drying up of trees, honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur Jaydeep Das said, ‚ÄúMost of the trees which are dying are falling to slightest wind as their roots are completely choked. NMC should clear the choked bases, keeping a minimum open circumference of three feet.‚Äù Adding that many dried up trees too have ecological importance, Das said, ‚ÄúTheir barks are home to numerous species like woodpeckers, owls, civet cats, squirrels and many insects which the birds eat. They also serve as perches for birds. If dried up trees are not posing any threat, then they should be left as it is.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-dried-up-trees-may-collapse-cause-serious-accidents-survey/articleshow/77322917.cms||Manka Behl

On this day, exactly 38 years ago, Bachchan had emerged from a semi-comatose stage following his near-fatal accident on the sets of ‚ÄòCoolie‚Äô. The coincidence was not missed by his fans who celebrated his ‚Äòrebirth‚Äô day with gusto. Abhishek, along with wife Aishwarya and daughter Aaradhya, who had later tested positive, remain admitted in hospital. All Bengal Amitabh Bachchan Fans‚Äô Association, which manages the ‚ÄúBachchan Dham‚Äù temple at Bondel Gate in south Kolkata, has been performing a ‚Äúmahamrityunjay jap‚Äù for his recovery since he was admitted on July 12.

Multiple other fan clubs distributed sweets and garlanded Bachchan‚Äôs photographs. ‚ÄúTo me, he is an inspiration. I wasn‚Äôt even born when he was in his prime, but I have grown up watching his movies and started admiring him more and more as years went by,‚Äù said Rohit Kumar as he garlanded a portrait of the actor in his bedroom.

I am back home in solitary quarantine. Grace of the Almighty, blessings of Ma Babuji, prayers & duas of near & dear & friends fans EF .. and the excellent care and nursing at Nanavati made it possible for me to see this day‚Äù. Just before his release, Bachchan posted a blog in which he recalled his days at the ICU of Mumbai‚Äôs Breach Candy Hospital back in 1982. He wrote how he would pull the pipes attached to his body in his stupor, forcing doctors to stitch one to his nostril leaving a permanent mark. Bachchan also recalled how he would gesture to wife Jaya or scribble on a piece of paper in ‚Äòbroken Bengali‚Äô asking for a sip of water that had been forbidden by doctors while he was undergoing a tracheostomy. ‚ÄúIt never worked,‚Äù he wrote. Other fans said while they were happy with the icon being released from the hospital, they will continue to pray for the recovery of junior Bachchan, Abhishek.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/august-2-redux-big-b-ve-fans-ecstatic/articleshow/77322369.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
August 3, 2020||Mysuru||Karnataka: While ryot and family recovered, locals farmed his land for free||MYSURU: While patients and their family members have been stigmatised and ostracized in many parts of the state, locals in Taltareshettalli, a small village in Somwarpet taluk, Kodagu district, not only came to the aid of a family that was badly hit by the virus, but also welcomed them back with much fanfare after they were discharged from hospital. When Puttaiah, a small farmer and his family contracted the virus, more than 30 residents of the village banded together to till the family‚Äôs field, planting a crop of paddy while the man and his family coalesced in hospital. When the family returned home from the hospital in Madikeri, they were pleasantly surprised to find a crop of paddy had been neatly sowed. Taltareshettalli is a remote village located 10km from Somwarpet town and Puttaiah owned around 1.5 acres of land. He, his daughter and wife all tested positive last week, while his 18-year-old son and two-and-half-year-old grandson were negative. All three were admitted to a Covid-19 hospital in Madikeri, while the son and grandson were home quarantined. ‚ÄúWith Puttaiah in hospital, there was no one to maintain his paddy field,‚Äù said KG Jeevan, a neighbour. ‚ÄúHe had planned to plant paddy. If there was a delay in planting, it would have resulted in a loss of yield. So, some of us joined together and decided to do the planting for free.‚Äù BP Anil Kumar, local gram panchayat president, said members of several families including Kurada Gowdana, Basavera and Chittera joined together to plan the paddy. ‚ÄúThe family returned to the village on Saturday afternoon after treatment. They were surprised to see the paddy had been planted,‚Äù said Kumar. ‚ÄúTo ensure the family do not suffer psychological problems, we welcomed them with a garland.‚Äù Puttaiah‚Äôs son thanked his fellow villagers for their help. ‚ÄúThey have done a big job for us,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/while-ryot-and-family-recovered-locals-farmed-his-land-for-free/articleshow/77321173.cms||Shrinivasa M

August 3, 2020||Dehradun||In a first for Uttarakhand, 10 python eggs hatched in an artificial incubator||Dehradun: A clutch of python eggs got a new lease of life after forest officials of Terai region decided to hatch them and keep them inside an artificial makeshift incubator for nearly two months, starting May-end. The forest officials had taken custody of this clutch of abandoned eggs from a farmhouse in Bazpur area of Banakhera forest range on May 28. The eggs were spotted by kids playing there. Subsequently, forest authorities kept the eggs in a safe place in a forest where the mother python visited for nearly 8-9 hours but thereafter, it abandoned them. After waiting for almost a day, the authorities took them to a Ramnagar-based forest office where they were kept in a silent place inside a room in a ‚Äòmakeshift incubator.‚Äô The python eggs, artificially incubated for almost two months at a maintained temperature between 28 and 31 degrees Celsius and humidity between 72 and 80%, saw hatchlings coming out of it this week. All the hatchlings have now been released into the wild of Terai West where their mother was last spotted. This was the first-of-its-kind experiment of the state forest department with the help of veterinarians and wildlife scientists. Prior to this, Kerala is one of the states where python eggs have been hatched artificially. Notably, pythons are categorised under Schedule 1 of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, the same as snow leopards, which means the species has to be conserved on priority. ‚ÄúWe saw 10 hatchlings coming out which were all fed reptiles and left in the wild safely. Every species has a strong role to play in the ecosystem and thus, we wanted to save them at any cost," said Himanshu Bagri, DFO, Terai West. The eggs were given a safe environment for incubation and two empty thermocol medicines boxes (used to keep vaccines) were used as an incubator. The base of the box was made up of sand to provide humidity and moisture to the eggs while the exterior of this box was covered with husk (used in a cooler) to keep it moist and damp. Surprisingly, this informal technique saved the eggs and hatchlings came out on July 31. The boxes had a thermometer and hygrometer each inside them so that at a regular interval staff could check the internal environment of the temporary incubator. ‚ÄúIt was a unique experiment because it was conducted without any professional equipment like incubators. We managed everything out of waste material and it proved to be quite a successful experiment. We maintained adequate humidity and temperature for the proper growth of the reptiles,‚Äù said Dushyant Sharma, senior veterinary doctor at Corbett Tiger Reserve. It is worth mentioning that pythons are poached for their meat and skin internationally. Many tribal communities consume them as bushmeat while the skin is illicitly traded to Europe and North America for manufacture of high-end accessories like bags, belts, and shoes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-a-first-for-uttarakhand-10-python-eggs-hatched-in-an-artificial-incubator/articleshow/77320103.cms||Shivani Azad

August 3, 2020||Trichy||Councillor builds road with own money||Perambalur: A union councillor in the district has spent Rs 12 lakh from her own pocket to construct a road connecting the remote hamlet with Veppur. A Tamilarasi, 39, purchased the land the from villagers and constructed the makeshift road without waiting for fund from the rural civic body. Tamilarasi was elected as Veppur union councillor from ward 9. During her election campaign, villagers of Sathanatham near Veppur had demanded a rural road to connect their village with Veppur that has a government hospital. The absence of road for decades was forcing the Sathanatham villagers to take a 4km detour via Nannai village to reach Veppur. As there was a significant delay in sanctioning funds from the panchayat, she purchased 47.25 cents of land from villagers to connect the Sathanatham at the shortest possible distance with Veppur. ‚ÄúWith my family‚Äôs support, a linear stretch of land bordering cultivation land from 23 villagers including farmers was purchased last month. For now, a gravel road is laid without disturbing the adjoining farmland,‚Äù Tamilarasi Arul told TOI. The makeshift road is laid for 1.2 km in length and measures 20 feet in width. The councillor said that farmers and people having livestock will benefit from the Veppur-Sathanatham road to market their harvested agriculture produce and reach the veterinary hospital. The Sathanatham village has a population of 1,100 people including school-going children. The villagers said that the neighbouring Kilumathur village in Veppur block will also reap the benefits of the new road by reaching Veppur in a short time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/councillor-builds-road-with-own-money/articleshow/77322908.cms||Deepak Karthik

He said the students could upload the copy of online class XII marksheet along with other documents like EWS certificate, income certificate and category certificate. ‚ÄúThe entire admission process has been made online and candidtes will not have to visit the campus even for counselling or fee submission,‚Äù Srivastava added. Admissions to MBA programme will be made through Common Admission Test (CAT) scores instead of LU‚Äôs own entrance test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-increases-30-seats-in-llb-5-year-course-10-in-ug-progs/articleshow/77323216.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Govt will give incentives to new industries in Vidarbha: Shinde||Nagpur: The state government is planning to give incentives to new factories in Vidarbha as the industries are concentrated in Mumbai-Pune belt, said urban development minister Eknath Shinde on Sunday. He had come to TOI-MT office on a courtesy visit. ‚ÄúThe Samruddhi Mahamarg will be a game changer for the entire state. It passes through 10 districts and additionally link 14 districts. The travelling time to Nagpur from Mumbai will reduce from the current 12 to 15 hours to 6 to 7 hours. Industries will then be ready to set shop in Vidarbha,‚Äù said the minister. ‚ÄúI have urged the chief minister to increase the incentive for companies that set up units far from Mumbai. More the distance, higher should be the incentive,‚Äù he said. Shinde, who is the guardian minister of Gadchiroli district, said that Naxalites could not be rehabilitated just by paying six lakhs to the surrendered ones. ‚ÄúWe will now work with a concrete plan to completely rehabilitate them. They will be trained to make them self-sufficient. The government has made a Rs10 crore provision for this. We will also spend money on improving education, healthcare, roads, etc in the district,‚Äù he added. According to the minister, the lockdown helped the government in reducing Covid-19 cases. ‚ÄúHowever, this should be accompanied by mass testing. All positive patients should be identified and isolated,‚Äù he said. Replying to a query, Shinde said that municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe was unpopular among public representatives because he had been reducing Nagpur Municipal Corporation‚Äôs (NMC‚Äôs) spending. ‚ÄúHe has done a good job of controlling Covid-19 in the city. People fully back him. However, public representatives have been elected by the people and he should take them along while doing his job,‚Äù he added. The high profile death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput is being probed by Mumbai as well as Bihar police. Additionally, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing money transactions between Rajput and his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty. When asked whether he thought that Bihar police and ED were probing the case due to political reasons, Shinde avoided a direct reply. ‚ÄúCM has said that Mumbai police is capable of handling such cases. Devendra Fadnavis was home minister for five years and Mumbai police was under him. He should not doubt its ability,‚Äù he said. However, when pointed out that Parth, son of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, had demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the case, he could not give any reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-will-give-incentives-to-new-industries-in-vidarbha-shinde/articleshow/77322927.cms||Ashish Roy
August 3, 2020||Trichy||Trichy tries out red & white stripes on speed breakers||TRICHY: Trichy Corporation has attempted the combination of red and white stripes for a speed breaker stripes to alert the commuters passing through it in Melapudur locality instead of the conventional white stripes. The red and white stripes, according to the corporation, were emulated from the practice attempted in cities in Maharashtra subscribing to Indian Roads Congress (IRC) protocols. The white stripes conventionally painted over the speed breakers, using thermoplastic paint, goes with the black colour of the road, giving black and white alternate stripes. But the white paint fades away in time. Whereas the combination of red and white stripes was found withstanding, even if the white paint would fade, the red stripes stand to alert road users. The civic body in late 2018 had attempted a similar move on Bharathidasan road near the main corporation office. Since the red and white stripes tried in the speed breaker was bright and endured all weather conditions, the novel attempt was expanded to Melapudur speed breakers recently.  ‚ÄúThe red stripes on speed breakers have indeed made the commuters slow down at a distance before the bumps,‚Äù an official with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-tries-out-red-white-stripes-on-speed-breakers/articleshow/77322919.cms||Deepak Karthik

Locals claim shops with temporary sheds have come up on the wall, putting lives in danger especially during rains. A PIL has been filed at the Nainital high court, but no action has been taken so far, locals alleged. Akash Yadav, an advocate and local resident , said he has raised the issue with several departments, including police, cantonment board and district administration, but nothing has happened on ground. Talking to TOI, Yadav said, ‚ÄúThe pushta wall in Prem Nagar along National Highway 72 has been encroached upon by people by erecting temporary sheds along it, which are being used as shops. Earlier, the hawkers would sit on footpaths. Now, they have erected these structures. Concerned authorities have been alerted, and I‚Äôve also filed a PIL at Nainital high court earlier this month.‚Äù Officials claimed the shopkeepers were asked to vacate as it was illegal to build any structure on a pushta wall or near a national highway. But few days after they were removed, the shops returned to the place. Another local, Kamal Prakash, said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only this particular wall. The shopkeepers dump their belongings on the road, encroaching upon it and hampering traffic movement. Authorities must take quick action to resolve the issue.‚Äù Gopal Ram Binwal, sub-divisional magistrate (Sadar), said, ‚ÄúThe shops were there before the pushta wall was built by NHAI.

Replying to questions during a webinar, Abdullah said he was of the firm belief that Kashmir is incomplete without Kashmiri Pandits and that he would support any mechanism to bring them back honourably. Nearly 60,000 Kashmiri Pandit families are registered as migrants after the onset of militancy in the Kashmir Valley in early 1990s. Abdullah, a member of Lok Sabha and president of the National Conference, chose to blame then former governor Jagmohan for the exodus and said that he ‚Äútook them away‚Äù on the false promise of ensuring their return within three months. During the webinar, Abdullah was asked whether he would support a genocide bill being floated by the Panun Kashmir, a Kashmiri Pandit organisation demanding a separate homeland for the migrants. The former CM said he would have to go into the details of the bill first.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farooq-calls-for-judicial-probe-into-exodus-of-pandits/articleshow/77323510.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Chennai||Chennai: Can fetus get Covid-19 from mother? Doctors begin study||CHENNAI: While studies are now beginning to show evidence that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus, a state-run hospital in Chennai has initiated a study to find if the risk to the child is higher from labour or from close contact with the mother. At least 400 women with Covid-19 have delivered at the Government Hospital for Women and Children in Egmore and about 11% of the newborns tested positive for the viral infection. Since the pandemic began, there have been isolated cases of newborns testing positive for coronavirus at birth, but there has not been enough evidence to rule out the possibility that the infants became infected by the mother after they were born. "While about four babies tested positive on the first day of birth, others were tested on the third or fifth day. We don‚Äôt know if the babies who tested positive on the third day got the infection because of close contact with the mother or because they were passed on during labour," said hospital director Dr Vijaya. In the last week of July, doctors at Sasson Hospital in Pune announced that they had the first and convincing evidence of transmission of the virus during pregnancy. Doctors said the baby‚Äôs nasal swab, placenta and umbilical stump tested positive for Covid-19 on RT-PCR test at birth. A week before the delivery, the mother, who had a history of fever, was tested because her results were negative. She was later found to have elevated levels of the virus-specific antibodies in her blood confirming that she had the Covid-19 infection in the recent past. Similar cases have emerged from the US and France. Doctors in the city said they plan to test the placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and breast milk of at least 1,000 women who go into labour. "We want to see if the virus reaches the placenta and replicates there. It will tell us if it is transmitted to the fetus. We also want to know if the fetus can have symptoms similar to adult Covid-19 patients," Dr Vijaya said. The results of the study will also help them analyse the effect of the virus in the first, second and third trimester of pregnancies. Health minister C Vijayabaskar said the state was encouraging tertiary care hospitals and medical colleges to conduct similar research to understand the virus better. "It helps doctors improve clinical management of pregnant women, check neonates and reduce the risk of viral transmission besides suggesting need for better policies," he said. "Most babies and mothers have recovered," he said. According to the public health department, at least 3,000 women have tested positive for the viral infection so far among which 32% were positive after they delivered. Thirteen mothers (0.4%) have died, 72% of them have recovered and have been discharged along with their infants. "Little more than a quarter of the pregnant women are still under treatment," health secretary J Radhakrishnan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/can-fetus-get-covid-19-from-mother-docs-begin-study/articleshow/77322433.cms||---

The civic body‚Äôs health department said the recovery rate has been good as most of the positive patients ‚Äî around 40% ‚Äî have been between the ages of 22 and 39. Also, nearly 80% of the patients within PCMC limits have been asymptomatic. Data put out on Sunday evening showed the twin cities have 6,600 active patients and 15,479 recoveries. An official from the civic body said after the 22 to 39 age group, the 40 to 59 age group remains the most affected by the coronavirus. A total of 6,566 people from this group have contracted the virus so far. And except for a few cases with comorbidities, individuals in these age groups have been able to fight off the virus because of overall good health. The official added that most of the asymptomatic patients have opted for home isolation. The official said, ‚ÄúMany are in home isolation. These patients are with their families and that can play a major role in early recovery.‚Äù Records reveal that around 6,000 patients have opted for home isolation so far. Officials from the PCMC said their health is being monitored regularly via a dedicated call centre. Other officials attributed PCMC's recovery rate to the increase in the number of Covid Care Centres. Many of these units came up as PCMC scaled up Covid-19 testing. Officials said the increased testing and the availability of isolation units helped in early detection and swift treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-15000-have-recovered-in-pcmc-limits/articleshow/77322446.cms||---

The local citizens‚Äô group and family members of the deceased women had alleged that the mismanagement at the centre had led to her death on Thursday. They claimed that though oxygen-supported beds and cylinders were available on the premises of the centre, the laggardness of the municipal staffers led to their unavailability. ‚ÄúThe citizens have highlighted the problem faced by the family. They have given us a memorandum about the issue. Directives have been given to the Pune Municipal Corporation officers concerned for looking into the matter and to take appropriate action,‚Äù Mohol said. According to the victim‚Äôs family members, the patient, along with her husband, was admitted at the care centre in the Vishrantwadi area. The woman, admitted on the third-floor of the centre, reported shortness of breath on Thursday. According to the protocol, the woman had to be shifted from the third-floor to the first-floor of the centre for oxygen support. Her family members alleged that a stretcher was not available for her transport. They themselves brought her down to the first-floor, following which the staffers allegedly told them that the room with the oxygen-supported beds was locked and the keys were missing. The staffers then had to break open the room, and despite that, oxygen could not be administered to the patient as the tools for operating the same were not available. ‚ÄúMy wife would have been alive today had she received timely care.

August 3, 2020||Chennai||Thrashed by cops, man in Chennai ends life, inspector suspended||CHENNAI: A 42-year-old house painter, who set himself ablaze after allegedly being beaten up by police at Puzhal in Chennai on Saturday, died of burn injuries on Sunday afternoon. Puzhal inspector Bensam has been placed under suspension. In a video recorded by his brother at the Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital where he was admitted for treatment late on Saturday, Srinivasan said Rajendran, his landlord who is an AIADMK functionary, had brought the inspector to pressure him into vacating his house. According to sources, Srinivasan had not paid rent for the past three months. He had rented the house at Vinayakapuram a year ago and was staying there with his wife and two daughters. Seven other tenants reside in the compound. Police said Srinivasan was let off with a warning eight months ago after neighbours complained that he often created ruckus after getting drunk. Inspector suspended for the second time in 3 yrsAccording to police, the neighbours again complained about him to the landlord on Saturday, and a police team reached the spot after being informed by Rajendran. Around 7pm, inspector Bensam allegedly beat up Srinivasan for creating ruckus and for not paying rent. As Srinivasan was completely sozzled, the inspector asked him to come to the police station on Sunday morning. According to his relatives, Srinivasan failed to pay rent as he could not find a job due to the lockdown, but police attacked him at the behest of Rajendran who wanted him to vacate the house. Unable to bear the humiliation of being beaten up by police in front of other tenants, Srinivasan set himself on fire at 11pm and was taken to the KMCH. Puzhal police have registered a case under CrPC 174 (unnatural death). ‚ÄúA detailed probe is on and we have sought a report,‚Äù a senior police officer said. This is the second suspension of inspector Bensam in the last three years. In July 2018, action was taken against him for making obscene gestures at an unidentified woman in a video call when he was the inspector of Karungal police station in Kanyakumari district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/thrashed-by-cops-man-in-chennai-ends-life-inspector-suspended/articleshow/77323511.cms||Sindhu Kannan

The 38-year-old man was given a ‚Äòpositive‚Äô report three hours after a ‚Äònegative‚Äô report. Then, despite being asymptomatic, the person got billed Rs1.9 lakh, reduced to Rs1.39 lakh after strong objections, for just six days of hospital stay. A copy of the reports available with TOI show one of the three private laboratories in the city released a report to the person at 9pm on July 26. The date and time of sample collection and report is same, though the person gave the sample a day earlier. The report said he tested negative using Real Time (RT) PCR method. The person received another report at 11.58pm from the same laboratory, saying he was positive. The person got admitted at Seven Star Hospital at Jagnade Square at 9.26pm on July 27. As per hospital‚Äôs tie-up, another private laboratory took a sample and gave a negative report on July 31. The person had fever a week before testing and pain in legs. When admitted, he reported no symptoms like fever, cough, cold etc. The hospital discharged him at 10.49am on August 2 with a bill of Rs1.9 lakh. The patient‚Äôs elder brother objected and said he intended to lodge a complaint with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The hospital revised the bill to Rs1.39 lakh, which the patient paid and returned home. Citing state government orders, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had on June 4 set charges for private hospitals for Covid and non-Covid patients. Private hospitals were to charge Rs4,000 per day for ward stay with isolation, monitoring and investigations. The private hospital billed the man for seven days. For twin-sharing room, Rs10,000 per day was charged with separate charges of Rs7,000 for nursing, Rs17,500 for consultation, Rs10,500 for RMO charges and fees for all types of investigations. Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe said a proper investigation will be done followed by appropriate action. Director of Seven Star Hospital Dr Prashant Rahate denied any violations. ‚ÄúAs per government‚Äôs guidelines, we are supposed to charge 80% beds as per government rates, and 20% beds our rates. We are asking patients if they wish to get admitted in government-rate facility or our rate. We give all facilities like TV, internet Wi-Fi etc in our rate,‚Äù he said. Dr Rahate added, ‚ÄúWe were directed to start Covid-19 services but were not getting non-Covid patients since then. We are paying high salaries to doctors and staff for risky Covid-19 work. Also, we all are residing in a costly private hotel, to prevent infection to our families. Also, we are taking care of our staff to boost immunity etc. We cannot operate in government charges. All should appreciate our efforts.‚Äù Representatives of Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) had approached divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar a few days ago opposing the charges finalized by NMC. They submitted their list of rates to Kumar, who forwarded it to the government for approval, but told them to start Covid-19 services at NMC rates till government approval is received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lab-gives-ve-report-3-hrs-after-ve-hospital-issues-rs-1-9l-bill-for-7-days/articleshow/77322469.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

August 3, 2020||India||Tribal party wrangles deal with Gehlot over support||JAIPUR: As the dissidence-struck Congress government in Rajasthan heads into a possible trust vote, even the two-MLA Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) has played its bargaining chips to get a long-pending demand fulfilled by CM Ashok Gehlot in return for its support. Gehlot‚Äôs announcement of August 9 as a public holiday in the state to mark World Tribal Day is one among several demands negotiated by the BTP. The party had supported Congress in the Rajya Sabha polls in June, but the crisis triggered by sacked deputy CM Sachin Pilot's revolt seemed too good an opportunity to pass for some hard negotiations, sources said. Gehlot has since committed to fulfilling 8-10 demands mentioned in the tribal party‚Äôs election manifesto. "The state government declaring a holiday on World Tribal Day is just the beginning. CM Gehlot promised while seeking support that all our demands would be fulfilled once the crisis is over," BTP MLA Rajkumar Roat told TOI over phone from Jaisalmer on Sunday. The BTP, formed in 2017, had contested 11 seats in 2018 against Congress and BJP. The party won two seats ‚Äî Roat from Chorasi and Ramprasad from Sagwara ‚Äì and finished second in two other constituencies. From the start, BTP was seen as a Congress ally. The relationship, however, soured after the merger of six BSP MLAs with Congress last September, giving Gehlot a comfortable majority of 106 in the 200-seat assembly. The party returned to Congress's side before the Rajya Sabha polls, lured by the government's promise to consider its demands. "After RS polls, our party realised that Congress is not working on our demands. The sense of betrayal was natural," Roat said. The party‚Äôs national president, Gujarat-based Mahesh Vasava, issued a whip to its two MLAs in Rajasthan to abstain from voting in the event of any floor test. This was followed by Roat being allegedly mistreated by the police in Jaipur over a video clip of him with BJP functionaries. This almost marked the end of BTP's ties with Congress until a patch-up effort was made by two of Gehlot's colleagues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tribal-party-wrangles-deal-with-gehlot-over-support/articleshow/77323513.cms||Shoeb Khan
August 3, 2020||Bareilly||AIKSCC to launch countrywide protest on day of Quit India Movement with slogan ‚ÄòCorporate Bhagao, Kisani Bachao‚Äô||Pilibhit: Two hundred and fifty farmer‚Äôs unions from across the country are set to launch a countrywide protest in support of their nine-point demand under the auspices of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) on August 9, the day India‚Äôs freedom fighters launched the ‚ÄòQuit India Movement‚Äô.Their demands include withdrawal of three ordinances passed by the Union government in June, to modify agricultural marketing. A loan waiver relief package for farmers is another crucial demand of AIKSCC.Notably, the Union government had amended the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) as a first step towards wiping out existing restrictions on stocking of food products like grains, oilseeds, pulses, potatoes, onions, etc.A second contentious ordinance was the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance (FPTC), passed with an objective of perforating monopolistic powers of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC), in order to ‚Äúempower farmers to sell their produce anywhere within the country‚Äù.The third contentious ordinance was the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (FAPAFS), by virtue of which, the government legalised contract farming.Talking to TOI on the phone, Singh said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll target all three ordinances as they are unconstitutional and will intensify farmers‚Äô woes, instead of addressing them.‚Äù He said the ECA amendment will protect traders‚Äô malpractices of hoarding, which would be enough to spoil the entire food produce marketing ecosystem.Slamming FPTC, he said over 80% agriculturists in the country were marginal or small farmers who are not internet savvy to search for suitable markets in other states. ‚ÄúHow can a small farmer afford the expenses of transporting his crop to another state? How can he expect a fair deal from traders after reaching there?‚Äù Singh asked.Regarding FAPAFS, he said the ordinance will convert farmers into labourers on their own lands, as big business groups and companies will begin cultivating vast swathes of agricultural lands on contract. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll send our memo of nine-point demands to the PM on August 9, which will also include our demand for interest-free fresh crop loans for forthcoming crops, as the farmers suffered great losses due to the Covid-19 lockdown, and price of produce as per the Swaminathan Commission‚Äôs recommendations,‚Äù he said.The farmers will raise the slogan ‚ÄúCorporate Bhagao, Kisani Bachao‚Äù from their tractors, roofs of their houses and fields. They will also hand over a copy of AIKSCC‚Äôs memorandum to the DM or SDM of their respective areas. Afterwards, they will upload their selfies on Twitter, Facebook and the AIKSCC website, Singh said.He added the protest will continue like the Quit India Movement until the desired result is achieved by the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/aikscc-to-launch-countrywide-protest-on-day-of-quit-india-movement-with-slogan-corporate-bhagao-kisani-bachao/articleshow/77318792.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Lucknow||Three Cobas 8,800 machines to ramp up Covid tests in UP||LUCKNOW: Amid rising cases of Covid-19 in the state, the medical education department has decided to install three Cobas 8800 machines, each having capacity of conducting 4,000 tests every day. Besides, 17 more labs conducting RT-PCR tests would be made functional in UP this month. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary, medical education, Rajneesh Dubey said that the first Cobas 8800 machine would be installed at Prayagraj, while in the next phase Lucknow and Gorakhpur would get one machine each. Cobas 8800 machine has a capacity to test 4,000 tests per day, Dubey said, adding that the state has already crossed the cumulative figure of 10,000 tests mark per million population. Starting with a single lab at KGMU with the capacity to conduct around 100 tests per day on January 29, the state has now over 150 labs, conducting over one lakh tests every day which is 20 per cent of the total tests conducted in the country, Dubey said and added that the state is conducting highest number of tests in the country. By crossing over 10,000 tests per million per day, the medical education department has created a record of sorts. In fact, UP today is the only state in the country conducting over one lakh tests per day which is 20% of the total tests being conducted in the country. UP has 53 labs conducting RT-PCR tests and of them 31 are government labs. The state also has 117 labs, including 100 government labs, conducting Truenattests. The ACS added that 17 more labs, including seven in private medical colleges, conducting RT-PCR tests, would be set up in the state this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/three-cobas-8800-machines-to-ramp-up-covid-tests-in-up/articleshow/77323231.cms||Subhash Mishra
August 3, 2020||Ludhiana||Resentment grows against PSPCL‚Äô s Rs 2/unit hike||Ludhiana: Resentment against the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) decision to levy Rs 2 per unit extra in addition to the normal power charges from 6pm to 10pm in industries is growing among the businessmen. This decision of the PSPCL has become a headache for the industry as according to the businessmen, their financial position is worse at this moment as their sales have not picked up owing to the situation caused by Covid-19 and therefore they are unable to pay these charges. Giving more information, Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of Federation of Industrial & Commercial Organization (FICO), said, ‚ÄúWe strongly oppose the decision of the PSPCL of imposing peak load charges of Rs 2 per unit for use of power from 6pm to 10pm. It is very unfortunate that even in these unprecedented times of coronavirus pandemic the PSPCL and the government has put burden of additional Rs2 per unit on us for the consumption of electricity from June 1 till September 30. If this was not enough , the PSPCL also withdrew the concession of Rs 1.25 against the night tariff available to industry for running operations from 10pm to 6am. We will not sit silent and take up this matter with chief minister Amarinder Singh and demand immediate roll back.‚Äù According to KK Seth, chairman of FICO, ‚ÄúDue the prevailing Covid-19 conditions, industries are going through a period of recession and imposing the peak load charges in these times will only increase the hurdles for it. Punjab‚Äôs industry generates huge revenue for the government in form of various taxes and duties and in return expects the support of the government in ease of doing business. By imposing the peak load charges, the raw material cost of the industry will be increased as electricity is one major raw material. So, the government should roll back its decision.‚Äù Dinesh Singh Bhogal, secretary of FICO, said, ‚ÄúAs electricity cannot be stored, it can only be used after it‚Äôs produced, so the huge units of electricity is still available in surplus, which can be utilised by the industry and government can earn revenue on it. Therefore, the government should provide discount on the night usage of power rather than slapping extra charges for consumption post 6pm.‚Äù Ashpreet Singh Sahni, organizing secretary, FICO, said, ‚ÄúPunjab is a surplus state in terms of power, especially hydel, which costs very low. Industrialists are already getting the most expensive power in Punjab, when compared to the neighbouring states and over and above this Rs 2 per unit has been further slapped on us. This decision is beyond our understanding and will hurt the industry very badly and will also hit government revenue as factories will refrain from operating during these hours, so it‚Äôs better that the PSPCL takes back this decision as soon as possible.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/resentment-grows-against-pspcl-s-rs-2/unit-hike/articleshow/77321342.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Central govt won't impose any language on states, says Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank||CHENNAI: Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Sunday reiterated that the Centre will not impose any language on any state. Tweeting in Tamil, Pokhriyal sought the support of the people in Tamil Nadu for the New Education Policy 2020. "We are looking forward to your guidance in implementing the New Education Policy 2020 in Tamil Nadu. I would like to reiterate that the Centre will not impose any language on any state," Pokhriyal said in his tweet in Tamil, in response to former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan, who had attached Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech about NEP 2020 in his twitter handle. The move comes in the wake of political parties in Tamil Nadu opposing NEP. DMK president M K Stalin on Sunday said NEP will make education affordable only to a small segment of people and called on ruling AIADMK to reject NEP. Pokhriyal's tweet elicited response, with several people countering the Union Minister on the NEP. "If no language will be imposed on any state, then it is better to continue with the two-language formula being followed at present. Why introduce the three-language formula at all," asked one. "If third language option has to be there, then let the option be for learning an international language," said another. "While I thank you for at least making a statement that the intent is not to impose any language on anyone, eventually you will end up saying that we have teachers only for teaching Hindi," countered yet another in his tweet. The developments came on a day when DMK president Stalin urged the ruling AIADMK to oppose NEP 2020. "NEP will create havoc in the education system and will make education affordable for only a few, while villages will suffer without proper education. Everyone should oppose this. The ruling party (AIADMK) should reject the new education policy," Stalin said, while participating in a panel discussion on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-central-govt-wont-impose-any-language-on-states-says-ramesh-pokhriyal-nishank/articleshow/77323514.cms||D Govardan
August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Balanced diet while breastfeeding helps in post-delivery weight loss||NAGPUR: Most of us know that breast milk helps to keep the baby healthy by providing all the important nutrients that the child requires in the proper quantities. Breastfeeding also has its benefits for mothers. Apart from saving new mothers from various types of cancer, diabetes and hypertension, it helps burn calories thereby helping in post-partum weight loss, said dietitian Malvika Fulwani. ‚ÄúMother should exclusively breastfeed her child for first six months. This will not only make the baby feel safe and loved, but also helps mothers lose some extra pounds gained during pregnancy,‚Äù said Fulwani. But, for this, there is no need for the mother to eat for two. ‚ÄúMother has to eat for two is a myth. The mother has to eat for herself and a little extra like 500 calorie more in the diet, which can get her fit and back in shape within six months. But, this diet should be nutrient-rich and packed with the nutrition which supports breastfeeding and nurtures a healthy baby,‚Äù she said. Eating double will only add unnecessary weight which may land mothers in post-partum depression, she said. ‚ÄúMothers can avoid all such complications by having a balanced diet. Theme of breastfeeding week 2020 is ‚ÄòSupport breastfeeding for a healthier planet‚Äô. I think diet is the most important support for breastfeeding,‚Äù she said. Doctors said breast milk constantly changes itself in its composition as and how required by the baby to meet all of its Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). ‚ÄúWeight gain is the best way to tell if your baby is getting enough nutrition through milk. It is normal for babies to lose about 7 to 8 per cent of their weight in the first five days and return to birth weight by 10 to 14 days. You will establish a milk supply for baby in the first three weeks. The more the baby has, the more milk your body produces,‚Äù said gynecologist Dr Rajasi Sengupta, secretary of Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society (NOGS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/balanced-diet-while-breastfeeding-helps-in-post-delivery-weight-loss/articleshow/77322939.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Health officials caught off guard as spot testing begins||Nagpur: Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) started spot rapid antigen test for high risk close contacts of positive patients at five quarantine centres and one Covid Care Centre (CCC) on Sunday. The move came unexpectedly a day before the announced start from Monday. Additional municipal corporation Ram Joshi told TOI the testing was started early to assess challenges that would have come on the first day. ‚ÄúWe got good response from people and the process was largely carried out without major glitches,‚Äù he said. Joshi admitted some difficulties were encountered in setting up kiosk for contactless swab collection and arrangements for suspects. ‚ÄúThese would be overcomed,‚Äù he said. Fifty suspects were tested at Pachpaoli CCC. Of them, six tested positive. At NU Law College hostel quarantine centre, four out of 35 tested positive. At RPTS quarters, Morris College Girls hostel, Ravi Bhavan and Raj Nagar PWD quarters, the total number of tests was in single digits. The suspected cases were shortlisted in high risk contact tracing of positive patients by zonal medical officers. These were brought in NMC buses to the testing centres. However, the sudden move to begin testing allegedly took the administrative staff by surprise. The Ashi Nagar zone suspects complained they had to stand outside for over two hours before chairs were provided. Later, the centre officials made seating arrangements with distancing norms. The collection teams had to don PPE kits to collect swabs as kiosk were not set up. Making matters worse, the positive persons had to be asked to return home allegedly in their own vehicles as there was no plan in case anyone turns out positive. Officials said such persons were counselled to directly go home and collect their belongings. They were then shifted to MLA Hostel CCC which received around 100 patients in the day. Questions were raised as Pachpaoli itself is a CCC and the patients could have been accommodated there right away instead of being sent home. The positive cases would be screened and those found asymptomatic can avail home isolation if they wish. The public health department officials said they were not informed about the decision though most of their staff is deployed. Some suspects drove to MLA Hostel CCC and had to be convinced it was not a testing centre. All asymptomatic patients would be screened at MLA Hostel CCC. Joshi clarified the facility for spot rapid antigen test is only for high risk close contacts, people with symptoms and comorbities. ‚ÄúIt is not advisable for everyone. People need to come through proper channel. First they must contact the zone office where the medical team will guide them,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/health-officials-caught-off-guard-as-spot-testing-begins/articleshow/77322479.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Recently, there was a case of two men of a particular community being beaten up in a village of Jalgaon district. The police had reached the incident spot in time and rescued the concerned men averting a major untoward incident. However, there was a post on the social media that the incident had happened in Malegaon.

August 3, 2020||Hubballi||Experts, academicians hail new education policy||Dharwad: Academicians and experts have welcomed the National Education Policy-2020 announced by the Modi-led Central government. Director of UGC Human Resource Development Centre Harish Ramaswamy said the new policy is a leap forward in India‚Äôs long-standing ambition of becoming a global education hub. It promotes multi-dimensional development of education and highlights cherished Indian values. Early childhood care education is an excellent step. Aided by the flexible 5+3+3+4 structure of schooling, it benefits students and helps in lateral entry in their careers. The removal of bureaucratic affiliations is another positive step. Inviting foreign universities will introduce competitiveness while renewed focus on India‚Äôs myriad languages will help extract our own knowledge and culture, Harish added. Former vice-president of Karnatak University Srinivas Saidapur said overhauling education system was long due and hence the NEP is welcome. Changes suggested for school education are in general welcome he said, and added that the proposal to convert colleges and universities as multi-faculty institutions is most welcome and timely. At the same time, the universities should have been given total autonomy and control by authorities like the UGC should have been reduced, he said. They are often stumbling blocks and discourage varsities from making new inroads, experiments and innovations in the education system as a whole, he felt. Director of Karnataka State Higher Education Academy SM Shivaprasad said the architects of NEP, after due reflection and extensive consultation, have chiselled a vision and a roadmap that is in tune with contemporary societal requirements. The thrust to prioritize higher education in the budget, forming appropriate central regulatory, policy making and research funding agencies, and credit carry-overs across institutions and disciplines is laudable, he said. Though this brilliant document throughout highlights the critical role of teachers in higher education, the actual teacher empowerment programmes necessary to make it happen could have been elaborated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/experts-academicians-hail-new-education-policy/articleshow/77320737.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

However, with both the central and state governments easing all restrictions, the people in Hubballi-Dharwad on August 2 experienced the fun of a Sunday, which was how it had been before the pandemic.

Many business establishments in Hubballi‚Äôs Central Business District registered encouraging business as a result. Most of the people who ventured outside wore masks, and were found carrying hand sanitisers. ‚ÄúIt is very encouraging to see people returning to the markets and visiting restaurants, and even having food at roadside eateries.

He attended the funeral without wearing a PPE kit to show that one could not contract the virus seven hours after a patient‚Äôs death. A 57-year-old from Challapalli village in Krishna district had died of Covid-19 while undergoing treatment at Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur. The family members refused to claim the body to perform the final rites. Upon learning about the incident, joint collector Dinesh Kumar swung into action and roped in Amma Charitable Trust to perform the funeral. Along with the representatives of the trust, the joint collector visited the burial ground where the funeral was performed as per the religious traditions of the victim. Amma trust chief Swamy Gnana Prasanna Giri lit the pyre. ‚ÄúWe wanted to send a message to people that they cannot contract the virus if they perform the final rites of their kin after six to seven hours after death,‚Äù said Dinesh Kumar. Dinesh Kumar said families can claim the bodies after 24 hours and perform final rites without any fear. ‚ÄúFamilies could wear PPEs and take a little care if they still have fear. In my view, they would not need any kits after 24 hours,‚Äù said the joint collector. He said the bodies of Covid-19 victims would be sprayed with sodium hypochlorite and packed in sealed bag as a precaution. In a similar gesture, Kurnool legislator Hafeez Khan wore a PPE kit to perform the funeral of a person who had succumbed to Covid-19. Meanwhile, Gopichand, district principal and sessions judge and chairman of District Legal Services Authority (DLSA), has directed the police to book criminal cases against those obstructing the funerals of Covid-19 victims. ‚ÄúAs per IPC 297, 341, 147 and 148, it is a crime to obstruct funerals.

In addition to this, it will also be ensured that the process of initiating GST refunds on timely basis and solving all problems of the tax payers do not get affected due to the ongoing situation when Covid-19 cases are on the rise.‚Äù Meanwhile, the working of Ludhiana office of the department is bound to suffer for some time as three staffers of the range-2 had tested positive on Friday, following which the building was sealed, though the senior officials of department had decided to open the office on Monday. But the reports of all officials and staffers who came in contact with the three positive cases have went into self quarantine due to which various works are likely to get affected. However, in another reshuffle which took place on July 27, Damanjit Singh Mann, who was serving as secretary, Regional Transport Authority (RTA), was made the assistant excise and taxation commissioner of range -2 of the Ludhiana office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tejbir-sidhu-gets-addl-charge-of-dy-excise-commissioner/articleshow/77321347.cms||Mohit Behl

August 3, 2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Four youths land in trouble for spin into actor Mohan Babu‚Äôs farmhouse||HYDERABAD: What seemed like a joy ride to four youngsters, ended up in them getting arrested on Saturday night. A criminal trespass case was registered after the four sped past the main gate into actor-producer Mohan Babu‚Äôs farmhouse at Jalpally, took a U-turn at the portico of the main building, zoomed out of the premises. Police arrested four youngsters ‚Äî Raghav Biradar, 30, private employee, K Anand, 24, student, Gowtam Rao, 23, car driver, and S Raju David, 22, grocery store worker, all residents of Durga Nagar in Mylardevpally, late on Saturday night. Around 8.30 pm on Saturday, they trespassed into the Manchu Township farmhouse of the actor an Innova vehicle in Pahadesharif. Alerted by security guard and other staff, the actor‚Äôs family immediately alerted police as they perceived the incident as a potential security threat. A criminal trespass case was registered. During preliminary probe, Pahadesharif police found out that the security guard of the compound had opened the main gate to allow a bike to leave the premises. ‚ÄúThere was a security guard manning the huge main gate of the compound. He had to open the gate completely to let the bike leave the premises. When the gate was open, an Innova suddenly entered the premises from outside. As it was raining, the security guard was holding an umbrella in one hand and tried to stop the Innova. As the vehicle did not stop, he gave a chase,‚Äù Pahadesharif inspector S Vishnu Vardhan Reddy said. Even as the security guard was chasing the vehicle on foot, the Innova went till the main building and took a U-turn in front of the portico. They drove out of the premises quickly through the main gate, which remained open, the inspector said. Police verified CCTV camera footage at the farmhouse and identified the registration number of the Innova (AP 31 AN 0004). Six traffic challans were pending against the vehicle number, mostly for speeding. Later in the night, police apprehended Raghav, Anand, Gowtam and David, residents of Durga Nagar, which is located a few kilometres away from the farmhouse. ‚ÄúOne of them is a college student and the rest are private workers. They did not know whose farmhouse they entered. They thought it is some kind of adventure to enter into the place which is frequented by film industry people,‚Äù the inspector said. Police summoned the family members of the four youngsters. After counselling them, police arrested them. ‚ÄúWe will produce them before the magistrate tomorrow,‚Äù the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-youths-land-in-trouble-for-spin-into-actors-farmhouse/articleshow/77322519.cms||---

Food Minister R Kamaraj, district collector, T Anand, and officials paid their tributes.

August 3, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Patients from old-age home find it hard in hospital||Thiruvananthapuram: She has been tested positive for Covid-19. She is feverish and has severe body pain; but a woman employed as caretaker at an old-age home continues to do her job even while under treatment for Covid-19 at General Hospital. Around 10 inmates of the 27 of an old-age home at Kochuthura, who were tested positive for Covid-19 and admitted to General Hospital, have been bed-ridden for years and always need help to eat, to drink water and even for their basic needs. This has left the caretaker woman with no other option but to feed them, to make them drink water and to remove their sheets whenever they pass urine and stool. At the old-age home, it took around five people to move them in wheel chairs to toilets. In a hospital ward crowded with patients and with no attached toilets, these old women, tested positive and suffering from other ailments, are becoming glaring reminders of need to mandate reverse quarantine. ‚ÄúI feel severe body pain, but I can‚Äôt lie around watching them suffer. I had fed them and taken care of them at the old-age home. When I know that one person is paralysed or one cannot move their right arm or one can‚Äôt see clearly, I have to help them eat and meet their basic requirements. Here hospital staff are also overburdened,‚Äù the woman said. One of the old women who is admitted has blurred vision and again it is the caretaker woman who has to take her to toilet. As for other women, who can‚Äôt move on their own, the only way is to keep changing sheets. There is nothing much the hospital authorities can do at this stage. Specialised care is needed for perennially bed-ridden patients ‚Äî something that is difficult to implement when cases surge at an alarming pace. Local ward councillor has been apprising the officials concerned about the issues of transferring bed-ridden patients to Covid hospitals. A total of 27 inmates and six others at old-age home were tested positive for Covid-19. The district administration has recently started a reverse quarantine facility at Vallakadavu. The authorities are also seeking community support to run reverse-quarantine facilities in coastal areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/patients-from-old-age-home-find-it-hard-in-hospital/articleshow/77316004.cms||Aswin J Kumar

August 3, 2020||Pune||Rush of outside nCoV patients to city points to ignored H1N1 lessons||Pune: As early warnings go, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was critical for Maharashtra. It was the first pandemic of the 21st century and it threw open the possibility of mass-scale infection capable of overwhelming healthcare systems. Vital lessons were learned and promises were made to boost disease surveillance, the number of doctors and local healthcare. But 11 years later, Covid-19 has seeped into the gaps that were supposed to have been sealed in the state and particularly Pune district, widely regarded as the epicentre of swine flu in the country.One indicator of failure is the number of Covid patients pouring into Pune‚Äôs intensive care units. Since early July, city doctors have been reporting a noticeable increase in patients from neighbouring districts and rural areas. One estimate states that 20% of all admissions in most city hospitals are from outside Pune city. Every week, at least 10 seriously-ill patients are being moved from the rural areas to Sassoon hospital, Yeshwantrao Chavan Memorial hospital or Aundh chest hospital.Most of these patients are from Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur and Ahmednagar ‚Äî regions impacted by H1N1. In a 2012 paper, experts studying swine flu at the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, Nashik, and Government Medical College, Miraj, had concluded: ‚ÄúEarly case detection can reduce the burden of disease, so the health system should be strengthened.‚Äù‚ÄúThat wasn't done,‚Äù said a retired Pune-based doctor. ‚ÄúWe had 10 years to build trust within local communities. Patients from these parts are fleeing ill-equipped hospitals. Their only hope is the big city hospitals.‚ÄùBut the big units are fast running out of beds themselves. Over the weekend, hospitals in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits had no more than a handful of vacant ICU beds for critical pateints.Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of Bharati hospital, said they have treated six Covid-19 patients, mainly from Baramati (Pune district), Wai (Satara district) and Sangli since early July. ‚ÄúThree of them needed ICU care. Hospitals in smaller cities and towns don‚Äôt have infectious diseases experts or trained intensivists,‚Äù he pointed out.Nashik is one such example. Seven private intensivists have now been roped in by the Nashik civil hospital to visit it once a day in turns to treat coronavirus patients. Intensivists play a key role in ensuring shorter ICU stays.In Aurangabad too, there has been a similar scramble for equipment and personnel. The number of ventilators at the government medical college and hospital there rose from 28 to 83. Requests have been made for more machines, but that would mean more trained staff. The hospital serves eight districts of Marathwada.‚ÄúWe did very little to improve the public health sector,‚Äù said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical advisor to the state government on pandemic control. ‚ÄúOnly a few states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have taken steps to improve local healthcare systems. Merely constructing hospitals will not do. In Maharashtra, there are not enough doctors or trained staff to run these hospitals. We have done nothing, or very little, to prepare for an extreme situation like Covid-19. What we are facing today is the result of several decades of ignorance,‚Äù he said.Salunkhe said even at the national level, not much was done to improve disease surveillance. ‚ÄúWe still do not have foolproof early-warning systems that can detect pandemic-level events. And barring ICMR guidelines, no state has research institutes or teams of experts working on the subject. We need branches of the National Centre for Disease Control in every state.‚Äù Other experts said lapses such as these have led to delayed treatment. A Telangana-based doctor said many of his Covid patients spent on average at least two days looking up helplines and information on the internet after symptom onset. ‚ÄúThose two days could have been put to better use. The pace of this virus can only be met with swift treatment,‚Äù he said.Sanjay Pathare, director of Pune‚Äôs Ruby Hall Clinic, said, ‚ÄúWe have been receiving Covid-19 patients from districts in western Maharashtra. Most of them needed ICU care because they delayed medical care.‚ÄùSalunkhe said capable institutes and personnel should be localised to catch infectious diseases early. ‚ÄúHow many epidemiologists do we have in each block or ward? Each state needs to create institutes like the National Institute of Virology. Only then can we have an early-warning net. We need to learn from the coronavirus.‚Äù(With inputs from Santosh Sonawane, Syed Rizwanullah and Satyajit Joshi)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rush-of-outside-ncov-patients-to-city-points-to-ignored-h1n1-lessons/articleshow/77322516.cms||Umesh Isalkar
August 3, 2020||Ludhiana||Breather for hospitality industry after closing time extended by 1 hour||Ludhiana: In a big relief to the hospitality industry, hotels, restaurants and other similar ventures, the closing time has been extended by one hour and now they will be allowed to operate till 10pm. The development is a big breather, especially for the industry as due to closing time of 9pm many difficulties were being faced by the businessmen as maximum turnout of customers was post 8pm and it was challenging for them to cater to the huge rush and also ensure closing by 9pm to avoid action by the authorities. The banquet hall owners too were facing the same problem but now with the deadline extended they too are feeling relieved. The businessmen, however, are demanding that the number of guests allowed for marriage and other functions, which still has been capped at 30, should be increased to 50 at least. Speaking to TOI, Amarveer Singh, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association, Ludhiana, said, ‚ÄúWe welcome the decision of the state government and district administration to allow restaurants, food outlets, banquet halls to open till 10pm. It was getting impossible for us to do business with the 9pm deadline as majority of food outlets and restaurants had to turn away clients post 8pm as there was pressure on us to close down our units by 9pm. A huge number of businessmen got penalised recently for inability to meet the deadline, but now with one hour extension in the deadline we will be able to ensure that we attend to our customers till 9.30pm and wind up operations by 10pm.‚Äù Amarveer added that, ‚ÄúWe also want to draw the attention of the government towards the crisis being faced by the banquet hall owners due to capping of 30 guests for marriage and other functions. We request the authorities to review this decision and allow us to host up to 50 guests as every property has made all kind of safety arrangements for the hosting of such gatherings and business worth several crores has been affected due to the limitation on number of guests.‚Äù According to Shiv Shankar Rai, owner of a hotel and member of the Hotel and Restaurant Association, Ludhiana, ‚ÄúExtending the closing time of the hotels, restaurants and banquet halls is a big relief for the hospitality industry as huge business opportunity was being lost due to the 9pm deadline. The only problem which now remains is the number of guests allowed in a marriage function, which currently is 30 only. With such small number of guests a lot of marriage functions are being postponed by residents while some have even started organising the small gatherings, particularly of functions like ring ceremonies, anniversary celebrations at home. Because of all this, hotel, banquet hall and marriage palace owners are facing huge losses. So, the government needs to increase the capping on number of guests and save our industry.‚Äù Box ‚Äì Changes for hospitality industry Hotels, restaurants and food outlets allowed to function till 10pm Restaurants allowed to function with 50% capacity or 50 guests, which ever is less. These will also remain open on Sunday as well Restaurants in hotels allowed to serve food, including buffet meals, to up to 50% of their seating capacity or 50 guests, which ever is less Restaurants in hotels will also be open to persons other than hotel guests, but bars shall remain closed Liquor can be served in the rooms and restaurants of hotel as permitted under the excise policy of the state||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/breather-for-hospitality-industry-after-closing-time-extended-by-1-hour/articleshow/77321394.cms||Mohit Behl

August 3, 2020||Madurai||Madurai: Two women jump into well to save cow, rescued||MADURAI: A woman who did not know swimming had a providential escape when she jumped into a 70-feet well swollen with water to save their pregnant cow, which they loved dearly. Fire force personnel later pulled her, her sister-in-law who too jumped down, and the animal. Though the incident happened a few days ago, the matter came to light when it went viral on social media. The incident happened at Meikilarpatti, a village near Usilampatti in Madurai populated by about 1,000 families who were into cattle rearing as a livelihood. Recounting the event, Ragavendran, 40, an electrician, said his wife, Muthu Bhuvaneswari, 34, heard a loud splash of something falling into their well in their backyard. ``I was shocked to see our spotted cow, Thangameena struggling in the well. She was two months pregnant and saving her was my only thought, so I jumped into the well,‚Äù she said, sobbing. Her sister-in-law Sudha heard her cry and rushed to her help. Since she was a good swimmer, she climbed down. Their cries were heard by Ragavendran and his nephew who also went down to save the women. Since they could not lift the cow, Usilampatti fire service personnel were called in. Usilampatti fire officer R Thangam said they used stretchers and ropes to pull out the animal and women. ``She is like my child, and hearing her cry made me act, but what would I do in these corona times when milch animals are our only livelihood and we are forced to eat the bad quality ration rice‚Äô‚Äô she said. Muthu Bhuvaneswari‚Äôs heroic act has come in for much praise in her village where milch cows are revered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/two-women-jump-into-well-to-save-cow-rescued/articleshow/77322483.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Old KSRTC buses to morph into fish & grocery stalls||Thiruvananthapuram: KSRTC has been launching various ventures to boost revenues and tide over the crisis brought about by the pandemic as most of its bus services have been stopped since the lockdown kicked in. The public transporter‚Äôs latest venture, KSRTC Fresh Mart, aims at revamping old and abandoned buses labelled as scrap and renting them out to government agencies such as Matsyafed, Meat Products of India, Kepco, Consumerfed, Supplyco, Kudumbashree, Horticorp and cooperative institutions to run their outlets at bus stands. The announcement was made on its social media page. ‚ÄúOn an average, 30 lakh people travel daily in KSRTC buses. Among them, some are government servants while some are from the private sector. Many people waiting for the bus at the depot may prefer to have a facility to purchase vegetables and other essentials from the bus stand itself. The bus stands, which could provide the facility for passengers, will become a shopping centre. As the construction of a shopping complex is an expensive option and takes time, KSRTC Fresh Mart has been launched by converting old buses into small stalls,‚Äù read the KSRTC‚Äôs post on the social media. The buses, which are in the fleet for more than 15 years and that cannot be used for service will be modified for the venture. Milma and Matsyafed have already agreed to start such stalls near bus stands at Thampanoor and East Fort. It will be a three-year contract and the agencies will have to pay rent for the vehicle as well as the leased-out land where the stalls will function. ‚ÄúThe scrap value of a bus comes to around Rs 1 lakh. This scheme will bring in additional revenue in the form of rent. The body of the bus will be modified and placed in the space set aside for setting up the stall. The agency will have to pay for the bus modification also. At Thampanoor, the stall will be started at a bus stand and at East Fort, a space near Putharikandom ground will be used to set up the facility. The stalls are likely to start functioning in the middle of August. Milma is considering our proposal to start their stall in KSRTC depots,‚Äù said a KSRTC official. In the second phase of the project, KSRTC has proposed to start mobile Fresh Mart units based on demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/old-ksrtc-buses-to-morph-into-fish-grocery-stalls/articleshow/77316024.cms||---

The CPI leader who has been elected from Nagapattinam parliamentary constituency had given his swab for Covid-19 test at Tiruvarur Government Medical College Hospital on Saturday. He had visited Tiruvarur hospital to get treatment for a wound in his leg. Since he was suffering from fever for the last few days, he volunteered for Covid-19 test. After the result came, he instantly travelled to Thanjavur from Nagapattinam and got admitted in the isolation ward, hospital sources said. Earlier on Thursday, he participated in a public hearing conducted by the state government to get public opinion on the bifurcation of the new Mayiladuthurai district from Nagapattinam district.

August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Humane approach makes juveniles withdraw from crime||NAGPUR: The lockdown has re-defined policing to such an extent that even some integrated programmes are bringing surprising outcomes. The city police were surprised to find a dramatic drop in the crimes committed by the juveniles till June this year after their families received assistance from the police department including ration kit and food packets during tighter version of lockdown amid pandemic outbreak. In 2018, city had witnessed 239 crimes committed by the juveniles or average of around 20 per month. Till June this year, only 44 offences were committed for an average of around seven per month. City had earlier the dubious distinction of having high numbers of juveniles in conflict with law. The programme, Counselling and Reformative Education (Care), initiated for reforming and rehabilitating juvenile offenders in September 2018 by city police chief BK Upadhyay, was one such initiative that was stretched to include helping their families too during the lockdown. This led to a transformation in their behaviour too. The bonding that took place between the police and juvenile offenders is learnt to have convinced many of them to reform. The programme currently has 387 juvenile under it‚Äôs purview. Upadhyay said crimes committed by the juvenile have seen an encouraging drop after measures like Care and Chhatra-police were made a part of policing. ‚ÄúWe ensured several juveniles returned to the mainstream of the society abandoning the criminal path. There was a cultivated effort behind the change that ensured a sizable number of teenagers will now possibly not grow up to become a dreaded anti-social element,‚Äù he said. Senior inspector Narendra Hiware of Lakadganj police station explained the manner in which the top cop‚Äôs Care programme was re-moulded during the lockdown. ‚ÄúOfficers are supposed to check the juveniles who have criminal records as a part of the Care programme. Lakadganj police had six such juveniles under surveillance. We were shocked to see their hardship with no food, ration or even other basic materials at home,‚Äù said Hiware. ‚ÄúImmediately, we had started diverting food packets, ration kits and other assistance from NGOs and our own initiatives to their families during the lockdown. The juveniles in turn refrained from taking part in any kind of anti-social activities despite their past record,‚Äù said Hiware. It is learnt the Social Service Branch (SSB), under Inspector Shubhada Sankhe, had organized seven programmes for the juvenile offenders under the supervision of Addl CP, crime, Nilesh Bharne and DCP Gajanan Rajmane. Bharne too said several juvenile offenders bonded with the cops when the latter reached out with love and caring approach. ‚ÄúThere is a definite change of heart among youngsters who were earlier in crime,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/humane-approach-makes-juveniles-withdraw-from-crime/articleshow/77322972.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Kochi||Online class: Rights panel to check burden on kids||Kochi: The Kerala state commission for protection of child rights (KeSCPCR) will look into the complaints that schools are overburdening children with long hours of screen-time exposure as part of online education. ‚ÄúWe have received two complaints about overexposing small children to screen learning. We cannot condone this practice if it violates the mental and physical health of children,‚Äù said Manoj Kumar, chairman, KeSCPCR. He said that even if parents are pressurising schools to take classes, long hours of screen watching is not acceptable, especially without proper breaks. A TOI infographic, ‚ÄòLearn, don‚Äôt cram‚Äô, appeared on July 31, had published the NCERT guidelines on online education for schoolchildren, which clearly stipulate reduction of screen time and more off-screen activities. ‚ÄúMany of the private schools, especially those that follow CBSE curriculum, are conducting online classes continuously for three-four hours even for primary students. The schools are fixing the class hours without considering the adverse impact the activity will have on children. The children are forced to attend classes and sit for hours together. After the class hours, they are made to write loads of notes by again looking at the screens as notes and assignments are given on WhatsApp,‚Äù said J Sandhya, lawyer and former member of KeSCPCR, in her complaint. She said that in this hurry to conduct classes, everybody seems to have forgotten that exposure to the screen for long hours would result in poor eye-sight and other physical issues in children. ‚ÄúThough I tried to intervene and discuss with a few school authorities, they refused to reduce the hours citing that they cannot charge the same school fees if the class hours are reduced. On the other hand, parents are unable to come forward with complaints fearing action from the part of the school management. Hence in the best interest of children, the commission may urgently take this petition into consideration and ensure that online class timings are not excessive,‚Äù she said. A parent who tried to raise this issue in the PTA said, ‚ÄúThey are not bothered about it. Parents are equating the screen time with school fees, as are the schools themselves. Some of them seem to be worried about the missed classes and examinations!‚Äù Even as the discussion picks up, parents are remarking about children developing headaches and eye strain. ‚ÄúA school principal told me that since a vehicle goes to pick up the teachers, it has to be worth the while. If the teacher does not take three-four periods a day, it is not economically viable,‚Äù said Sandhya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/online-class-rights-panel-to-check-burden-on-kids/articleshow/77320260.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
August 3, 2020||India||Digvijaya takes aim at Rahul, adds fuel to Cong‚Äôs ‚Äòold vs new‚Äô fire||NEW DELHI: The exchange within Congress over introspection and leadership continued to simmer on Sunday as senior leader Digvijaya Singh urged Rahul Gandhi to undertake ‚Äúyatras‚Äù across the country and young MP Manickam Tagore said the Gandhi scion had already done so but needed support of senior leaders who were not putting their weight behind him. On Twitter, Singh said while Rahul was ‚Äúdifferent and wants to do politics differently‚Äù, he should be ‚Äúmore active in Parliament and more accessible to people‚Äù. ‚ÄúAs advised by Sharad Pawar, he should go around India. ‚ÄòYatras‚Äô are important to connect,‚Äù he said. The former CM had done a yatra before the state election in Madhya Pradesh. Tagore waded in to insist Rahul had already held nearly 100 marches. ‚ÄúI think if (those) who occupy high positions in party truly stand with him and not criticise behind his back, we won't be in opposition for long,‚Äù he said, adding that if those given to ‚Äúleaking‚Äù information about the party stopped to do so, Congress would win. Yet, Tagore, who had a day earlier agreed with party colleague Rajeev Satav that there was merit in keeping party discussions within the party, deleted his tweets later. Sunday's fresh salvos were a continuation of Satav‚Äôs remarks that ‚Äúintrospection‚Äù over defeats should go back to the UPA era. This led to a strong reaction from a clutch of leaders who said Congressmen should not run down UPA, with Satav's comments coming in a meeting with Sonia Gandhi where former PM Manmohan Singh was present. Satav clarified that he did not question Singh‚Äôs leadership during the meeting of Rajya Sabha MPs, dubbing it ‚Äúa lie, a total misrepresentation of facts‚Äù and a ‚Äúmalicious attempt‚Äù to draw the former PM into the exchange. ‚ÄúUPA-2 was a good government, people‚Äôs government. The success of UPA-2 is reinforced when we compare it to the sharp slide under Modi. BJP‚Äôs misdeeds have piled up. We need to jointly stand together under the leadership of Soniaji, Dr Singhji, Rahulji,‚Äù he said. While representing restiveness over leadership and strategy in Congress, the Twitter exchange between senior and junior leaders point to Rahul being urged to take back the reins of Congress and end the uncertainty and ad hocism created by his resignation after the 2019 Lok Sabha debacle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/digvijaya-takes-aim-at-rahul-adds-fuel-to-congs-old-vs-new-fire/articleshow/77323518.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Nagpur||BJP cries over power bills, gives no relief in water dues||NAGPUR: At a time when the BJP has been demanding scrapping of inflated power bills, complete waiver of bills up to 100 units for consumers hit by Covid-19 lockdown and instalment facility, the saffron party-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is disconnecting water supply to residential buildings for recovery of arrears from the citizens facing financial difficulties. The civic body, which has already effected 5% water tariff hike from April 1 for the 10th year in a row, has not given any waiver or instalment facility or offered extension to due date to pay the water bills. Instead, the NMC has disconnected water supply to 650 residential buildings in the last two months. Even the BJP seems to be a divided house over the issue. Two of the BJP corporators on Sunday staged a sit-in outside the residence of municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe protesting against the disconnection of illegal water connections. On Sunday, a few residents of MHADA Colony led by BJP leader Prashant Singh Thakur, his corporator wife Rupali and corporator Abhay Gotekar staged a dharna in front of civic chief‚Äôs residence. ‚ÄúWater supply to 96 houses in MHADA Colony, Vishwakarma Nagar was disconnected terming them illegal connections. Even amid the pandemic, the authorities did not consider regularization. Moreover, a few connections were snapped citing arrears even though the residents have been paying the dues to MHADA,‚Äù said Thakur. Former Congress corporator Arun Dawre said, ‚ÄúThis exposes BJP‚Äôs double standard. For the last two months, I have been urging authorities not to snap water supply amid the pandemic, but none listened. On one hand, governments and NMC are telling people to wash hands frequently to prevent contracting novel coronavirus, on the other water supply to residential buildings is being disconnected that too without any intimation.‚Äù ‚ÄúBJP should resume water supply to all, offer respite in the water bills by waiving off some units and also extend instalment facility,‚Äù he said. Standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke said, ‚ÄúThe civic administration is disconnecting water supply. We are against the disconnection during the Covid-19 period.‚Äù Zalke said the protest by party corporators was not expected. ‚ÄúI support disconnection of illegal connections. I had assured party corporators of resolving the issue, but still they went ahead with the agitation,‚Äù he said. An NMC official said, ‚ÄúIn all 156 houses are in MHADA Colony. Of them, 96 had illegal connections and hence the supply was snapped on July 31. Remaining households owe NMC arrears to the tune of Rs9.13 lakh from July 30, 2016. All these year, water supply was not disconnected.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-cries-over-power-bills-gives-no-relief-in-water-dues/articleshow/77322999.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
August 3, 2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Missing sailor‚Äôs kin write to DG shipping, demand probe||Thiruvananthapuram: The family of a sailor who went missing from a ship has approached the director general of shipping with a complaint seeking detailed investigation. Abey Chandran who was sailing as an ‚ÄòAB seaman‚Äô on-board MV GLOCEM, manned by SALS Shipping, Mumbai went missing on July 22 near Mauritius. The ship had started its journey from Visakhapatnam on March 12. Chandran‚Äôs family, based in Thiruvananthapuram, received an email from Anil Walke, general manager, SALS Shipping on July 23, informing them he was swept away when heavy swell struck the vessel.  M V GLOCEM and another vessel, M V ASALI started the search operation for locating Chandran. In the meantime they also informed D G Shipping India, Panama Flag Authorities, the insurance company of the vessel, coastal authorities of Port Louis and D G Shipping Mauritius and MRCC Mauritius. The mail said that M V GLOCEM and M V ASALI conducted search operations till 12 noon on July 23 adding that the weather in the area where the incident took place was very bad, with heavy winds and high swells reducing the visibility. In the letter to Amitabh Kumar, DG shipping, the family alleged that the captain of MV GLOCEM told Chandran‚Äôs relative that the mooring rope was swept away in the swell and Abey and another seaman were sent to retrieve the rope. ‚ÄúThe family are of the view that we lost Chandran due to the negligence on the part of the captain. When the sea condition was very bad, the captain should not have asked him to retrieve the rope which fell in the sea,‚Äù said the letter. They have requested for a detailed investigation into the incident. ‚ÄúChandran was not engaged in any personal work and was obeying the orders of the captain. How could they send a person outside in the rough weather? No person in authority is sharing any details with us. They earlier said that there were other sailors with Chandran when the incident happened, later they claimed that he was all alone. We have requested for an investigation on the accident,‚Äù said S Sabitha, Chandran‚Äôs sister. The family has also requested authorities to provide a copy of the captain‚Äôs statement of facts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/missing-sailors-kin-write-to-dg-shipping-demand-probe/articleshow/77316035.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Kochi||Isolated but inspired: Pillai turns to poetry||Kozhikode: Confined in the sprawling Raj Bhavan in Aizawl, Mizoram‚Äôs capital city, for the past five months, governor P S Sreedharan Pillai has taken to writing poetries to vent his pent-up feelings. ‚ÄúI have been locked down in this ‚Äòfive-star prison‚Äô, unable to move around due to Covid 19 and there are strict regulations in the Raj Bhavan for visitors,‚Äù said Pillai. And the result of the ‚Äòsolitary confinement‚Äô is a collection of poems in Malayalam ‚ÄòCovid Kavithakal‚Äô that ruminate on philosophical questions in pandemic times. ‚ÄúI read the news about an incident that happened in Italy where elderly persons were allowed to die when the pandemic peaked. The ventilators were removed to be used for younger patients,‚Äù Pillai said. ‚ÄúOne nurse found the practice cruel and against the oath taken while doing the nursing course. Unable to bear the tension, she committed suicide. This incident triggered the poem Vayojanam (Elderly). We live in a culture where the elderly are respected and cared,‚Äù he said. The poems centre around the theme of human helplessness in the face of impending death. The virus has taught humanity how dependent we are on each other and how silly our petty clashes are, he said. The poem Mahamari (Pandemic) asserts the power of human will to take on adversities. It reminds us that humanity has conquered outbreaks of diseases like plague and smallpox in the past. ‚ÄúThere is no need to despair because together, human beings will defeat the enemy and will reach the other end of the tunnel,‚Äù he said. The poem ‚ÄòWuhan‚Äô deplores how the ancient city that was the cradle of civilization has become the synonym of the disease. The release of the anthology along with two other books will be held at Raj Bhavan on August 8. Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga and other dignitaries will attend the function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/isolated-but-inspired-pillai-turns-to-poetry/articleshow/77320283.cms||---

The decision to this effect was taken following incidents of old wadas collapsing across the city in the last one year. Last year, over a dozen old wadas had collapsed during monsoon. The Nashik Municipal Corporatio (NMC) had warned the occupants to vacate wadas but their appeal fell on deaf ears. This year too, an old wada collapsed last month in which one youth was killed and two others were injured.The civic body has appointed three agencies in the city to conduct structural audits. The owners of the buildings will have to get the structural audit done from the agency appointed by the NMC.The structural engineers of the agencies certified by the municipal corporation will inspect the buildings and will give certificates about the status of the building on whether it is fit for occupation or not.Moreover, the agency will also suggest the works that need to be carried to repair the old structures. Once the necessary works are carried out, the agency will submit a certificate stating that the structure is in a good condition to the divisional office of the municipal corporation. The owners of the old buildings will have to pay the service charges of Rs 23 per sq metre or at least Rs 5,000 each.The structure of the old buildings which are unsafe or dangerous will have to be removed by the owners on their own. The NMC has already identified 1,032 old and unsafe buildings in the city and served notices to the owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/structural-audit-must-for-bldgs-older-than-30-years/articleshow/77320267.cms||Tushar Pawar
August 3, 2020||Ludhiana||Six months since completion, Hambran slaughter house yet to open||Ludhiana: Even after passing of six months since the completion of the modern abattoir on Hambran Road, the civic authorities has not been able to make it functional. Earlier, there were certain issues with the contractor, who had been hired for running this slaughter house, over annual payment to the civic body and now it was being said that the contractor was reluctant to take over, citing lesser demand of chicken and mutton in the city these days. However, the officials claimed that recently the finance and contracts committee (F&CC) had given the final nod for handing over the operations and maintenance of this slaughter house, but they had not received the file and so they were unable to sign an agreement with the contractor. The modernisation of the slaughter house was completed in January and it was supposed to get inaugurated, but it was cancelled as the operation and maintenance was not final till then. But when it got finalised the lockdown was imposed and all activities were stopped. Almost a month back the civic body officials got the consent from the Punjab Pollution Control Board to run this slaughter house. Mayor Balkar Sandhu had asked the officials to increase the annual revenue generation from this slaughter house to Rs 35 lakh from Rs 31 lakh. The mayor on being contacted claimed that they had asked the contractor to take over the slaughter house but he was asking for some time as due to Covid-19 there was lesser demand among the public for chicken or mutton. He said moreover, during rainy season people avoid consuming these things, so they were expecting that after a few days this slaughter house could get functional. Meanwhile, senior veterinary officer Y P Singh said, ‚ÄúWe are yet to sign an agreement and issue work order to the contractor. We are waiting for the file of this case that had gone to the F&CC for a final approval. As soon as the file will reach us we will go ahead with the project.‚Äù The project was announced in 2008 but it kept on delaying due to scarcity of funds. The total cost of this project is around Rs 19.50 crore. The main objective behind this modern slaughter house is to bring slaughtering under one roof in a systematic manner and avoid slaughtering in every nook and corner of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/six-months-since-completion-hambran-slaughter-house-yet-to-open/articleshow/77321429.cms||---

Usually, Vinayaka Chaturthi is a big time for them to earn some money but this time they are bracing to face huge losses due to the prevailing uncertainty. Vilacheri doll makers, who use clay mixed with elephant dung for making large Ganesh idols, have not made even a single doll so far. But, migrant doll makers at Surveyor Colony Road at Mattuthavani have made some idols, but are waiting for orders. However, doll markers continue to make small idols meant for household poojas, in limited quantity due to the uncertainty. Many doll makers from Vilacheri said that they are making small idols to kill boredom. They are only making a few as they do not have adequate place to store all the finished idols. P Vijayakumar, from Vilachery said, ‚ÄúLast year, I made 40 big Vinayaka idols ranging between five to 10 foot, which fetched me Rs 3 lakh. I have not made even a single piece so far. An inquiry came from Manamadurai in Sivaganga district for an order. I have asked them to get police permission first. They are yet to respond,‚Äù he said. Vijayakumar has not faced livelihood loss of this scale so far. ‚ÄúOnly those into making smaller ones are doing some work. There are 100 families in the village who are involved in the work, of which 90% are into making small idols. A couple of families have opened grocery stores at their house to eke out a living,‚Äù Vijayakumar said. P Santhi, who is into making dolls for Navratri Golu and Christmas, has not started her work in full swing due to the uncertainty. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the upcoming festivals will be celebrated with fanfare like that of the previous years. We do not want to invest money and face loss,‚Äù she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/idol-makers-concerned-over-dull-sales-ahead-of-ganesha-chaturthi/articleshow/77322521.cms||V Devanathan
August 3, 2020||Vijayawada||NGOs urge Andhra Pradesh government to screen homeless for Covid-19||AMARAVATI: There has been growing concern among social workers that the state government has not been keen to screen the destitute for Covid-19. The NGOs are struggling to feed orphans and the destitute as the government has not released funds under National Urban Livelihood Management (NULM) programme which is mandatory as per the Supreme Court directive. About 11,500 people are taking shelter in different districts in the state. Former Union secretary EAS Sarma requested chief secretary Nilam Sawhney to take urgent steps to screen the homeless. He cited the issue of about 57 inmates of a UP government shelter home, including two pregnant women, testing positive for Covid-19. ‚ÄúI find that the state government has not been undertaking Covid-19 testing for the inmates of the shelters, homes and hostels run by NGOs on behalf of the government, though the responsibility for the welfare of the inmates rests with it. In my view they are highly vulnerable to diseases such as Covid-19,‚Äù said Sarma. The non-release of funds for maintenance of shelters for homeless is scaring organisers. Sources said the government has not released funds since March to the NGOs despite the Centre releasing funds for the same. Many NGOs started shelters after signing an understanding with respective urban civic bodies following a SC verdict in 2011. The state governments through civic bodies should release funds to NGOs under National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM). The Supreme Court had directed municipal bodies to set up shelters for the homeless at least one for each one lakh population. The SC also said that each shelter should provide food and shelter to at least 100 people. ‚ÄúThe state government had identified about 12,000 homeless people and allowed nearly 76 shelters to operate. There is dire need to open more shelters but NGOs are not coming forward due to lack of encouragement from government and civic bodies,‚Äù said Pragada Vasu of Association for Urban and Tribal Development (AUTD) in Visakhapatnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ngos-urge-govt-to-screen-homeless-for-covid-19/articleshow/77320258.cms||Samdani MN
August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Being fearless helped many with comorbidities defeat Covid-19||Nagpur: Meera Rajurkar, 80, returned home on August 1 after 10-day stay at AIIMS, Nagpur, as a Covid-19 positive patient. Apart from advanced age, she had comorbidities and history of knee replacement and other surgeries. Still, she recovered within the standard protocol. Megha Dixit, 52, who has history of angioplasty and gall bladder removal surgery, also recovered within the specific 10-day period and went home last week. From a 94-year-old man from Amravati to 88-year-old retired army soldier from Akola, many patients with advanced age and severe co-morbidities have recovered successfully, irrespective of their health problems. Vidarbha has one of the best recovery rates in country and there are many examples of people recovering from Covid-19 despite having heart, kidney, diabetes, liver and other diseases. According to doctors, co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and CKDs are definitely risk factors when you get infected with Covid-19, but if these lifestyle diseases are kept in good control, patients can definitely recover from Covid-19. ‚ÄúYou can be a patient of diabetes or hypertension and still beat Covid-19 easily if you have good control on your disease,‚Äù said Dr Nirmal Jaiswal, who is leading a team of doctors treating Covid-19 patients at Wockhardt Hospital. Dr Jaiswal is also a member of the Covid-19 task force formed by state health department to deal with cases and deaths in Nagpur. ‚ÄúDiabetic condition can be aggravated due to medication, hospitalization and mainly due to stress and trauma regarding Covid-19. But, if the sugar level is restricted under 180 and blood pressure maintained, one can surely recover within the prescribed period,‚Äù he said. Seconding Dr Jaiswal‚Äôs views, patients who recovered said that positive attitude and avoiding fear was the key of their recovery. ‚ÄúI had a history of heart disease and surgery. I had mild symptoms when tested positive. I kept on telling myself that these symptoms are like a common cold and will be cured in three-four days. Finally, the same happened,‚Äù said Megha Dixit. She appealed to people with comorbidities to get tested early. Doctors also suggest early testing for people with lifestyle ailments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to get tested when you have early symptoms. Early detection will ensure that you are mild symptomatic or asymptomatic. As per new policy, asymptomatic patients are allowed to rest at home,‚Äù said Dr Vaibhav Agrawal. According to doctors, staying at home provides big psychological relief and recovery becomes easy for asymptomatic patients. In case they need medical assistance, it‚Äôs just a phone call away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/being-fearless-helped-many-with-comorbidities-defeat-covid-19/articleshow/77322524.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The lull in markets notwithstanding, licensed shops selling ‚Äòbhaang‚Äô are cashing in on the ‚ÄòShrawan‚Äô boom as devotees of Lord Shiva are lining up at these stores to buy (cannabis). In Hindu mythology, bhaang is offered to Lord Shiva as a prasad (offering). According to excise department officials, the city has witnessed a multi-fold increase in the sale of bhaang during Shrawan. The demands from licensed bhaang sellers for increased supply indicates to the surge in demand. ‚ÄúThere are 121 licensed cannabis sellers in the city and their monthly quota differs from shop to shop. Annually, we provide 25,000kg bhaang to these 121 sellers, which is around 2,000kg per month. The sellers can request for more, if the demand exceeds their monthly quota,‚Äù said district excise officer Sandeep Bihari Modwell. Sources said that sellers‚Äô sold their monthly quota of bhaang in a first fortnight during Shrawan. Even though ‚Äòkanwar yatras‚Äô have been cancelled this year due to the pandemic, devotees of Lord Shiva are filled with enthusiasm. They are offering ‚Äòbhaang‚Äô to the deity and are then consuming the ‚Äòbhog‚Äô of cannabis as ‚Äòprasad‚Äô. The excise department officials admit that demand for bhaang this month has increased by up to 20%. Sanjeev, a licensed bhaang seller in Muttiganj locality, said, ‚ÄúOn normal days, especially during the lockdown, the sale of cannabis was much lower. I was even struggling to sell our monthly quota. However, during Shrawan this year I sold my monthly quota in just two weeks and people are still demanding it.‚Äù Modwell said, ‚ÄúThe surge in demand has also generated more revenue. From the 121 licensed cannabis shops in the district, Rs 43 lakh revenue was generated this month.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/biz-boom-amid-covid-gloom-as-bhang-shops-see-queues/articleshow/77321433.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Trichy||Migratory birds start arriving early at Udayamarthandapuram||TRICHY: With the advent of south west monsoon, migratory birds have started arriving at different waterbodies in the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu including the Udayamarthandapuram bird sanctuary in Tiruvarur district. Usually birds start arriving in October every year, but they started arriving from mid-June this year. The sanctuary, which spreads across 44 hectares, has become habitable for bird as well as other living beings. According to forest officials, this is perhaps the first time in the last decade that birds have arrived much ahead of season. Usually, birds start arriving by October from Europe, Siberia, China and Russia and stay there till February. ‚ÄúNormally the south west monsoon will not be so active on the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu. But this year all the tanks are brimming with water because of good rain making the conditions favourable for birds much earlier,‚Äù said conservator of forests, Ramasubramanian (IFS), Thanjavur circle. Among the more than 9,000 birds that arrive at the sanctuary, white ibis have come in large numbers besides painted stork, spot billed duck and coot. While the sanctuary having paddy field adjoining it attracts a good number of wetland birds, it also receives a good number of terrestrial and arboreal birds. Tiruvarur district forest officer (DFO) K Arivoli said that habitat improvement activities such as removal of aquatic weeds and invasive shrubs species carried last year has ensured that the water spread area is not chocked. Growth of these weeds will affect breeding of fish and nesting by birds, he said.

August 3, 2020||Ludhiana||MC officials want 10% rebate on property tax dues extended till Sept||Ludhiana: Covid-19 has hit the recovery of property tax being collected by the civic body hard and if the 10% rebate scheme on previous years property tax dues had not been extended for June and July then it would have become difficult for it to achieve the same. The rebate period has come to end on July 31 and now officials are keeping their fingers crossed, whether it will get extended up to September, so that more recovery could reach the MC kitty. Another reason is that due to coronavirus the civic body officials are not going from door to door for recovery of property tax dues and in the absence of rebate people will not come to clear dues. April and May got wasted due to lockdown as only some of the dues amount was cleared during these two months. But when the MC suvidha centres were opened in June the recovery picked up while in July too there was good response from the residents. As per the officials, only in June and July they were able to recover Rs 17 crore in property tax dues, out of which Rs 9 crore is for the current year while Rs 8 crore is the arrear amount. Conforming the same the superintendent of MC, Vivek Verma, said both months remained good for the civic body as people came to clear their dues. He said on July 31 only they generated Rs 1 crore at the suvidha centres and through online payment. He admitted the fact that due to coronavirus people were avoiding coming out of their houses but since 10% rebate was there, so they came out somehow. Meanwhile, requesting anonymity, one of the civic body officials claimed that now 10% rebate option was available only for the current year tax payers that is up to September end. He said they were not sure whether they would be able to go in field for recovery this year as it was not safe enough to visit door to door. He claimed that the state government should extend the rebate period for previous years till September end so that more revenue could be generated as otherwise they would not be able to match the target of this financial year. Poor recovery will directly hit the services being provided by the civic body like water supply, sewerage lines, roads, streetlights, parks and garbage lifting. When there will be paucity of funds the civic body will not be able to do anything for the residents. In the past two years the civic body did not take up any major project for the city and the present works are going on were under smart city mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-officials-want-10-rebate-on-property-tax-dues-extended-till-sept/articleshow/77321460.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Madurai||How Tuticorin managed to keep death rate lowest in south Tamil Nadu||TUTICORIN: In the last two weeks, Tuticorin district has reported not less than 200 fresh Covid-19 cases a day, with the highest being 415 on July 23. However, despite having 7,628 positive cases and 54 deaths, the district‚Äôs death rate of 0.7% is the lowest among the southern districts. It is also the lowest among 15 districts with more than 50 deaths and second lowest among the 14 districts that have more than 5,000 cases. Early detection by reducing the waiting time to less than a day from two days was a key factor in lowering the death rate, says district collector Sandeep Nanduri. ‚Äú The focus on proactively finding (cases) among those with comorbidities and antenatal mothers and other vulnerable persons in the containment zones and surrounding areas and during the fever camps is among factors that helped reduce the deaths,‚Äù he told TOI He said that in a recent death audit they had stressed on early shifting of those with symptoms or comorbidities from the primary health centres and other government hospitals to the tertiary care facility (Thoothukudi government medical college and hospital) to bring down the death rate further. Medical college hospital dean C Revathy Balan said their team made judicious use of X-rays and CT scans to determine the infection for those with comorbidities. ‚ÄúResults of these persons are obtained on priority to change the treatment protocol without delay,‚Äù she said. Of the 700 beds for Covid patients in the hospital, 350 have oxygen support. The hospital got the fully automated Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyser (ECLEA), the first government facility outside Chennai to be equipped with it. The analyser helps to analyse five inflammatory markers in Covid-19 patients ‚Äì Interleukin 6, d - dimer, Ferritin, Procalcitonin and CRP. ‚ÄúThese parameters are used to predict the progression of Covid patients to severe forms and to make treatment decisions,‚Äù she said. The hospital received the equipment in the first week of June and has analysed 536 samples so far. ‚ÄúNow, at least 10 samples are tested in it every day,‚Äù the dean added. As many as 179 women who tested positive and admitted to the Covid ward gynaecology department have delivered babies. ‚ÄúThere has been no mortality among them and 155 of them were in July,‚Äù she said. Only 13 frontline workers from the hospital including 4 doctors and 9 others were infected by Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/how-tuticorin-managed-to-keep-death-rate-lowest-in-south-tn/articleshow/77322518.cms||M K Ananth
August 3, 2020||Lucknow||‚ÄòMr Fixit‚Äô who grew beyond UP politics||LUCKNOW: In July 2018, while inaugurating the first ground-breaking ceremony in Lucknow, Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised the audience by making special mention of Amar Singh. While starting his address, the PM paused and said "Amar Singh ji, namaskar‚Äù. Seated in the second row at the sprawling pandal, Singh smiled but observers of UP politics say that it was an indirect acknowledgment of the fact that the Rajya Sabha member was the pioneer of bringing investment from outside to the state. Singh passed away in Singapore after prolonged illness on Saturday. As the second most powerful person in SP government between 2003 and 2007, he headed the UP Development Council to bring corporate India closer to UP. As members of the council, the likes of Anil Ambani, Adi Godrej, Subrata Roy, and Amitabh Bachchan helped the state get India Inc to invest in UP. However, before it could bring a desirable result, the SP was voted out and the council was disbanded. Singh, however, was instrumental in setting a precedence. After joining SP in late 90s, it was Singh who helped this regional outfit acquire a national stature through his connections which transcended the moorings of political leanings. After Amar‚Äôs departure from the party which coincided with the growing influence of the present chief Akhilesh Yadav, it has also lost its impact in the national politics as his successor, Ram Gopal Yadav failed to perform that role. The role of 'Mr Fixit' that he played with aplomb, benefited many. He claimed that it was he who introduced Big B to Subrata Roy, who helped the superstar ward off the financial storm he was facing. Besides, Singh also introduced Bachchan as a farmer in Barabanki, and named his Gomatinagar residence in Lucknow as 'Aishwarya' and opened a school in her name in Barabanki. Singh was also responsible for adding glamour quotient to Saifai Mahotsava, a rural festival at the village of the SP's first family, by bringing Bollywood A-listers to the event. Although the party was criticised for this for losing its core value. He aggressively campaigned for the release of Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, who was languishing in jail after being slapped with POTA by the Mayawati government in 2002. He also helped his mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav to take a second shot at the CM's chair in 2003 by 'managing' adequate number of legislatures after Mayawati walked out of the coalition government she was running along with BJP. His falling out with the Yadavs started after Akhilesh's wife Dimple lost Lok Sabha bypoll against Raj Babbar in Firozabad in 2009. He was sacked from the party in 2010 but continued to be its Rajya Sabha member till 2014. Two years later, he mended the fence with Mulayam and got another term at the upper house by regaining entry into the party. However, the second innings didn't last long and the Yadav family's internal feud took a toll on him. Akhilesh lashed out at him publicly holding him responsible for the schism between him and his father, and ousted him from the party. But Singh continued to be an RS member till his death. In his condolence message, Akhilesh tweeted a picture of Amar Singh walking between him and his father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mr-fixit-who-grew-beyond-up-politics/articleshow/77323237.cms||Subhash Mishra
August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Conduct exams for failed students of class IX, XI: CBSE to schools||NAGPUR: CBSE has asked all affiliated schools to conduct exams for failed students of Std IX and XI, if not done already. These exams are internally conducted and assessed. Since these classes are outside the purview of RTE, students do not have the safety cover of a guaranteed promotion to the next class. In a notification dated July 23, CBSE‚Äôs controller of examination (CoE) Sanyam Bhardwaj said schools must proceed with the examinations for such students, if not done so already. Bhardwaj informed schools that online, offline and/or innovative tests may be taken to ensure compliance. CBSE has not set any time frame for these tests to be conducted. Bhardwaj has written to schools that these must be done ‚Äúas and when possible‚Äù. Reena Dargan, chairperson of Nagpur Sahodaya Schools‚Äô Complex, said this would be applicable to hardly a few schools. ‚ÄúI believe almost every school has already completed these internal exams. March is usually when most of us conduct these exams. There is no point in keeping Std IX and XI failures in suspended animation for so long. There might have been some who missed out due to the lockdown,‚Äù said Dargan. Last week, the Maharashtra state board, too, issued similar instructions to all affiliated schools to ensure that students who failed in Std IX and XI get pushed to the next grade. The only difference, however, is that state board has been specific about the type of exams. Ashok Gavhankar, a senior state board academician, said ‚ÄúThese exams have to be conducted through online oral tests.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/conduct-exams-for-failed-students-of-class-ix-xi-cbse-to-schools/articleshow/77323000.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
August 3, 2020||Ludhiana||BRS Nagar to have 2 new parks; LIT to develop these||Ludhiana: Residents of BRS Nagar will get two new parks in I and L blocks shortly as the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) is going to develop these. In L-block it will be the first public park for the residents as there is no other park in the locality. However, in I block it will be a leisure valley spread on 2 acres. The officials claimed that already trees have been planted in these parks, so it will be an additional thing as they need not to wait for plants to grow and people will immediately get shades of trees. Meanwhile, on Sunday, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu too visited the sites where the park and leisure valley are to be developed. The LIT chairman, Raman Balasubramanium, and other officials also accompanied the minister. They discussed the plan on the basis of which these would be developed. This will be the fifth leisure valley coming up in Ludhiana (west) constituency represented by Punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Ashu said that tenders for both these projects would be floated shortly as all approvals had been granted by the local bodies department He said that the leisure valley in block I of Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar would have a dedicated footpath for morning/evening walkers, badminton and basketball courts, an open gym, swings for children, canopies, besides several such amenities. The other four leisure valleys are coming up near DAV Public School (along Sidhwan Canal) in Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, in Haibowal, near Lodhi Club and behind Blocks D and E in Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar. He said that these projects would prove as lifelines for the city and its residents. He said that near DAV Public School the leisure valley was around 1.5km in length (starting from opposite DAV Public School till railway crossing near Pakhowal road). He said that near DAV Public School, the vacant chunk of land was literally being used as a garbage dump. He added that this space had been fully transformed into one of the best leisure valley‚Äôs of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/brs-nagar-to-have-2-new-parks-lit-to-develop-these/articleshow/77321462.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Dehradun||Pending electric bills stalling power projects, says UPCL||Dehradun: The power-related development projects in Uttarakhand have run into a wall as the Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) is claiming to be struggling with finances due to long-pending electricity bill payments of government agencies and commercial establishments. As per the data available on the website of the corporation, the total arrears amounted to nearly Rs 1,500 crore till April 2020. BCK Mishra, managing director of UPCL, told TOI, ‚ÄúThe overdue electricity bills are a big concern for us. It is impacting our collection efficiency and revenues directly. Since UPCL has long-term power supply agreements with commercial units, the overdue power bills delay the repayment process to our creditors who supply us power for further distribution. Even though we also carry out drives for expediting the collection of bills and disconnect power connections whenever necessary, the mounting arrears are a big cause of concern.‚Äù As per the data, the top defaulters include various units of Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan with overdues of more than Rs 100 crore, Northern Division Ganges Canal of Haridwar with over Rs 58 crore dues, and many other government departments and commercial establishments. In order to address the problem, UPCL officials said that a new revised list of bill repayment defaulters is also being prepared which will include many more establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pending-electric-bills-stalling-power-projects-says-upcl/articleshow/77320302.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Madurai||Students excited, but worries galore as online classes begin||MADURAI/TRICHY: As colleges start online classes for second year and third year UG and second year PG students from Monday, students are excited at having a semblance of normalcy. However, many teachers and colleges are apprehensive about internet connectivity as well as lack of guidelines on going about the job. ‚ÄúNow that we have no exams too, I‚Äôm glad we are able to quickly carry on with classes for the next semester. I‚Äôm worried how well I‚Äôll be able to understand with online classes but I still am excited,‚Äù said D Anierudh, a second year BSc Physics student. Though timings vary for different colleges, online classes are set to happen every working day for three to five hours. ‚ÄúWe have already intimated our students about the classes, given them email IDs and held demo classes. We are taking this as a challenge. Currently, of course, we are having only theory classes which will be live,‚Äù said Dr Davamani M Christober, principal, The American College. Bharathidasan University vice-chancellor P Manisankar briefed college principals and head of university departments on taking least 450 hours of online class for a semester within 90 working days. The colleges were asked to keep their content ready for classes from Monday. Asked if up to seven hours of classes would not be hectic for students, BDU registrar G Gopinath told TOI that it need not be a lecture, but a demonstration, a tutorial or a case study. However, several colleges in Trichy said no proper guidelines are in place for the online classes. Besides, most colleges were busy with admission work when they were asked to start online classes in less than a weeks‚Äô time. Vimal Jerald, faculty member of computer science department, St Joseph‚Äôs College, said online education is essential to engage the college students during the pandemic. But it is vital to frame guidelines and provide basic ICT infrastructure facilities both for the institutions and students. Jamal Mohamed College (JMC) Trichy was holding trial with students on online classes for a week. Principal Ismail Mohideen said students exhausted their data within two hours of classes. It could be an issue in the long run if online classes become compulsory. Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science, Madurai said they have been holding online classes throughout July for two hours per working day. ‚ÄúThough there was some resistance initially, we had 90% attendance in July. But, some students do have internet connectivity issues. Hence, we are also recording the live lectures and posting in our learning portal. Now, there will be classes for at least four hours,‚Äù he said. Assignment and tests will also be carried out online in real time and otherwise. A survey by Lady Doak College Madurai revealed that about 90% of its students had access to their own or shared gadgets though not all of them had good connectivity. ‚ÄúFor those without access to gadgets and internet, we are also trying to get second hand devices with the help of an NGO,‚Äù said Dr Christianna Singh, principal of the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/students-excited-but-worries-galore-as-online-classes-begin/articleshow/77322531.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
August 3, 2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Only 50,000 benefited from Atmanirbhar scheme in July||BENGALURU: Barely a month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, aimed to ensure migrant workers do not go hungry, the demand for rations under the scheme has fallen in Karnataka. Under the scheme, every migrant with an Aadhar card could receive a one-time dole of rations for two months. The scheme initially received strong response from migrant workers, many of whom were stranded in Karnataka with neither jobs nor savings. As per government records, more than 10 lakh migrants were provided free rice and channa (whole gram) for June. However, by the end of July, the numbers had plummeted to about 50,000 beneficiaries, a small fraction of the 80 lakh migrant workers estimated to have been in the state prior to the lockdown. While on the one hand those figures suggest a huge chunk of the labour force moved out of Karnataka, on the other hand the state claims there is still a considerable number of migrants who reside in Bengaluru and other parts of the state, but are ineligible for rations under the scheme since, under the Centre‚Äôs directive, a migrant worker, who does not have a ration card, is applicable to receive rations only once under the scheme. State records show each of the 10 lakh migrants in June, and another 3.2 lakh people in May, received 10kg of rice and 2kg of channa. These people cannot seek rations again. ‚ÄúIn my constituency of Mahalakshmi Layout alone, there are 41,000 beneficiaries. However, there are many people who would need another round of assistance to survive till economic activity pick up,‚Äù said K Gopalaiah, food and civil supplies minister. The minister did admit lakhs of migrants had left Karnataka due to lockdowns and loss of work, but many more remain in the hope of securing employment. Officials believe that if the ANBP scheme is extended again to first-time beneficiaries, 6 to 7 lakh migrants will benefit. In fact, the state has written to the Centre to allow Karnataka to open another round of distribution under ANBP. Besides Karnataka, Rajasthan is said to be the only other state with a widespread distribution of ANBP rations. ‚ÄúEven last month we had a video conference where the Centre categorically said the scheme has been extended in terms of time, but not for the same people. We are hoping, with lockdowns ending, the numbers will increase,‚Äù said Shamala Iqbal, commissioner food and civil supplies department. The government has also asked the Centre to extend the scheme till November for all migrants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/only-50k-migrants-benefitted-from-atmanirbhar-rations-scheme-in-july/articleshow/77320926.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

August 3, 2020||Hyderabad||Telangana: Transporters plan protest over tax, insurance waiver||HYDERABAD: With very few people opting to commute via cabs, autos and private buses even during unlock 3.0, the transport operators who have suffered immense financial losses due to the pandemic are planning to stage a protest after not receiving any help from authorities. The operators say that despite submitting multiple representations to the transport department authorities requesting a tax and insurance waiver, there has been no communication from them till now. ‚ÄúThe prevailing situation and the constantly increasing diesel prices have crippled our incomes. Most drivers haven‚Äôt been earning anything from past four months. We have been repeatedly asking the authorities to consider our plea but there is no response from their side. Every time we try to talk to them, the police intervenes and stops us from entering their office premises,‚Äù said Shaik Salauddin, the chairman of Telangana State Taxi and Driver joint action committee. ‚ÄúThe state government keeps extending the deadline for fines, taxes, insurance and other things but they are not accepting the request for a waiver. We have decided to stage a protest because the police are not allowing us to hold talks with the transport commissioner,‚Äù he said. The JAC also reiterated the high court order asking all the transport operators to form a union and submit a representation to the department. ‚ÄúWe have been trying to give representations and hold talks with the transport department authorities by following instructions of the high court. Despite that, neither the authorities nor the government is ready to listen to our problems,‚Äù said Manchireddy Rajender Reddy, the Working President of Telangana Lorry Owners‚Äô Association.

August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Quick response saves one, delayed test claims another||Nagpur: A week after a patient in Kamptee town died before an ambulance could take him to the hospital, quick action by the same doctor from whom the deceased was also undergoing treatment saved a life. Another person who consulted the private practitioner, however, could not survive. Kin of the patient who died were reluctant to get a Covid test done. Both the incidents happened within the gap of one day. The person who has survived reached the hospital on Thursday and the other incident took place on Friday. The death of an over 50-year-old tailoring contractor at Gora Bazaar locality of Kamptee had led left the locals agitating. The two incidents happened after that. Last week, a female patient was brought to Sneha Clinic of Dr Rajendra Dipani in Kamptee. The oxygen level had dipped to critical level. Instead of waiting to get the tests done in Kamptee first, the doctor and the Kamptee Tehsildar Arvind Hinge took a call and sent her straight to the Indira Gandhi Government Medial College (IGGMC). ‚ÄúShe tested positive at IGGMC but has survived. The patient was administered oxygen at the government hospital in Kamptee and timely cooperation by the Tehsildar helped,‚Äù said Dipani. The patient‚Äôs daughter gave her version of events to TOI. ‚ÄúMy mother was first taken to another private hospital where they advised a typhoid test. Later, at Sneh Clinic we were asked to get a Covid test done soon. By the time we reached the government hospital in Kamptee, the timings for the day were over and my mother started getting breathless. She was administered oxygen but there was no arrangement in the ambulance,‚Äù she said. The daughter, however, complained of lack of facilities at IGGMC and also said that no testing facility was open at that time in Kamptee. It was around 1:30pm when they reached. Another female patient was, however, not so lucky. This patient was given a written note in the prescription. However, the relatives resisted and did not get the tests done. Soon, the condition deteriorated. ‚ÄúWe had planned to send her straight to Nagpur. However, for some reason the ambulance could not be arranged at that time. The patient was taken to Nagpur in an autorickshaw. She reached there but could not be saved,‚Äù said Dipani. ‚ÄúPatients should realize that early testing helps. These days every person with even slight symptoms is referred for a test. There are chances that the mild symptoms can soon turn into a severe condition,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/quick-response-saves-one-delayed-test-claims-another/articleshow/77322535.cms||Shishir Arya

Authorities said this was in keeping with the latest ICMR guidelines, according to which even if the cause of death is due to other illnesses, it is considered a Covid-19 death if the patient had tested positive. The deaths, which occurred between June 21 and July 13, were reconciled similar to the 444 deaths added to Chennai‚Äôs death toll. Among the 13, the test results of seven had returned positive after their death. The reconciled deaths have raised the total deaths in Madurai to 253 and death rate from 2.1% to 2.2% as on Sunday. Director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam told TOI that reconciliation of Covid-19 deaths was being done on a weekly basis by the death audit committee under the director of medical services. ‚ÄúAcross all districts, from all government and private institutions, all Covid-19 deaths are being reconciled as per latest ICMR guidelines. Deaths are being updated daily as per these guidelines. Any deaths that were missed out previously also continue to be updated in the state medical bulletin,‚Äù he said. Head of Treatment Protocol Committee at GRH, Dr K Senthil, asserted that there were no delays in submitting reports from the hospital side and that all Covid-19 deaths were being given immediate certification. ‚ÄúThere are cases wherein the Covid-19 test results of the deceased are awaited which we specify as ‚Äòawaited‚Äô. In such cases, there may be a delay in communication and reconciliation with reports,‚Äù he said.

August 3, 2020||Vijayawada||Vijayawada youths return home, take up farming||VIJAYAWADA: The Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown to curb its spread has seen many youth take to farming as an alternative livelihood option. Many daily wage earners who moved to Vijayawada have turned to agriculture as a means to support their families. Interestingly, their families have been in farming for years. Around one lakh daily wage earners at wholesale markets in One Town, Gollapudi and Bhavanipuram ‚Äî the largest marketplaces in the state ‚Äî are from the villages surrounding the city. Workers from Gudivada, Nuzividu and Jaggiahpet commute to the city every day to work in the marketplaces. With the pandemic, however, matters changed overnight. Most wholesale and retail outlets in the city emptied out and ‚ÄòStaff wanted‚Äô boards came up. Workers from the nearby rural areas returned home, preferring to take up cultivation rather than staying on in Vijayawada. Absence of public transport and half wages paid by managements also drove many daily wagers to pick up farming. ‚ÄúI have worked in a garment store in Vasthralatha market for more than ten years. I used to travel to Vijayawada from Thotlavalluru every day for earning Rs 12,000 per month. The lockdown bared the real face of life as my shop remained closed and there was no option left for me except to start cultivation on a small piece of land. I have started cultivating vegetables as there is huge demand in Vijayawada. Cultivation helped me to lead my life comfortably despite the Covid-19 crisis,‚Äù said N Venkata Prasad, a farmer from Thotlavalluru. The shift in employment has made an older generation of farmers happy who hope that agriculture may now prove to be more profitable. ‚ÄúI have been a farmer for the last 40 years and cultivate seven acres of land in Agiripalli. Both my sons are graduates and they preferred working in Vijayawada for a lower salary. I requested them to take up farming but they made fun of me.

August 3, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Schools welcome NEP pre-primary rules, say formalization necessary||KOLKATA: The news that three years of pre-school will now be a part of formal schooling, according to the new National Education Policy guidelines has left both educators and parents happy. After years of uncertainty about how kids going to pre-schools should be hand-held into the portals of education, finally clear guidelines are expected, they said. La Martiniere schools, St James, Modern High, South Point are some city schools that run pre-primary sections and have hailed the change because it is expected to ring in uniformity based on scientific methods. ‚ÄúChildren are going to schools very early and the government now recognizes that pre-schools have to be formalized. A realistic practical curriculum is expected, focusing on skill development, to make the transition into the primary department smoother and better structured,‚Äù said Aban Confectioner, head of the primary and junior department, Modern High School for Girls. A curriculum was loosely followed in the pre-school sections of formal schools that would dovetail into the primary system. ‚ÄúHowever, now it would be formalized and we will have a national guideline to fall back upon,‚Äù said Krishna Damani, spokesperson of South Point School. Most pre-schools now follow informal rules that have been laid down by two bodies ‚Äî Early Childhood Association and India Montessori Foundation. The ECA had been pushing the Centre for this formalization and has expressed its joy. ‚ÄúIt was a matter of concern that pre-schools are largely not governed by any authority, not any more,‚Äù said Suman Sood, national core committee member of the association. Keeping with the present trend, most pre-schools have started online classes for kids between two and five-plus. Most have perfected modules keeping in mind that at this age it is difficult to hold their attention for long. At Modern High School, it took three months before the pre-schoolers were hand-held to the screen by parents. Kids are given worksheets, along with a practice schedule of the written work like joining the dots, colouring, pattern writing etc. During online class, kids listen to stories, introduction of the letters through sound/phonics, colour identification, singing, rhyming and craft. Pre-school kids are playing with dough/clay, pre-writing on slates, having a messy time with their salt trays and squishy bags in the online classes of Kangaroo Kids, Kankurgachhi, as they would in the real classroom, said Khushbu Agarwal, owner. Parents at all branches of Little Laureates were trained for three months on online teaching techniques and classes have now started. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new platform and has to be carefully introduced and cannot happen without parents partnering us.‚Äù explained CEO Tamal Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-welcome-nep-pre-primary-rules-say-formalization-necessary/articleshow/77322537.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

August 3, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Burrabazar remembers boy next door Amar bhaiya||KOLKATA: His family owned a thriving lock business in Burrabazar, yet he decided to carve a niche in unlocking the world of politics. He often got scolded by his parents for watching too many movies, but little did they know that their son would go on to count some of the biggest film stars as his friends including Jaya Prada, Sanjay Dutt and Amitabh Bachchan, who often addressed him as ‚Äúchhote bhai‚Äù. The news of Amar Singh‚Äôs demise in Singapore on Saturday turned the mood in 202 Chittaranjan Avenue, a Burrabazar borough, sombre. It was here that he had spent his childhood and a few years of his adult life before his meteoric rise to national politics where he earned monikers like ‚Äútrouble shooter‚Äù. Singh had spent his childhood in a 500sqft apartment on the third floor of 202 CR Avenue in Jorasanko where he lived with his father Harishchandra, mother Shail Kumari and brother Arvind. He studied in Khatri Vidyalaya in Mechhua and cut his teeth in politics as a student leader. ‚ÄúWe are saddened by Amar bhaiya‚Äôs death. He had spent his formative years in Kolkata and the foundation of his successful political carrier was laid in Burrabazar,‚Äù said Vijay Upadhyay, a school friend of Amar Singh who is now a TMC leader. Family and friends said he owed his meteoric rise from Kolkata‚Äôs ward politics to the highest echelon of power in the country to a former Congress leader, who is now a senior minister in TMC government. ‚ÄúIn the 1970s and 1980s Congress was at its peak in central politics but leaders from West Bengal did not know very good Hindi. A senior Congress leader who is now a minister in the TMC government inducted Amar bhaiya into his inner circle because he knew both Hindi and Bengali and helped the leader interact with seniors. Amar bhaiya used this opportunity to build bridges with several senior Congress leaders and industrialists, a relationship that lasted till he breathed his last,‚Äù said Upadhayay. Cousin Vinod Singh, who still owns Vinod Stores on the ground floor of 202 CR Avenue, said Amar would win any debate he participated in. Family members also recalled his fondness for Kolkata puri sabzi and phuchkas. ‚ÄúHe would relish them whenever he visited Kolkata even till a few years ago. He was also a big movie buff,‚Äù said a cousin. The buzz in Burrabazar is that he was often scolded by his father for ignoring the family business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/burrabazar-remembers-boy-next-door-amar-bhaiya/articleshow/77322546.cms||Zeeshan Javed

August 3, 2020||Lucknow||UP cabinet min Kamal Rani loses Covid battle||Lucknow: UP's technical education minister and two-time MP Kamal Rani Varun died on Sunday morning after battling with Covid-19 for 15 days at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS). Kamal Rani is the first minister and third politician in Uttar Pradesh to have died of novel coronavirus. Meanwhile, UP BJP chief Swatanta Dev Singh also tested positive for the virus. He gave this information in a tweet in which he said that he had quarantined himself at his Lucknow home. ‚ÄúThe minister died of multiorgan dysfunction at 9.30am. She had been on severe oxygen requirement since the time of admission two weeks ago and was also administered convalescent plasma therapy,‚Äù an SGPGIMS statement said. The 62-year-old minister, an MLA from Kanpur‚Äôs Ghatampur assembly constituency, had tested positive on July 18. A Dalit leader and postgraduate in social work, she had been a member of Parliament in the 11th and 12th Lok Sabha in 1996 and 1998. Earlier, former deputy mayor of Lucknow Abhay Seth and former minister Ghura Ram died of Covid-19. Overall, six ministers have tested positive so far. "The minister was admitted to SGPGI with fever, cough and breathlessness after testing positive for Covid-19. She also had comorbidities - diabetes, hypertension and hypothyroidism. She had bilateral pneumonia with high oxygen need at the time of admission and was shifted to ICU on that day itself," said SGPGI director Dr RK Dhiman. Tributes poured in from various quarters after the minister's demise. President Ram Nath Kovind said Kamal Rani was respected for serving people at the grassroots. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Kamal Rani played a key role in strengthening BJP in UP. "Saddened by the death of UP minister Kamala Rani Varunji. Her life was devoted to social service and she played a vital role in strengthening BJP in the state. My condolences are with her family and supporters in this hour of grief. Om Shanti!" PM Modi tweeted in Hindi. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his cabinet ministers called it an "irreparable loss" for the public and government. The CM also called her a dedicated people's leader. Governor Anandiben Patel and former CM Mayawati also offered condolences to the family. BSP chief Mayawati said with her death, the state and central governments should take UP's rising number of Covid-19 cases seriously. SGPGI's statement on the politician's health said that she had all features of the disease's severity. "She had bilateral pneumonia at admission and was shifted to ICU on the day of admission itself because of high oxygen requirements. Later, she required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with high oxygen requirements. She was given injection Remdesevir (anti-viral) followed by immunosuppressive drug Tocilizumab due to which she had some improvement in her clinical status for a few days, However, her condition started deteriorating with increasing NIV and oxygen requirements. She was immediately transfused with convalescent plasma and steroid doses were hiked," it said. The institute also took expert advice from renowned pulmonologists -- AIIMS Delhi director Prof Randeep Guleria and PGIMER Chandigarh's Prof Ritesh Agarwal. "However, she had progressive severe disease and was unresponsive to maximal medical therapy. She was put on mechanical ventilator on August 1, but her condition continued to deteriorate with hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction. She succumbed to illness on Sunday," the institute said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-cabinet-min-kamal-rani-loses-covid-battle/articleshow/77323240.cms||Yusra Husain
August 3, 2020||Nagpur||CISF‚Äôs airport team avoid corona with unique measures||Nagpur: The 350-odd personnel of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) deployed at Nagpur airport have managed to remain unscathed amid the Covid outbreak even as some personnel of other agencies working here, like the police department, could not keep themselves from getting infected. It‚Äôs learnt, successful adoption and execution of measures like ‚Äòone-minute-drill‚Äô and ‚Äòtouch-free‚Äô techniques helped CISF to remain Covid-free though some of those who arrived by flights in city later tested positive. An officer of the city police, along with another colleague, who were entrusted with duty of checking flight passenger, too had tested positive. According to a source in CISF, the agency ensured its personnel perfected the ‚Äòone-minute-drill‚Äô in which they would wear PPE kits and follow other precautionary measures within the shortest possible time whenever any suspected or high risk person, with or without symptoms, was required to be monitored and personally attended. ‚ÄúWe modified structures of gadgets like hand-held metal detectors which can help us in frisking passengers from a distance. The entire checking process has been made touch-free without compromising with the security,‚Äù said the source. As per a reliable source, CISF personnel have been maintaining distance during checking and frisking, without allowing any lapses, under the supervision of the chief airport security officer. The CISF personnel, equipped with face-shields and hand gloves, got luggage sanitized through ultra-violet ray machines before handling them over to passengers with special techniques, thus considerably reducing the risk of contracting the infection. In addition, CISF has introduced compulsory yoga sessions for its staff in the morning and also provided immunity booster medicines. It‚Äôs also learnt that senior CISF officials have been personally guiding the personnel on how to avoid the infection and remain mentally strong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cisfs-airport-team-avoid-corona-with-unique-measures/articleshow/77322542.cms||Soumitra Bose

Sources in the real estate sector said that government employees and non-resident Indians (NRIs) have started to enquire about plots soon after the three capital bills received the governor‚Äôs assent. Fortune Properties managing partner Fahim Mudassar said, ‚ÄúWe are now getting calls from the government and NRIs about the plots and flats. Those working in corporate jobs and private sectors have not connected with us yet.‚Äù An executive member at the Confederation of Real Estate Developer‚Äôs Associations of India (CREDAI), Visakhapatnam, said people working in the private sector are not looking to invest in the real estate sector at present due to the Covid-19 outbreak. ‚ÄúUncertainty among many private employees over layoffs and cost cutting measures by the respective companies are some of the reasons behind the poor response from those working in the private sector,‚Äù the CREDAI member told TOI. Another real estate marketer K Srinivasa Rao said earlier people would avail loans to invest in the real estate sector but in view of the pandemic, buyers are hesitant to come forward. Up until February 2019, the real estate sector witnessed a boom, with prices rising between 15 to 30 per cent. With the imposition of the nationwide lockdown from late-March, the fortunes of the sector plummeted and it is only now that signs of recovery are appearing in the city, after the governor approved the bill to establish three capitals for the state. ‚ÄúDemonetisation, sand crisis and now Covid-19. These factors made the real estate market suffer in the last few years. Now, our last hope is the executive capital, which has received the governor‚Äôs assent. We hope that this development will help the sector recover,‚Äù said Bonthu Narayana, a realtor. Meanwhile, realtors expect a boom in demand for flats on the outskirts of the city and plots between Vizag city and Vizianagaram town. In Vizag city, the average price per square foot ranges between Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 in Madhurawada and Rushikonda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/capital-status-brightens-realtors-fortunes-in-vizag/articleshow/77320335.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

August 3, 2020||Business||Pharma co‚Äôs expenses towards freebies for docs can be claimed as deductions: ITAT||MUMBAI: Tax issues surrounding the ‚Äònexus‚Äô, between pharma companies and doctors, where the latter are sponsored for conferences, at times replete with sightseeing and gala dinners, or expensive gifts, refuse to die down. Judicial precedents, in several cases, have been in favour of pharma companies with the costs relating to such freebies being allowed as business deductions. The Mumbai bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) recently passed an order in favour of Medley Pharmaceuticals, an Andheri based company. The crux of the tax issue dealt with re-opening of the assessment for the FY 2011-12, owing to a change of opinion by the succeeding I-T officer. Based on technicalities such as no fresh ground material available on record, the re-opening was quashed by the ITAT. However, the ITAT also went on to analyse the allowability of sales promotion expenses aggregating to Rs 6.2 crore for the pharma company. A break-up showed that Rs 2.4 crore was towards product reminders; conference expenses and travel costs ran into Rs 2.7 crore and additional doctors‚Äô expenses were of Rs 1.1 crore. The ITAT made some pertinent observations regarding the code of conduct issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI) and a circular issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). It said that the MCI code of conduct, which debars freebies, is meant to be followed by the medical fraternity alone and does not apply to pharma companies. Amended on December 10, 2009, the code prohibits medical practitioners and their professional associations from taking any gift, travel facility, hospitality, cash or monetary grant from the pharmaceutical and allied health sector industries. The CBDT circular dated August 1, 2012 says that any expense in providing freebies in violation of the Medical Council‚Äôs code shall not be allowed as a business deduction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pharma-cos-expenses-towards-freebies-for-docs-can-be-claimed-as-deductions-itat/articleshow/77323527.cms||---

Each squad has been given a seven-point agenda which it has to refer to while checking for the compliance of the industries to the safety protocols mentioned in the Covid-19 health advisory. The important issues that squads would be looking for are whether social distancing is being observed between two employees, what preventive measures are being taken during change of shifts, sanitization facilities provided for the employees, frequency of sanitizing the entire facility, if the vehicles entering the company premises are sanitized, thermal scanning and oxygen level scanning of employees, measures for frequent hand wash, are the visitors to the company coming from the containment zones,etc. The industrial associations have welcomed the move by the administration and have pledged their cooperation. The industrial associations have already forwarded a letter to its members drawing their attention towards the issues that will be checked by the squads during their visits.‚ÄúWe understand that the negligence of a company could lead to problems for neighbouring industries. We have asked all the companies to stick to the preventive measures and comply to the norms to prevent the spread of Covid-19,‚Äùsaid Shashikant Jadhav, president of Nashik Industries and Manufacturers Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/squads-to-check-industry-compliance-of-safety-norms/articleshow/77320342.cms||Abhilash Botekar

A majority of critically ill and comorbid Covid-19 patients from the four north-coastal Andhra districts are housed at VIMS. Around 70% of Covid-19 deaths in the district have taken place here and relatives of the deceaseds travel down from other districts to claim the bodies. Authorities at VIMS, however, said the mortuary will start functioning from August 4. Sources said, ‚ÄúEven though four to five deaths are almost daily reported at VIMS as critical Covid-19 patients from Vizag, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and East Godavari are being treated here, preserving or keeping dead bodies till the relatives arrive from various districts and remote areas has become a big problem. There are no freezers and manpower to transfer the body to the mortuary building.‚Äù Special officer for Covid-19 (north-coastal AP) Dr P V Sudhakar said, ‚ÄúWe need at least six freezers each for KGH and VIMS. There are also two tables at VIMS mortuary for postmortem but autopsies are not taking place and mortuary staff is not available. We have asked the VIMS director to purchase new freezers and make the mortuary operational for storing bodies.‚Äù When contacted, VIMS director Dr K Satyavaraprasad said, ‚ÄúSo far, a mortuary was not needed for VIMS.

August 3, 2020||Hyderabad||Clothing store fined Rs 50,000 for selling torn sherwani to man||HYDERABAD: A district consumer court has directed a designer clothing store in the city to refund Rs 83,000 and pay Rs 50,000 as compensation to a consumer for selling him a damaged sherwani. Kishore Rai, the complainant, said in his plea that he had purchased a sherwani and accessories worth Rs 83,000 on November 19, 2019, from Origins, Banjara Hills, for his son-in-law to be worn on the wedding day (December 1, 2019). While getting ready, the bridegroom found that the sherwani was torn near the shoulder. Immediately, the bridegroom‚Äôs brother and relatives rushed to another shop and bought a new sherwani for Rs 51,020. Alleging that the family was subjected to extreme embarrassment, humiliation and anxiety because of the negligence and carelessness of the clothing store, the complainant issued a legal notice but received no response. He,therefore, filed a complaint seeking appropriate relief. The respondent, meanwhile, has not contested the allegations despite being served a notice. The bench said that the last-minute purchase of yet another sherwani by the bridegroom could have not only caused additional expenditure but also a disastrous experience on the wedding day which is priceless for the married couple and their families. ‚ÄúBe it the substandard quality of the stitched goods, or tearing of sherwani due to poor tailoring, it goes to show the negligent and careless attitude of the opposite parties causing such disastrous experience to a bride, groom, and the marriage parties on the wedding day,‚Äù said the bench. It added that the opposite party is not only liable to refund the amount of the wedding sherwani but also liable to compensate for the loss of reputation, humiliation, and embarrassment suffered by the complainant and his family on the auspicious occasion of his daughter‚Äôs wedding. Apart from refund and compensation, Rs 5,000 was awarded towards litigation expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/clothing-store-fined-rs-50k-for-selling-torn-sherwani-to-man/articleshow/77322559.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Unlike last three years, when students took active part in making rakhis, this year about 90 teachers volunteered to make rachis as students could not be involved because of Covid-19 lockdown. This year was special as they have made ‚ÄòThirukkural Rakhis‚Äô with selected Thirukkural couplets printed on the rakhis along with soldiers‚Äô pictures, said senior principal C Ramasubramanian. This was inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Thirukkural reference in his recent speech to the soldiers in Ladakh, he said. Rakhis were sent to the former member of Rajya Sabha Tarun Vijay, who handed them over to the defence minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi on Saturday, which will be dispatched to soldiers on the borders. Even though Raksha Bandhan is not celebrated in Tamil Nadu, Vijay appreciated the gesture by the institutions. ‚ÄúIt is believed that Rakhi tied by a sister will protect brother from all harms. Believing that faith, we take this as an opportunity to express our love and support to the selfless soldiers of our country,‚Äù said S Sudhadevi, a teacher volunteer.

According to authorities of the sub jails, initially, one inmate from each of the prisons underwent Covid-19 tests as they were to be transferred to other sub-jails. It is then that the inmates tested positive for the contagion. ‚ÄúOnce they tested postive, authorities of all the five sub-jails conducted rapid antigen tests for all the inmates. A total of 79 jail inmates have tested positive,‚Äù said officials. On the instructions of Ahmendnagar district collector Rahul Dwivedi, the administration quickly set up a temporary jail-cum- Covid care centre at Shetkari Bhavan in Rahuri where the inmates who have tested positive are undergoing treatment. This Covid care centre has 307 beds. ‚ÄúAll of them are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. They are being looked after by the district health team and their condition is stable,‚Äù said officials. According to authorities of the five sub-jails, after the inmates tested positive, adequate measures have been put in place to ensure that other inmates do not get infected.‚ÄúIt is difficult to observe social distancing in the sub-jails due to lack of space.

August 3, 2020||India||Congress kept Farooq‚Äôs dad in jail for 11 years: BJP||NEW DELHI: Reacting to Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs demand for release of former Jammu & Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufi, BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav on Sunday reminded the Congress leader of how Sheikh Abdullah was kept in jail for 11 years by the Congress government. ‚ÄúSheikh Abdullah was kept in jail for 11 years. Just some history trivia I want Rahul Gandhi to apprise himself of,‚Äù Yadav tweeted. People‚Äôs Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mufti has been in detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA) since J&K‚Äôs special status under Article 370 was revoked in August last year and the state was bifurcated into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh. Two former chief minsters, Omar and Farooq Abdullah were released recently. In 1953, Sheikh Abdullah, who was considered to be a good friend of the then PM Jawaharlal Nehru, was jailed in connection with the infamous 'Kashmir conspiracy case'. It was alleged that the top Kashmiri leadership under the guidance of Abdullah was trying to promote secession. Abdullah was released in 1964 in what was seen to be a peace deal between the two parties for an agreement on Kashmir. The same year, he visited Pakistan and 11 years later, Abdullah and the then PM Indira Gandhi signed an accord paving the way for him to return to power in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-kept-farooqs-dad-in-jail-for-11-years-bjp/articleshow/77323534.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Nagpur||Drive in govt depts, during events to boost plasma collection||Nagpur: In a bid to prod recovered Covid 19 patients, the Platina therapy project team comprising the 21 medical colleges of state and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has approached social and religious organizations beside government departments, where large number of employees were affected, to donate their plasma for off label emergency use and trial purpose. Said to be the world‚Äôs largest trail-cum-treatment, the project aims to simultaneously prevent 5,000 fatalities from Covid-19 through off label use and conduct randomized control study on 472 patients using the convascent plasma of recovered persons who were moderate or severe patients. The push has come at a time when it is peak time of the pandemic in Maharashtra where total cases reached 4,31,716 by Sunday evening. Platina project state coordinator Dr Mohammed Faisal told TOI that he has sent request letters to all Ganesh mandals in the state while NGOs, social organizations like Jamaat-e-Islami, and police departments would be approached too. Total 9,566 cops including 988 officers were infected by Covid. Of this, 7,534 have recovered while 1,900 are under treatment. 40 to 50 cops from different places have already donated plasma. The plan is to counsel the recovered patients. Once the patient is convinced, a technician will collect blood sample, and if found fit, the plasma will be collected at designated centres. The project team is assuming that there would be around 5,000 Ganesh mandals and 10 donations from each of them can be achieved on one bag per day basis. The team would be setting up LCD screens to play videos, putting up posters beside making phone calls to prospective donors. The outreach program would continue till December as plasma is being seen as a major component in clinical management of Covid patients. Even after over a month of launching trial-cum-treatment project, the state medical colleges are unable to meet its target of a modest 500 plasma bags. As on Sunday, the project received a total of only 418 bags. Officials and the medical colleges were hoping to get a sizeable donors during the Eid-UL-Azha seeking help of religious heads. But the drive didn‚Äôt yield satisfactory result as many recovered Covid patients had some or other disease which made them unfit for donation though they were willing to oblige the request of doctors. From August 4, the state will again give a push to the plasma collection drive and approach each Ganesh manual to send at least one eligible donor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drive-in-govt-depts-during-events-to-boost-plasma-collection/articleshow/77322585.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
August 3, 2020||Kolkata||West Bengal: Security agencies bet big on health safety business to stay afloat||KOLKATA: In a bid to survive in the new-normal, Bengal‚Äôs private security industry, which employs close to 7 lakh people in Kolkata, are betting big on health safety to off-set employment losses and keep afloat. The agencies have already started to set up separate sanitization units, provide health safety solutions to clients and even step into bio-medical waste disposal. According to industry sources, the migration to health safety solutions has seen a substantial spike. For example, government establishments ‚Äî including some who rely only on government security ‚Äî has been increasing seeking out private firms for sanitization measures. Added to that are factories, even municipalities. ‚ÄúIt is not only about private companies running big workplaces,‚Äù said an industry insider. ‚ÄúEven private companies, which are insisting on lower security manpower due to reduced office operations, are very eager to put in place the health protocols,‚Äù the insider added. A case in point are some Sector V biggies, who have asked their security providers for a 30% slash in physical security, are eager to scale up health safety protocols. Several private banks ‚Äî among the biggest employers for private security personnel ‚Äî are also keen to adopt this new normal, sources indicated. Debajit Choudhury, CMD, NIS Management Limited, said: ‚ÄúThe nature of the trade is changing. While physical security has taken a hit, we have been witnessing new opportunities in sanitization, thermal scanning even bio-medical waste disposal. Security companies, which were already offering facility management services, are quickly upscaling. Others, too, are following suit.‚Äù Choudhury said, ‚ÄúControl access will remain a key physical security measure, but companies have to invest big on technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), to reduce proximate security, including frisking and checks.‚Äù ‚ÄúSafety is now integral to security. Clients are approaching us for sanitizing and maintaining health protocols. Security Organization are also planning to diversify into sanitization, as that is the need of the hour,‚Äù said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, secretary general, Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI), West Bengal. Ahluwalia, who is also the CMD of Kolkata Response Group added, ‚ÄúWe have developed a specialist team, who have been trained in providing safety and sanitization solutions and are using high-tech equipment, including thermal scanners‚Äù Shyamal Karmakar, S&IB managing-director, said: ‚ÄúCompanies that provide facility management are adapting to these new work roles. Normal security and housekeeping solutions must be integrated in the longer run. We have been setting up sanitizing units and training people on the new health protocols.‚Äù CAPSI has already written to the Centre urging them to lessen the the 18% GST component for private security providers to help them offer cheaper health safety and security solutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/security-agencies-bet-big-on-health-safety-biz-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/77322592.cms||Saibal Sen

The gang was intercepted at Sawali phata following a tip-off. The trio was denied bail and sent to judicial custody. The arrested accused have been identified as Pravin Jhanjhal, Devendra Choubey and Rajesh Turkar.

This was the first major action after police got special powers around a fortnight ago to crackdown on racketeers dealing in spurious substances banned in the state. Sources in the police department said the racketeers mislead police by claiming to be heading towards Amravati or Hyderabad, but never reveal the name of the actual receiver.

August 3, 2020||Shimla||Vocal for local: Himachal Pradesh's Kullu says no to Chinese rakhis||MANALI: Rejecting Chinese rakhis this year, thousands of sisters in Kullu district have decided to go for the rakhis made by various NGOs, women groups and specially-abled and orphans children. Since special rakhi markets have not been set up this year to maintain social distancing amid the Covid-19 pandemic, this gave an opportunity to many to make rakhis at home. Several NGOs, women self-help groups (SHGs) and a large number of children have designed their own rakhis over the past few days and those have found favour with the local populace. While some are selling their rachis in markets, others are providing home delivery facility. Sudarshana Thakur of Radha NGO said the children at her organisation asked her if they could make and sell rakhis, as the country is boycotting Chinese products. ‚ÄúThey made a large number of rakhis, which are selling like hot cakes. We sold them not just in Kullu-Manali, but orders were received from other districts as well. Usually, we make and sell pickles and hand-woven products,‚Äù she said. Rakhis made by nearly 35 specially-abled children in Nav Chetna NGO have also become very popular in Sarwari region of Kullu. NGO‚Äôs president Prabhu said, ‚ÄúWe give vocational training on different things to our children. This time they learned rakhi making. Our rakhis got a good response from people.‚Äù Even Himachal‚Äôs largest weavers‚Äô society Bhuttico is selling desi rakhis through its showrooms spread across the state. The rakhis made of pure wool and other local products are also in good demand. Bhutti Weavers Cooperative Society (Bhuttico) managing director Ramesh Thakur said, ‚ÄúCoronavirus has affected the livelihood of weavers as well. So, they decided to make rakhis.

August 3, 2020||Lucknow||UP: Amar Singh a flamboyant politician who added glitz to dry politics||LUCKNOW: ‚ÄúOne can love me or hate me, but certainly can‚Äôt ignore me,‚Äù Amar Singh had said while talking to TOI at his Lucknow residence several years ago. That was perhaps the best assessment that people approved of regarding Amar Singh and his role in UP politics. Born in Aligarh and having his roots in Azamgarh, Singh started his political journey as a member of the students‚Äô wing of the Congress party. After his education in Calcutta, he stationed himself in Delhi and came close to Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav. Barely four years after the SP was founded, Singh was nominated to Rajya Sabha. It was actually not his friends across party lines but his contacts in showbiz and corporate world that made Amar Singh different from a typical politician that UP had seen till then. It was Singh‚Äôs association with superstar Amitabh Bachchan that saw the actor pitching in for the Samajwadi Party during the elections with his campaign ‚ÄúUP mein hai dum‚Ä¶‚Äù Despite his known ‚Äòdifference of opinion‚Äô with SP‚Äôs Muslim face Azam Khan, Singh went on to be appointed as party‚Äôs general secretary. After being sacked from SP in 2010, Amar Singh joined Ajit Singh‚Äôs Rashtriya Lok Dal in March 2014. Having lost elections from Fatehpur Sikri, Singh once again reached out to Mulayam to mend fences. In 2016, he was nominated to Rajya Sabha by Mulayam Singh despite resistance from son Akhilesh Yadav, who was then the UP CM, and Azam Khan. According to insiders, Mulayam put his foot down on the issue stating that Amar Singh helped him when the CBI was after him in disproportionate assets case and that it was now time for him to pay back. However, Akhilesh went on to hold Amar Singh responsible for attempting to administer a split in the party by misleading uncle Shivpal Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amar-a-flamboyant-politician-who-added-glitz-to-dry-politics/articleshow/77323025.cms||---

An internal communication has been issued by Patil after a senior inspector from Aurangabad rural police was booked on the charges of demanding bribe and later destroying evidence of the same.Terming the ever-increasing number of ACB cases in the limits of Aurangabad rural police as ‚Äòdisappointing‚Äô and ‚Äòscandalous‚Äô, the communication, a copy of which is with TOI, reads, ‚ÄúDespite issuing strict warnings from time to time during crime meetings, orderly room meetings, darbars, inspections, surprise visits, the number of ACB cases are increasing.‚ÄùPatil has asked all the police station chiefs to address their immediate subordinates and warn them against demanding or accepting bribe. The police stations heads have also been asked to keep a close watch on the activities of their subordinates and the arrests and investigations carried out by them. The sub-divisional police officers (SPDO) have been asked to regularly reach out to the police stations and brief them accordingly.‚ÄúSDPOs should act as vigilance officers and initiate appropriate measures for keeping a check on the corrupt practices in their respective jurisdictions,‚Äù reads the communication.Henceforth, policemen and officers will face stringent as well as administrative action for their involvement in corrupt practices. ‚ÄúIn the event of any such incident in future, the accountabilities of SDPOs as well as police station chiefs would be fixed and they will take action accordingly.

August 3, 2020||Chennai||Phase-2 of vaccine trials to begin, SRM calls for volunteers||CHENNAI: Even as the preliminary results of phase-1 human clinical trials of indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin are awaited, researchers at the SRM Medical College and Research Centre have begun preparations for phase-2 trials expected to begin by this month end. The city institute is one of 12 institutions chosen by ICMR to conduct trials for the vaccine developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR and the National Institute of Virology. According to Dr Melvin George, associate professor of clinical pharmacology at SRM, because of the prevailing global conditions, seamless clinical trials have to be adopted wherein phase-2 trial begins along with the phase 1, without waiting for results like in traditional trials. ‚ÄúWe are definitely not rushing. Due norms have to be followed. This happens whenever we are dealing with a pandemic or even an endemic situation, when we strive to bring a drug or vaccine quickly into the market. This is what we call an accelerated approval,‚Äù Melvin George told TOI. As part of phase-I trial, to test the vaccine‚Äôs safety and ensure it has no side-effects, about 30 people in the age group of 18-55 years were given the first shot of this candidate-vaccine and the results will be available in a month‚Äôs time after complete clinical evaluation. For phase-2 trials, the institute will be needing about 100 volunteers and appealed to the public to actively participate in it as an altruistic measure. If the results of phase-2 are convincing, phase-3 trials will require the drug be tested on 5,000-10,000 people. In a normal scenario, phase-2 trials will last for 6-12 months, but researchers are expecting to work at a faster rate due to the prevailing conditions. While these are the existing conditions in the race to find the vaccine, Dr Melvin George said when the vaccine will be introduced in the market can only be speculated. ‚ÄúIt is all in the hands of the government. If the efficacy is good, they can release it into the market after phase 2 results itself. If we have to wait for phase 3, it may take a year and a half,‚Äù Dr Melvin said adding that, to understand the safety of any drug or vaccine, it has to be exposed to a larger population to identify rare side effects. ‚ÄúTo pick up these rare side effects, phase-3 is necessary, but in these situations, since lives and livelihoods are lost, we can accelerate,‚Äù Dr Melvin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/phase-2-of-vaccine-trials-to-begin-srm-calls-for-volunteers/articleshow/77321598.cms||Srikkanth D

Earlier, people had to visit the offices of registering and licensing authority (RLA) and regional transport officers again and again for their work, but now, all services of the department are available at the click of a button. ‚ÄúNow there is no need for people to visit transport offices or seek favour from officials. This will also ensure elimination of harassment,‚Äù he said, adding that six steps ‚Äî user registration, user login, filling online form, attaching documents, making online fee payment and submission and acknowledgment ‚Äî have been introduced for the delivery of smart transport services.

The man, Chandrakanth Sharma, had lured the investors with a promise of high returns of more than 70% by making investments in the entertainment sector and other undefined projects under the banner, CineMirchi Productions. Sharma has been remanded to five-day police custody, while his wife is being questioned regarding her role. Joint CP (EOW) OP Mishra said that Sharma and his wife would do extensive publicity campaigns and get their photographs clicked with Bollywood celebrities to attract investors. They have also produced two movies named ‚ÄúThe Great Indian Casino and ‚ÄúLust Wala Love,‚Äù which are yet to be released. They lured investors claiming that they had planned to make one international movie every year. After people invested money into the company, Sharma paid them the return once after which the investors stopped hearing from him. Some of the investors were duped after a staffer at AIIMS befriended them and lured them to the scheme laid out by Sharma, the complainants told the cops. ‚ÄúBased on complaints from 88 investors, we registered an FIR under the relevant sections and found that the accused was continuing with the investment procedure. He was even giving life threats to some of the investors,‚Äù said Mishra. CineMirchi would promise a return of about 70% on a weekly basis and generated an ID for every investor through which they could invest more cash. An incentive of 5% was given if the investor introduced a new member to the company. When the cops started tracking Sharma, it was found that he has been changing his phone number and location frequently for the past few months. He would issue SIM cards in the name of his aides and travel to faraway places from Delhi to make calls. Sharma was arrested from Chandigarh after a hot pursuit by the cops. Police say the number of investors could go up to nearly a thousand people as most victims have not come forward to lodge a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/film-producer-dupes-investors-of-rs-6cr-nabbed/articleshow/77321652.cms||---

August 3, 2020||India||Free Mehbooba from ‚Äòillegal detention‚Äô: Rahul||NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday demanded the release of former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti from ‚Äúillegal detention‚Äù, saying democracy is damaged when government detains political leaders, illegally. Mufti has been in detention under the stringent Public Safety Act since Article 370 was nullified on August 5 last year, revoking special status to J&K and bifurcating the erstwhile state into two Union Territories. Though many other political leaders in Kashmir have since been freed, Mufti‚Äôs detention under PSA was given a three month extension by the government. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs democracy is damaged when GOI illegally detains leaders. It‚Äôs high time Mehbooba Mufti is released,‚Äù Gandhi said on Twitter. Last week, Rahul made a similar plea for the release of senior INC leader Saifuddin Soz after the latter‚Äôs sensational videos ‚Äî speaking to the media from behind corcertina wires installed on his bungalows walls ‚Äî went viral on social media. While the J&K administration has submitted in Supreme Court that Soz is free, the 82-year-old Congress veteran had claimed otherwise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/free-mehbooba-from-illegal-detention-rahul/articleshow/77323540.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Ahmedabad||93% of MBA batch at IIM-Ahmedabad at or below 25 years||AHMEDABAD: Of the 390 students for the MBA course of 2020-22 batch at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A), 363 are at or below 25 years of age, making it the youngest in past three years. Last year, of 388 students, 345 or 88% were in the same age bracket. On Sunday, the top officials of IIM-A welcomed the incoming batches of MBA and MBA-FABM through an online inaugural from IIM-A campus.  Prof Errol D‚ÄôSouza, director of IIM-A, said that they would make sure that the students feel the campus experience in online classes as the institute awaits government directives to open academic institutions. Analysis of the incoming students in the flagship MBA course reveals that the batch had one of the lowest non-engineering students‚Äô percentage at 24% compared to 26% in 2019-21 and 33% in 2018-20 batch. In FABM course, the share of engineering students went down from 65% and 63% in past two years to 48% this year. On the other hand, science students consist of 45% of the batch of 47 compared to 37% in the last admission. ‚ÄúThe institute believes that diversity has an impact on the heterogeneity of the deep and enduring attributes such as values, attitudes, opinions, and perspectives of students which enhances their creativity and performance in an organizational context,‚Äù said Prof D‚ÄôSouza. Dr Manav Mehta, an MBBS who got admitted in MBA course, said that he chose the course as he was interested in the business and managerial side of healthcare. ‚ÄúThe Covid-19 outbreak has shifted global attention to healthcare sector and the industry is expected to grow. Thus, it would be a long-term value to do an MBA that won‚Äôt be affected by the coronavirus,‚Äù he said. Parul Gupta, a psychology student who made it to MBA, said that the current crisis will present an opportunity for adaptation towards new norms of interaction ‚Äî it would require understanding the changing needs of consumers and innovating accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/93-of-mba-batch-at-iim-a-at-or-below-25-yrs/articleshow/77322649.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Ranchi||Sindri‚Äôs power woes continue||SINDRI: Although the Jharkhand Bidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) claims to have taken several steps to strengthen power supply in Jharkhand, nearly 6,000 consumers in Sindri township have been left in the lurch. Frequent power cuts due to cable failures results in the township remaining in darkness from 12 to 24 hours almost every alternate day. JBVNL, earlier known as JSEB, took over the power supply system from the now closed Sindri fertiliser factory in 2003. Even at that time, while the fertiliser factory management used to supply power in the township, JSEB had its own private consumers both in and out of the town. Problems arose when the state power cradle started shifting its load on the weathered 60-year-old power supply system of the town. The old underground cables and circuit breakers started bursting under the increased load and instead of replacing the faulty cables and breakers, the JSEB authorities kept bypassing them, bringing the situation to the present condition where even repairing the old cables has become difficult. The indifferent attitude of JBVNL can be gauged from the fact that it has not been even able to open a maintenance office in the township in the last 17 years. ‚ÄúEarlier, it was decided that the fertiliser factory management would take care of the power system inside the plant premises and JSEB would take care of the system outside the plant,‚Äù said Deepak Kumar, the secretary of Sindri Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Kumar added, ‚ÄúNow, when the HURL is setting up a new fertiliser unit in the plant premises, it should take care of the power supply system.‚Äù When contacted, HURL general manager S K Sinha said they are equally disturbed by the frequent power cuts. ‚ÄúHURL deposited Rs 7 crores with JBVNL on July 31, 2018 for shifting the power cables from inside the plant premises to outside the plant. However, the work has not been completed yet,‚Äù Sinha added. He further said, ‚ÄúLast week, we even provided them with a new cable for replacement of the worn-out cable but the state power body is not providing the required man power. We have complained to the Dhanbad DC (Uma Shankar Singh) in this regard and she convened a meeting with HURL and JBVNL on Friday evening to resolve the matter.‚Äù The meeting was going on till the time this report was filed. Upon contact, JBVNL area general manager Paritosh Kumar said that he was looking into the matter and the issue will be resolved shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sindris-power-woes-continue/articleshow/77322931.cms||Anil Ashutosh
August 3, 2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand 4th most dangerous state for Christians, claims report||RANCHI: With 21 cases of hate crimes and a murder, Jharkhand is rated as the fourth most ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù state in India for Christians after Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh, a half-yearly report by Persecution Relief, a nationwide missionary organisation based at Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and working for Christian rights, noted. BJP said the report seemed to be lopsided and demanded that similar studies be conducted on ‚Äúforceful conversions‚Äù by missionary groups. Ruling Congress said the Jharkhand government does not differentiate people based on their religions and persecutions, if any, are triggered by trouble mongers. The report claimed that 293 cases of crimes against Christians have taken place nationally in the first half of 2020 (January-June) despite a nationwide lockdown since March 25, which is a staggering 40.87% hike compared to 208 incidents in 2019. Of the total incidents in Jharkhand so far, 14 were reported during April (1), May (5) and June (8) alone. January saw four cases, two in February and March had one, added the report, which was prepared based on media reports as well as independent studies by the group. Barring 2019, Jharkhand was also among the top 10 states with crimes against missionaries since 2016. In 2016, it registered 19 instances, 12 in 2017 and seven in 2018. Christian missionaries were at loggerhead during the erstwhile BJP rule between 2014-19 after the Raghubar Das government introduced the Freedom of Religion Act in 2017 (anti-conversion law) to prevent the alleged conversion attempts by missionaries targeting poor tribals. Even the change of guard in Jharkhand after the formation of the Mahagathbandhan government comprising JMM-Congress-RJD too didn‚Äôt seem to have improved the situation for Christians in Jharkhand. While the report doesn‚Äôt directly criticise the ruling dispensation, the instances of hate crimes indicate this. On the murder in Jharkhand, the report states that 27-year-old Kande Mudu was killed in Khunti last month by a group of religious fanatics who were armed with weapons in a village named Bari. The miscreants broke into his home, attacked him and slit his throat. ‚ÄúHe and his family had accepted Christianity four years ago and had been harassed by locals ever since. Bindu Mudu, his wife and his two daughters fled the village for fear of being attacked and their whereabouts are unknown. No arrests have been made so far,‚Äù claimed the report. It added that two young missionaries, who were a part of the youth missionary movement for over eight years, were beaten up by migrant workers in Belgaria in Dhanbad. Similarly, in Latehar, the house of a Christian family was found ransacked in Hadgadwa village. Shibu Thomas, founder of Persecution Relief, in a statement said that the purpose of highlighting such reports is to wake up governments concerned to prevent religious intolerance. ‚ÄúIt is growing to peaks of new inhumane attitudes now,‚Äù he observed. Reacting to the report, BJP‚Äôs Pratul Shahdeo maintained that it seems lopsided and sought similar studies of forceful conversions being done by missionary outfits. ‚ÄúThey will never talk about how forceful conversions they often resort to or will not talk about the massacre and violence against non-Christian tribals like the one which took place in Burugulikera in West Singbhum in January,‚Äù he said. Recalling a statement by former archbishop Felix Toppo after the Hemant Soren government came to power, he said, ‚ÄúNow, enjoy the Christmas gift.‚Äù Toppo had termed the victory as a Christmas gift. The ruling dispensation, however, put the blame on some trouble mongers and defended the state government of being sensitive towards all religions. ‚ÄúUnlike the previous regime, the current government doesn‚Äôt differentiate people on the basis of religion and is equally sensitive towards all. Whenever criminal acts have come to the fore, the state police have swung into action against the culprits,‚Äù said Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-4th-most-dangerous-state-for-christians-claims-report/articleshow/77322925.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The judicial magistrate first class court exonerated accused Savio Fernandes after it found that the prosecution ‚Äúneither proved game nor gambling‚Äù and failed to explain the activity he carried out. ‚Äú‚Ä¶the prosecution has not explained as to what is the ‚ÄòLal Kala‚Äô gambling activity, how it is performed, who controls the activity, how winner is declared, mode of declaring winner, who declares the winner and who pays money to the winner. Therefore, the prosecution has neither proved game nor gambling,‚Äù judge Anuradha Andrade stated. The court also found that the prosecution didn‚Äôt identify persons with whom the accused allegedly played ‚ÄòLal Kala‚Äô gambling activity and observed that the investigating officer didn‚Äôt take pains in arresting other persons involved in the gambling activity. ‚ÄúIn the instant case, there is no corroboration of the case through independent witness,‚Äù the court further stated, adding that the prosecution‚Äôs case was not convincing. The prosecution stated that the police while patrolling Anjuna area in September 2018 caught the man conducting gambling activities known as ‚ÄòLal Kala‚Äô in an open public place. The police seized Rs 700 from him and other gambling articles. The investigating officer deposed that the person was dribbling strikers and people were betting on the strikers. He stated that he conducted the raid with two panch witnesses and the person who was dribbling the striker and accepting bets was caught red handed, but the people betting escaped. He was charged under Section 11(2) (a) of the Goa Daman and Diu Public Gambling Act, 1976.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/strictures-passed-against-police-for-failing-to-prove-gambling-case/articleshow/77322659.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Across road from J Jayalalithaa‚Äôs house in Poes Garden, V K Sasikala builds her own||CHENNAI: While the Tamil Nadu government is preparing to turn former chief minister J Jayalalithaa‚Äôs Poes Garden residence Veda Nilayam into a memorial, her long-time housemate V K Sasikala is building her own house across the road. Ousted from the AIADMK by her friend‚Äôs foot soldiers, Sasikala is expected to be released from prison soon after serving term in the disproportionate assets case. ‚ÄúWe are building a house, but the progress is slow because of the pandemic,‚Äù a family member told TOI, seeking anonymity. While Veda Nilayam (36/81), a three-storied building, is spread across 24,000sqft, Sasikala‚Äôs abode under construction is expected to be bigger. The plot (95/58) is registered in the name of M/s Sriharichandana Estates Pvt Ltd, represented by its director K Karthikeyan. The plan is for the proposed construction of ground floor plus two floors, the same as Veda Nilayam, but with ‚Äútwo dwelling units of residential building‚Äù. CMDA approved the building plan a year ago, during the run-up to the 2019 general elections. ‚ÄúThe plot is registered in the name of a company,‚Äù said a CMDA source. Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, who revolted against Sasikala before merging his faction with that of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, holds the housing portfolio. He is also the CMDA chairman. Jaya‚Äôs guards used to park vehicles at spotWhen Jayalalithaa was the chief minister, the plot across Veda Nilayam was being used by her black cat commandos to park their vehicles. Journalists too used to hang around here while waiting for Jayalalithaa to come out of her residence. A relative of Sasikala said she has not been sharing her plans with anyone. ‚ÄúShe was betrayed in politics. Now, she does not trust anyone,‚Äù said the family member. EPS, the man she chose to head the party and the government when she was convicted in the assets disproportionate case, ousted her from the AIADMK. He could well be the CM candidate for the party in the 2021 assembly election. As for her nephew T T V Dhinakaran, now heading the AMMK, sources said differences have cropped up between him and his aunt. Sasikala is likely to strike out on her own from a new address in Poes Garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-across-road-from-j-jayalalithaas-house-in-poes-garden-v-k-sasikala-builds-her-own/articleshow/77323546.cms||Jaya Menon

August 3, 2020||Goa||Opt for basic infrastructure over lavish projects: GITP||Panaji: Instead of allocating funds for extravagant and unnecessary infrastructure, the state government must exercise restraint and spend taxpayer‚Äôs money in a judicious manner, Goa IT Professionals (GITP) said on Saturday. GITP called on the state government to fix its priorities and focus on basic infrastructure which can aid entrepreneurs and other learning systems. ‚ÄúHard earned money of citizens, paid as taxes, cannot be washed away for luxuries, extravaganza, miscellaneous and non-priority infrastructure,‚Äù GITP president Gurudev Naik said. GITP has urged the government to improve connectivity in the state and set up the long overdue single-window system for investment so that jobs are created in Goa and people are able to earn a respectable living. ‚ÄúDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, entrepreneurs and businesses are reeling under extreme pressure and are struggling to survive. Lack of basic infrastructure like connectivity and power makes matters worse for technology-dependent businesses and online education models,‚Äù GITP said. ‚ÄúIn the current troubled circumstances, while every government in the world is exercising restraint on expenditure, it is disheartening to see crores of rupees being earmarked for projects such as facelift of the assembly, construction of memorials, Raj Bhavan, convention centres, panchayat ghars, etc,‚Äù Naik said. Such infrastructure projects, Naik said, can‚Äôt be the priorities during a pandemic. ‚ÄúWhile Goa continues to rank behind in the Ease of Doing Business rankings due to the lack of a single-window system, industries are either closing down or retrenching staff. Goa‚Äôs tourism sector and allied sectors have taken a big hit,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIn this backdrop, the least that can be expected from the government is judicious spending of the exchequer‚Äôs money by setting the priorities right,‚Äù Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/opt-for-basic-infrastructure-over-lavish-projects-gitp/articleshow/77322725.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Goa||GTA questions govt‚Äôs move on new startup policy||Panaji: Expressing surprise over the state government‚Äôs move to come out with a new startup policy, Goa Technology Association (GTA) on Sunday said some startups are yet to benefit out of the existing policy, this while the Goa IT Policy itself has not been fully implemented. The association‚Äôs president, Mangirish Salelkar, suggested that the government continue with the existing policies which were drafted along with inputs from former chief minister Manohar Parrikar. ‚ÄúGTA has not yet been invited to be part of any drafting committee,‚Äù Salelkar said. ‚ÄúWe need to understand the need to revamp the policy.‚Äù Further, Salelkar asked the IT department to utilise funds earmarked for the IT parks to sustain startups and IT companies which have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis. GTA members said that communication and productivity have taken a hit due to poor last mile internet connectivity. They said that despite raising these issues with the government, telecom companies and internet service providers, the problems persist. Salelkar pointed out that the industry had sought support from the chief minister and minister for IT, Jennifer Monserrate, but despite assurances, nothing had changed on ground. ‚ÄúWe have also had a video conference with the IT minister and director of IT, wherein we put forward our issues and presented suggestions for the industry‚Äôs revival. They promised to get back to us on it in two or three days, but we haven‚Äôt heard from them for the last two to three months,‚Äù he said. Salelkar acknowledged the role of IT director Ankita Anand in helping the industry with travel passes during Lockdown 1.0. The pandemic itself has forced IT companies and startups to re-evaluate their business plans. ‚ÄúThere have been pay cuts, job losses and deferred payments from clients. This has affected our members,‚Äù Salelkar said, urging the government to take GTA into confidence while taking policy decisions. ‚ÄúInstead of approving crores to design consultants for project consultation of the IT park, if even 10% of that amount was to be disbursed to existing IT or startup companies, and to improve the infrastructure and last mile internet connectivity, we would have been in a position to create so many jobs,‚Äù Salelkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gta-questions-govts-move-on-new-startup-policy/articleshow/77322728.cms||---
August 3, 2020||World||UK to mint Gandhi coin, but not all PIOs happy with choice||LONDON: The Royal Mint is working on a proposal for a new coin commemorating Mahatma Gandhi as the first ethnic minority face to feature on British currency amid criticism by some prominent PIOs, who argue that a figure intrinsically connected to UK politics and society would have been a more appropriate choice. A spokesperson for The Royal Mint told TOI, "We are working with the Chancellor (Rishi Sunak) and the Royal Mint Advisory Committee (RMAC) to develop a proposal...It is too early to reveal further specific details about the coin as we are still in the initial stages of discussions." The RMAC is an independent committee of experts that recommends themes and designs of coins to the Chancellor, in his role as Master of the Mint. Her Majesty's Treasury confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi would be the face of the coin. "The Chancellor is keen that our coinage commemorates the work of the many previous generations who have served this nation and those nations that form the Commonwealth," a treasury source said. Finance minister Sunak, who is Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy's son-in-law, had written to The Royal Mint on Saturday, urging it to consider celebrating the achievements of someone from the BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) community on UK coinage. He pointed out that "for generations, ethnic minority groups have fought and died for this country". Sunak did not specifically mention Gandhi. The letter was in response to a communication from Zehra Zaidi, who runs the ‚ÄòWe Too Built Britain‚Äô campaign, seeking his "active support" for new coins and bank notes to reflect "service to the nation" by BAME individuals both in military conflict and on the home front. Zaidi, a descendant of Sayyid Bashir Hussain Zaidi, a member of India's first Lok Sabha, on Sunday distanced herself from the Gandhi coin, saying he was not on the proposed list of names she had sent to Sunak. The list included Khudadad Khan, the first British Indian soldier awarded the Victoria Cross, and Muslim British-Indian WWII spy Noor Inayat Khan. "We never pushed Gandhi," she said. The Indian high commission in the UK welcomed the decision, though. "Gandhi has been a symbol of equality and humanity for the whole world. His message of non-violence is more relevant today than ever," an official said. Sudhakar Goud, spokesperson for the Indian Overseas Congress in UK, said, "Gandhi fought for justice and freedom and so he is ideal for this.". Kamal Dhaliwal, president of the IOC (UK), said: "This is a proud moment for us." But London-based historian Dr Zareer Masani, author of Indira Gandhi‚Äôs biography, had a contrasting view. "I thought the demand was for an outstanding British person of colour to be on our currency, not an Indian nationalist hero. The person who qualifies more than any other is Cornelia Sorabji. To select Gandhi instead is a cop out." Lord Meghnad Desai, chairman of the Gandhi Memorial Statue Trust, said he felt Dadabhai Naoroji would have been a better choice as he was "more connected with British political life, being the first Indian to enter British Parliament". Labour MP Preet Gill said, "We already have a statue of Gandhi. There are lots of women not acknowledged like suffragette Sophia Duleep Singh. This is not Rishi Sunak‚Äôs campaign, it has to be a community campaign."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-to-mint-gandhi-coin-but-not-all-pios-happy-with-choice/articleshow/77323555.cms||NAOMI CANTON

August 3, 2020||Goa||Sugar factory workers to get short extension||Ponda: State government has decided to extend the tenure of contractual workers of Sanjivani Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana, Dharbandora. An order in this regard will be issued on Monday, said public works department minister Deepak Pauskar. Eighty-six out of the 93 contractual workmen staged an agitation at the factory gate on Saturday seeking extension of their term. With no hope of the factory resuming operations this crushing season, the workers were afraid that their jobs were on the line. Local MLA Pauskar approached the workmen and discussed the issue.  In his capacity as the cabinet minister, Pauskar assured them of extending their contractual term either by two months or till proper arrangements are made. Pauskar said the issue arose as the staff members failed to send workmen‚Äôs extension proposals to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Authorities were reluctant to send the proposals of 7 workmen out of the 95 serving the facility, as the laboratory where they were working has been shut. Two of the workmen render their services at the petrol pump near the factory and get compensated. Puti Gaonkar, workers‚Äô union leader said these workmen were in service of the factory for over a decade and recently, the cooperation minister had assured them of absorbing them elsewhere in the event of factory operations come to a halt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sugar-factory-workers-to-get-short-extension/articleshow/77322739.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Goa||State braces for heavy rainfall till Aug 5||Panaji: Rainfall activity is expected to intensify further in the next few day, the India meteorological department has forecast on Sunday. Heavy to very heavy rainfall will continue till August 5. ‚ÄúRed alert warning is not issued as of now, as the regions of higher impact is slightly north of Goa. Still, the possibility of extremely heavy rainfall is valid over Goa also,‚Äù IMD scientist Rahul M said. The IMD in its previous warnings had forecast an increase in rainfall activity over Goa during the first week of August. TOI had reported the same, last week. The possible impact of the heavy rain showers could be short-term waterlogging, flooding of susceptible informal settlements, low-lying areas, urban areas. Also, short-term disruption to municipal services like water, electricity, etc. Due to strong winds, weak trees may get uprooted and there could be instances of localised power interruptions. The IMD has also warned that, if the heavy showers prolongs, it may lead to a possibility of mudslides and rock falls in vulnerable areas. Fishermen are advised not to venture into sea until August 6 as squally weather will prevail along the coast of Goa with speeds reaching 45-55kmph.

August 3, 2020||Goa||Several paddy fields inS Goa under pest control||Margao: Several paddy fields in South Goa, particularly Salcete, have been infested with certain types of pests causing damage to farmers, prompting the Salcete zonal agriculture office to issue an advisory to paddy farmers. ‚ÄúThe bountiful rainfall the state has received until now has been favourable for paddy, at least during the initial growth stages. However, high humidity levels have also created conducive conditions for attack of pests like Rice Caseworm and Rice leaf folder,‚Äù zonal agriculture office, Margao, Shariff Furtado, told TOI. Assistant agriculture officer Jovita Sequeira who inspected the pest-infested paddy fields across Salcete said that most of the damage was witnessed in areas of Curtorim, Sao Jose de Areal, Nuvem and Verna. Sequeira said adequate pest control measures as advised by the agriculture officers would help in controlling the damage to a great extent. The agriculture officers have advised paddy farmers to look out for signs that could be indicative of the crop being infested by pests. If any such signs are observed, the farmers have been asked to take adequate preventive or curative measures, as the case may be, to prevent or avoid further damage. ++++++++++++For infographics ++++++++++++++++++ Graphic header: Bugging The Agriculturists Pest name: Rice case worm (Nymphula depunctalis) To identify caseworm damage, check for: ¬∑ Caterpillars feed on green tissues of the leaves and they become whitish papery ¬∑ Tubular cases around the tillers by cutting the apical portion of leaves ¬∑ Floating of tubular cases on the water ¬∑ Cutting off leaf tips to make leaf cases Identification of insect pest: Egg: Individual egg is circular, flattened, and measures 0.5 mm in diameter. It is light yellow and has a smooth surface. Mature eggs are darker and develop two purplish dots. Larva: Pale translucent green with orange head. It has filamentous gills on the sides of the body. The larvae are found hanging from the leaf and measures upto 15mm long. Pupa: The pupa is cream in color and about 5.5 mm long. Mature pupa is silvery white. Adult: Moth is small, delicate white with pale brown wavy markings. The adult moth is about 5 mm long. It is bright white with light brown and black spots. Life cycle : ¬∑ Female lays about 150 tiny eggs on leaves and leave sheath in rows and batches which hatch in about a week ¬∑ Young larvae feed by scrapping the leaves surface. The larva makes a cylindrical, tubular case out of a portion of the leaf cut and remains inside it, moving with the case on the leaves and becomes fully grown in about 20 days reaching a length of 10-12 mm. ¬∑ The caterpillars undergo six instars. Larger cases are made by the succeeding larval instars. The larval stage pupates inside the last case. Before pupation the case is attached to the leaf sheath above the water level and it‚Äôs both ends are plugged. ¬∑ The pupal period lasts for about a week, after which it is converted into an adult insect. The life cycle is completed in about 35-40 days. Adult stage of the pest which is not directly harmful but it lays eggs and on hatching the worms cause actual damage. Management: Use of correct fertilizer application Plant early and use wider spacing (30 √ó 20 cm) Drain the field Transplant older seedlings Mix 250 ml of kerosene to the standing water Dislodge the cases by passing a rope and drain water. Collect the cases and destroy In case the infestation of the paddy crop has crossed the economic threshold level which will cause economic loss only then farmer is advised to undertake spraying operations described below All farmers especially of Salcete and Mormugao talukas are advised to have preventive spray of Biopesticide Azadirachtin @ 50ml per 10 lts of water If already infestation is witnessed then farmers are advised to take curative measures like spraying Chlorpyriphos @ 25 ml per 10 lt of water. After 20 days, the farmer have to repeat spray with 15 ml Imidiacloprid per 10 lt of water to avoid resurgence and development of resistance of spray to insects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/several-paddy-fields-ins-goa-under-pest-control/articleshow/77322796.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Goa||40% of dementia cases linked to lifestyle, potentially preventable: International study||Experts have found that by reducing risk factors one can delay, even altogether prevent, the onset of dimentia by 40%. A recent study has expanded the number of known risk factors by three to include head injuries in mid-life, excessive alcohol consumption in mid-life, and exposure to air pollution in later life. ‚ÄúThe evidence that dementia can be prevented or delayed by as much as 40% comes as a ray of hope,‚Äù said Dr Amit Dias, department of preventive and social medicine at the Goa Medical College, one of the 28 world-leading dementia experts on the Lancet Commission‚Äôs ‚ÄòDementia prevention, intervention, and care: 2020 report‚Äô. Professor Gill Livingston from the University College London (UCL) was the lead author of the report. The report is an update on the 2017 Lancet Commission report that had listed blood pressure, poor early education, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, loss of hearing, diabetes, obesity, depression and even inadequate levels of social contact as the nine modifiable risk factors which contribute to 34% of all dementia cases. Combined, the three new risk factors are associated with 6% of all cases with head injuries in mid-life accounting for 3% of the cases, excessive alcohol consumption in mid-life 1%, and 2% exposure to air pollution in later life. The 12 risk factors identified in the report are estimated to affect 40% of people with dementia and hold special implications for low and middle income countries like India, Dr Dias said. ‚ÄúThis understanding can help us deal with the rising tide of dementia in India by focusing on preventive strategies,‚Äù he said. Dementia is the umbrella term for a group of progressive, degenerative brain syndromes that result in memory loss, difficulty in thinking behaviour and emotion. There are an estimated 4 million people with dementia in India, approximately 5,000 of whom are in Goa and 50 million worldwide. ‚ÄúWhat is worse in India is that due to stigma and lack of awareness more than 90% of the people do not even get a diagnosis and grapple with the condition in confusion and this adversely affects the life of the person with dementia as well as the caregivers,‚Äù Dr Dias said. Experts in the field of dementia study repeatedly advocate the importance of prevention as the condition holds huge emotional and financial repercussions for the individual and family. According to the Alzheimer‚Äôs disease international, UK, global costs for dementia are estimated to about US $ 1 trillion. The Lancet Commission study showed that one must adopt a brain-friendly lifestyle to prevent dementia in late life and this includes limiting drinking as much as possible. Consumption of more than 21 units a week is a risk for developing dementia. If at all one needs to drink, it should be restricted to 14 units per week. ‚ÄúThis translates to around six pints of average beer or 10 small glasses of low strength red wine in a week. Consumption above this also causes severe brain damage besides leading to dementia,‚Äù said Dr Dias, the only one from India on the Lancet commission. As India goes through a demographic transition, conditions such as dementia will rise further, said Dr Dias, while pressing for policy-makers and the community at large to take active measures to prevent the condition. ‚ÄúOur society and lifestyle is rapidly changing, resulting in an increase in non-communicable diseases. Adopting a healthy lifestyle and controlling the risk factors to prevent dementia has far-reaching benefits,‚Äù he said. Unanimous in its verdict that it is never too early or late to modify one‚Äôs lifestyle to prevent dementia, the study team pointed to already reducing incidences of age-related dementia in many countries . ‚ÄúEven the possibility of delaying the onset of dementia by a few years can have a great impact on the quality of life and cost of care for the family. There is a huge difference if someone develops dementia at the age of 60 as compared to the age of 80 years,‚Äù Dr Dias said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/40-of-dementia-cases-linked-to-lifestyle-potentially-preventable-international-study/articleshow/77322807.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Chennai||Chennai: Covid delays second airport, plan to engage consultant postponed||CHENNAI: The pandemic and the lockdown has hit plans to build a second airport for Chennai. The decision to appoint a consultant for the airport proposed to be established at Parandur in Kancheepuram district has been postponed because of the spread of Covid-19. The state government had fixed a pre-bid meeting for bidders in mid-March but it has been postponed and a revised date is yet to be announced. The state-owned Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (Tidco), the nodal agency for developing the new airport, has announced that the date of pre-bid meeting for consultancy services would be notified in "due course". Pre-bid meeting is meant for firms who are interested to bid for being a consultant for the project, they seek clarifications and suggestions ahead of the selection process. A tender for request for proposal (RFP) for appointing a consultant to study various issues including preparation of techno-economic feasibility report was floated in February. "Selection of a consultant will take some more time," a senior Tidco official told TOI. The consultant must prepare a plan for the airport such as number and length of runways, taxiways, hangars, modes of surface transport including high speed rail or metro rail, besides accommodation requirements for transit passengers at the airport. There are two views regarding the project - keep the ground work and paper work completed for work to begin at short notice, or postpone the project till the situation improves. "The process will have to be slowed down as no one will be ready to invest in the new airport because of the current situation. The studies done now will go to waste after 10 years. The city airport is handling only 50 to 60 flights per day. It looks like it may take almost mid next year for the passenger traffic to reach the pre-shutdown level of growth" said an official of Airports Authority of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-covid-delays-second-airport-plan-to-engage-consultant-postponed/articleshow/77323569.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

On July 25, after much persuasion by teachers, the state government finally complied with the Centre‚Äôs directives. The DoE issued a circular allowing teaching and non-teaching staff in Goa‚Äôs schools to work from home upto July 31. However, August 1 was declared a public holiday due to Eid and this was followed by a Sunday. On Monday, the teachers will be forced to return to work. As Covid-19 cases are rising in Goa, there is panic among teachers. ‚ÄúCentral government orders ask to keep schools and colleges closed till August 31, but Goa government is not following these norms,‚Äù said a teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teachers-to-return-to-work-today/articleshow/77322825.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Mumbai||Men account for 65% of Mumbai‚Äôs 6,000+ Covid deaths, CFR high at 6.1%: BMC||MUMBAI: In an analysis of 6,297 Covid deaths in the city, men were found to have a higher case fatality rate (CFR) of 6.1% than women‚Äôs 5.3%. Mumbai‚Äôs overall CFR‚Äîthe percentage of coronavirus deaths to number of patients who have tested positive‚Äîis 5.8%, still much higher than the state and country averages. Of the city deaths, 65% were in men even though they accounted for 62% of cases while women accounted for 35% of the deaths despite contributing to 38% of cases. The gender disparity seen in the city though is consistent with the trend seen nationally and globally. At the state level too, 65% of the deaths are in men and 35% in women. BMC‚Äôs additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that recent findings, where more women were seen with antibodies than men, got them thinking. Gender disparity in infections max in 31-70 age groupWe relooked at the deaths to understand the gender disparity. The antibody study did show us that more women were exposed and developed antibodies. We will look at it more closely and see if there is a correlation. There is also growing medical evidence about hormones protecting women, but only studies can establish that,‚Äù he said. The BMC‚Äôs sero surveillance in three wards had showed that 59.3% of the total 2,297 women surveyed had antibodies. In contrast, 53.2% of the 1,937 men surveyed had antibodies. A look at infections show that a nearly equal percentage of girls (46%) and boys (54%) are affected in the age group of 10 years and under in the city. The share more or less remains the same till the age-group of 11-20 years. However, the gender gap in infections is the highest in the age groups of 31 years to 70 years, where the share of men go up to 65-69%. Endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi, also a member of the state task force, said that globally studies are being conducted to understand how oestrogen helps pre-menopausal women and whether it can become an armour against Covid. ‚ÄúThere is evidence now that shows that the testes may act as a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19). The virus needs a receptor to enter human tissue. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been found to be particularly high in the testes. In simpler terms, it is believed that it plays a role in aggravating the disease in men. Oestrogen, on the other hand, downregulates it and probably prevents a critical turn in women,‚Äù said Dr Joshi. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava said that the mystery of why a lesser proportion of women than men get infected or die has not yet been solved. ‚ÄúIt could be a combination of gender, immunity and genetic predisposition that protects women. The answers are not clear,‚Äù he said. KEM dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh cautions that till it is known what protects women, they shouldn't drop their guard. ‚ÄúWomen with comorbidities probably have the same risk,‚Äù he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/men-account-for-65-of-mumbais-6000-covid-deaths-cfr-high-at-6-1-bmc/articleshow/77323567.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The DoE said that ‚Äòdue to some discrepancies‚Äô the grant-in-aid institutions are being asked to provide the ‚Äòcorrect information‚Äô by August 7. The DoE said that any changes in enrolment figures can be updated later. Many schools may not be able to get the correct picture of its student numbers as several migrant families have left the state due to the pandemic. ‚ÄúThe staff recruited on regular basis should be correctly shown and the NOCs over the last three academic years, recruitment done during the three years, the proposed recruitment should be invariably shown, so as to take into consideration the existing staff position in the school,‚Äù the DoE told aided schools. All management should submit information about surplus staff and any irregularities in this regard will be viewed seriously, schools have been told. In June, the DoE had asked its taluka-level education inspectors to take count of students in government schools within their jurisdiction. These schools are feeling the most impact of thousands of migrant families leaving the state. For many schools it is already proving to be a challenge to gauge the enrolment for the new academic session. Many migrant families are not responding to calls from schools or their phone numbers are now not contactable. For schools located inside containment zones, the process of assessing student numbers will be delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/education-dept-takes-stock-of-student-teacher-numbers/articleshow/77322846.cms||---

GSIA, which held a virtual AGM, said that despite the efforts of all industry bodies the state government ignored requests not to enhance compensation under the Industrial Disputes Act. ‚ÄúSome of the members were sceptical of the government‚Äôs intentions,‚Äù GSIA president Damodar Kochkar said. ‚ÄúIn spite of the fact that the economy of the state now largely depends on the industrial sector, the government gives scant attention to the industries.‚Äù Kochkar also informed industrialists that with Covid-19 cases rising in Goa, entrepreneurs will have to learn to live with the pandemic. ‚ÄúIndustries must ensure that all the guidelines of the government and the standard operating procedures circulated by GSIA should be meticulously followed. Any concealment of positive cases will adversely affect the other workers, their families, and will also affect industrial activity,‚Äù Kochkar said. A 100-bed hospital has been set up using contribution from the Verna Industries Association and individual units at the Verna industrial estate, a swab collection centre has been set up and a RT-PCR Covid-19 testing machine has been donated to the state district hospital at Margao, Kochkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sceptical-about-govts-plans-for-industry-say-entrepreneurs/articleshow/77322855.cms||---

US officials have said TikTok under its Chinese parent poses a national risk because of the personal data it handles. Trump said on Friday he was planning to ban TikTok in the United States after dismissing the idea of a sale to Microsoft. But following a discussion between Trump and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the Redwood, Washington-based company said in a statement that it would continue negotiations to acquire TikTok from ByteDance, and that it aimed to reach a deal by September 15. It was not immediately clear what changed Trump's mind. Several prominent Republican lawmakers put out statements in the last two days urging him to back a sale of TikTok to Microsoft. The negotiations between ByteDance and Microsoft will be overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a US government panel that has the right to block any agreement, according to the sources, who requested anonymity ahead of a White House announcement. "Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President's concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury," Microsoft said in a statement. ByteDance and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under the proposed deal, Microsoft said it would take over TikTok's operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It said it would ensure that all private data of TikTok's American users is transferred to and remains in the United States. Microsoft may invite other American investors to acquire minority stakes in TikTok, the company added.

August 3, 2020||Mumbai||70% Covid centres in Mumbai shut as cases down in slums||MUMBAI: Four months after BMC‚Äôs orders for requisitioning rooms in private buildings, lodges and hotels in Mumbai for setting up Covid care centres (CCCs), the civic body has returned almost 70% of them. The structures included sports complexes, marriage halls, hostels, and dormitories in possession of private parties that were lying vacant due to the lockdown. On April 1, the then civic chief Praveen Pardeshi said it had been found that many high- and low-risk contacts of patients in particular buildings and localities lived in small homes and used common sanitation facilities, thereby being vulnerable to infection. Hence, they needed to be shifted to CCCs to avoid viral spread. Last week, civic chief IS Chahal pointed out that 80% of new cases are from non-slum buildings. ‚ÄòNo need felt for keeping many CCCs operational‚ÄôA senior official from the civic public health department said the facilities were needed a few months ago when there was a huge number of Covid-19 cases especially from slums. ‚ÄúIt was impossible to ask those living in Mumbai's dense slums to isolate themselves in their homes and therefore they had to be quarantined in these facilities to break the viral chain. Following a decline in cases from slums, no need was felt for keeping these CCCs operational anymore,‚Äù he said. Civic wards which had the maximum number of CCC-1s are E (Byculla) with 21 (19 discontinued) and G North Dharavi) with 19 (11 discontinued).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/70-covid-centres-in-mumbai-shut-as-cases-down-in-slums/articleshow/77323586.cms||Richa Pinto

August 3, 2020||Chennai||Chennai to get third Miyawaki forest, in Mugalivakkam||CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has started work on developing a third Miyawaki forest in the city, in Alandur zone. Miyawaki method is a Japanese technique of growing different varieties of trees in a small patch of land using organic manure. Already two such forests have been created on small patches of land. The first one is besides the Kotturpuram MRTS station, falling in Adyar (zone 13). The second one is in Rayala Nagar in Valasaravakkam. While the one in Adyar has 2,000 saplings of 40 species of trees on around 20,000 square feet of land, the one in Valasaravakkam has more than 700 saplings of 45 different species on a 6,000 square-foot land. The one in Alandur zone will come up in Blooming Garden Road in ward 156 (Mugalivakkam) on a similar sized plot. There will be 2000 saplings in 35 cents of land. The trees are likely to create a dense foliage within two years. Regional deputy commissioner (south) Alby John visited the spot on Saturday and also planted a sapling. "Though the land was identified and we had prepared to plant it in early March, Covid-19 delayed the plans. However, after a good spell of rains, we decided to start the plantation and finish it in a week," Alby John said. In the Miyawaki scheme, trees are grown with a gap of 1 metre. Traditional tree varieties like Poongan, Peepal and Neem trees would be planted on this. Fruit-bearing trees would also be part of the forest, which would form a canopy. The Miyawaki system uses organic manure and soil for growing trees. In the process, soil would be dug up to four feet to plant the trees. Wet waste (converted to manure), coir, cow dung and other similar material is used as an organic manure. According to GCC's calculations, the 2,000 trees in Kotturpuram would consume 11.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide and give out four tonnes of oxygen in the first year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-to-get-third-miyawaki-forest-in-mugalivakkam/articleshow/77323620.cms||---

EESL MD Saurabh Kumar said the company has floated a new tender for 250 electric cars, and the Chinese company, which sells ‚ÄòZS‚Äô e-vehicle, has to fulfil the criteria to participate.

Police have registered a case under Section 304 A (causing death by negligence) against HSL, Anupam Industries and Green Fields Corporation. The massive iron structure crashed to the ground after the crane‚Äôs cabin and base snapped during a load trial run killing 10 people. Speaking to TOI, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Harbour sub-division, T Mohan Rao said that the death toll in the crane mishap was initially pegged as 11 on Saturday, however, the death toll could actually be 10. ‚ÄúOn Saturday, 10 bodies were recovered from the accident spot including half of a body. The other half of the body is still stuck under debris. As per our investigation, the death toll in the incident is 10. We have to match the bodies once the debris is cleared,‚Äù he added. HSL authorities have informed the police that HSL had placed a work order for supply, installation and commissioning of a 70-tonne capacity level Luffing Crane in May 2009 at a cost of Rs 17.75 crore. Gujarat-based Anupam Industries Ltd‚Äî an overhead crane maker‚Äî supplied the crane and completed installation in August 2017 and commenced the commissioning process. During commissioning, HSL authorities observed some technical deficiencies in the crane. Subsequently, HSL requested the vendor to fix the defects and undertake load trials, which was part of the scope of work. However, since August 12,2017, Anupam Industries did not attend to the work and the technical deficiencies in the crane remained unattended. Since load trials of the crane had not been completed, HSL did not use it and sent the vendor a performance notice. Despite the notice, Anupam Industries did not complete the work. Subsequently in October 2019, HSL outsourced the work to Visakhapatnam-based Green Fields Corporation which was supposed to finish the commissioning process and conduct load trials. Green Fields Corporation carried out the balance work and the liquidation of defects and commenced load testing of the crane. On August 1, when load testing was underway, the crane collapsed and fell on the north side of slipway 4 on the crane track. Speaking to TOI, K Durga Prasad, inspector of Malkapuram police station, said that preliminary investigation has shown negligence as cause of the major mishap. ‚ÄúWe have registered a case against Anupam Industries, Green Fields Corporation and some HSL officials under Section 304A,‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, HSL has constituted an internal committee headed by the director of operations. Visakhapatnam district collector V Vinay Chand has constituted an independent committee comprising heads of departments of civil, mechanical and electrical engineering departments of Andhra University Engineering College to probe the cause of the mishap. The committees will probe whether any human negligence caused the fatal mishap. Based on the reports filed by these committees, police will initiate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/hsl-mishap-initial-probe-finds-negligence-as-cause/articleshow/77320189.cms||Nalla.Babu

The 600-odd staff, including officials, security personnel, gardeners, sweepers, and dependents in the residential quarters, are in a state of panic. The Raj Bhavan campus is spread across 156 acre. "No one knows who the primary source is. It is a mystery," said a senior official in Raj Bhavan. A battalion of CRPF is stationed inside the campus for round-the-clock security. The first set of positive cases emerged from them, after some of them turned symptomatic 10 days ago. Health teams were roped in and testing was carried out among 147 people, and 84, including security and fire service staff, tested positive and were hospitalized in government-run Covid facilities in the city. Along with Tamil Nadu police posted at the entrance, the CRPF personnel take turns and work in shifts. They keep every nook and corner of the campus under surveillance -- from the main gate to staff gate, from Velachery gate to the forest area. "The governor takes a stroll in the morning," said a staff member. A canteen meant for CRPF is popular in the premises, and a staff from the public relation office in Raj Bhavan, who visited the canteen last week, is now undergoing treatment in a Covid facility in the premises of the King Institute of Preventive Medicine. Days later, a senior public relations officer tested positive and was hospitalized, sources said. There is regular Covid screening of people and vehicles at the staff gate. There is regular supply of vegetables, fruits and groceries through government agencies. A ration-shop is run to provide all necessary commodities, and there is an ATM and post office in the campus. Last week, three more members tested positive among 38 staff members, including a secretary to the governor. The testing continued for another set of 46 employees on Saturday afternoon. This time, the governor and his aide tested positive. After further tests at a private hospital on Sunday, Purohit returned home in the evening. "The governor's office is a stickler for Covid protocol. They strictly followed the protocol. The number is testimony to effective tracing of contacts," said an official. The special tours for tourists in Raj Bhavan have been cancelled till August 31, while 'At Home' event on August 15 in the premises is likely to be cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-once-considered-lung-space-raj-bhavan-is-now-a-covid-hotspot/articleshow/77323626.cms||Julie Mariappan

Rear Admiral (retired) LV Sarat Babu, chairman and managing director of HSL said that employment will be provided to eligible family members of the deceased on the basis of educational qualification. However, trade union activists and family members of the deceased demanded that HSL announce Rs 1 crore as ex-gratia. CITU activists alleged that safety workload procedures were not being followed at HSL and a majority of cranes are decades old. They demanded that the HSL management procure new cranes and comply with safety norms so that such accidents don‚Äôt recur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/rs-50l-compensation-for-kin-of-deceased/articleshow/77320200.cms||Nalla.Babu
August 3, 2020||Business||Indian parts makers gain as auto cos look outside China||CHENNAI: As global OEMs look for alternative sourcing to China, the Indian auto component supply chain has begun reaping early gains with parts makers saying that Japanese, South Korean and European companies started a ‚ÄòChina + 1‚Äô policy discreetly a couple of years ago. Amid the pandemic and the US-China spat, this process has now become ‚Äúless discreet and more rushed‚Äù. Already Indian auto component companies are getting orders and feelers from global OEMs. ‚ÄúThey are willing to offer bigger advance, help with setting up local plants in Europe as well as accept a slightly higher cost than China as long as the sub-parts are all made-in-India,‚Äù said Jayant Davar, co-chairman & MD of Sandhar Technologies, which started building a plant in Romania after the lockdown that will go into operation in 2 months. Others including Minda Group and Motherson Group are also handling renewed interest and orders from OEMs and tier-1 suppliers, looking to widen their sourcing base. ‚ÄúWe did Rs 400 crore in exports last year and in FY21 too we should do as much despite 2 months of lockdown. Already we are investing around Rs 60 crore in a new business line for a turbo charger company BorgWarner,‚Äù said Ashok Minda, chairman & group CEO, Minda Corporation. Auto component makers say this first trickle of global orders will improve once the new launch developments come in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indian-parts-makers-gain-as-auto-cos-look-outside-china/articleshow/77323630.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
August 3, 2020||Vijayawada||New board to govern AMRDA, chairperson yet to be named||Amaravati: The state government has notified the constitution of Amaravati Metro Region Development Authority (AMRDA) after governor Biswabhushan Harichandan endorsed the repeal of CRDA Act. The government also formed a new board for AMRDA which will manage assets and liabilities of the erstwhile CRDA. The government has, however, not named the chairperson of the newly-constituted board. While the chief minister was the CRDA chairperson, minister for municipal and urban development had held the position of vice-chairman. Sources said that the government might not name the CM as head of AMRDA as it is no more a prestigious organization like CRDA. It is being speculated that the government might appoint a legislator as chairperson of AMRDA with cabinet rank status. In the given situation, the CM is likely to head Visakhapatnam Metro Region Development Authority (VMRDA) as the focus of the state government will shift to Vizag after relocation of the executive capital city. The government has not renewed the term of Dronamraju Srinivas as chairman of VMRDA. He has held the position only for one year. ‚ÄúAs per the Section 3 (b) of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Act, 2020, the areas within the jurisdiction of AP Capital Region under the Principal Act (AP CRDA Act 2014-Act 11 of 2014), shall be deemed to be the area of the Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority,‚Äù said the government in the GO to notify AMRDA. The municipal administration department secretary has been made AMRDA deputy chairman while several officials including principal secretary of finance, district collectors of Krishna and Guntur, superintending engineers of R and B department in Krishna and Guntur, SE of CPDCL, director of town and country planning were made members. Erstwhile CRDA commissioner Lakshminarasimham has been made AMRDA commissioner through a separate GO. A member from environment department and experts of national or international repute who possess knowledge in urban governance, urban planning, conservation, environment and transportation would also be appointed as members of the governing council at a later date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/new-board-to-govern-amrda-chairperson-yet-to-be-named/articleshow/77320208.cms||Samdani MN

August 3, 2020||Visakhapatnam||Child trafficking case: Another Visakhapatnam hospital under scanner||VISAKHAPATNAM: Investigation into the child trafficking case linked to Universal Srusti Hospital has taken a twist in course of the weekend. Police now suspect a link between the accused and Padmaja Hospital at Seethammadhara. Police and medical teams searched the hospital on Saturday night and seized some documents. A week ago, MR Peta police arrested six people including Dr P Namrata, managing director of Universal Srusti Hospital and Dr Tirmala, an employee of the hospital, for allegedly selling off a baby to a Kolkata-based couple. In course of investigation, police have found that the group may have been involved in five other child trafficking cases. Searches were carried out at Universal Srusti Fertility and Research Centre on July 26 and documents were seized. The investigation revealed that Universal Srusti Hospital has performed a total of 56 deliveries till date and referred some deliveries to Padmaja Hospital in Seethammadhara, thereby linking the hospital to the case. Police have observed that the management of Padmaja Hospital has not maintained proper records. Speaking to TOI, DCP Aishwarya Rastogi said that the child trafficking case will require a wide investigation. ‚ÄúWe are investigating the case in multiple aspects to ascertain the number of babies sold. We will examine the seized documents and look into the alleged role of other hospitals in the case,‚Äù the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/child-trafficking-case-another-vizag-hospital-under-scanner/articleshow/77320227.cms||Nalla.Babu
August 3, 2020||Business||Tea Board ops rejig likely as Centre may repeal ‚Äòobsolete‚Äô Tea Act of ‚Äô53||Kolkata: The future of The Tea Board of India, the city-based iconic headquarters of the tea industry regulator, may soon come under question as the Centre has included The Tea Act, 1953, in the list of ‚Äúobsolete and redundant laws which have lost their significance‚Äù with a view to repeal them. The Tea Act, 1953 (No. 29 of 1953) was enacted by setting up the Tea Board. Sources close to the development told TOI that following the revocation of the Tea Act and other such Acts, all agricultural industry boards such as tea, rubber, coffee and spices may come under a single umbrella of an agri-products exports promotion council governed by the Union commerce ministry. The Centre is reviewing some of these ‚Äúarchaic and irrelevant‚Äù legislations and has asked for comments from respective government-run regulatory boards. In a July 7 letter to the Tea Board deputy chairman in Kolkata, the plantation division of the commerce ministry has sought his comments on the issue immediately. The executive director of the Rubber Board at Kottayam has also received a letter on the possible repealing of The Rubber Act, 1947. Reeta Vasistha, additional secretary at the Union ministry of law and justice, had issued a note in June saying that ‚Äú‚Ä¶one more Repealing and Amending Act would be tabled in the next session of the Parliament‚Äù. According to the current Tea Board chairman, the regulator could still serve as an export and domestic demand promotion council even if the Tea Act is repealed. P K Bezbaruah, the first non-IAS and non-executive chairman of the Board, told TOI: ‚ÄúTea Board has not been able to satisfy the expectations of its stakeholders for the last two years or so. Deficiencies such as pending subsidies to gardens, unsatisfied small tea growers (STG) due to the paltry aid, malfunction of pan-India e-auction system, phasing out of overseas promotion and little effort for domestic tea campaign have been blamed on ‚Äòlack of funds‚Äô by the board functionaries. So, either the Board should be given an adequate budgetary support, or its role should be reimagined.‚Äù Welcoming the possible change, a tea industry veteran explained that tea accounted for 40% of India‚Äôs exports in 1953 while it forms just 0.4% of the same today. ‚ÄúThe sector is a mix of agriculture and industry. There may be better ways of handling this dichotomy than to govern it through an archaic piece of legislation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPersonally speaking, the Tea Board could gradually metamorphose into a structure in which the agriculture part could be led by the ministry of agriculture, the consumer safety and quality by FSSAI, the internal demand and export aspects by a government-aided trade body such as EEPC,‚Äù added Bezbaruah, who is serving his second tenure as the chairman. Indian Tea Exporters‚Äô Association (ITEA) chairman Anshuman Kanoria, too, feels that the Tea Act indeed has become obsolete. ‚ÄúIn the last few decades, the attention has moved to the back end and without any budgetary support, export and generic promotion has been a casualty,‚Äù he said. Bijoygopal Chakraborty, the president of STG body Cista, said, ‚ÄúIf the Act is repealed, we will only seek a better, helpful and beneficial environment for the STGs, who produce over 50% of tea in India.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tea-board-ops-rejig-likely-as-centre-may-repeal-obsolete-tea-act-of-53/articleshow/77321417.cms||Sovon Manna
August 3, 2020||Vijayawada||BEE to study energy efficiency measures||Vijayawada: The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has selected Andhra Pradesh to conduct a study on energy efficiency measures in refractory industries. Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) making refractories in East and West Godavari districts have been chosen for the study. The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) will take up a detailed study in the refractory clusters. Detailed energy audits will be conducted by TERI by closely interacting with stakeholders, manufacturers and industry associations. This will help assess the areas of improvement for energy savings and to identify the scope for introducing latest technologies. TERI will bench mark the energy consumption in refractory clusters and help them introduce advanced global technologies in energy efficiency that are cost-effective and will help save energy. Director of BEE, Miling Deore, said in a webinar conducted with energy department officials on Sunday that they are going to conduct an energy audit in refractory clusters in two districts of Andhra Pradesh and one district in Jharkhand. The findings of the study will be utilised to develop a roadmap for making refractory sector energy efficient and environment-friendly, he said. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli thanked BEE and TERI for undertaking study in Andhra Pradesh. He assured all cooperation from the state government, which is keen on making cost-effective power available to its consumers. He urged BEE and TERI to focus on implementing new cutting-edge technologies as a way forward. He requested for recommendations in the form of suitable business models for wider adoption in MSME sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bee-to-study-energy-efficiency-measures/articleshow/77320237.cms||---

August 3, 2020||Business||Flipkart may consolidate Walmart‚Äôs wholesale operations||NEW DELHI: E-commerce giant Flipkart, which recently took over its US parent Walmart‚Äôs wholesale business in India, is exploring ways to consolidate its operations and this could include shutting down unviable ‚ÄúBest Price‚Äù stores or turning some of them into full-fledged warehouses with a greater focus on their e-commerce operations, sources said. The Bengaluru-headquartered company, in which Walmart bought 77% stake for $16 billion in 2018, is also in the process of relinquishing the space in Gurgaon used as headquarters by Walmart India, which runs 28 Best Price stores across India, with plans to relocate its employees to Bengaluru. ‚ÄúEmployees of the Walmart India team will transition to Flipkart Wholesale in January 2021. As part of the integration, we will be moving our operations to Bengaluru in the next fiscal. We will provide our employees with the necessary support to make this move,‚Äù a Flipkart Group spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThe Best Price cash and carry business will continue to serve its 1.5 million+ members via its omni-channel network of 28 stores and B2B e-commerce operations.

The deceased were identified as Ch Rohit (14) and G Vardhan (16), both were residents of the Gnanapuram area. A group of eight youngsters had gone to the beach to celebrate the birthday of one of them. After they entered the waters, two of them got caught in a current, which sucked them deeper into the sea. Seeing the plight of the two, the remaining friends raised an alarm. Although locals tried to rescue the youngsters, their efforts proved futile. The police, who were called in, immediately launched a search and rescue operation but the bodies could not be recovered before Sunday. The police have registered a case and shifted the bodies to a hospital for post mortem. The parents of the deceased said that their children had not informed them about their outing. Police have appealed to youngsters to not venture into the sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/bday-outing-2-teenagers-drown-at-sea/articleshow/77320256.cms||---
August 3, 2020||Business||Lithium ion cells, PCBs may get local manufacturing sops||NEW DELHI: After mobiles and basic & bulk drug manufacturing, the government is looking at incentive schemes for other sectors such as lithium ion batteries and printed circuit boards (PCBs). While the commerce and industry ministry is working on a plan to support the domestic production of several items, sources said the finance ministry is not in favour of offering the performance-linked incentives (PLIs) to products such as air-conditioners, furniture and segments of the textiles industry that several government agencies and industry bodies are demanding. Tightening the flow of funds, North Block has indicated that savings from the Merchandise Exports of India Scheme (MEIS), where it has capped the outgo at Rs 9,000 crore during April-December, can be used for incentivising domestic production of goods, which are currently being imported and widening the trade deficit. The outgo on MEIS was estimated at Rs 43,000 crore last year. The commerce and industry ministry has already put in place a blueprint for over a dozen industry groups, while starting work with industry captains on adding another eight sectors, including TV sets, CCTV equipment, set-top boxes, electric vehicle components, medical devices, sports & gym goods and lithium ion batteries. ‚ÄúThe idea is to focus on goods that are high technology and require value addition, instead of things like furniture which is run of the mill,‚Äù said a senior finance ministry officer. Incidentally, the finance ministry had opposed the performance-linked incentive scheme for mobile phones, questioning the need for an expenditure of around Rs 40,000 crore. It finally went through after the ministry of electronics and IT and NITI Aayog explained that the sops would create jobs and generate revenue in future. The proposals, put together, require large investment. For instance, to make India a large base of AC manufacturing, an investment of around Rs 1 lakh crore is required. Another officer said that the government recognises that there is a need to provide support to encourage domestic manufacturing, especially when imports from countries such as China were being discouraged. But the idea is to prioritise expenditure. Some of the initiatives, such as setting up of a footwear park, are being pursued by the private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lithium-ion-cells-pcbs-may-get-local-manufacturing-sops/articleshow/77323643.cms||Sidhartha
August 3, 2020||Mumbai||Locked-down home chefs in Mumbai turn idle time into swelling business||MUMBAI: When the Covid-19 lockdown was first announced in March, yeast ran out of stock in supermarkets and social media was flooded with beautifully plated chicken tandoori and banana bread, as everyone unleashed their inner ‚ÄòMasterchef ‚Äô. While the trend did not keep up with the multiple extensions to the lockdown, several Mumbaikars turned it into business to compliment income in in a time when jobs were being lost, or to fulfil a lifelong dream. ‚ÄúWith the lockdown, I had a lot of time at hand and business has been slow. Spending hours in my kitchen helped me deal with the anxiety the pandemic brought. I baked for friends and that‚Äôs when some of them suggested I try it out professionally. But, there are already a lot of home bakers so I wanted to make something that isn‚Äôt easily available in the city,‚Äù said Abhishek Thukral, a publicist who recently started selling his home-baked goodies as the ‚ÄúWhimsical Baker‚Äù on Instagram and Facebook. On his menu are Lemon Ricotta Cake and Torta Caprese (flourless chocolate cake), among other things. With hopes that the comfort and safety of a home-cooked meal might be preferred over commercial kitchens, the newbie chefs are learning about inventory, logistics and pricing. Bandra residents and motherdaughter duo Sabina Manekia (52) and Imaan Surve (23) started dishing out kebabs and kormas through their brand, MamaaMiya from their home kitchen in Bandra. ‚ÄúMy mom is a fashion designer and business was on a standstill during the lockdown, she was bored of doing nothing. She loves to cook and feed people and there was no better time to turn that into an opportunity. While mom cooks, I source ingredients, manage orders and coordinate deliveries,‚Äù said Surve who also is a media professional. MamaaMiya takes orders during the week and delivers through third party applications on weekends. For Hema Nakwe, kickstarting Hema‚Äôs Veg Rasoi in July from her Matunga (E) home with her husband Prashant, was both the realisation of a long-cherished dream as well as a necessity fuelled by pandemic-related job loss. Nakwe reminisced that the passion emerged when she was a four-year-old, helping her mother with minor tasks in the kitchen. The couple sets a weekly menu and the thalis usually comprise chapatis, a rice preparation, sabzis, pickle and the occasional appetizer or sweet. Papads are sourced from a local women‚Äôs entrepreneurial initiative. ‚ÄúWe source the ingredients ourselves and I make my own masalas. Due to the lockdown, certain items have become more expensive but we ensure that it is not reflected in the price of the thali,‚Äù she said. For now, patrons pick up their orders from the couple‚Äôs home. Existing home dining experiences are also reorganising themselves to home deliveries. Authenticook, which used to provide a home dining experience through 150 home cooks across the city, has now started providing takeaway meals through the same chefs. Co-founder Ameya Deshpande said it was a natural progression from the lockdown perspective. ‚ÄúThe thing to consider here is that what the home chef prepares for you as a consumer is also what they eat‚Äîunlike in a restaurant. This is what makes people a little more comfortable with home kitchens,‚Äù Deshpande said. Another key aspect was the fact that home cooks provide much more variety. Deshpande said that Authenticook does 50 odd regional and community based cuisines in Mumbai itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/locked-down-home-chefs-in-mumbai-turn-idle-time-into-swelling-business/articleshow/77323646.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
August 3, 2020||Mangaluru||Covid-19: In Karnataka's Dakshina Kannada, returnees account for less than 10% cases||MANGALURU: People returning to their homes from abroad have been largely blamed for the spurt in cases in Dakshina Kannada district, but it is an ill-founded assumption. Data which TOI has accessed shows international travellers account for fewer than 10% of the district‚Äôs Covid-19 tally of 6,010 cases. Moreover, the sharp slide in the number of flights being operated under Vande Bharat Mission has resulted in a corresponding decline in the number of people returning home from abroad. As on July 29, as many as 6,811 passengers returned to Dakshina Kannada, mostly from Gulf countries. But only 478 of them tested positive. Dakshina Kannada district health officer Dr Ramachandra Bairy said that, on average, until the end of June, nearly 25 passengers arriving by the Vande Bharat flights in Mangaluru tested positive. ‚ÄúBut this number gradually decreased to single digits after June. Also, not even a single traveller has died in the district so far,‚Äù Dr Bairy said. The DHO said that most returnees were taking utmost precautionary measures and were also being subjected to tests prior to their departure. ‚ÄúThe passengers returning home now are much more aware than their counterparts who arrived in the first and second phases in the immediate aftermath of the launch of the Vande Bharat Mission flights,‚Äù Dr Bairy added. Another official in the health department said that not a single passenger on board two flights that landed at the Mangaluru International Airport had tested positive for novel coronavirus. However, he was quick to add that this was not to be read as an indicator for a decline in the number of cases in the countries that the expatriates were returning from. He also added to the ordeal that officials at the airport had to endure each time the flights landed, from dealing with unruly passengers to ensuring the safety of pregnant women, children and elderly citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/covid-19-in-karnatakas-dakshina-kannada-returnees-account-for-less-than-10-cases/articleshow/77323649.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
August 3, 2020||Kolkata||West Bengal: Doctor‚Äôs call final in Covid patient‚Äôs admission, release||KOLKATA: Whether a Covid patient needs admission in a private-sector hospital or not will henceforth depend only on the decision of the examining doctor, without ‚Äúany extraneous consideration or recommendation‚Äù. Similarly, a Covid patient will have to move out of a hospital if the treating doctor feels so; the patient can, at most, insist on going to a safe house but will not be able to occupy a hospital bed under any circumstance once the doctor has given a verdict. The two directives are a part of several important orders issued by the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission that aim to free up private-sector hospital beds for Covid patients who need emergency treatment. The commission is a quasi-judicial body, and its advisories are binding on private establishments. With private hospitals running short of Covid beds, patients often have to wait to get admitted or hop from one hospital to another. Every day, a large number of patients are kept waiting either in the emergency or the triage area of various hospitals. ‚ÄúIf the number of waiting patients is more than the number of vacant beds, the doctor on duty would examine each patient and allot beds to the most deserving ones ignoring any extraneous considerations or recommendations. The decision of the doctor on duty will be final and binding upon all,‚Äù said an advisory from the commission. According to the advisory, the procedure will be the same for shifting a patient from the general bed to ICU or ITU. ‚ÄúWe have received the advisory; this will help streamline admissions to an extent and free up hospital beds. Some patients refuse to be discharged even after they are fit, more due to social concerns than anything else,‚Äù said Sudipto Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital. Even as the discharge guidelines have changed long back and a clinically fit patient can now be sent home even without testing negative, there are still instances where patients refused to go home without a confirmatory negative report.  ‚ÄúWe cannot throw out a patient if he/she refuses to go home despite doctor‚Äôs advice. Though the number of such patients is on the decline, even a single bed occupied by them is precious, due to the crisis. Therefore, this latest advisory will help us,‚Äù said an administrator of a hospital off EM Bypass. An official at another private hospital said a team from the health department had earlier come across two such clinically fit patients. ‚ÄúIn fact, we were accused of not discharging the two, whereas the duo had simply refused to leave, saying they did not have proper home isolation facilities,‚Äù said a source in the hospital. WBCERC chairperson Justice Ashim Kumar Banerjee has circulated the advisories through a WhatsApp group that includes hospital administrators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doctors-call-final-in-covid-patients-admission-release/articleshow/77323028.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
August 3, 2020||Ranchi||Durga Puja pandals to remain off limits for revellers this year||Ranchi: With cases of Covid-19 growing in Ranchi, the city‚Äôs prominent Durga Puja committees on Sunday unanimously agreed to keep the revelry low this year. Their pandals would be smaller in size and remain closed for public to avoid transmission the virus. Till Sunday morning, the district recorded 2,262 cases (highest in the state) of which 1,702 are active and 25 died of the virus. The Ranchi District Durga Puja Committee (RDDPC), the umbrella body of around 250 organisers of the state capital, also agreed upon a slew of measures with an aim to host a low-key celebration this year. Munchun Rai, president of Ranchi Railway Station Durga Puja Committee, said, ‚ÄúIt was agreed that no committee will allow visitors inside the pandals. However, keeping with the tradition, only priests will carry out the rituals. The pandals will not be extravagant this year and will be just enough to carry out the rituals.‚Äù Ashok Purohit, the president of RDDPC and chairman of Rajasthan Mitra Mandal Puja committee, said it was agreed that no pandal will be built and no idols above three feet will be worshipped. ‚ÄúThe decision has been taken to avoid physical contact during immersion. Bigger idols need more hands for immersion,‚Äù Purohit said. Many prominent puja committees, which also organise fairs alongside their pandals to draw crowd, will refrain from doing so this year. ‚ÄúNo vendors, rides and other makeshift shops will be allowed around the pandal premises. While visitors will not be allowed, revellers will not be allowed to offering pushpanjali,‚Äù Purohit said. While revellers will be barred, most of the city‚Äôs puja committees will take the online route. ‚ÄúVirtual tour of pandals and aarti will be arranged so that revellers can sit at home and be a part of the rituals,‚Äù a member of the Bakri Bazaar puja committee said. Purohit said RDDPC will formally intimate about their resolution to the district administration and the chief minister‚Äôs office soon. ‚ÄúA review of the situation will be done in September,‚Äù he added. This year, Durga Puja begins on October 22. As per estimates of RDDPC, the 250-odd puja committees spend around Rs 25 crore on an average every year for building their theme-based pandals, deities, lightings, decorations and other paraphernalia. Thousands of workmen from Jharkhand and neighbouring states work for weeks on these structures. During the five-day festivities, the fairs and other entertainment activities provide source of incomes for approximately 4,000 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/durga-puja-pandals-to-remain-off-limits-for-revellers-this-year/articleshow/77321855.cms||Dhritiman Ray
August 3, 2020||Ranchi||Pvt hosps cannot refuse patients with Covid symptoms: Dist admin||Ranchi: No private hospital in the city should refuse suspected Covid-19 patients and must make arrangements to treat them in isolation, the district administration said on Sunday, hinting that strict action might follow in case of non-compliance. The administration made the appeal to the private hospitals during a meeting to discuss means and ways to check the rising number of cases in the city. Seeking cooperation of the private hospitals to fight the growing number of infections and shortage of beds in government facilities, DC Chhavi Ranjan said, ‚ÄúPatients with various complaints go to private hospitals. If any of the patients showed Covid symptoms, the hospitals must not refuse admission to them but start treatment by following ICMR protocols. It is advised to get the patients tested but treatment should begin immediately.‚Äù The DC also hinted that the administration would be forced to take strict action if there is a complaint against any private hospital for refusing to treat patients on suspicion of Covid-19 infection. During the meeting, the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association agreed to extend full cooperation to the administration. President of the association, Dr Jogesh Gambhir, said, ‚ÄúThough it is difficult to maintain complete isolation in every nursing home, we have assured to work to the best of our capabilities.‚Äù Ranjan said the private healthcare facilities are allowed to charge fees from the patients and can discharge those who are unable to afford the cost but only after informing the district authorities so that they can be shifted to government facilities. Gambhir said incident commanders would take a call in such cases. As of date, there are around 90 private nursing homes in the capital with nearly 15 of them having proper facilities to treat Covid patients. Representatives of the association suggested that the sadar hospital should be used to treat asymptomatic patients. ‚ÄúEven if all private facilities are taken into consideration, hardly 150-200 additional beds could be added . However, sadar hospital, which is centrally located and has 500 beds can be turned into a dedicated Covid care centre,‚Äù Gambhir added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pvt-hosps-cannot-refuse-patients-with-covid-symptoms-dist-admin/articleshow/77321700.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
August 3, 2020||Kolkata||In touch with Shah, MPs from Bengal self-isolate||Kolkata: At least two BJP lawmakers from West Bengal, who were to attend the Ram temple ‚Äúbhumi pujan‚Äù in Ayodhya on August 5, dropped the plan after Union home minister Amit Shah tested Covid-19 positive. A few more MPs from the state, who had met Shah over the past few days, decided to go into isolation. Governor Jagdeep Dhankar had gone into self-quarantine on returning from New Delhi after meeting Shah on July 20. Dhankhar had tested negative for Covid-19 on July 24. ‚ÄúResult Covid Negative. In good sound health,‚Äù he tweeted on Sunday. Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta and Union ministers Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri had met Shah on July 20 and sought his intervention in the Chopra incident that had sparked unrest in the area. ‚ÄúI will stay in isolation. But my meetings and seminars on the virtual platforms will continue,‚Äù Dasgupta said. Supriyo, who met Shah also a day back, too has gone into isolation. ‚ÄúI am advised by my doctors to confine myself away from my family members for the next few days. A test will be done soon,‚Äù he tweeted. Chaudhuri said ‚Äúwe met Amitji around 13 days back. It seems I will however keep myself confined to my house for the next few days‚Äù. Darjeeling MP Raju Bista, who was part of the delegation that met Shah regarding the Chopra incident, said he would go for a test on Monday. ‚ÄúI had a meeting scheduled with Amitji on Tuesday. That is postponed now.‚Äù MPs Saumitra Khan and Nisith Pramanik had met Shah a few days back and submitted a memorandum on the Covid-19 situation in Bengal. ‚ÄúAmitji has mild Covid-19, and we are following the health ministry protocol and putting ourselves in isolation. I will go for the swab test tomorrow and wait for the result,‚Äù said Pramanik, the Cooch Behar MP, who is in New Delhi now. He was scheduled to leave for Ayodhya on Monday to attend the ground-breaking ceremony. Khan too dropped his Ayodhya plan. ‚ÄúEven if I have not tested positive in the first test, I cannot take chances as a lot of people will be attending the ceremony. It is a question of their safety as well,‚Äù he said. Khan called up his associates and cancelled all programmes for the next one week. ‚ÄúI have been moving from one district to another in the past few months. I come in touch with many during the day, but I try to maintain hygiene and social distance,‚Äù the MP said. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted to wish Shah a speedy recovery immediately after the home minister revealed he had tested Covid-positive. ‚ÄúWishing him speedy recovery.

August 3, 2020||Kolkata||Kolkata: Plasma therapy trial at Beliaghata ID Hospital shows ‚Äòpromising‚Äô results||KOLKATA: The randomised controlled trial (RCT) on plasma therapy in treating Covid-19 patients in Bengal has thrown up encouraging results. According to an interim report on the trial taking place at the Beliaghata ID Hospital, patients who received plasma had better treatment outcomes than those who did not. While researchers cautioned against drawing conclusions from this provisional report, they remained hopeful. ‚ÄúGoing by the initial report of the RCT, the outcome of the plasma therapy appears promising,‚Äù said public health specialist Abhijit Chowdhury, a senior doctor who‚Äôs the head of hepatology at SSKM Hospital‚Äôs School of Digestive and Liver Diseases, who‚Äôs also on the state government‚Äôs panel of experts on Covid. The provisional report ‚Äî on the basis of the treatment outcomes on 10 patients who received plasma therapy ‚Äî has been submitted to the West Bengal Health department as well as the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR). Dipyaman Ganguly, the trial‚Äôs principal investigator, said the progress of these 10 patients was carefully matched against those who received standard therapy (the control group). ‚ÄúThere was a discernibly better outcome, compared to standard therapy given to the control group. Even as the result so far has been encouraging, this report is based on 10 plasma transfusions, so the data is very preliminary. The final assessment will be done only after we achieve 40 transfusions,‚Äù said Ganguly, an associate professor at the Translational Research Unit of Excellence of Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. ‚ÄúThe trial is certainly helping a cluster of patients, while some patients are not responding to plasma therapy,‚Äù said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray, an assistant professor at the School of Tropical Medicine Kolkata, who‚Äôs a clinical investigator in the trial, and a member of the core Covid team at the ID Hospital. ‚ÄúAs the trial progresses, we will be studying the immunological parameters of both categories of patients to analyse why it worked in some patients and why it did not in others.‚Äù Ray said that finding the reasons ‚Äî why some patients are responding to the treatment, while others are not ‚Äî and correlating it with immunological parameters could play a key role in framing policy guidelines on plasma therapy. ‚ÄúIf we can zero in on the cluster of patients who are responding well to the treatment, it could be helpful in guidelines regarding the category of patients who could benefit from the therapy,‚Äù he said. The clinical trial on passive immunization using convalescent plasma is a joint initiative of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research and the West Bengal government. Fully funded and supported by CSIR, the trial is taking place in the Covid ward of the ID Hospital. Unlike other clinical therapy trials elsewhere in the country, which are on mildly affected patients, the trial in Kolkata is on adult patients who have both mild and moderate ARDS (acute respiratory disease syndrome). Patients who have received the therapy include those with co-morbidities like aplastic anaemia and kidney failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plasma-therapy-trial-at-beliaghata-id-hosp-shows-promising-results/articleshow/77323035.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

August 3, 2020||Hyderabad||Homemade rakhis, handmade gifts and virtual rituals: Siblings find creative ways to celebrate Raksha Bandhan||Festivals are usually the time when we get together with our loved ones to meet, greet, relive old memories and create new ones. But the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way we celebrate festivals. With social distancing measures, lockdown rules and travel restrictions still in place, people have had to come up with innovative ideas to celebrate Raksha Bandhan this year. Rakhis made at home are safe and a fun family activity For many sisters, the hunt for the perfect rakhi begins weeks before Raksha Bandhan. Sushmita Goud, an engineering student in Narsingi says, ‚ÄúEvery year, I send a rakhi to my brother who works in Bengaluru after searching for the perfect rakhi for days on end. This time,I decided to make a rakhi myself. Since my college is closed, I had ample time to watch DIY videos and I made a pearl rakhi. I just hope my brother doesn‚Äôt lose it like he does every year.‚Äù  Parents are also encouraging their little ones to create rakhis at home as it is risky to step out at this time. Latha Sen from Gachibowli says, ‚ÄúTo keep my kids engaged during the lockdown, I have been teaching them how to make vases, toys etc. with clay. For Raksha Bandhan, I asked my five-year-old daughter to make a rakhi for her brother with clay. She made the rakhi and I coloured it. As brothers are supposed to give a gift to their sisters on Raksha Bandhan, my son made a flower vase for his sister.‚Äù Celebrating the festival virtually With many siblings stuck in different cities or continents, Raksha Bandhan celebrations will take place on video calls. Magunta Vandana, an IT employee in Hydernagar says, ‚ÄúMy brother, who works in Kakinada, always comes home for Raksha Bandhan but since itis a containment zone now, it is impossible for him to travel. So I decided to celebrate the festival over video call. I will show him the rakhi on screen and ask him to eat a piece of chocolate or sweet if he has any at his place. Once things get better, I‚Äôll make sure to collect my gift from him.‚Äù  Most brothers are also excited thinking about what‚Äôs in store for them this Raksha Bandhan. Saket Sinha from Ranchi who stays in Resham Bagh says, ‚ÄúMy sister recently informed me that she was unable to send the rakhi so I told her that I won‚Äôt be getting any gifts for her. But she is not the one to give up so easily. She came up with a plan to celebrate Raksha Bandhan virtually and I am excited to see how it pans out. Seems like you can never escape buying gifts for your sister, even in the middle of a pandemic.‚Äù||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/homemade-rakhis-handmade-gifts-and-virtual-rituals-siblings-find-creative-ways-to-celebrate-raksha-bandhan/articleshow/77321351.cms||Thadhagath Pathi

The Jamshedpur Sporting Association (JSA), which regularly conducts football tournaments in the city, said that it would appeal to the football enthusiasts, in particular, to refrain from organising or participating any sporting events now. ‚ÄúOn Monday, we will issue a public appeal to the sportspersons and the sports bodies,‚Äù said JSA functionary Mohamed Zubair Alam. In the wake of a steep rise in the number of Covid-19 cases where 1,358 people were infected (till Sunday morning), the police and municipal officials are working in coordination to conduct surprise inspections in sports grounds to take action against the rule violators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/despite-admin-appeal-sporting-activities-continue-unabated-in-steel-city/articleshow/77321648.cms||---
