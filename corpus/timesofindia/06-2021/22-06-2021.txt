The case doesn't decide whether students can be paid salaries. Instead, the ruling will help determine whether schools decide to offer athletes tens of thousands of dollars in education benefits for things including tutoring, study abroad programs and graduate scholarships.  The high court said that NCAA limits on the education-related benefits that colleges can offer athletes who play Division I basketball and football violate antitrust laws.  Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court that the NCAA sought "immunity from the normal operation of the antitrust laws." And he said that allowing colleges and universities to offer "enhanced education-related benefits ... may encourage scholastic achievement and allow student-athletes a measure of compensation more consistent with the value they bring to their schools."  Under current NCAA rules, students cannot be paid, and the scholarship money colleges can offer is capped at the cost of attending the school. The NCAA had defended its rules as necessary to preserve the amateur nature of college sports.  But the former athletes who brought the case, including former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston, argued that the NCAA's rules on education-related compensation were unfair and violated federal antitrust law designed to promote competition. The Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling barring the NCAA from enforcing those rules.  As a result of the ruling, the NCAA itself can't bar schools from sweetening their offers to Division I basketball and football players with additional education-related benefits. But individual athletic conferences can still set limits if they choose.  "It is our hope that this victory in the battle for college athletes' rights will carry on a wave of justice uplifting further aspects of athlete compensation," said Steve Berman, an attorney for the former college athletes, in a statement following the ruling. "This is the fair treatment college athletes deserve."  The NCAA had argued that a ruling for the athletes could lead to a blurring of the line between college and professional sports, with colleges trying to lure talented athletes by offering over-the-top education benefits worth thousands of dollars. Even without the court's ruling, however, changes seem on the way for how college athletes are compensated. The NCAA has been working to amend its rules to allow athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses, frequently abbreviated NIL. That would allow athletes to earn money for things like sponsorship deals, online endorsement and personal appearances. For some athletes, those amounts could dwarf any education-related benefits.  "Even though the decision does not directly address name, image and likeness, the NCAA remains committed to supporting NIL benefits for student-athletes," NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement following the ruling. "Additionally, we remain committed to working with Congress to chart a path forward, which is a point the Supreme Court expressly stated in its ruling."  The players associations of the NFL, the NBA and the WNBA had all urged the justices to side with the ex-athletes, as did the Biden administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/high-court-sides-with-ex-athletes-in-ncaa-compensation-case/articleshow/83728621.cms||---
---||World||EU, US, UK, Canada join forces to slap sanctions on Belarus||BRUSSELS: The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada joined forces Monday to impose sanctions on several senior officials in Belarus over the forced diversion to Minsk of a passenger plane travelling between two EU countries last month.  Asset freezes and travel bans were also imposed on a number of officials linked to the security crackdown that continues to rock the country some 10 months after President Alexander Lukashenko was returned to power in elections branded by the EU and others as "fraudulent."  "We are united in our deep concern regarding the Lukashenko regime's continuing attacks on human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law," the four said in a joint statement.  "We are committed to support the long-suppressed democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus and we stand together to impose costs on the regime for its blatant disregard of international commitments," they said.  The EU hit seven people and one entity over the "forced and unlawful" landing of the Ryanair plane, which was traveling from Greece to Lithuania when it was ordered to stop in Minsk, where authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a dissident journalist who was one of the passengers.  The four called on Minsk to cooperate with an international probe into the incident, immediately release all political prisoners, and "enter into a comprehensive and genuine political dialogue" with the democratic opposition and civil society.  Among those targeted by the United States were close Lukashenko associates, those accused of helping to violently suppress peaceful protests since last year and others alleged to have orchestrated fraud during the elections.  At a meeting in Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers also prepared a series of economic measures that are aimed at hitting Lukashenko and his allies. EU leaders are expected to endorse them at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.  The EU has gradually ratcheted up sanctions since Lukashenko - dubbed the last dictator in Europe - won a sixth term last August.  But the 27-nation bloc has taken a harder approach since the Ryanair incident, and over the country's alleged use of migrants to pressure neighboring Lithuania, which has provided a safe-haven to Belarusian opposition figures and is one of Lukashenko's most vocal critics.  Among their actions Monday, the ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 78 Belarus officials and froze the assets of 8 "entities," which are usually companies, banks, or associations. It means that a total of 166 people and 15 entities are now under EU restrictive measures.  "This decision was made in view of the escalation of serious human rights violations in Belarus and the violent repression of civil society, democratic opposition and journalists," a statement said.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who chaired the meeting, said the economic sanctions "are going to hurt ... the economy of Belarus heavily."  The measures are likely to include action against the export of potash - a common fertilizer ingredient - tobacco industry exports and petroleum products, among others.  "We will no longer just sanction individuals. We will now also impose sectoral sanctions -- meaning that we will now get to work on the economic areas that are of particular significance for Belarus and for the regime's income," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.  "We want to make very, very clear to Lukashenko that there is no going back," Maas said.  Maas said the 27 EU countries stand united on sanctions "We are really very, very determined not to budge, not just today -- nothing about this will change in the coming weeks and months," he said.  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said EU countries had thought only a month ago that it still might be possible to reason with Lukashenko but that "the mood is different now."  Landsbergis accused Minsk of "weaponizing" migration flows. He said around 500 people are sheltering in Lithuania, most from Iraq, and that Belarus border guards brought 30 refugees to the border in recent days. He said Lithuania has limited capacity for them and is building a tent camp.  Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger who fled Belarus after the vote, welcomed the new measures, saying that "the EU and the entire civilized world have set a goal to stop Lukashenko and the escalation of violence."  "The EU sanctions would raise not only external, but also internal pressure on Lukashenko ... and will make it more costly for his main sponsor, the Kremlin, to maintain the Belarusian regime," she said.  Tsikhanouskaya said the Ryanair incident shows that "Lukashenko's regime has become a threat not only to citizens of Belarus but also to international security."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/eu-us-uk-canada-join-forces-to-slap-sanctions-on-belarus/articleshow/83729708.cms||---
---||Goa||GOA EXPRESS||On November 30, 1985, when Goa made their debut in the Ranji Trophy cricket tournament, there was nervousness in the air. Goa were playing at home in Vasco and didn’t know what to expect against visiting Kerala. The start of the three-day encounter wasn’t encouraging. Goa lost their first six wickets for a mere 81 runs on the board, bringing Sharad Pednekar to the crease. Born in Bombay, now Mumbai, Pednekar had carved a reputation for himself as a top-notch fast bowler who rubbed shoulders with many of the greats. But here, as Suresh Mahadevan watched from the other end, he had to put his batting skills to use and save Goa the embarrassment. Pednekar ended up scoring 40 runs, the highest for Goa in their first innings score of 188 (Namdev Phadte scored 72 of the 153 runs in the second). He also grabbed three wickets in the first innings to emerge as the most successful player on the state’s debut. For someone who generated so much speed and showed so much promise when he was still in his early twenties, it’s surprising that Pednekar played just 15 first class games. He quit quite unexpectedly with 38 wickets –best of 4 for 51 against Karnataka -- at an average of 28.78 after just three years. “Maybe I should have continued playing,” says Pednekar, now 60 and leading a retired life in the city. “At the time, there was hardly any incentive for playing cricket. We got paid almost nothing. In fact we had to pay from our pockets. I also thought it was better to make way for youngsters.” Cricket in the eighties, as Pednekar reminds us, wasn’t really a well-paying sport. Players got paid Rs 140 for a three-day game and Rs 20 as pocket allowance. It’s a different world now with Rs 1.4 lakh on offer for each game in the Ranji Trophy. No wonder nobody thinks like Pednekar and steps aside at the height of their game. That Pednekar had real talent was never in doubt. Having represented Podder College in Mumbai, which has produced the likes of Dilip Vengsarkar, Ravi Shastri and Sanjay Manjrekar, he was among the known faces. But the city was teeming with so much talent that it would take only something special to make it to the top. Around the same time, Goa were pencilled to make their debut in the Ranji Trophy and he chose to return home. “Goa were in the south zone, which was clearly the strongest in the country. We had to play against Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, all teeming with top-notch players. It was very challenging,” says Pednekar. Whenever he bowled, he put his heart into it. He was marked as the dangerman by most opponents with former India captain Kris Srikkanth once telling his teammates at the Panjim Gymkhana ground, “don't take any chances against Pednekar.” Interestingly, Srikkanth himself took a chance with the first ball which he drove back to the bowler, but Pednekar dropped the catch. “I wasn’t expecting it,” he says. When opportunities were there for the taking against big names, Pednekar, however, grabbed it with both hands. His wickets include, amongst other greats, Gundappa Viswanath, Brijesh Patel, Sadanand Viswanath, Sandeep Patil, Sanjay Manjrekar, Eknath Solkar and his all-time favourite Mohammed Azharuddin. “Azhar was a treat to bowl. He was a different kind of a batsman, not your regular player. He was artistic. If you bowl an out-swinger, he could still flick you to the midwicket boundary. You had to use your brains to get him out. You had to innovate. Azhar’s wicket was always priceless,” says Pednekar, who has been the state’s chief selector in the past. Pednekar came up with consistent performances at the national level but never managed to catch the eye of selectors. “We didn’t have officials who could make a case for us,” he says. “If Goa had some representation, like say a Chetan Desai or Vinod Phadke (both influential Goa Cricket Association officials), it would have been a different story.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-express/articleshow/83729936.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The baby Hawaiian bobtail squid were raised at the University of Hawaii's Kewalo Marine Laboratory and were blasted into space earlier this month on a SpaceX resupply mission to the International Space Station.  Researcher Jamie Foster, who completed her doctorate at the University of Hawaii, is studying how spaceflight affects the squid in hopes of bolstering human health during long space missions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Monday.  The squid have a symbiotic relationship with natural bacteria that help regulate their bioluminescence.  When astronauts are in low gravity their body's relationship with microbes changes, said University of Hawaii professor Margaret McFall-Ngai, who Foster studied under in the 1990s.  "We have found that the symbiosis of humans with their microbes is perturbed in microgravity, and Jamie has shown that is true in squid," said McFall-Ngai. "And, because it's a simple system, she can get to the bottom of what's going wrong."  Foster is now a Florida professor and principal investigator for a NASA program that researches how microgravity affects the interactions between animals and microbes.  "As astronauts spend more and more time in space, their immune systems become what's called dysregulated. It doesn't function as well," Foster said. "Their immune systems don't recognize bacteria as easily. They sometimes get sick."  Foster said understanding what happens to the squid in space could help solve health problems that astronauts face.  "There are aspects of the immune system that just don't work properly under long-duration spaceflights," she said. "If humans want to spend time on the moon or Mars, we have to solve health problems to get them there safely."  The Kewalo Marine Laboratory breeds the squid for research projects around the world. The tiny animals are plentiful in Hawaiian waters and are about 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) long as adults.  The squid will come back to Earth in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nasa-sends-squid-from-hawaii-into-space-for-research/articleshow/83730551.cms||---

"Our Iran policy is designed to advance US interests and that is regardless of who is chosen as Iran's president in a ... process that we consider to be pretty manufactured. This was not a free and fair election process," Price told reporters in a telephone briefing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-views-election-of-irans-raisi-as-pretty-manufactured/articleshow/83730176.cms||---

In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the board said the result, on the basis of its assessment policy, will be declared by July-end, after which it will provide online facility for registration for the optional examination for those students who are not satisfied with their results. It, however, said the examination will be conducted only in the main subjects and "the marks obtained by a candidate in this examination will be treated as final". It said policy for tabulation of marks for Class 12 board examination has been formulated by CBSE to ensure standardisation of marks, as marks of Class 11 and 12 component will be awarded at school level and, therefore, they will strictly not be comparable across schools. "Therefore, to ensure standardisation, each school will have to internally moderate the marks to account for school level variations by using a reliable reference standard. This is necessary in the interest of fairness and to ensure that the marks allocated are comparable and there is no adverse impact or undue gain for any student," the affidavit said. As some parents opposed cancellation of the board examination and pleaded that it could be conducted in view of the Covid-19 pandemic being under control, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said it would hear their plea also. The bench said it had, in principle, approved decision of CBSE and ICSE to cancel the examinations but it would hear the opposite views also and pass a final order. As various other petitions have also been filed in SC for cancellation of examinations conducted by state boards, the bench asked all states to make their stand clear on Tuesday when it will take up the case for final hearing. It said the issue needed to be adjudicated within a week to end uncertainty. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for petitioner, told the bench that there was no uniformity in the assessment policy of CBSE and ICSE and the court should intervene to ensure that the same policy was followed by all boards which did not want to conduct examination. Assuring that the court will examine all the issues, including the plea for uniform assessment policy, the bench directed that all petitions filed in the apex court on board examination be listed on June 22 and it will hear the views of all the petitioners before passing a final order. CBSE said disputes regarding computation of results will be referred to a committee constituted by it.

Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a recreation center in Pittsburgh as part of a broader push to promote the program in partnership with churches, schools and other organizations.  "When more families know about how they can get the relief, that is how we will be able to lift our children out of poverty," Harris said.  The administration has launched the website with details for potential recipients. As part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, eligible families can receive as much as $3,600 for each child under the age of 6. The tax credit will be $3,000 annually per child between the ages of 6 and 17.  The payments are to be made monthly, a first for the program. People can register for the program even if they did not fully file their taxes.  The program is slated to expire after one year, though Biden has proposed extending it through 2025 with the ultimate goal of making it permanent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-launches-public-push-for-child-tax-credit/articleshow/83731575.cms||---

The study analysed 548 participants (aged 1 to 17) who were split into two groups - those who have tested positive for Covid (via RT-PCR) and those who haven't. Researchers found the MCVs had vaccine effectiveness of 87.5% against SARS-CoV-2 and that vaccinated participants had less severe Covid symptoms than the unvaccinated. The Pune findings support a much-discussed hypothesis that children are fairly protected against SARS-CoV-2 because of 'non-specific immunity' following inoculation with live attenuated vaccines, including measles-containing vaccines (MCVs) and the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) shot. The measles vaccine has been part of India's universal immunisation programme for the last 36 years. The research was published in the peer-reviewed international journal, Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics, this month. The researchers said although their findings are encouraging, larger trials would be needed before a definitive conclusion can be made. "The results of our study indicate that MCVs can be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed further through prospective randomised clinical trials," said paediatrician Nilesh Gujar, the study's lead investigator. The measles vaccine is given at 9 months and 15 months. In 2018, the Union government launched a campaign to cover children under 18 who had not received the vaccine at these ages. The children enrolled in the Pune study had documented evidence of vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/measles-vax-effective-in-kids-against-covid-study/articleshow/83731498.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||India||Covid vaccination: India's total doses per 100 is 19.6 against UK’s 108.7||India's vaccination record till date has been middling among the world's 30 most populous countries with a rank 16 among them in terms of doses per 100 population. At 19.6 as of June 19, India's level is less than a fifth of what the UK has achieved but several times what many Asian and African countries have. The rank remains 16 among these 30 countries even if we were to consider the proportion of the population fully vaccinated, but in this case the gulf between the UK (45.8%) and India (3.6%) is considerably wider. What is more a matter of concern is that the countries ranking below India on this chart - all from Asia or Africa barring Ukraine - have been significantly less badly hit by the pandemic as their cases and deaths per million show. The only countries among these 30 with lower vaccination levels that have been hit harder are Iran and Ukraine. Conversely, among those with higher vaccination levels, almost all have seen a much higher level of cases and deaths per million than India; China, South Korea and Japan being the exceptions. The data from ourworldindata.org tracks both the number of people given the first dose and those that have been fully vaccinated. In the case of China, this break-up is not available, but with over a billion or 100 crore doses administered in that country, at least half that number, that is 500 million people or roughly 36% of the population, would have received the first shot. Those above India on this chart are not all developed countries. From the developing world, China, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico and Columbia, all have provided shots to a larger proportion of their populations. Each of them has also fully vaccinated a bigger chunk of its population than India. Vaccination in India has been constrained by supplies but is expected to improve, particularly from August. Whether that will be in time to prevent or minimise a third wave of Covid-19 is another matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-vaccination-indias-total-doses-per-100-is-19-6-against-uks-108-7/articleshow/83732455.cms||---
---||World||Iran's Ebrahim Raisi backs nuclear talks, rules out meeting Joe Biden||DUBAI/WASHINGTON: Iranian President-elect Ebrahim Raisi on Monday backed talks between Iran and six world powers to revive a 2015 nuclear deal but flatly rejected meeting US President Joe Biden, even if Washington removed all sanctions.  In his first news conference since winning Friday's presidential election, the hardline judge said his foreign policy priority would be improving ties with Iran's Gulf Arab neighbours, while calling on Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia to immediately halt its intervention in Yemen.  Raisi, 60, a strident critic of the West, will take over from pragmatist Hassan Rouhani on Aug. 3 as Iran seeks to salvage the tattered nuclear deal and be rid of punishing US sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.  "We support the negotiations that guarantee our national interests. ... America should immediately return to the deal and fulfil its obligations under the deal," said Raisi, who is himself under US sanctions.  Negotiations have been under way in Vienna since April to work out how Iran and the United States can both return to compliance with the nuclear pact, which Washington abandoned in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump before reimposing sanctions on Iran.  Iran has subsequently breached the deal's limits on enrichment of uranium, designed to minimise the risk of it developing nuclear weapons potential. Tehran has long denied having any such ambition.  Raisi said Iran's foreign policy would not be limited to the nuclear deal, adding that "all US sanctions must be lifted and verified by Tehran".  Iranian and Western officials alike say Raisi's rise is unlikely to alter Iran's negotiating stance in talks to revive the nuclear deal. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say on all major policy.  Asked if he would meet Biden if those sanctions were lifted, Raisi answered: "No." White House response  The White House downplayed Raisi's influence, saying no meeting was planned and that Khamenei was the real decision maker in Tehran.  "We don't currently have any diplomatic relations with Iran or any plans to meet at the leader level," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. "Our view is that the decision maker here is the supreme leader."  The U.S. State Department said it regarded the process that elected Raisi as "pretty manufactured" and expected the Vienna nuclear talks to resume "in the coming days."  Raisi secured victory as expected in the election after a contest marked by voter apathy over economic hardships and political restrictions.  He is under US sanctions over a past that includes what the United States and human rights groups say was his involvement in the extrajudicial killing of thousands of political prisoners in the Islamic Republic in 1988.  When asked about human rights groups' allegations that he was involved in the killings, he said: "If a judge, a prosecutor has defended the security of the people, he should be praised."  "I am proud to have defended human rights in every position I have held so far," Raisi said.  The White House said it would keep human rights on the table following negotiations on the nuclear deal. Psaki declined to predict when or if a deal would be reached, adding that officials are "looking forward to seeing where that goes."  Gulf Arab states have said it would be dangerous to separate the nuclear pact from Iran's missile programme and "destabilising" behaviour in the Middle East, where Tehran and Riyadh have fought decades of proxy wars, in countries from Yemen to Iraq.  Echoing Khamenei's stance, Raisi said Iran's "regional activities and ballistic missile programme" were non-negotiable.  A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 after Iran-backed Houthi forces drove its government out of the capital, Sanaa. The conflict has been largely stalemated for several years.  "They (the United States) did not comply with the previous agreement. How do they want to enter into new discussions?" Raisi said.  Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran, which severed ties in 2016, began direct talks in Iraq in April aimed at containing tensions. "The reopening of the Saudi Embassy is not a problem for Iran," said Raisi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/irans-ebrahim-raisi-backs-nuclear-talks-rules-out-meeting-joe-biden/articleshow/83732680.cms||---
---||World||In Senate vote, Biden sees 'step forward' for elections bill||WASHINGTON: The White House said Monday it views the Senate's work on an elections bill overhaul and changes being offered by Sen. Joe Manchin as a "step forward," even though the Democrats' priority legislation is expected to be blocked by a Republican filibuster. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the revisions proposed by Manchin are a compromise, another step as Democrats work to shore up voting access and what President Joe Biden sees as "a fight of his presidency." "The president's effort to continue that fight doesn't stop tomorrow at all," Psaki said. The Senate is preparing for a showdown Tuesday, a test vote of the For the People Act, a sweeping elections bill that would be the largest overhaul of US voting procedures in a generation. A top priority for Democrats seeking to ensure access to the polls and mail in ballots made popular during the pandemic, it is a opposed by Republicans as a federal overreach into state systems. Manchin had been the sole holdout among Democrats in the Senate, declining to back his party's bill. But late last week the West Virginian aired a list of proposed changes that are being well received by his party, and a nod from the White House will give them currency. He has suggested adding a national voter ID requirement, which has been popular among Republicans, and dropping other measures from the bill like its proposed public financing of campaigns. Among voting rights advocates, one key voice, Democrat Stacey Abrams, has said she could support Manchin's proposal. Ahead of Tuesday's vote, it is clear Democrats in the split 50-50 Senate will be unable to open debate, blocked by a filibuster by Republicans. In the Senate, it takes 60 votes to overcome the filibuster, and without any Republican support, the Democrats cannot move forward. "Will the Republicans let us debate it?" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as he opened the chamber Monday. "We're about to find out." The Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has said no Republican will support the bill, calling the legislation a "partisan power grab" that would erode local control of elections. While some Democrats want to change the filibuster rules to push the elections bill through, Manchin and other senators are opposed to taking that next move. Psaki said the administration's hope is that the chamber's 50 Democrats are aligned and that an unsuccessful vote will prompt the search for a new path. The White House didn't give its full support to the Manchin alternative. But Psaki said the president "is appreciative of the efforts by Senator Manchin and others to continue to make progress on voting rights which he feels is a huge priority." The sweeping voting reform bill is taking on fresh urgency as former President Donald Trump continues to challenge the outcome of the 2020 election, and is urging on Republican-led states that are imposing new voting rules in the states. State officials who certified the results of the 2020 election have dismissed Trump's false claims of voter fraud, and judges across the country who have dismissed multiple lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies. Trump's own attorney general said at the time there was no evidence of widespread fraud that would change the outcome. The changes being put in place in many of the Republican states are being decried by voting rights advocates who argue the restrictions will make it more difficult for people to cast ballots, particularly minority residents in cities who tend to support Democrats. As the Senate action churns, more changes could be coming to the bill. Democrats want to protect against intimidation at the polls in the aftermath of the 2020 election. They propose enhancing penalties for those who would threaten or intimidate election workers and creating a "buffer zone'' between election workers and poll watchers, among other possible changes. Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., a lead sponsor of the bill, said the effort underway is to "respond to the growing threat of election subversion in GOP-led states across the country."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/in-senate-vote-biden-sees-step-forward-for-elections-bill/articleshow/83732852.cms||---

Shawn Michael Chock, 35, fled the crash Saturday in Show Low, which is about a three-hour drive northeast of Phoenix, and was shot by police as they chased him, said Kristine Sleighter, a police spokeswoman. Chock, who lives in nearby White Mountain Lakes, is still hospitalized in stable condition, and authorities were trying to determine a motive for the crash.  Prosecutors have been working with police investigators, but Navajo County Attorney Bradley Carlyon said his office typically does not charge hospitalized suspects until they are discharged.  Online court records in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, show someone matching Chock's name and age has a history of arrests for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol and assault. In 2007, he was indicted on aggravated assault. Several months later, he was charged with disorderly conduct with a weapon and pleaded guilty to a reduced charge.  In 2010, three DUI-related charges, including having a third DUI, were dropped as part of an agreement where Chock pleaded guilty to felony aggravated DUI and shoplifting. He also pleaded no contest to aggravated assault.  Records show Chock was given probation in 2012 but violated the conditions of it in May 2013. According to court paperwork, Chock rejected a chance at continuing probation and requested prison time. He was sentenced to two years and eight months but got more than 280 days credit for time served before sentencing. Online Arizona Department of Corrections records indicate he went to prison in May 2013 but was paroled in October 2014.  On Saturday, Chock is accused of speeding his truck into bike racers gathered just before 7:30 a.m. for the annual 58-mile (93-kilometer) Bike the Bluff race, which had drawn hundreds of participants. Witnesses described seeing the bodies of cyclists flying left and right. Tony Quinones, a cyclist who saw the crash, said some riders wondered at first whether the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. But Quinones said he saw the man speed toward the cyclists.  "He went right at us," Quinones said.  Seven cyclists were rushed to hospitals, and six were listed in critical condition. The other was in stable condition. Sleighter said she had no update on how they are doing.  After crashing into the bicyclists, the driver of the pickup hit a telephone pole, and cyclists ran up to the truck and started pounding on the windows, screaming at the driver to get out, witnesses say.  Quinones said the driver hit the accelerator and backed out, drove down the road, made a U-turn and then headed back toward the cyclists but did not hit them again and drove away.  He was shot by police outside a nearby hardware store. Chock did not comply when officers tried to arrest him, Show Low spokeswoman Grace Payne said, but authorities have not yet given details on the circumstances that led to the shooting.  Show Low police say they are turning the investigation over to the Arizona Department of Public Safety.  The Associated Press called a cellphone number listed for Chock, which didn't appear to be set up, and left messages with two people who may be his relatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/driver-who-rammed-bicyclists-in-arizona-race-has-dui-history/articleshow/83733380.cms||---
---||India||Covid: Record 85 lakh doses on Day 1 of new vaccination policy||NEW DELHI: The first day of the revised Covid-19 vaccination policy, in which the Centre is procuring 75% of domestically available vaccines for free jabs to the 18-plus population, saw a record 85 lakh doses administered till midnight, almost doubling the previous high of 43 lakh doses on April 5. Monday’s big bang start saw officials express hope the Centre’s target of 1 crore jabs a day could be met soon. “Today’s record-breaking vaccination numbers are gladdening. The vaccine remains our strongest weapon to fight Covid-19,” PM Modi said. "Congratulations to those who got vaccinated and kudos to all the front-line warriors working hard to ensure so many citizens got the vaccine," Modi tweeted. Today’s record-breaking vaccination numbers are gladdening. The vaccine remains our strongest weapon to fight COVID… https://t.co/dhphQOzElx— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1624285116000Over 68,000 vaccination sessions were conducted on Monday. However, private sector participation remained very limited as it organised around 2,000 sessions where recipients pay for their jabs. Private hospitals are allowed to access 25% of vaccines under an aggregation scheme to be finalised by respective states and UTs. The politicisation of the vaccine discourse was apparent on Monday, with central officials highlighting that BJP-ruled states strongly outperformed opposition states. "NDA-ruled states accounted for around 70% of all vaccinations done today. MP vaccinated around 15 lakh, Karnataka more than 10 lakh," said an official. Central officials said Punjab, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Delhi were not able to cross even 1 lakh vaccinations. “The three have been indicated availability of around 8 lakh vaccines each till the end of this month, Chhattisgarh around 3.5 lakh and Maharashtra 33 lakh,” said the source. While preparations to scale up vaccination were on since the announcement of the revised norms by the PM on June 7, the Centre worked with state governments and district administrations in particular to ensure capacity utilisation to the extent possible to achieve a milestone to mark the first day of the new vaccine regime, officials said. Times ViewJabbing about eight million individuals in a day is laudable. But this should be the norm, not an exception. Otherwise, it would be impossible to attain the “vaccination for all” target by December end. Simple maths shows that India still needs about 160 crore doses to be administered by year end to meet that goal. With 193 days left, that translates to nearly 83 lakh doses a day, seven days a week.“This demonstrates our capability of managing a huge turnout on a daily basis. This is the outcome of restructuring of the guidelines for procurement and supplies. The rollout of new norms has infused a new energy in the states,”said Niti Aayog member V K Paul said. Officials are hopeful that these numbers will further improve in next few weeks. The vaccination drive has been ramped up through more vaccines, advance visibility of availability to states and UTs for enabling better planning, and streamlining the vaccine supply chain, health ministry said. During May, more than 7.9 crore vaccines were available nationwide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-record-85-lakh-doses-on-day-1-of-new-vaccine-policy/articleshow/83733442.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||Mexico president to investigate border shooting of innocents||CIUDAD VICTORIA: Mexico's president vowed to investigate the border shootings that left 19 dead over the weekend, even as the latest homicide figures showed a rebound in killings nationwide.  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said evidence indicated that 15 of the victims were innocent bystanders. The other four dead were suspected gunmen from a group that drove into the northern border city of Reynosa and opened fire indiscriminately.  "Everything indicates that it was not a confrontation, but rather a commando that shot people who were not involved in any conflict," Lopez Obrador said.  Reynosa is located across the border from McAllen, Texas, and has been the scene of fighting between factions of the Gulf cartel. But those disputes usually target rival gunmen or security forces. The dead in the Saturday attack included taxi drivers, workers and a nursing student.  Authorities are still investigating the motive, though in the past, drug cartels have sometimes used random killings of civilians to turn up the heat on rival gangs, or intimidate local authorities.  Lopez Obrador asked federal prosecutors to take over the case and pledged "a thorough investigation."  Maria Elena Morera, director of the civic anti-crime group Common Cause, said many people have become inured to such violence.  "Mexicans have become accustomed to all these atrocities, without there being any real reaction," Morera said. "In the face of so much violence, people prefer not to let the pain in, and turn away."  The killings Saturday in Reynosa, and the latest nationwide homicide figures, suggest that Lopez Obrador's "hugs not bullets" crime strategy is doing little to decrease killings.  There were 2,963 homicides in May, the latest month for which figures are available, higher than May 2020 and well above the numbers that prevailed when Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018.  The government says homicides declined 2.9% in the first five months of 2021 compared to 2020, but that may be because January and February of this year were marked by Mexico's worst coronavirus wave, when public activities were curtailed.  "This is nothing," Morera said of the drop. "It is as if you keep a patient in a coma and then say he's doing very well." Tamaulipas Gov. Francisco Garcia Cabeza de Vaca called the Reynosa victims "innocent citizens," and said "Criminal organizations must receive a clear, explicit and forceful signal from the Federal Government that there will be no room for impunity, nor tolerance for their reprehensible criminal behavior."  Garcia Cabeza de Vaca belongs to the rival National Action Party and is himself being investigated by the federal prosecutor's office for organized crime and money laundering - accusations he says are part of plan by Lopez Obrador's government to attack him for being an opponent.  Local businessman Misael Chavarria Garza said many businesses closed early Saturday after the attacks and people were very scared as helicopters flew overhead.  On Sunday, he said "the people were quiet as if nothing had happened, but with a feeling of anger because now crime has happened to innocent people."  The attacks sparked a deployment of the military, National Guard and state police across the city.  The area's criminal activity has long been dominated by the Gulf cartel and there have been fractures within that group. Experts say there has been an internal struggle within the group since 2017 to control key territories for drug and human trafficking. Apparently, one cell from a nearby town may have entered Reynosa to carry out the attacks.  Olga Ruiz, whose 19-year-old brother Fernando Ruiz was killed by the gunmen, said her sibling was working as a plumber and bricklayer in a company owned by his stepfather to pay for his studies.  "They killed him in cold blood, he and two of his companions," said Olga Ruiz, adding that the gunmen arrived where her brother was fixing a drain.  "They heard the gunshots from afar and my stepfather told him: 'son, you have to take shelter.' So he asked permission to enter a house but my brother and his companions were only about to enter when the vehicles arrived," Ruiz said. "They stopped in front of them and started to shoot."  Lopez Obrador has sought to avoid confrontations with drug cartels, at one point releasing a top trafficker to avoid bloodshed. He prefers to focus on addressing underlying social problems like youth unemployment.  Earlier this month, Lopez Obrador praised the drug cartels for not disrupting the June 6 mid-term voting, even though three dozen candidates were killed during the campaigns.  "People who belong to organized crime behaved very well, in general, there were few acts of violence by these groups," the president said. "I think the white-collar criminals acted worse."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexico-president-to-investigate-border-shooting-of-innocents/articleshow/83733513.cms||---
---||World||Witness describes terror at deadly Florida Pride parade||FORT LAUDERDALE: The Pride parade route glowed with rainbow colors and Mardi Gras beads, some crowd-goers waved flags in anticipation of what was supposed to be a celebration of life and love, more meaningful than ever post-pandemic in this tight-knit South Florida gay community.  But it quickly turned into terror Saturday night, as gleeful cheers were drowned by the sounds of sirens and crying children.  Michael Albetta has participated in the parade for years and was readying to walk the route alongside U.S. Congressman Ted Deutch in his role as regional director for the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus. The two were queuing up as the parade was about to begin when he heard the truck's engine revving.  The 77-year-old driver of the pickup, a member of the Fort Lauderdale Gay Men's Chorus, suddenly accelerated forward, killing a fellow chorister and injuring another in what the chorus director, city officials and Wilton Manors police said was a tragic accident.  "You hear the engine roaring and galloping with more speed. All of a sudden you heard 'thump, thump, thump,' and those were the bodies he was hitting and he just crashed right through the nursery," a shaken Albetta said in an interview Monday.  Fort Lauderdale police have not released the name of the driver or the victims, but said the driver is was cooperating with the investigation and there was no evidence drugs or alcohol was involved. No arrests have been made and friends said the driver and members of the 25-person ensemble are heartbroken by the loss.  Albetta said the driver narrowly missed U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's vehicle, somehow jumped the curb and came straight down on the victims, before careening into a fence on the opposite side of the road.  In the initial aftermath, parade participants and witnesses didn't know want to think. A visibly shaken Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said it was a terrorist act on the gay community. On Sunday, he said he was traumatized by what he witnessed and clarified it was an accident.  The parade route turned into pandemonium as participants and witnesses frantically pieced together what had happened. Parade goers waiting at the end of the route heard the commotion and were frantically calling friends near the accident at the front of the route asking if they should flee.  A heavy police presence already secured the parade route, so there was an immediate onslaught of blaring sirens and flashing lights.  "Children saw this, and they were in shock and they started crying because they saw people on the ground with the blood coming out. It was horrible," said Albetta, who said the 7- and 10-year-old children with his group were so traumatized their parents immediately took them home.  "To see human life being taken out was just awful," he said.  Fort Lauderdale police said they are conducting a thorough investigation with the FBI, noting in a statement they are "considering and evaluating all possibilities."  But the Fort Lauderdale mayor, the Wilton Manors police chief and vice mayor, and the chorus director stressed that it was an accident.  A spokesman for the chorus said the director did not want to give interviews, adding that many members of the small group witnessed the fatal crash and were deeply shaken.  "As the Chorus family mourns together, we thank the community for their love and understanding," according to a statement on the group's website, which referred to it as an "unfortunate accident."  Wilton Manors is a tight-knit community near Fort Lauderdale with a vibrant downtown filled with shops, where people line up for Rosie's famous hamburgers or to gossip and drink at Georgie's Alibi Monkey Bar.  June is Pride Month, commemorating a June 1969 uprising that followed a police raid targeting gay patrons at the Stonewall Inn in New York. It was a catalyst for the gay rights movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/witness-describes-terror-at-deadly-florida-pride-parade/articleshow/83733589.cms||---
---||World||Swedish PM loses confidence vote, sparking uncertainty||COPENHAGEN: Stefan Lofven, Sweden's Social Democratic prime minister since 2014, lost a confidence vote in parliament on Monday, making him the first Swedish leader ever to lose such a motion. The development creates new political uncertainty in the Scandinavian nation after the last election in 2018 created a deadlocked parliament and months of negotiations to produce a government. Under a timeline dictated by the Swedish Constitution, the prime minister now has one week to decide whether to call a new election or ask the parliament speaker to find a new government. Lofven said he wants "to take some time`` though "not necessarily the whole week" to decide on his next step. That government, a Social Democratic-Green coalition, is a minority government that has relied on votes from the small Left Party to pass laws. The no-confidence motion in Lofven's government was called by the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, but it ultimately succeeded because the Left Party had withdrawn its support from the government over proposed legislation to tackle a housing shortage. Lawmakers voted 181-109 against Lofven, with 51 abstentions. The Left Party said it lost confidence in Lofven over a proposal to abolish rent controls on newly built properties. Sweden has strict regulations on rents aimed at maintaining affordable prices in larger cities. However, this makes property developers less willing to invest in building new homes for the rental market. People wanting to rent a home can wait years for a contract and buying property is increasingly hard amid soaring home prices. However, the Left Party fears that deregulating the rental market will lead to rapid price increases and deeper segregation between rich and poor. After the vote, Lofven, 63, said that ``regardless of what happens, I and my party will be available to shoulder the responsibility for leading the country.'' "My focus has and will always be to do the best for Sweden," he added. Over the weekend, Lofven held last-minute meetings seeking to secure a majority in parliament for his proposed rent reforms. On Sunday, he sought to soften the reforms by inviting landlords and tenant organizations for talks. However, Left Party leader Nooshi Dadgostar said the party was standing by its decision to oppose Lofven and said his effort was "a political show." "We have done something that is perceived as unusual in politics ... kept our word," she said. The Left Party's initiative was supported by three other parties, including the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing populist party which the mainstream parties generally refuse to cooperate with because they consider it extreme. The Sweden Democrats made huge gains in a 2018 vote to 17.6% _ a showing attributed to a backlash against large-scale migration. In 2015, Sweden, with a population of 10 million, took in a record 163,000 refugees - the highest per capita of any European country. The populist party became Sweden's third-largest party in the 2014 vote. The 2018 election produced a hung parliament, with parties on the left and the center-right bloc securing about 40% of the vote each. In January 2019, Swedish lawmakers approved Lofven's minority government, ending a four-month political deadlock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/swedish-pm-loses-confidence-vote-sparking-uncertainty/articleshow/83733435.cms||---
---||India||Sharad Pawar, Yashwant Sinha call meet to put up united opposition||NEW DELHI: In the first major attempt post the recent round of assembly elections to bring opposition parties together, NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar and BJP veteran- turned-TMC- leader Yashwant Sinha have called a meeting of political leaders from the anti-BJP spectrum for a discussion on the political situation in the country on Tuesday. There will, however, be no representation from Congress. Interestingly, the three invites to Congress leaders went to G-23 members - Kapil Sibal, Vivek Tankha and Manish Tiwari. Two of the invitees said they are not attending and one of them is not in the capital. The invitations have not been sent to parties or party leaders as such, but the G23 angle stands out . Congress sources said the party had not been approached about the proposed meeting. Economists and public figures have been invited to the discussion as well. The meeting was announced soon after poll strategist Prashant Kishor, who was part of the winning TMC and DMK campaigns, met Sharad Pawar on Monday at his residence in Mumbai where they are learnt to have discussed issues pertaining to opposition unity. Congress's absence will weaken the "unity" factor in the meeting which will nonetheless attract considerable attention. Organised by the forum "Rashtra Manch" that was launched by Sinha in 2018, the discussion is on the "present national scenario". Sinha spelt out the message behind the meeting when he listed the "failures" of the Modi government topped by Covid mismanagement and asked the opposition parties to come together to defeat the saffron outfit. The former finance minister said parties should work to ensure that votes are not divided and their power increases, which will serve to increase the appeal of the opposition platform among people with the passage of time. Ghanshyam Tiwari, who is a member of the manch, and national spokesman of Samajwadi Party, said, "We picked the leaders first and not parties, based on their active participation in public forums on issues of national interest beyond the narrow confines of party line." He added, "The BJP government has failed on every front, starting from development to Covid, and is instead relying on distractions. The idea behind the meeting tomorrow is to get India back on the path of progress." Interestingly, after Kishor met Pawar, there were TV reports that the senior NCP politician had called a meeting of non-Congress opposition parties, a speculation that first gained currency after their luncheon meeting in Mumbai on June 11 that was termed as a courtesy call. However, the nature of discussions became evident when Sinha said Congress was a key part in the opposition forces and should join in the unity efforts. “Congress should show the maturity. Besides BJP it is the only national party and it should engage in unity efforts... it should decide,” he said. While Sinha’s comments defused the “non-Congress opposition” talk, its recurring mention is bound to be disconcerting since there is a view that the presence of Congress hurts opposition unity given that many regional parties are in direct conflict with the grand old party. A Congress member rubbished the possibility and said there can be informal efforts by Pawar to mobilise opposition parties without Congress, but a final picture authored by him wouldn’t exclude Congress. Another office-bearer said Pawar has the ability to bring even anti-Congress regional parties on one platform, which is good from opposition point of view.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sharad-pawar-yashwant-sinha-call-meet-to-put-up-united-opposition/articleshow/83733609.cms||---
---||World||US hitting encouraging milestones on virus deaths and shots||Covid-19 deaths in the US have dipped below 300 a day for the first time since the early days of the disaster in March 2020, while the drive to put shots in arms approached another encouraging milestone Monday: 150 million Americans fully vaccinated.  The coronavirus was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But now, as the outbreak loosens its grip, it has fallen down the list of the biggest killers. CDC data suggests that more Americans are dying every day from accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, strokes or Alzheimer's disease than from Covid-19.  The U.S. death toll stands at more than 600,000, while the worldwide count is close to 3.9 million, though the real figures in both cases are believed to be markedly higher.  About 45% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Over 53% of Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine. But US demand for shots has slumped, to the disappointment of public health experts.  Dr. Ana Diez Roux, dean of Drexel University's school of public health, said the dropping rates of infections and deaths are cause for celebration. But she cautioned that the virus still has a chance to spread and mutate given the low vaccination rates in some states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming and Idaho.  "So far it looks like the vaccines we have are effective against the variants that are circulating," Diez Roux said. "But the more time the virus is jumping from person to person, the more time there is for variants to develop, and some of those could be more dangerous."  New cases are running at about 11,400 a day on average, down from over a quarter-million per day in early January. Average deaths per day are down to about 293, according to Johns Hopkins University, after topping out at over 3,400 in mid-January.  In New York, which suffered mightily in the spring of 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted on Monday that the state had 10 new deaths. At the height of the outbreak in the state, nearly 800 people a day were dying from the coronavirus.  Some states are faring worse than others. Missouri leads the nation in per-capita Covid-19 cases and is fourth behind California, Florida and Texas in the number of new cases per day over the past week despite its significantly smaller population.  The fall will bring new waves of infection, but they will be less severe and concentrated more in places with low vaccination rates, said Amber D'Souza, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  "So much depends on what happens over the summer and what happens with children," D'Souza said. "Anyone who is not vaccinated can become infected and transmit the virus."  Meanwhile, because of regulatory hurdles and other factors, President Joe Biden is expected to fall short of his commitment to share 80 million vaccine doses with the rest of the world by the end of June, officials said Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-hitting-encouraging-milestones-on-virus-deaths-and-shots/articleshow/83733663.cms||---
---||World||Covid: Scientist opens up about his early email to Fauci on virus origins||Among the thousands of pages of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails released recently by BuzzFeed News, a short note from Kristian Andersen, a virus expert at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, has garnered a lot of attention. Over the past year, Andersen has been one of the most outspoken proponents of the theory that the coronavirus originated from a natural spillover from an animal to humans outside of a lab. But in the email to Fauci in January 2020, Andersen hadn’t yet come to that conclusion. He told Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, that some features of the virus made him wonder whether it had been engineered, and noted that he and his colleagues were planning to investigate further by analyzing the virus’s genome. The researchers published those results in a paper in the scientific journal Nature Medicine on March 17, 2020, concluding that a laboratory origin was very unlikely. Andersen has reiterated this point of view in interviews and on Twitter over the past year, putting him at the center of the continuing controversy over whether the virus could have leaked from a Chinese lab. When his early email to Fauci was released, the media storm around Andersen intensified, and he deactivated his Twitter account. He answered written questions from The New York Times about the email and the fracas. The exchange has been lightly edited for length. Q: Much has been made of your email to Fauci in late January 2020, shortly after the coronavirus genome was first sequenced. You said, “The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered.” Can you explain what you meant?A: At the time, based on limited data and preliminary analyses, we observed features that appeared to potentially be unique to SARS-CoV-2. We had not yet seen these features in other related viruses from natural sources, and thus were exploring whether they had been engineered into the virus. Those features included a structure known as the furin cleavage site that allows the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to be cleaved by furin, an enzyme found in human cells, and another structure, known as the receptor binding domain, that allowed the virus to anchor to the outside of human cells via a cell-surface protein known as ACE2. Q: You also said you found the virus’s genome to be “inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”A: This was a reference to the features of SARS-CoV-2 that we identified based on early analyses that didn’t appear to have an obvious immediate evolutionary precursor. We hadn’t yet performed more in-depth analyses to reach a conclusion, rather were sharing our preliminary observations. I cautioned in that same email that we would need to look at the question much more closely and that our opinions could change within a few days based on new data and analyses — which they did. Q: In March 2020, you and other scientists published the Nature Medicine paper saying that “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.” Can you explain how the research changed your view?A: The features in SARS-CoV-2 that initially suggested possible engineering were identified in related coronaviruses, meaning that features that initially looked unusual to us weren’t. Many of these analyses were completed in a matter of days, while we worked around the clock, which allowed us to reject our preliminary hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 might have been engineered, while other “lab”-based scenarios were still on the table. Yet more extensive analyses, significant additional data and thorough investigations to compare genomic diversity more broadly across coronaviruses led to the peer-reviewed study published in Nature Medicine. For example, we looked at data from coronaviruses found in other species, such as bats and pangolins, which demonstrated that the features that first appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 were in fact found in other, related viruses. Overall, this is a textbook example of the scientific method where a preliminary hypothesis is rejected in favor of a competing hypothesis after more data become available and analyses are completed. Q: Some people, including virus expert David Baltimore, say the presence of the furin cleavage site could be a sign of human manipulation of the virus, whereas you and other virus experts have said it naturally evolved. Can you explain for readers why you don’t think it is proof of an engineered virus?A: Furin cleavage sites are found all across the coronavirus family, including in the betacoronavirus genus that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to. There has been much speculation that patterns found in the virus’s RNA that are responsible for certain portions of the furin cleavage site represent evidence of engineering. Specifically, people are pointing to two “CGG” sequences that code for the amino acid arginine in the furin cleavage site as strong evidence that the virus was made in the lab. Such statements are factually incorrect. While it’s true that CGG is less common than other patterns that code for arginine, the CGG codon is found elsewhere in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the genetic sequence[s] that include the CGG codon found in SARS-CoV-2 are also found in other coronaviruses. These findings, together with many other technical features of the site, strongly suggest that it evolved naturally and there is very little chance somebody engineered it. Q: Do you still believe that all laboratory scenarios are implausible? If not an engineered virus, what about an accidental leak from the Wuhan lab?A: As we stated in our article last March, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove specific hypotheses of SARS-CoV-2 origin. However, while both lab and natural scenarios are possible, they are not equally likely — precedence, data and other evidence strongly favor natural emergence as a highly likely scientific theory for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, while the lab leak remains a speculative hypothesis based on conjecture. Based on detailed analyses of the virus conducted to date by researchers around the world, it is extremely unlikely that the virus was engineered. The scenario in which the virus was found in nature, brought to the lab and then accidentally release[d] is similarly unlikely, based on current evidence. In contrast, the scientific theory about the natural emergence of SARS-CoV-2 presents a far simpler and more likely scenario. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV-1, including its seasonal timing, location and association with the human food chain. Q: Some people have pointed to your email to Fauci, suggesting that it raises questions about whether scientists and government officials gave more credence to the lab-leak theory than they let on to the public. And some recent reports have suggested that certain government officials didn’t want to talk about the lab-leak theory because it would draw attention to the government’s support of so-called gain-of-function research. What is your response to these suggestions? Were you worried in the spring of 2020 about the public latching on to a lab-leak theory?A: My primary concern last spring, which is true to this day, is to perform research to discern exactly how SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the human population. I won’t speak to what government officials and other scientists did or didn’t say or think. My comments and conclusions are strictly driven by scientific inquiry, and I strongly believe that careful, well-supported public messaging around complex topics is paramount. Q: Many scientists have now expressed an openness to the possibility that a lab leak occurred. Looking back over the past year, do you have any regrets about the way you or the broader scientific community have communicated with the public about the lab-leak idea?A: First, it is important to say that the scientific community has made tremendous inroads in understanding COVID-19 in a remarkably short amount of time. Vigorous debate is integral to science and that’s what we have seen regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. It can be difficult at times for the public, I think, to observe the debate and discern the likelihood of the various hypotheses. That is particularly true where science becomes politicized, and the current vilification of scientists and subject matter experts sets a dangerous precedent. We saw that with the climate change debate and now we’re seeing it with the debate around various facets of the Covid-19 pandemic. Throughout this pandemic, I have made my best efforts to help explain what the scientific evidence is and suggests, and I have no regrets about that. Q: Do you support President Joe Biden’s call for US intelligence agencies to further investigate these various possibilities? Could they find anything that would change your mind?A: I have always supported further inquiries into the origin of SARS-CoV-2, including President Biden’s recent call, as it is important that we more fully understand how the virus emerged. As is true for any scientific process, there are several things that would lend credence to the lab-leak hypothesis that would make me change my mind. For example, any credible evidence of SARS-CoV-2 having been at the Wuhan Institute of Virology prior to the pandemic — whether in a freezer, in tissue culture or in animals, or epidemiological evidence of very early confirmed COVID-19 cases associated with the institute. Other evidence, were it to emerge, could lend further weight to the natural origin hypothesis. That includes the identification of an intermediate [animal] host (if one exists). Also, now that we know that live animals were sold at markets across Wuhan, further understanding of the flow of animals and connected supply lines could lend additional credence to natural emergence. Q: It seems that you’ve shut down your Twitter account. Why? Will you come back?A: I have always seen Twitter as a way to interact with other scientists and the general public to encourage open and transparent dialogue about science. Increasingly, however, I found that information and comments I posted were being taken out of context or misrepresented to push false narratives, in particular about the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Daily attacks against scientists and the scientific method have also become common, and much of the conversation has steered far away from the science. For those reasons, I felt that at present, I could no longer productively contribute to the platform, and I decided it would be more productive for me to invest more of my time into our infectious disease research, including that on Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-scientist-opens-up-about-his-early-email-to-fauci-on-virus-origins/articleshow/83733660.cms||---
---||India||Post-poll violence: Calcutta HC dismisses Bengal govt plea to recall order on NHRC probe||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Monday dismissed the Bengal government's plea to recall its last week's order that directed the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to set up a panel for examining all post-poll violence complaints on record. A five-judge bench led by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal set aside the state's recall-modification plea. "The way the state was proceeding in the matter that required immediate action did not inspire confidence," the larger bench said while turning down the state's plea. The state said it did not get an opportunity to probe the 3,423 complaints lodged with the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority and place a report before the court. "The court should have sent a copy of the complaints to the state before sending them to the NHRC," the state pleaded. It also urged the court to "expunge" the remarks made against it in the June 18 court order, which said the state's lapses would be taken "seriously" as contempt of court. State advocate-general Kishore Dutta submitted that the court should define "post-poll" violence. "Any violence cannot be called post-poll violence. We should be allowed to place facts so that everything can be resolved in this court itself. We have already taken action," the advocate-general said. The bench, while noting the "serious objections" to the post poll-violence applications, said: "The order (June 18) was passed considering the number of complaints and police inaction. No prejudice as such was caused to the state." "A chart of alleged action was sought to be produced in court, which was not supported by an affidavit. The advocate-general stated that he could vouchsafe for its authenticity," the court said, adding that the state could place that report before the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) panel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-poll-violence-calcutta-hc-dismisses-bengal-govt-plea-to-recall-order-on-nhrc-probe/articleshow/83733729.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya land row: Seller claimed he had full right||LUCKNOW: The controversy over the sale of a piece of 'nazul' land to Ram Janmabhoomi Trust for the expansion of the proposed Ram Temple complex took a curious turn when Devendra Prasadacharya who sold this land to Deep Narayan - who in turn sold it to the temple trust - claimed in the sale deed he was the 'owner' of the said property and had the 'full right to sell the land'. As per the Government Grant Act, nazul land is owned by the government and can't be sold. The government gives these lands on lease for development activities. Prasadacharya sold this 890 sq mt land to Deep Narayan, said to be the nephew of Ayodhya mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay, for Rs 20 lakh in February this year. Deep Narayan sold the same land to the Ram temple trust for Rs 2.5 crore in May. The value of this land as per the DM circle rate is approximately Rs 35 lakh, but the going rate - after the 2019 SC verdict on the Ram temple - is several times higher. Both Prasadacharya and Deep Narayan are not willing to speak to the media after controversy erupted over the deal. But, Prasadacharya has accepted before camera that he sold this land for 'whatever money he got' as it was a nazul land and he wasn't getting anything out of it. "All that I knew was that the land belonged to nazul, not me. Whatever I was getting was good enough)," he can be seen telling a TV channel reporter. TOI, too, found this piece of land being mentioned as 'nazul' on Bhulekh, the official website of land records. The sale deed registered between Prasadacharya and Deep Narayan on February 20, 2021, further mentions that land was "not for public purpose use" and was "out of the ambit of acquisition process by any government department". What's more, it also says that Narayan got all the facts related to the land "properly checked" and "was satisfied with the ownership of the land" before the deal. Deep Narayan sold this land to Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerath Kshetra for Rs 2.5 crore on May 11, 2021. In this case, too, the registry records show Narayan mentioning that he "had full rights" to sell the land to the trust which was represented by its general secretary and VHP international vice-president Champat Rai. The registry mentions that Rai also "got all the facts checked" before buying the land on behalf of trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-land-row-seller-claimed-he-had-full-right/articleshow/83733819.cms||Pankaj Shah

The event is to be held virtually with India willing to share its experience and technology. In a joint initiative by the ministries of health, external affairs and the NHA, the conclave will see participation from health and technology experts representing countries such as Vietnam, Peru, Mexico, Iraq, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Ukraine, Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates and Uganda, among others. Some countries have developed their own systems but may pick up a tip or two from India's experience. According to officials who have been interacting with many of these countries, there is enormous demand for Covid-19 vaccines as well. The software is virtually useless without vaccines. The idea is to showcase the Co-Win portal for countries interested in adopting it, as well as sharing the technology. According to official sources, over 20 countries have already shown interest in this technology to help run their own vaccination drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-plans-global-meet-to-share-co-win-tech/articleshow/83733860.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Now, Andhra Pradesh government to e-auction minor mineral leases||AMARAVATI: The state government has decided to switch over to the e-auction route to grant leases for minor minerals. The existing system of granting leases through the first-come-first-serve basis is not attracting big investors into the picture, said the government. The government also hopes to increase its revenue through the new system. After studying the existing system of granting leases to minor minerals, the government found that serious entrepreneurs are not able to obtain quarry leases to undertake mining. Moreover, the applicants are keeping the mineral bearing areas idle, by not pursuing requisite clearances. Studies have also found that the applicants are trading areas under the existing system. Taking all these challenges into consideration, the government has decided to grant quarry leases of all minor minerals except sand through the e-auction route, similar to grant of mining leases of major minerals. The government has also decided to classify minor minerals into Part A with granite, marble and 31 minor minerals and Part B with all other minor minerals. Sand has been categorised under Part C. “We are hopeful that the new system will help clear the quarry leases faster with transparent allocation. It will also help fetch higher revenue to the state exchequer,” said mines and geology minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy. The minister said that it would also encourage serious entrepreneurs for promotion of mineral-based industries and increased compliance with sustainable mining activity. According to the proposal readied by the department, there will be a two-stage auction similar to the one being carried out for major minerals. The government would consider the existing lessees to continue the quarrying only if they are proved to have a high technical background and match the bid amount of e-auction. “The lease will be granted for 25 years for all minerals, 20 years for road metal and napa slabs and five years for gravel,” said an official. The lease will be granted only if the minimum extent of land is about four hectares (10 acres). “Bids will be finalised only if there are at least three bidders in the final stage of e-auction. 100% bid amount should be paid within two weeks of conclusion of the bid,” the official said. The lease holders should also show at least 10% production in the first year, 30% in the second year, 50% by the third year and above 60% by the fourth year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/now-govt-to-e-auction-minor-mineral-leases/articleshow/83725743.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: 10-year-long struggle to get Aadhaar resolved||GUNTUR: The near decade-long struggle of the family members of a mentally-disabled woman recently ended when district collector Vivek Yadav resolved their grievance within hours of receiving a complaint. Twenty-eight-year-old Boddu Chinna is a resident of Narayanapuram village in Dachepalli mandal. Her elder sister Santhi Lakshmi has taken care of her wellbeing since childhood. In the past, Lakshmi had tried to enroll Chinna for government welfare benefits, but failed as Chinna had no Aadhaar number. In fact, Lakshmi took Chinna to the local Aadhaar enrolment centre several times in the last decade but staffers at the centre failed to capture her fingerprints on the scanner. Refusing to give up, Lakshmi continued her struggle to secure an Aadhaar cared for her sister and posted a message to the new district collector Vivek Yadav on Friday. Moved by the sisters’ plight, Yadav directed Dachepalli tehsildar Venkateswara Naik to immediately resolve the issue. Naik rushed to Chinna’s residence and took her and Lakshmi to the local Aadhaar centre where Chinna’s fingerprints were recorded. The tehsildar immediately granted her the welfare pension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/10-yr-long-struggle-to-get-aadhaar-resolved/articleshow/83725912.cms||Samdani MN

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Showcause notice to 3 jail officials||PUNE: The state prisons department has served showcause notices to three officers at the Yerawada central jail, asking them to explain why action should not be taken for their “negligence and misinterpretation of a bail order” in the wrongful release of Tejas More, an undertrial prisoner in a Rs12.5-crore bank loan fraud case, on June 3. A court in Pimpri had rejected More’s bail application on June 2. Yet, he was released from jail the following day. More returned to the prison on his own on June 6, after the authorities contacted his family and lawyers on realising the error. The prisons department then ordered a probe into the lapse. The showcause notices were issued after a preliminary inquiry, the authorities said. Additional director-general of police (prisons) Sunil Ramanand told TOI, “We have issued showcause notices to the three Yerawada central prison staffers, giving them time to reply. A preliminary inquiry revealed that there was gross negligence towards their duty. They did not read the rejected bail order and misinterpreted it. Normally, these officers read the court orders and then decide whom to release from the prison.” More, arrested in February, had moved an application in the Pimpri court in May seeking an interim bail. But the court on June 2 rejected it citing the seriousness of the offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/showcause-notice-to-3-jail-officials/articleshow/83730464.cms||---
---||Goa||Around 50% of Goa’s 60+ age group yet to take their first jab||PANAJI: Even as vaccination is picking up as a consequence of the deadly second wave, officials are scratching their heads over senior citizens — the age group most vulnerable to Covid-19 — still reluctant to get the jab. Among all states, Goa has one of the highest proportion of senior citizens in India, and only around 50% have been vaccinated, said district immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar. Around 11.2% of Goa’s population is over 60 years old, second only to Kerala. “A large number of senior citizens are still evading vaccination, either because they believe misinformation or have some misconceptions,” said a senior government doctor. “Even after seeing the most lethal side of the pandemic last month, many of them still don’t want to get vaccinated.” Official government data recently released showed that of the 1,798 persons who died over a 42-day period at the peak of the second wave, 99.6% hadn’t taken a single dose of the vaccine, and 90% had received only one dose. However, even this evidence of real-world effectiveness hasn’t poked a hole into senior citizens’ reluctance. Suman Naik, 65, from Mandrem is yet to get her first shot. She said she was waiting for curfew restrictions to be lifted, even after being told that nobody would stop her from visiting a vaccination centre. While Naik will eventually take the vaccine, others, like Kamakshi Porob, 70, won’t. She has decided not to get it because she fears the vaccine will make her ill. “My mother is very scared about the vaccine, and I can’t force her to take it. In fact, she has been more frightened after I fell ill for three days after I got the shot,” said her son Akash. The health officer said that there ought to be continued awareness to dispel the myths and misconceptions that senior citizens may have about the vaccine. “However, not enough is being done on this front. The first few days of Tika Utsav or vaccination drive receive a good response, but after that, everything slows down,” he said. Borkar, a district immunisation officer, said that hesitancy about the vaccine is more evident in the rural population. “We are receiving good response from senior citizens in urban areas,” Borkar said. Asked what will be done to convince senior citizens who have refrained so far from getting vaccinated, he said perhaps they would have to go door-to-door. However, it would be of much help if elected representatives take a lead and find out the names of people in their respective areas who are yet to get vaccinated, and persuade them to get inoculated. Paying a home visit to give a vaccine shot, he said, is not a practical solution considering the vaccine wastage involved. A beneficiary needs to be monitored for half an hour after being given the shot. It can be effectively done at a designated site, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/around-50-of-goas-60-age-group-yet-to-take-their-first-jab/articleshow/83731314.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Patna||Nitish Kumar to visit Delhi today, may meet BJP top brass||PATNA: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar will be on a three-day visit to New Delhi from Tuesday. This time, his visit is in more limelight amid the speculations that he might meet PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief J P Nadda to discuss issues ranging from his JD(U)’s entry in the Union cabinet to the recent split in the Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). JD(U) national spokesperson K C Tyagi told TOI on Monday that Nitish would stay in New Delhi for three days. “But, I am not aware about his detailed itinerary as to whom he will meet during his stay in Delhi,” Tyagi said over phone from Delhi. However, another senior JD(U) leader and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh said the CM was going to the national capital for his medical check-up and taking advice from certain doctors. Singh also said it was the CM’s “private visit” and denied reports about political meetings. But some NDA leaders said the Bihar CM might meet some senior BJP leaders to discuss issues related to the Union cabinet expansion and political developments in the LJP. As PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah recently held a series of parleys with senior BJP and RSS leaders in New Delhi, speculations are rife about possible Union cabinet expansion in the next few days. There is a strong buzz in Bihar’s political circles about the likely inclusion of JD(U) members as well as the rebel LJP MP Pashupati Kumar Paras in the Union cabinet. Sources in the JD(U) said party president RCP Singh and Munger MP Lalan would be the party’s first choice for the cabinet berth, if the BJP offers only two seats to Nitish’s party. JD(U) also wants to send one member from the extremely backward castes (EBCs), its core voters, to the Union cabinet. Hence, it wants at least three berths. “If permitted, Rajya Sabha member Ram Nath Thakur (who is the son of former CM Karpoori Thakur) or Jehanabad MP Chandeshwar Prasad may be considered,” a senior JD(U) leader said, adding that JD(U) would join the Modi cabinet only when it gets “respectable representation”. However, RCP on Monday said CM Nitish Kumar will take a final decision on the names to be included in the Union cabinet. This time, Nitish is visiting the national capital after a gap of four months. Last time he went to Delhi on February 11 when he called on PM Modi and backed three contentious farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-to-visit-delhi-today-may-meet-bjp-top-brass/articleshow/83725146.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Pashupati Kumar Paras’s ‘man’ meets Chirag Paswan in Delhi||PATNA: Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras-led faction of LJP received a setback when their state vice-president and former MLC Vinod Kumar Singh met Chirag Paswan in Delhi on Monday and reposed faith in his leadership. “The proposed ‘ashirvad yatra’, which is to be launched from Hajipur, will be a historic one,” said Singh. Earlier, Paras group had claimed that Singh was with them. However, state president of the Chirag-led faction, Raju Tiwari, said Singh took part in their Sunday's national executive committee meeting as an invited member. There were 77 members of the national executive committee of LJP. In addition, the party has 17 invited members. On Sunday, 66 members were present. Tiwari said at least 20 state presidents of the party took part in their executive committee meeting on Sunday, proving Chirag’s support base and growing influence in the party. On the other hand, Paras-led faction asserted that the people were brought in hired vehicles from different states to show strength at the executive committee meeting convened by Chirag, who has been removed as the LJP national president. The tug of war between ‘chacha’ and ‘bhatija’ for one-upmanship has, however, left the district level party functionaries confused. “Both are honourable for us,” said a district LJP president, requesting anonymity. Most of the district office-bearers preferred to wait for the controversy to die down. “It’s a family fight. So, better keep mum over the issue,” said another functionary. They, however, maintained that now the ball is in the court of the election commission, which will decide who is the real claimant of the party's symbol--bungalow. "It's sooner the better," a former MLA of LJP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/parass-man-meets-chirag/articleshow/83726659.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||Covid positive woman on ventilator becomes mom in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Doctors at the state-run Medical College Hospital Kolkata (MCHK) on Monday morning conducted a life-saving C-section on a 31-year-old pregnant woman who is under ventilation due to severe Covid-19 pneumonitis. Conditions of both mother and newborn are said to be critical, but doctors said they believed it was possible for the duo to recover. Rakhi Mandal Biswas was admitted to the Covid CCU on June 12, 31 weeks into her pregnancy, with respiratory distress. Doctors immediately put her on oxygen therapy along with medication — initially NRBM, then HFNC and BiPap. Despite all these, her oxygen saturation kept declining and plunged to 60% on Sunday night, following which she had to be put on ventilation. “On Thursday, we requested the medical superintendent to form a board to decide whether we should conduct a C-section or terminate the pregnancy because her oxygen requirement kept escalating despite all efforts,” said MCHK anaesthesia department head Asim Kundu.A board comprising the heads of anaesthesia, gynaecology, haematology and paediatrics decided to attempt a C-section. Since the patient is 31, with no known co-morbidities, the team decided to take her to the OT on Monday. But since she had to be ventilated from Sunday night, doctors had to conduct the surgery at the Covid CCU bed itself. “During pregnancy the uterus gets pushed upwards, restricting diaphragm movement. The surgery was risky and the anaesthesia was tricky, but we agreed that the benefits outweighed the risks,” said Kundu, who led the anaesthesia team. The patient also needed four units of the rare blood group A2-positive, which was arranged by a blood bank attached to the hospital. “We have had a number of deliveries by Covid patients, but this is the first time a C-section was conducted on a patient who is on ventilation. The baby is in NICU and requires intensive care,” said gynaecology head Partha Mukherjee. “Now we can consider proning or go for ECMO support if needed,” said Kundu. Doctors said the woman’s condition could have had a cascading impact on the foetus without the surgery. “If the mother had collapsed under ventilation, it could have posed a risk to the foetus. This kind of surgery is quite a feat,” said Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India vice-president Basab Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-ve-woman-on-ventilator-becomes-mom/articleshow/83728917.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The tourism department is contemplating to take the support of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) to develop the shrine. The development of Ahobilam temple will not only help religious tourism but also eco-tourism as it is located in the Eastern Ghats. “A journey into lush green forest to pay darshan to the historical Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple (nine temples) is a fascinating experience. The government should explore development of a theme park, dhyana mandiram, cottages and setting up of statues of Ramanujacharya, Annamaiah,” said Gopireddy Srinivasa Reddy, a historian. He said that it might not cost more than Rs 100 crore to turn the picturesque temple into the biggest tourist attraction not only in the state but in the country as one could rarely find such a peaceful temple environment. Ahobilam Khetram is considered one of the 108 holy shrines of Lord Vishnu as described by Alwarlu. Only two shrines—Tirumala and Ahobilam—from the state have found place in the historical holy places of Vaishnavaites in the country. The historians found fault with successive governments for their misplaced focus on development of tourism projects in the state. “I could not visit the shrine due to Covid-19 for last two years. Otherwise, I could not simply resist from making a trip to this historical shrine at least once in a year,” said Dr G Narayana Sarma, former professor of Anantapur, adding that it could even attract the youth as the neighbouring Nallamala forest offers many options for adventure tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-mulls-developing-ahobilam-as-tourist-hub/articleshow/83736403.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Abhijit Banerjee says social scientists should guide policymakers||PATNA: Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee said on Monday that institutional framework of a society persists for long as the impacts of zamindari system can be seen even 150 years after its abolishment. Delivering the first Shaibal Gupta memorial lecture on ‘Under the thumb of history?’ jointly organised by the Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance (CEPPF) and Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) through a digital platform, Banerjee said social scientists should guide policymakers by drawing analysis from macro indicators and studying the capabilities of specific institutions or groups of people. He further pointed out that according to Marx, historical laws predict the necessary transition from feudalism to capitalism, and from capitalism to socialism. But, the modern view is more pessimistic as there is no necessity of transition due as oligarchy holds on to power. He further shared that there is no logical reason why persistence would mean determination. Sometimes change is purely due to inertia and sometimes due to persistence. He emphasized that formal rules bring about changes and observed that the mandatory representation of women affects political decisions, short and medium-term outcomes and overall impact. He also shared that beyond policies even small accidents have long-term impacts. In his special address, state’s chief secretary Tripurari Sharan shared the story of cooperative societies and the institutional history that impacts the behaviour of individuals and systems. ADRI’s chairperson Harish Khare welcomed the guests and recalled the contributions of Shaibal Gupta in the state’s socio-economic development. ADRI’s member secretary P P Ghosh proposed a vote of thanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/abhijit-says-social-scientists-should-guide-policymakers/articleshow/83725562.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Young ‘heroes’ played a vital role in helping Covid patients in Bihar||PATNA: Since March, social media was flooding with stories either about requests or verified leads on hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, concentrators, blood donors, essential medicines like Remedesivir as well as food delivery. But the young ‘heroes’ in Bihar changed the course of tackling the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic without a cape and stood for humanity amid the worst healthcare crisis. Maybe, the initial instinct was of doing the least they could, of using what was in their hand, a mobile phone. Nushaque Saba was in Delhi when 10 members in her family and relatives in Patna got infected with the virus in March-end. Her mother was in dire need of oxygen support. After no luck finding offline, they tried to ask their friends online. The message spread and reached an NGO, which was working for Covid relief. It arranged an oxygen cylinder at its own expense, even got their lab tests done and helped arrange medicines for the family. “We are thankful that we got genuine help in time. A friend in Kanpur was bound to buy six vials of Remdesivir at Rs45,000 each, two of which turned out to be fake,” said Nushaque. Vinit Mishra, a businessman from Rajendra Nagar, who works for the same NGO which helped Nashaque’s family, said: “We started a helpline on April 23 after the load of requests skyrocketed. Now, we provide online verified leads from across the country. Apart from arranging beds and medical supplies, we have recently distributed ration to around 100 families. We have even tied up with various dealers to provide ‘antifungal injections’ to hospitals having black fungus patients.” The Student's Council Body of Patna Women’s College has been resourcing Covid supply with the help of its alumni since April. Riya Pushkar, the general secretary of the CWC body, said: “We gather all leads available on social media, individually verify them and spread the authentic leads. We arranged for ICU beds, essential medicine, plasma donors and food delivery information on a daily basis.” Md Saquib Nezami, a software engineer living at Phulwarisharif, works with his friends for providing relief to Covid patients and the economically weaker people. “We crowdfunded around Rs2.5 lakhs from friends and relatives for providing free medicine and oxygen cylinders. For ration distribution and other relief works during the lockdown, we gathered a sum of approximately Rs1.5 lakh. We also arranged B (-ve) and AB (-ve) donors for two kids suffering from Thalassemia and jaundice. We also took full responsibility of getting an electrician’s hand operated as he was the loan breadwinner in his family and almost lost his hand in an accident,” Saquib said. Saquib claims that these works give self-satisfaction to them and motivation to others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/young-heroes-played-a-vital-role-in-helping-covid-patients-in-bihar/articleshow/83725411.cms||---

Sanjay Kumar Singhania, an office-bearer of the North Eastern Chamber of Commerce, Katihar chapter, said, "During the rainy season, waterlogging problems are seen not only in Katihar town but across the district. Besides, several culverts (small bridges) in the district have just one slab, instead of two. The gaps in culverts often leads to accidents during the rainy season.” Singhania further said, “The municipal corporation has enough resources and manpower to clean the drains of the town falling under more than 40 wards of the town. Municipal workers can clean the drains of a ward in a single day. This his exercise could have been completed in one-and-a half months. But, why is this work starts only when the monsoon approaches is a mystery.” He also questioned the logic behind carrying out the construction of drains along the MG Road and others during the rainy season. It was not the appropriate time to start the work, he added. Ajay Dalmia, a machinery shopowner on MG Road, said, "Several traders have constructed buffers in front of their shops to stop rainwater from entering their premises. Just 20-30 minutes of rain converts this road into a pond. Our several representations to the municipal corporation have fallen on deaf ears.” A mobile shopowner on the condition of anonymity, said, “Rainwater comes in contact with sewage because drains along the road are open. Besides, the outlet point for draining out stagnant water is choked with filth and garbage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/heavy-rainfall-brings-misery-to-katihar-residents/articleshow/83725324.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Proposed vax allocation system for pvt units will be entirely online, ‘offer transparency’||Kolkata: Private hospitals are getting ready for the new allocation system of vaccines through National Health Authority of India (NHA) and Co-Win portals where online applications will be submitted by private Covid vaccination centres (PCVCs) with the latter paying the NHA online for doses. The system is set to take off in July. Earlier this month, the Centre had announced that vaccines will be provided to the state and the latter will distribute them based on the requirements of PCVCs to ensure a more equitable distribution across cities and states. Under the proposed new system, each private vaccination centre will fill out a form on the Co-Win portal. It will have to mention the aggregate of Covaxin and Covishield they require, with separate demands for each. The maximum demand that a centre can raise will be double their average daily consumption between the 19th and 25th of the previous month. Private CVCs can demand either or both vaccines and ‘there will be no need for approval by any government authority’, said the new guidelines which are yet to reach most private hospitals in Kolkata. The maximum limit can be revised based on performance. On successful submission, a confirmation will be given to the private CVC and a unique demand ID number will be generated. The Co-Win system will aggregate the demand according to district and state, and provide a system for tracking IDs. Payment will have to be made directly on the NHA portal. While making the payment, PCVCs must provide the CVC ID and a demand note number, after which the amount payable will be displayed. After payment, a transaction ID will be sent to Co-Win by the NHA portal, which will be visible to the PCVC. “The new system will remove doubts and make it easy by going online. There will be enough transparency and we will have no worries about procuring doses. Since the payment will be online, we will know our financial liability clearly. There is a scope for asking for vaccines based on the previous month’s consumption. It will help us build stock and meet the rising demand,” said Medica Superspecialty Hospital chairperson Alok Roy. AMRI Hospitals said it was yet to receive the new guidelines. “We will go by the government directives,” said a hospital official. While earlier it had been announced that states would have to aggregate the demand of private hospitals, the new system allows a direct interaction between PCVCs and NHA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/proposed-vax-allocation-system-for-pvt-units-will-be-entirely-online-offer-transparency/articleshow/83728800.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

In a hearing last Friday, the state-owned lenders informed the bench that they will get 26% of their dues after factoring in third-party guarantees. The operational creditors will also get part of their dues under the settlement plan. Lenders of Siva Industries had approved a one-time settlement (OTS) proposal from R C K Vallal, promoter of Siva Industries and father of businessman C Sivasankaran, under which they will take a 93.5% haircut and just Rs 5 crore in upfront cash. Of the company’s total dues of Rs 4,863 crore, the IDBI Bank-led lenders will get Rs 313 crore, excluding upfront payment, within 180 days of receiving NCLT’s nod.The overall recovery is much higher than expected because of third-party guarantor payments and also due to some claims continuing after the OTS. IDBI Bank’s claim of Rs 644 crore will remain a liability to be paid based on the outcome of ongoing court proceedings. Blackstone-backed International ARC will be paid an additional amount of Rs 510 crore through third-party guarantors. All liabilities of the company will remain and not be extinguished until the last payment is made to the lenders within the deadline of 180 days as set in the OTS application.Section 12A of the IBC legally permits promoters to get back their companies if 90% of the lenders agree to their settlement plan. Vallal, a shareholder, offered a settlement proposal which NCLT-Chennai directed the committee of creditors (CoC) to consider and vote on. The proposal was subsequently approved with a 94.3% vote on April 6. Voting on the proposal was completed only after approval from respective boards of banks and the application is now pending with the NCLT. The liquidation value of the company has been estimated to be about Rs 209 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-adjourns-siva-industries-settlement-case-to-june-25/articleshow/83728388.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

I take this opportunity to thank and congratulate every single ‘Covid-19 warrior’ who has made this possible during these testing times,” Jagan tweeted. Earlier, at a review meeting at his Tadepalli camp office, he directed officials to expedite the works of construction of new medical colleges and complete them on a war footing. The officials informed the chief minister about details of the study regarding buildings, services and non-building services. He asked them not to compromise on standards and added that emergency plans should also be effective in evacuating patients safely in the event of unforeseen accidents.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors field strange requests in Covid wards||KOLKATA: Critical care doctors in Covid ICUs of the city have been coming across unique experiences involving patients and their relatives. Touching requests from families of moribund patients asking doctors to keep birthday cakes or ‘get well soon’ notes beside their beds are common. Conscious patients, who have been on oxygen support, have requested for sweets, mangoes or home-made food. A daughter even requested a smiling photo of her father be clicked when she understood that chances of his survival were bleak. In the cold confines of the Covid intensive care unit of Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) last month, critical care doctor Indudipa Sinha was surprised to hear a frail voice one morning saying: “Khush raho (Be happy)”. She heard the phrase twice. Turning around, she traced the voice to 85-year-old Subrata Sarkar, occupant of bed number 3002. “Khush raho beta, bhalo theko tomra. (Be happy, child, stay well),” Sarkar said again from his bed. It was a sunshine moment for all frontline workers of the ICU that day. But what made the incident more memorable was when Sarkar shared that he was the first anaesthetist of the same hospital. One thing led to the other and Sinha soon found that both were alumni of RG Kar Medical College. “He said he was 85. That meant I am exactly 50 years his junior. Though he was critical, he did not need ventilation. Soon, we were sharing notes of our canteen, the anatomy building, surgery building, students’ hostel and the administrative block. Then, I popped a request: ‘Sir, let’s take a selfie’,” Sinha said. It took a while for Sarkar to get over his apprehensions of “looking like a Santa Claus” if a selfie was clicked. But the heart-warming selfie that Sinha shared on Facebook of this unique reunion on May 31 has since gone viral. “He recovered, and was discharged too. Both my seniors and juniors from college got in touch with me after seeing our selfie. That was the most pleasant experience I had in the ICU,” she added. ‘Patient called kin to inform about docus’Critical care doctor Dipshikha Ghosh of Apollo Gleneagles was in the news some weeks ago for making a video call to a son who had sung Kishore Kumar’s ‘Tera Mujhse Hai Pehle Ka Naata Koi’ to his dying mother. In another incident, relatives had asked for a patient’s birthday cake to be offered, along with the meal. “This patient was already on ventilation and we kept the cake next to the bed,” Ghosh said. In another case, a relative had asked Ghosh to keep a ‘get well soon, Daadu’ card that his son had made for his grandfather inside the bag that would be used to pack his father’s last remains. Sinha recalled another incident with a critical patient who had wanted to make a video call to his family to inform them where their insurance and banks papers were kept. “It was late in the night, and he wasn’t sure he would survive. He insisted that no one else in the family knew where those papers were kept. I made the video call. Fortunately, the patient survived,” she said. In the case of another critical patient in his late 60s, his daughter and cousin requested for a smiling photo. “But he was in coma and we just couldn’t do that. I remember another incident of a wife asking us to allow her to be at the bedside of her husband while he was breathing his last. But she couldn’t reach the hospital on time,” she recalled. Last month, a Hindu doctor in Kerala was in the news after she had recited Islamic prayers for a patient on his deathbed. “I had another request from a mother who sent jam-jam (Holy water from Mecca) and requested me to keep it beside his bed. He understood the gesture but couldn’t express his feelings,” Sinha remembered. It was a poignant moment, when relatives of a patient in her mid-40s had requested Sinha to keep a picture of her deceased mother on her bedside. The requests were honoured but neither survived beyond three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-field-strange-requests-in-cov-wards/articleshow/83731234.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Dr Chandra Prakash Mohan, additional professor of paediatrics department at AIIMS-Patna, said about 60% are already infected, but 40% population is still vulnerable. If we maintain the Covid appropriate behaviour, the immune population would be increased up to 75% through vaccination. However, in today’s scenario, the rapid transmission rate is still high,” he said. “If 5,000 cases were reported in the second wave, 8-12% of them were kids and it has been estimated that their proportion in the next wave may increase up to 30%. People should not feel that the worst is behind us and should using masks and maintain social distancing,” he added. “The immunity level of kids between zero to seven is lower than those between eight and 18. Kids in the age group of zero to 5 are more vulnerable as the memory T-cell (antigen-specific T cells that remain long-term after an infection has been eliminated) in this age group is low,” Dr Mohan said. Former IMA-Bihar president Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said the third wave will not be very effective, because a large population will be vaccinated. “Besides, learning from the mistakes in second wave, the state has geared to tackle the situation,” he said. Former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics-Bihar, Dr Arun Shah, feels the third wave is inevitable. “The vaccination percentage in India is till at 4% when it comes to two doses. It is a sign that people need to be cautioned. Though, the second wave is going down, we still need to practise safety protocol even after vaccination,” he said. As far as predicting the time period of the third wave, Dr Shah said no one can be sure about it. “Yes, it may come but it will not be as disastrous as the second wave,” he said. Meanwhile, the state health department has set deadlines for different projects like setting up oxygen plants, preparation at government hospitals, focusing more on NICU and PICU wards, making availability of medicines among others to ensure that the state has full resources to deal with the third wave in case it strikes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/be-alert-stick-to-covid-safety-protocols-doctors/articleshow/83725524.cms||Faryal Rumi

Since June 1, Andhra Pradesh has recorded 66.9 mm of rain as against the normal rainfall of 62.1 mm. However, seven districts have recorded deficient rainfall. Officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that Rayalaseema recorded 89.2 mm of rain as against the normal of 52.9 mm between June 1 and 21. The region recorded over 69% above the normal rainfall till June 21. Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam comprising nine districts and part of Puducherry received 50.8 mm of rainfall as against the normal of 68.6 mm till June 21, deficient by 26%. Among the nine coastal districts, only two—Guntur and Krishna—received surplus rainfall of 4% and 7%, respectively while Nellore, Prakasam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam received deficient rainfall. East Godavari and West Godavari, the rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh, received 43% and 40% deficient rainfall in the period. “Southwesterly winds prevailed over many parts of Andhra Pradesh. Due to the winds, the monsoon has been subdued over many parts of the state. The southwest monsoon will revive over large parts of the state only after the formation of a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal,” said director of IMD, Amaravati, S Stella. The IMD predicted that thunderstorm and lighting are likely to occur at isolated placed over north-coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam from June 23 to 25. “Parts of AP will receive normal rainfall in the next phase of the monsoon and at present weather conditions are not suitable for an active monsoon. There are chances of formation of a low pressure area over Bay of Bengal which will activate the monsoon system in the state,” said OSRU Bhanu Kumar, retired professor, department of meteorology and oceanography, Andhra University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/rain-eludes-7-districts-met-says-revival-likely/articleshow/83725810.cms||Nalla.Babu

Till Monday the black fungus toll had reached 54 in the region. Most of the patients belonging to the region are being treated at the Banaras Hindu University hospital. Regarding the period between June 15 and Monday, hospital’s medical superintendent Prof KK Gupta said, “A total of 10 new cases of black fungus were admitted after which its tally had reached 199. Due to black fungus infection, 12 more lives were lost in this period after which the toll became 54.” The first black fungus case in the region was detected on April 30 when a patient had reached BHU hospital amidst the second wave of Covid-19. A 54-year-old Covid-19 positive and comorbid woman from Azamgarh was the first to succumb to this infection. Since then, the number of patients from east UP districts has steadily increased at the hospital. “Of the 199 cases of black fungus infection we treated, 14 have been discharged after getting cured so far,” said Prof Gupta, mentioning that surgeries have been conducted upon 118 mucormycosis infected patients at this hospital. “As many as 131 are under treatment,” he said adding, “only four of them are admitted in Covid ward while others are being treated at non-Covid wards of the hospital.” The menace of black fungus is continuing in the region at a time when the second wave of Covid is on decline. “At the super-speciality block of BHU hospital, where level-3 facility for critical Covid-19 positive cases is operated for the patients from east UP district, the number of patients has come down the to 50,” said Prof Gupta adding among 49 patients being treated there, 12 are those who had been shifted from DRDO hospital before it was made defunct on June 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/12-succumb-to-black-fungus-infection-in-one-week/articleshow/83727506.cms||---

The CM also laid foundation stones for 73 government buildings of 12 departments on the occasion. These buildings would be constructed at a cost of Rs725.22 crore. Thus, the CM on Monday launched total building projects worth Rs2,136.22 crore. The Bihar Sadan will be the third guesthouse of the state government in Delhi after ‘Bihar Bhawan’ and ‘Bihar Niwas.’ Covering an area of two acres, the building has 10 floors in addition to the basement and ground floor. It has altogether 118 rooms. There is a multipurpose conference hall with a capacity of 200 people and also a cafeteria to cater to 180 people there. The Bihar government’s Delhi-based liaison offices of energy, tourism, IPRD, water resources, finance, road construction departments among others would now function from the Bihar Sadan. The new building would cater to the needs of Bihari diaspora in Delhi-NCR more effectively and adequately. “People from Bihar would not face any difficulty in Delhi after the completion of the Bihar Sadan. They will get many facilities at the Bihar Sadan,” Nitish said. “The Bihar Sadan is expected to become an important landmark in the national capital symbolizing the public-friendly approach of the Bihar government. This house will act like a one-stop solution for all needs of people from Bihar,” said an official. Nitish said his government would also do some extension works in the Bihar Bhawan and the Bihar Niwas. He said the building construction department (BCD) has been given the responsibilities of maintenance of Bihar Sadan. He asked BCD secretary Kumar Ravi to make all necessary arrangements for its proper maintenance. The CM also asked the BCD officials to ensure proper maintenance of all those buildings constructed by the department. He also asked them to complete on time all the building projects for which foundation were laid on Monday. Highlighting the importance of fly ash bricks in view of the environment protection, Nitish said, “The fly ash bricks will also be used in all those buildings for which foundation stones were laid today.” Nitish said the state government was constructing a world-class guesthouse at Bodh Gaya at a cost of Rs136 crore. “People will get a 5-star hotel like facilities at the guesthouse once it is ready,” he said.

Also, it would receive complaints from people on violation of the forest and environmental rules and route the calls to the officials concerned for immediate action. Launching this call centre with the phone number 0612-2226911, the EFCC minister Neeraj Kumar Singh said that the environment, forest, ecosystem and biodiversity are closely related to people’s life and society. Principal secretary of EFCC Deepak Kumar Singh, principal chief conservator of forests AN Sharan and other officials were present on the occasion. At present, this call centre will function on all working days from 9.30 am to 5.30 pm, however, after reviewing the public response to it, the government may extend its timing to 24x7 in coming weeks, he said. Five physically challenged forest guards have been deputed to run this call centre. Neeraj said, “Many inquisitive minds wanted to know much more than what was learnt from other sources like the status of forests of particular area, conservation of wildlife and even guidance on developing agro forests and all such queries would be entertained and responded with authenticity.” People may also seek information on the Mukhyamantri Niji Paudhshala Yojana on plantation. As degradation of the ecosystems adversely affected the biodiversity, the call centre would help in their rejuvenation. He said, the call centre aimed at mobilising people’s participation in the state government’s initiatives through a two-way contact system. There were incidents of straying of wild animals to human habitats, illegal felling of trees, encroachment of wetlands and and polluting the air by various acts in different parts of the state.

---||Business||SAT clears vote on PNB Housing deal with Carlyle||TNN & Agencies Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Monday allowed PNB Housing Finance (PNBHFL) to hold its extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Tuesday, as part of the controversial Rs 4,000-crore investment proposal by PE major Carlyle Group and its associates in the mortgage lender. The SAT, however, has asked PNBHFL to not announce the result of the shareholders’ voting on the proposed deal, which is the most important part of the EGM. Earlier on Monday, PNBHFL had informed the exchanges that it was moving SAT after Sebi last week asked the company to not proceed with the preferential allotment to Carlyle and associates as the process did not confirm to mortgage lender’s articles of association (AoA). Sebi had also asked PNBHFL to appoint a new valuer for its shares and its board to consider the valuation given by that entity to finalise the price of the shares for allotment to Carlyle. While dealing with the matter, the two-member bench at SAT said that since electronic voting had already started, it was not fair to stay the voting process that dealt with allotment of preference shares at the EGM, scheduled on June 22. The tribunal members said that since the dispute related to interpretation of some provisions of Sebi’s Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements Regulations and Companies Act relating to the AoA of the company, the EGM could go ahead. The SAT also asked Sebi to file its reply by June 26. Sebi’s regulatory directive had come after SES, an institutional shareholders advisory firm, pointed out on June 8 that the allotment of shares to the PE major and its associates was ultra vires of PNBHFL’s AoA. SES had also said that the way the whole deal was structured, it was skewed against minority shareholders, currently holding about 15% in the mortgage lender.As part of the deal, Carlyle and its associates also announced an open offer to PNBHFL shareholders at Rs 403.2 per share. The deal is structured in a way that will eventually result in a change of management control of the housing finance company from Punjab National Bank, the PSU banking major, to the private equity major. On Monday, the PNBHFL stock on the BSE closed at the 5% lower circuit limit at Rs 702.4. Since the time it became public knowledge that the PE major along with its associates would become a majority owner, the company’s stock price had more than doubled within a month to its 52-week high of Rs 924 by June 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sat-clears-vote-on-pnb-housing-deal-with-carlyle/articleshow/83730173.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Water released from dam carry threat of buried bodies getting exposed||Prayagraj:With the level of the Ganga river continuing to rise and threatening to expose a large number of bodies buried towards the city side of the Phaphamau ghat, the Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) has now decided to step up the monitoring process of the buried bodies which could surface and cremate the same before they get swept off by the river water causing pollution. The threat to these bodies getting exposed has increased since rains have forced various barrages in Uttaranchal and UP to release water causing a rise in the level of the Ganga. The seriousness of the situation could be accessed by the fact that a total of 11 bodies were cremated by the PMC on Monday. With this, 41 bodies have been cremated by the hands of the zonal officer of PMC, Neeraj Kumar Singh since June 4. The level of water of river Ganga at Phaphmau ghat was 76.67 meters on Sunday evening which rose by 3 cm on Monday and the level of water was recorded at 76.70 meters. Likewise, 3,75,423 cusecs of water were released from the Haridwar barrage on June 19 and 1,93,263 cusecs on June 20. Similarly, 10,722 cusecs of water were released from the Kanpur barrage on June 19 and 15.156 cusecs on June 20. Hundreds of bodies are buried on the sandy banks of the Ganges between the two sides of the river (city and Phaphamau side). While on a visit to the site, local boatmen told TOI that there are many poor families of the rural areas of Prayagraj and neighbouring districts who, because of weaker economic condition, prefer to bury the bodies. Earlier, this was done on the Phaphamau side of the river but when the district administration started to cremate the bodies of corona positive patients at the Phaphamau ghat, the villagers started coming towards the city side of the river. “The Phaphamau side is far from the active current of the river and the soil is more alluvial and less sandy because of which the body gets decomposed in a shorter time. Moreover, as the bodies don’t get exposed by the current of the river, there are fewer chances of dogs and jackals getting hold of the corpse”, said 60-year old Gadhru, a local boatman. He added that since the bodies are buried in the sands this year, the strong currents are continuously eroding the banks and hundreds of buried bodies are facing the threat of getting exposed and if not attended, they would either be washed away in Ganga or animals would make a rush for them. The phenomenon of Ganga eroding its banks and the bodies getting exposed was first noticed on June 4 and the zonal in-charge of PMC cremated the bodies with the help of his team of PMC. Since then, 41 bodies have been cremated by Singh with the funds, around Rs 3000 per cremation, provided by PMC. Neeraj Kumar Singh said, “Monitoring has been increased on the ghat after the information about the rise in the water level of Ganga and the release of lakhs of cusecs of water from various reservoirs”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/water-released-from-dam-carry-threat-of-buried-bodies-getting-exposed/articleshow/83727240.cms||---

In that instance, too, an overhead power line had snapped and dropped into the water. But CESC claimed the snapped cable was for earthing, which is not supposed to carry electricity and the other lines were intact. “It appears that the station manager of Pailan CCC should have been more proactive in proper maintenance of LT OH lines and the divisional manager of Behala division as well as regional manager of South 24 Parganas should have monitored the line maintenance activities rigorously to avoid such incidents,” the report stated. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/official-suspended-for-electrocution-death/articleshow/83729002.cms||---

The cost of application forms will range from Rs 250 to Rs 1,000, depending on the courses. The candidates can apply for any number of subjects long as they fulfil the eligibility criteria. “Students will be able to apply only after their boards or councils publish the Class XII results,” an official from the institute said. St Xavier’s College, after J D Birla Institute and The Bhawanipur Education Society College, is the third institute in the city to share information on UG admissions. “Though we have not yet announced the date of of online applications, we have shared information about various undergraduate subjects and a tentative time for application, depending on the publication of their results,” said the official. The college has decided not to provide any hostel accommodation this semester. St Xavier’s University in New Town will admit undergraduate students through online tests, which will be held in the first half of July. All colleges affiliated to Calcutta University will also start inviting applications only after the state board Class XII (HS) exam results are published, which the council intends to publish by July. “The sooner the results are published the better it would be for us so that we can start the admission process.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Vamsadhara tribunal clears Neradi barrage construction||VIJAYAWADA: The Vamsadhara river water disputes tribunal on Monday cleared the state government’s proposal to construct Neradi barrage and have a head sluice to draw 8 tmcft of water from the river. The tribunal also directed Odisha state to acquire 106 acres of its land required for the barrage and hand it over to AP. The tribunal asked AP to pay compensation to Odisha for land acquired, including rehabilitation of people to be evacuated if any. The dispute had been pending before the tribunal since February 2006, after Odisha objected to the flood flow canal proposed with the construction of head sluice. Odisha said the head sluice would result in drying up the existing river bed. It also raised the issue of scientific assessment of available water in Vamsadhara at Katragada and Gotta barrage and the basis for sharing the available water between the two states. The tribunal declared that “the yield of river Vamsadhara at Gotta barrage is 115 tmcft and this shall be shared by both states on a 50:50 ratio”, which was initially agreed by the two states on September 30, 1962. The tribunal further held that even if the water level is excess or low, the same has to be shared proportionately. While clearing AP’s request to have head sluice to the left side of the barrage and draw 8 tmcft of water every year from June 1 to November 30, the tribunal noted the gates of head regulator of the flood flow canal on the side weir shall be closed on December 1 or earlier, as the case may be, i.e., as soon as total drawal of water equals 8 tmc and the gates shall remain closed till May 31 of next year. “The tribunal hereby permits the state of Andhra Pradesh to construct the Neradi barrage across river Vamsadhara with ancillary structures. The barrage will have a right head sluice of design capacity of 8,000 cusecs for meeting its requirements. The barrage will also have a left head sluice for meeting the requirements of the state of Odisha below Neradi barrage,” the order said. However, the tribunal asked Odisha to inform AP about the drawing capacity of the left head sluice within the next six months. It also directed that the head sluice at Katragada “shall be totally plugged and made completely non-functional immediately after Neradi barrage is commissioned”. It also constituted a supervisory committee to implement its orders. The committee consists of Central Water Commission chief engineer as chairman, followed by one representative each from AP and Odisha, with SE from the CWC as member-secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vamsadhara-tribunal-clears-neradi-barrage-construction/articleshow/83724793.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Patna||Bihar: Ganga likely to maintain rising trend for next few days||PATNA: The river Ganga in Bihar is expected to maintain a rising trend over the next couple of days, even as the rising water level might not touch the danger mark anywhere between Buxar on the west and Kahalgaon in the east. On Monday, the level of water was more than what it had been on Sunday all along its stretch in Bihar. While the danger level (DL) mark at Buxar is 60.32 metres, the Ganga was flowing at the 52.09 metre or eight metres below the danger level. The corresponding reading at Digha in Patna was 47.74 metre-point against the DL mark of 50.45 metres. Beginning from Gandhi Ghat, where the reading of the water level was 47.14 metre point against 48.60 metre DL mark, the gap between the existing water-level and the DL mark has been narrowing along the further downstream of the river towards Kahalgaon on the east. The water level was at 40.1 metre-point against the DL mark of 41.76 metre at Hathidah. Similarly, the reading at Munger were 36.53 metre against the DL point of 39.33 metre and it was 31.03 metre against the DL point of 33.68 metre in Bhagalpur. At Kahalgaon, the water level was 28.72 metre against the DL mark of 31.09 metre. “In the next 24 hours, the water-level is expected to go up further all along the downstream right up to Kahalgaon,” a WRD source said. The rising level of water in the river Ganga is on account of the fact that the basins of the rivers originating in Nepal and passing through Bihar, or those originating in the western Himalayas beyond Nepal, have received near continuous rainfall from June 15-16. The accumulated water has been flowing into the Ganga and passing along the downstream, state water resources department (WRD) sources said. The rivers like Yamuna and Ghaghra have been carrying their water into the river Ganga, as a result of which its level along its downstream stretch from Buxar to Kahalgaon, as well as Digha and Gandhi Ghat in Patna, and at Hathidah, Munger and Bhagalpur is increasing since June 19. The increasing trend is expected to remain steady for the next two to three days from Monday. In fact, on Monday, dense rain-bearing clouds had kept the sky overcast in seven districts – Patna, Nalanda, Arwal, Jehanabad, Vaishali, Bhojpur and Saran. Further, the IMD has forecast light to moderate rainfall in these seven districts, which might not be uniformly spread. “Water from these districts will flow into the Ganga, which naturally will maintain the increase in the volumet. Even in the last 24 hours till Monday morning, two districts in the Ganga basin received high rainfall – Khagaria (77 mm) and Samastipur (65 mm),” WRD sources said. From the point of view of floods, the redeeming point is that the level of water in the rivers Mahananda, Kosi and Gandak has been falling. “No significant amount of rainfall was received in Nepal on Monday,” the WRD source said. Meanwhile, West Champaran DM Kundan Kumar said on Monday that work was being done on war footing to restore the road communications and also repair the damaged bunds. Plugging of the breaches on the bunds and embankments was also being done. 52 E Champaran villages inundated Due to continuous rain for the last eight days more than 52 villages of Sugauli , Areraj , Keshariya and Sangrampur blocks of East Champaran district were inundated on Sunday night as Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bangari, Tilawe and Dudhaura rivers were in spate and touching danger level at four points near Dumariyaghat and Sugauli. The Burhi Gandak river overflew an embankment at Lalparasa village. According to disaster management sources, one Kajal Kumari (7) was drowned in the floodwater and her body was taken out by villagers . Anil Kumar, ADM and disaster management head has said that the flood waters entered 52 villages of 24 panchayats and 45,000 people have been affected by the flood. Around 4000 marooned people with their cattle are taking shelter on safer places at Kesariya, Sangrampur, Sugauli and Areraj blocks . More than 40 houses were eroded by the floods of Burhi Gandak river Bhawanipur village under Sugauli block and the homeless are taking shelter on NH-28A near Sugauli. More than 500 people are taking shelter on Champaran embankment near Bhawanipur under Keshariya block.

The man in his complaint has accused his in-laws of deceiving him by keeping him and his family in dark at the time of the marriage. According to the complaint, the man, who got married on April 28, had discovered his wife’s condition when he tried to consummate the marriage. He claimed the genitals of his wife were not fully developed due to which she was unable to establish physical relations with him. He said when he took his wife for a medical examination, it was discovered in the medical report that she was a transgender. “A resident of Shastrinagar married a woman from the Panki area of the district. After their marriage, the bride was found uncomfortable in making relationships with the groom, and told him that she had health issues. As the days passed, the man began to suspect that something was amiss. He finally took his wife to a gynecologist for a medical check-up. To his horror, he was informed by the doctor that his wife was a transgender,” the police said. The man lodged a complaint along with the medical reports of his wife on Sunday. Later, an FIR was filed under section 420 (cheating) of IPC against the bride, her parents and the mediator. “An FIR against eight persons, including man’s in laws has been lodged under relevant sections of the IPC, and investigations are continuing in this regard,” said inspector Kakadeo Kunj Bihari Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-files-fir-against-in-laws-for-misleading-him-to-marry-transgender/articleshow/83727856.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Behala pockets under water for fifth day||KOLKATA: Residents of vast stretches of Behala, including Natunpara-Adarshapally, Shyamsundarpally, Sarsuna and Shakuntala Park, were still waterlogged despite the sun shining after four overcast days on Monday. KMC, which sent several water tankers to the affected areas fearing an outbreak of enteric diseases, had to continue the services in select pockets. For the fifth straight day, pumps and underground reservoirs at several residences remained submerged and locals questioned why senior KMC officials have not bothered to visit these neighbourhoods. According to Subhajit Hore, a resident of Adarshapally, the water has begun to stink. “For the first time in four days, we were able to access drinking water. The water level has receded somewhat, but it is taking a lot of time,” he said. For Subhendu Das from Bangasree Pally, the situation has worsened each time KMC operated pumps to drain water from other parts of Behala. “Due to lack of planning and silted canals, we are suffering,” he said. Neighbourhoods like Khejuribagan and Subhas Marg are under waist-deep water and without power, and locals have had to use makeshift boats to move about. Local party workers are also using them to provide relief items. At Purbapara, water has entered ground floors of several houses. “We shifted the LPG cylinder, oven and utensils to the first floor last Thursday. Five days have passed, but water hasn’t receded,” said Rama Mistry, a local. At the Sarsuna and Shakuntala housing complexes, water has receded from the main roads, but the bylanes are still submerged. “With the dengue season around, we are worried,” said Rajarshi Sengupta, a school teacher. “The township was constructed with an open drainage system that has collapsed due to lack of maintenance,” said Shakuntala Park Cooperative Society chairman T S Kar. Even Sarsuna police station is inundated. “We had set up a garden, which has been destroyed,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/behala-pockets-under-water-for-5th-day/articleshow/83728962.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||‘Bengal has vaccine stock for 5 days to jab 3 lakh recipients daily’||KOLKATA: The number of Covid-19 vaccines administered on a single day hit the 3-lakh figure on Monday. Despite the government restricting the inoculation drive for the 18-44 age segments to only the priority groups, health officials hope for a boost for the drive with the back-to-back arrival of vials over the past few days. “The overall stock of vaccines is healthy for us to target around 3 lakh doses a day. We have the capacity and the infrastructure to administer even five lakh doses a day. We had done 4.75 lakh a day earlier, even when the 18+ group was yet to be included in the drive,” said state director for health services Ajay Chakraborty. “We currently have a stock that would last us about five days if we inoculate around 3 lakh people every day. We should be getting more vials in the next couple of days,” said a health department source. The inoculation drive hit a speed-breaker in May, when private hospitals had to shut shop as they were required to procure the vials on their own, after the central government asked the states to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers for the inoculation of recipients in the 18-44 age group. According to the directive, the Bengal government bought 18 lakh doses in May alone and placed orders for 22 lakh more. The last order was recalled only a few days ago after the Centre announced they would provide doses for all age groups for government Covid vaccine centres. While private vaccine facilities inoculating recipients of all age groups eligible for the doses, the state had reserved the 18-44 age group drive only for the priority group, including hawkers, transport workers, media professionals, kin of healthcare workers and domestic help. “The priority group in the 18-44 age segment is the first target to cover. We will increase the number of vaccinations as per the quantity of vails we receive,” said Chakraborty. On Monday, close to 3,21,549 doses were administered from 2,636 vaccination sites across the state. This is the second time in June that the number crossed the 3 lakh-mark, following the June 7 drive when 3,05,054 people were administered the vaccine. As on Monday, Bengal had administered 1,93,39,317 doses of which 1,49,89,052 were first doses and the rest second doses. In Kolkata, 22,48,117 recipients have got their first jabs, while 5,52,769 people have been inoculated with both the doses. In Kolkata, a total of 48,335 doses were administered on Monday. Even though the government has restricted the inoculation drive in the 18-44 age category to the priority groups, in Kolkata, the number of shots administered on people in the segment has overtaken that of other age groups. Despite being the last segment to be include in the drive—the date of rollout was May 1—8,52,486 people in the city in that age group had got their shots till Monday, against 8,05,539 doses in the 45-60 age group and 5,84,868 doses in the 60-plus age group. “Private hospitals opening up avenues for the inoculation drive, including setting up camps at workplaces, housing apartments and malls, have given a major boost to the inoculation in this category. We have been expanding the list of our priority group in this economically active age group from time to time. We have been told that there will be an escalation in the vaccine supply by the end of the month. In such a case, we will also scale up our operations,” said a senior health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-has-vax-stock-for-five-days-to-jab-3l-recipients-daily/articleshow/83728716.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Goa||Goa: As classes restart, students’ trek for Net resumes||Fifteen months after classes went online due to the pandemic, when the new academic year began on Monday, students in the remote hamlet of Surla in Sattari saw themselves trekking uphill yet again through dense forests in heavy rainfall for internet connectivity. Though teaching did not begin on the very first day of the new academic year 2021-22, anxious students in remote areas of Goa still had to find ways to connect with their schools about the upcoming lesson plans. Parents of students in remote areas of Sattari expressed fear that their children would once again suffer like last year, trekking through hilly and forested areas, risking wild animal attacks. Due to poor connectivity students of remote areas have to trek to higher altitudes in forested area to access network to attend online classes.“Students residing in Surla have to trek to uphill areas in search of network despite heavy rainfall. A tower has been erected since we appealed to authorities last year, but connectivity is expected to be provided in another month or so. We feel bad to see the students attending online classes by holding an umbrella in one hand and a phone in another,” said Surla panch member Suryakant Gaonkar. It is a similar struggle for students in other remote areas of Sattari taluka like Satre, Derode, Kodal, Maloli, Nanoda and Bambar areas of Nagargao panchayat, Caranzol, Kumthol, Shelpe Budruk, Sanvordem, Sonal, Dhave in Sanvordem panchayat, and Khotoda Malpan, Shelpe, Paikul, Murmune in Guleli panchayat. Although BSNL network is available in some parts of Sattari, students said the connectivity is not good enough to connect to live sessions. “We were able to connect to only around 20% of students on the first day, which may be because of network problems. Last year, many teachers travelled more than 15km from Valpoi to Sakhali town for connectivity. Teachers can travel to the place where they get the best connectivity, but it’s very difficult for students to manage,” said Fehmida Khan, a school teacher from Valpoi. In Gaondongrim, Canacona, a group of five boys trekked 300ft to a hilly forested area to be able to connect with their school teachers. “We can’t get connectivity if we sit at home,” said one of the boys, a student of Tudal High School, Tudal, Gaondongrim. “We narrowed down this area after roaming to different areas for network connectivity. Due to frequent disruption in the network, we lose track of what is being taught, but there is nothing we can do about it.” Villager Molu Velip said that schools are doing their best to continue with the teaching, but there is little that they can do about the erratic network. Students in various areas of Bicholim were equally affected, where locals said that the network was poor in most parts of the taluka, except town areas. “Students cannot concentrate on their studies when the network keeps fluctuating. I cannot get range in our house, as a result of which I have to come out of the house and find a place at a higher altitude,” said a student of government high school, Kudchirem. If students in remote areas are facing network problems, school authorities should take responsibility to identify a safe place for students to access their classes from, said Deelip Dhargalkar of the higher secondary teachers’ association. “If school authorities are finding this difficult, they should take the help of the education department inspector of the taluka and find a solution to the problem. Allowing students to struggle for two years due to network issues is negligence on the part of the state,” he said. Another problem is that many parents in remote areas also do not have the financial means to buy the mobile phones required for online education, depriving many children of access to online classes. Laxmi Talewad and Rakesh Talewad, both siblings studying in Class VI in a Valpoi-based school, said that they do not have mobile phones to attend online classes. “Our father works as a labourer and he could not afford a mobile phone for us,” they said. Nilesh Parwar, panch of Thane-Dongurli village panchayat, said that he prays that there are not untoward incidents reported due to such students from poor families going through immense stress over not being able to attend online classes for the lack of a device.

The accused, Sukhram Ganva (22), who also tried to snatch her mobile, fled via the vestibule but was nabbed by GRP at Dahanu Road station after the woman, who was alone, raised an alarm. The home guard on duty in the coach was absent and has been suspended.The woman fought off Ganva, a contract labourer employed in the track maintenance work, said Palghar GRP senior inspector Yogesh Devre. He added that Ganva had entered the coach with the intention of robbing the woman. He does not have a criminal record. Around 11pm, the woman boarded the train at Virar. When it reached Vangaon station after about an hour, she was alone in the compartment. She was speaking on her cellphone when Ganva tried to snatch her phone at around 11.55pm. She fought him off even as the train was moving. As the train approached the last station--Dahanu Road—at 12.05 am, she raised an alarm and alerted the GRP officials on duty at the siding platform number 4. The accused bit the woman on her hand and escaped through the vestibule. The cops moved quickly through the vestibule and nabbed him. Ganva has been booked under sections 354 (molestation) and 393 (attempt to robbery) of the Indian Penal Code and sections sections 137 (travelling without a ticket) and 162 (travelling in a ladies coach) of the Indian Railways Act. He has been remanded in police custody for two days. The police said that it would have been difficult to track the accused had he escaped as there are no closed-circuit television cameras on railway premises beyond Virar. Devre said a request has been made to provide cameras on all stations up to Dahanu Road as suburban trains terminate there.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Over 2,000 2008 DSC candidates given contractual employment||VIJAYAWADA: The state government has issued a GO giving contract jobs to 2,193 candidates who passed the 2008 District Selection Committee (DSC). Principal secretary B Rajasekhar issued the orders stating that the decision is to accommodate the DSC 2008 candidates “as a special case in the exceptional circumstances on humanitarian grounds.” He further said that the decision “shall not be taken as a precedent.” The change of recruitment process in 2008 had affected 4,657 candidates who appeared for the DSC examination that year. The changes were introduced after the qualifying exam following the Supreme Court direction that the candidates should have a Bachelor of Education (BEd) pass certificate and not Diploma in Education (DEd). However, with the candidates filing the case, the court directed the government to give only 30% jobs, leaving 70% for BEd candidates. Following this order, 4,657 candidates lost jobs in the recruitment in 2008, and had been making representations to the government for positive consideration. The government had constituted a committee of MLCs in 2018 to study and make recommendations on the representations of the DSC 2008 batch. The committee, after several meetings made its recommendations to the government, suggesting that these candidates may be accommodated as ‘vidya volunteers’ or teachers on contract basis or outsourcing. However, the government wanted the candidates to “undergo six months Bridge Course in Elementary Education recognised by the NCTE within two years from the date of appointment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/over-2k-2008-dsc-candidates-given-contractual-employment/articleshow/83725303.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Missing’ Dalit girl, eight, strangled to death with her trousers; family alleges rape||BAREILLY: An eight-year-old girl was found dead in a village cane field in Pasgava area of Lakhimpur Kheri district late on Sunday. She went missing in the afternoon. Her trousers were removed and used to strangle her. Villagers claimed she was raped and murdered. Police suspect the girl was killed after the accused possibly failed to rape her. They have registered a case of murder. The autopsy was conducted by a panel of three doctors, including a woman doctor. The girl belonged to a Dalit labourer’s family and she was the eldest among three siblings. Her father had gone to Punjab to work as a farm labourer on a contract and was expected to return home by Monday evening. The girl’s grandmother said, “My granddaughter had gone to graze goats along with me. In the afternoon, she said that she is going back home. But in the evening, I was informed that she didn't return home. We started searching for her and later found her dead.” After the girl went missing, the family started searching for her and later informed the police. Two teams were deployed to search for the missing girl and her body was recovered by a police team inside a cane field outside the village. Forensic experts were called to collect evidence from the crime scene as the family didn’t raise allegations against anyone. Senior superintendent of police Vijay Dhull and circle officer (Mohammadi) Abhay Pratap Mall also carried out investigation. The girl’s mother told TOI, “My daughter was very innocent. Why would someone kill her? We don’t have enmity with anyone in the village and we never harmed anyone. Someone must have done bad with her and killed her.” The SSP told TOI, “The autopsy is being done by a panel of experts and its report will confirm the possibility of sexual assault. The girl was strangled to death using her ‘salvar’. We didn’t see any other injuries on her body. There have been cases in the past where the victim was killed after a failed rape bid but we cannot confirm the actual reason in this case so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/missing-dalit-girl-8-strangled-to-death-with-her-trousers-family-alleges-rape/articleshow/83725509.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

In retaliation, the relatives of the deceased accompanied by some local residents attacked the house of the accused Md Hasnain and his wife Sanauwar Khatoon (35) and nephew Md Anwar (30). They also set Hasnain’s house ablaze and damaged a customer service centre at Khadi Bhandar Chowk. A car parked outside his house was also torched by the mob. Shravan, a farmer by profession, died on the spot. While Anwar succumbed to his injuries during treatment at a hospital in Samastipur, Sanauwar drowned in a ditch filled with rainwater in her bid to escape the mob fury. Hasnain, however, managed to escape unhurt. The trouble started on Sunday evening when Hasnain objected to a plastic pipe being laid by his neighbour Shravan to drain out accumulated rainwater near his house. Locals said the matter was settled after the intervention of some residents. At around 8am on Monday, Hasnain fired at Shravan when he was busy in draining out rainwater after cutting a portion of the road in front of the deputy mukhiya’s house. IG, Darbhanga range, Ajitabh Kumar rushed to the spot and inquired about the incident. The senior officials, however, described the situation as tense but under control. Samastipur DM Shashank Shubhankar said the incident took place following a dispute over draining out rainwater near the house of Shravan. His neighbour raised objections, leading to the death of three people from the two sides. He said additional armed police personnel and a magistrate have been deployed at the village to ward off any untoward incident. The DM said those involved in the incident would not be spared. “Raids will be launched once the situation becomes normal,” he said, adding a meeting of the peace committee was also held at the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dispute-over-draining-out-rainwater-claims-3-lives/articleshow/83724758.cms||Ramashankar

---||Ahmedabad||In year of mass promotion, more weight for Gujarat Common Entrance Test||AHMEDABAD: After announcing a mass promotion for Class 12 students based on merit-based progression, the state government now plans to increase the weightage of the Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GujCET) over class 12 (science stream) performance for college admissions in engineering and pharmacy courses. This is being planned to ensure a fair advantage to meritorious students. Every year a merit list for college admissions is drawn up by giving 40% weightage to percentile obtained by the candidate in GujCET and 60% weightage to the percentile obtained in Class 12 (science) board exams. “This year, however, the state education department is planning to give 60% weightage on GujCET and 40% for Class 12 (science) performance,” said sources in the education department. The exam date for GujCET is expected to be announced shortly after NEET dates are declared. The final decision on the exact weightage of GujCET to be for professional admissions will be taken by the state government. Kamlesh Joshipura, the former vice-chancellor of Saurashtra University, said there is a need to increase weightage in GujCET so that meritorious students don’t face injustice. He is also a member of the committee formed to look into the issues arising by giving mass promotion and to find an amicable solution for it, including evaluation of the academic performance of Class 12 students. Navin Sheth, the vice-chancellor of Gujarat Technological University (GTU), said that at a recent meeting between university vice-chancellors and state education department officials, the issue of giving 60% weightage to GujCET for college admissions was discussed. The state-level exam is held annually for science students seeking admissions in degree engineering, diploma and degree pharmacy courses in government, grant-in-aid, and self-financed engineering institutions in Gujarat. The decision on holding the GujCET will be taken after the Central government announces the dates for the NEET (National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test) and JEE (Joint Entrance Exam) for medical and engineering seats, said sources in the state government. Last year about 1.25 lakh students had taken the entrance test and this year a higher number of students are expected to take the exams. An estimated 1,40,000 students were expected to take the Class 12 board exam from the science stream this year. After cancelling the exams this year due to the Covid-19 situation, Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) said last week that it will use students’ performances in Class 12, Class 11, and Class 10 exams in a 25:25:50 ratio to evaluate their Class 12 results. The Class 12 results for science stream students will be announced in the second week of July. In the case of Class 12 general stream students, the results are expected to be declared online in the third week of July. The certificates will be handed out to the students in the last week of July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-yr-of-mass-promotion-more-weight-for-gujcet/articleshow/83736400.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh government mulls developing Ahobilam as tourist hub||AMARAVATI: Considered to be a rare historical hill shrine, Nava Narasimha Khetrams of Ahobilam Mutt, located in the middle of Nallamala forests in Kurnool district, is likely to become a fine tourist attraction in the state shortly as the tourism department is studying various options to make the group temples a tourist hub. The tourism department is contemplating to take the support of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) to develop the shrine. The development of Ahobilam temple will not only help religious tourism but also eco-tourism as it is located in the Eastern Ghats. “A journey into lush green forest to pay darshan to the historical Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple (nine temples) is a fascinating experience. The government should explore development of a theme park, dhyana mandiram, cottages and setting up of statues of Ramanujacharya, Annamaiah,” said Gopireddy Srinivasa Reddy, a historian. He said that it might not cost more than Rs 100 crore to turn the picturesque temple into the biggest tourist attraction not only in the state but in the country as one could rarely find such a peaceful temple environment. Ahobilam Khetram is considered one of the 108 holy shrines of Lord Vishnu as described by Alwarlu. Only two shrines—Tirumala and Ahobilam—from the state have found place in the historical holy places of Vaishnavaites in the country. The historians found fault with successive governments for their misplaced focus on development of tourism projects in the state. “I could not visit the shrine due to Covid-19 for last two years. Otherwise, I could not simply resist from making a trip to this historical shrine at least once in a year,” said Dr G Narayana Sarma, former professor of Anantapur, adding that it could even attract the youth as the neighbouring Nallamala forest offers many options for adventure tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-mulls-developing-ahobilam-as-tourist-hub/articleshow/83725692.cms||Samdani MN
---||Amaravati||Now, Andhra Pradesh government to e-auction minor mineral leases||AMARAVATI: The state government has decided to switch over to the e-auction route to grant leases for minor minerals. The existing system of granting leases through the first-come-first-serve basis is not attracting big investors into the picture, said the government. The government also hopes to increase its revenue through the new system. After studying the existing system of granting leases to minor minerals, the government found that serious entrepreneurs are not able to obtain quarry leases to undertake mining. Moreover, the applicants are keeping the mineral bearing areas idle, by not pursuing requisite clearances. Studies have also found that the applicants are trading areas under the existing system. Taking all these challenges into consideration, the government has decided to grant quarry leases of all minor minerals except sand through the e-auction route, similar to grant of mining leases of major minerals. The government has also decided to classify minor minerals into Part A with granite, marble and 31 minor minerals and Part B with all other minor minerals. Sand has been categorised under Part C. “We are hopeful that the new system will help clear the quarry leases faster with transparent allocation. It will also help fetch higher revenue to the state exchequer,” said mines and geology minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy. The minister said that it would also encourage serious entrepreneurs for promotion of mineral-based industries and increased compliance with sustainable mining activity. According to the proposal readied by the department, there will be a two-stage auction similar to the one being carried out for major minerals. The government would consider the existing lessees to continue the quarrying only if they are proved to have a high technical background and match the bid amount of e-auction. “The lease will be granted for 25 years for all minerals, 20 years for road metal and napa slabs and five years for gravel,” said an official. The lease will be granted only if the minimum extent of land is about four hectares (10 acres). “Bids will be finalised only if there are at least three bidders in the final stage of e-auction. 100% bid amount should be paid within two weeks of conclusion of the bid,” the official said. The lease holders should also show at least 10% production in the first year, 30% in the second year, 50% by the third year and above 60% by the fourth year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/now-govt-to-e-auction-minor-mineral-leases/articleshow/83736528.cms||Samdani MN

The arrest took place on June 16 after cops caught the accused, both of who are minors, from Penamaluru and Ajit Singh Nagar. Cops said coming from a conservative background, the victim feared approaching the police for a year as she was afraid that she would be taken out of college and married off immediately. She then approached Coalition Against Online Blackmail and Revenge Porn, a non-profit initiative by LawSikho who then approached the police with an assurance that her family would not come to know of the matter.

---||Ahmedabad||Weather, fewer Covid cases buoy travel spirit||AHMEDABAD: A spell of rain coupled with cool winds, lush greens, and a little post-Covid courage encouraged many to take short getaways last weekend. Hotels across Udaipur, Mount Abu, Saputara and Gir forest were nearly full with scores of Amdavadis stepping out after being cooped at home for long due to the second wave, a harsh summer, and curbs imposed by the government. “Destinations such as Polo Forest, Udaipur, Saputara, Pavagadh, Gir forest and Statue of Unity were sold out over the weekend. This time, summer vacations were completely wiped out by the second wave. Those who travel every year were a little less apprehensive,” said Manish Sharma, chairman, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI), Gujarat. “However, with the weather cooling off and Covid cases going down, there was optimism among people. But they are still apprehensive of air travel and prefer destinations that are easily accessible by road,” said Anuj Pathak, president, Tour operators and travel agents’ Association of Gujarat (TAG). People are preferring to drive down to nearby destinations where they can unwind. For instance, Prahladnagar resident Bhakti Kamdar stepped out with her husband, kids and friends for a getaway to Udaipur. “We came here on Sunday for a three-day stay. While we do enjoy long drives around the Aravallis especially in this weather, we are not really stepping out to any of the tourist places. We were looking for a break since long. Due to the pandemic situation, we picked holidaying over the weekdays instead of the weekend,” said Bhakti. In fact, in the coming week, there have been a good number of inquiries and bookings for destinations in Gujarat. “For the coming weekend, the tent city at Statue of Unity is fully sold out and we are expecting some traction in the days to come. Bookings have poured in huge numbers from Ahmedabad and Surat, among other cities,” said Nikhil Aggarwal, partner at a hospitality firm which manages the tent city at Statue of Unity. Aaryan Khole, a student, is travelling with his friends to Statue of Unity this week. “We were looking for a break and decided to head to SoU. We have taken all precautions and have got our RT-PCR tests done as well. We needed a change of scenery. With cases receding, we are looking forward to getting out of the house and moving about,” said Khole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/weather-fewer-covid-cases-buoy-travel-spirit/articleshow/83730517.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Kolkata||Schools send exam data, hope for parity||KOLKATA: Schools affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations have already sent the board-year students’ school assessment and project/practical scores for the council to arrive at their final results, based on the new formula. CICSE, which aims to declare the results on or before July 31, has asked schools to maintain all academic and attendance records of classes IX-XII. Principals welcomed the fact that schools’ own performance for six years would also be analyzed. “The details the council has gone into will help students. I like the idea of judging on school performance for six years. This will address lenient and over-strict corrections,” said a principal. With board exams being cancelled in the pandemic, CISCE has devised a strategy to mark the candidates. Back in April and May, the council had sent notices to schools, asking them to submit the board-year students’ marks. For Class X (ICSE), average percentage of classes IX and X scores, along with project and practical marks, were submitted and for Class XII (ISC), average percentage of XI and XII along with practical and project scores were given. For Class XII, ICSE scores, which the council already has, will also be considered. For students who had migrated from other boards, their Class X average marks (English + best four subject scores) were asked for. “We sent all the data long ago. We can now only analyze the formula and get a rough idea of how our children will fare,” said a principal. Schools also had to submit the respective institute’s performance details from 2015 to 2020, which will be used for computing ISC results. A school’s best average percentage during these six years will be considered and a benchmark standard deviation calculated on the percentage of all candidates in that best year will be included. The formula will also check the students’ general proficiency and subject proficiency. Subject raw theory percentage and subject raw marks have been used to calculate both ISC and ICSE scores. For ICSE, most parameters as that of ISC will be followed, except that the children will not have a previous board performance to compare. “Data from ICSE exams of 2015-20 were analyzed. Extensive scenario analyses were done, based on different subjects. The weightages were chosen to ensure fairness to all candidates,” said the council notification. City schools hoped the SC hearing on Tuesday will shed further light. Details on the improvement exams for candidates unhappy with the computed marks have also been given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-send-exam-data-hope-for-parity/articleshow/83728688.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Before resumption of the OPDs, intensive sanitization was undertaken to remove any remnants of the deadly virus anywhere in the departments. Roster of doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff for the different departments has been prepared for treating the non-Covid patients in the OPDs. JLNMCH medical superintendent (in-charge) Dr Asim Kumar said the OPD, general medicare as well as emergency services resumed in view of very few numbers of Covid positive cases and more specially in order to serve the non-Covid patients. “Everyone has been asked to attend duties diligently and provide healthcare services to patients. The departments have been thoroughly sanitized and made safe for non-Covid patients,” Dr Das said. JLNMCH, a Covid-19 dedicated hospital in the region since March 2020, was turned into a Covid care hospital in May 2021. It temporarily closed down OPD and general medicare services in order to focus on the Covid patients in the backdrop of sharp rise in the number of positive cases during the second wave. The JLNMCH, run by the state government, is a multispecialty hospital with 800 beds. Around 30,000 patients availed the OPD services at JLNMCH every month before the pandemic, a hospital source said. Bhagalpur civil surgeon Dr Umesh Sharma said the separate OPDs for different healthcare services, including emergency, for non coronavirus patients, has also been started at the Sadar hospital from Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhagalpur-hospital-resumes-opd-facility/articleshow/83725262.cms||Kumar Rajesh

---||Allahabad||20 June Solar electric power system emerges as the go to option during Covid||Prayagraj: Worried about the overmounting utility bill on account of the use of electric appliances, citizens of Sangam city including owners of big showrooms, farmhouses, community halls and marriage pandals are fast switching toward solar electric power systems in an attempt to reduce electricity charges. Agencies taking up the installation of solar power systems in Sangam city claimed that the absence of business during the first and second lockdown and secondly, business fraternity particularly owners of big showrooms, community halls, and marriage pandals owners who could not be able to earn profits due to hardly any customers showing up during the relaxations, were more enthusiastic to install both battery-based solar power system and on-grid solar power systems. Rahul Khare, director of a firm installing solar power energy systems told TOI that there has been a rise of 40 per cent in customers seeking installation of the solar power system to help reduce their electricity bills soon after the first lockdown. “There are two types of solar systems including off-grid (battery-based solar system with back up and saving and on-grid solar system (without battery system) which are in high demand in the city,” he added. He, however, said that people of the city are increasingly switching to an on-grid solar system as they only want to reduce their electricity bills. For them, no backup was required. But in rural areas, people prefer an off-grid system where a backup is needed. Khare further added, “The demand for solar power systems started gaining popularity after the first lockdown when the business community found it difficult to cope up with rising electricity bills at their residences as well as paying unwanted electric bills of their commercial sites\shops\showrooms.” In the past two years, the demand for solar power electric system has also increased in the semi-urban and rural areas and users often turn to it to eliminate their electricity bills. Sandeep Bhargava, a city-based businessman said, “Solar electric energy system is a clean energy initiative and we can cut down our electricity bills to a major extent. “We can utilize our roof as solar roof setups are already installed,” he added. Agencies involved in the installation of solar electric power system claimed that industrial units could also cut their electricity bills in a range between 30 per cent and 60 per cent by replacing the grid power supply with renewable energy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/20-june-solar-electric-power-system-emerges-as-the-go-to-option-during-covid/articleshow/83727009.cms||---

Investors across the globe had turned cautious after some US Fed officials turned hawkish about inflation and on interest rate in the world’s largest economy. Following this, Dow Jones had ended its Friday session more than 500 points (1.6%) down. The sensex opened at 51,888 points, down about 450, and soon dipped to the day’s low at 51,740. However, after the initial dip, the recovery was almost unidirectional with the sensex touching the day’s high at 52,629 points minutes before close when it finally settled at 52,574 — up 230 points on the day. On Monday, while foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 1,245 crore, domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 138 crore, BSE data showed. At the start of the week’s trading on Wall Street, Dow Jones index was up over 500 points which could give domestic investors some comfort on Tuesday. However, a strong rise in crude oil prices, to near $74/barrel, which is a three-year high mark, could unnerve some people, market players said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-vaults-889-pts-from-days-low-to-end-at-52574/articleshow/83729987.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat corona roller coaster: Sharp rise, steeper plunge||AHMEDABAD: On Monday, Gujarat recorded 151 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, the lowest daily tally since April 15 last year. This was even lower than the beginning of the second wave at 427 cases on March 1 this year. Analysis of the second wave across major states of India reveals that Gujarat recorded one of the steepest falls in daily Covid cases. According to Covid-19 data aggregator Covid19India.org, Gujarat on Monday was placed 12th in cumulative cases and 14th in active cases among Indian states. Analysis of the rise and fall of the cases reveals that from March 1 to April 30 – when Gujarat recorded the peak of highest daily cases at 14,605 – the cases rose 34 times in 60 days. But the fall was steeper, as the next 50 days saw cases fall by 80 times at 185 on June 20. To put the figure in perspective, India recorded eight times fall in daily cases from its peak till June 20 (from 4.14 lakh on May 6 to 52,978 on June 20) whereas the rise from March 1 to peak was 34 times from 12,270. In comparison, Maharashtra recorded its peak at 68,631 on April 18. From March 1 cases (6,397), it was 11 times. By June 20, the cases fell seven times at 9,361. Likewise, Kerala – ranking second in cumulative and third in active cases – recorded its peak at 43,529 on May 12. From March 1, it rose 15 times. By June 20, the cases fell by four times, revealed analysis. In fact, among the top 12 states in terms of cumulative cases in India, Gujarat was fourth behind Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan in peak-to-tail rate. The first three states have recorded more than 100 falls from its peak, reveal analysis. The second wave for Gujarat was monstrous compared to the post-Diwali surge in Covid cases. Before the peak of the second wave (14,605), the post-Diwali surge had witnessed a high of 1,607 cases on November 27, making the second wave nine times bigger than the first one. “Need of the hour is to start preparing for the future in terms of beds, oxygen and medicine. We are fortunate to see sudden rise and sudden fall in cases – many states are still witnessing plateau in terms of daily cases. The corresponding deaths have also reduced drastically in Gujarat,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “But we must not for a moment let our guards down. Covid, as we have seen from evidence from across the globe, is cyclic in nature, and our behavior would decide how fast the rise in cases would return.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-corona-roller-coaster-sharp-rise-steeper-plunge/articleshow/83729352.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||Kolkata gets its first standalone vaccination centre||KOLKATA: The city got its first standalone vaccination centre on Monday. With a capacity to inoculate 1,000 people a day, with the provision of scaling up the figure to 2,000 a day, the centre on Alipore Road, to be run by Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital, was inaugurated by transport and housing minister Firhad Hakim, along with Woodlands managing director Rupali Basu. Located around 200 meters from the hospital, Woodlands have rented the space for the permanent vaccination centre.  “It was my dream to see a private player come up with such a centre. Before the third wave hits us, in which we are told children could get infected, it is important that more and more people get inoculated. If a child’s parents, other relatives and domestic help are all vaccinated, the chances of a child contracting the novel coronavirus will be less. That is why more such centres are needed,” said Hakim. The Woodlands Vaccination Centre will have an automated temperature scanner — a contact-free automated device to check temperature — automatic shoe cover dispenser and an automated queue management system. The facility will operate between 9am to 7pm from Monday to Saturday. Slots can be booked on Co-Win. “Vaccination is now the only potent weapon with which we can win the war against Covid. This centre is planned, keeping in my mind to scale up the drive,” said Basu. At the inauguration were Binod Kumar, KMC commissioner and Soumya Purkait, joint secretary of the state health and family welfare department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-gets-itsfirst-standalone-vaccination-centre/articleshow/83728763.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Centre’s ‘major penalty’ notice on ex-CS Alapan Bandyopadhyay||KOLKATA: The Centre has initiated “major penalty proceedings” against former Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, asking him to respond within a month to the charges framed against him for failing to attend a Yaas review meeting in Kalaikunda with PM Narendra Modi on May 28. The proceedings, which can deprive officers of post-retirement benefits partially or fully if proved guilty, comes in the backdrop of a Centre-state stand-off over the 1987-batch IAS officer. The Centre first okayed a three-month extension for Bandyopadhyay as the state’s chief secretary but, four days later, directed him to report to and serve in Delhi. Bandyopadhyay chose to seek retirement on May 31 after the Bengal government refused to release him. The state then appointed him as CM Mamata Banerjee’s chief adviser for a three-year period. Bandyopadhyay, who suffered a bereavement in the family late last week, was unavailable for comment but senior Bengal government officials confirmed that he had not got “any formal communication till Monday evening”. “All legal formalities, however, should be complied with within deadline,” one of the officials said. The Centre’s latest notice, sent on June 16, has also asked Bandyopadhyay whether he would like to respond in person. It charges him with “failing to maintain absolute integrity and devotion to duty and exhibiting conduct unbecoming of a public servant”. The state government and CM Banerjee have already rebutted the charges against Bandyopadhyay. Inclement weather and lack of air traffic control permission delayed their landing at the Kalaikunda base, Banerjee had explained. She, along with Bandyopadhyay, had then met the PM and “sought his permission” to go to Digha for another Yaas review meeting, the Bengal CM had added. Banerjee has also repeatedly asked the Centre whether the action against Bandyopadhyay was a part of its “political vendetta and vindictiveness”. The letter sent to Bandyopadhyay informs him that the Centre proposes to hold “major penalty proceedings” against him under Rule 8 of the All-India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969, and Rule 6 of the All-India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958. The rules allow the central government to withhold “pension or gratuity, or both, either in full or in part, whether permanently or for a specified period” if officers are proved guilty. Bengal chief secretary H K Dwivedi has already responded to a department of personnel and training notice, explaining that Bandyopadhyay retired on May 31, that the state government chose not to release him to take up the Delhi assignment and that Bandyopadhyay was not even empanelled with the Centre. CM Banerjee had written to the Centre before about the state government’s inability to release Bandyopadhyay and questioned its move to summon him to Delhi barely four days after approving her request to let him continue as the state chief secretary for three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centres-major-penalty-notice-on-ex-cs-alapan/articleshow/83731141.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Kolkata||Calcutta HC rejects Bengal’s plea to recall NHRC probe panel order||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Monday dismissed the Bengal government’s plea to recall its last week’s order that directed the National Human Rights Commission to set up a panel for examining all post-poll violence complaints on record. A five-judge bench led by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal set aside the state’s recall-modification plea. “The way the state was proceeding in the matter that required immediate action did not inspire confidence,” the larger bench said while turning down the state’s plea. The state said it did not get an opportunity to probe the 3,423 complaints lodged with the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority and place a report before the court. “The court should have sent a copy of the complaints to the state before sending them to the NHRC,” the state pleaded. It also urged the court to “expunge” the remarks made against it in the June 18 court order, which said the state’s lapses would be taken “seriously” as contempt of court. State advocate-general Kishore Dutta submitted that the court should define “post-poll” violence. “Any violence cannot be called post-poll violence. We should be allowed to place facts so that everything can be resolved in this court itself. We have already taken action,” the advocate-general said. The bench, while noting the “serious objections” to the post poll-violence applications, said: “The order (June 18) was passed considering the number of complaints and police inaction. No prejudice as such was caused to the state.”“A chart of alleged action was sought to be produced in court, which was not supported by an affidavit. The advocate-general stated that he could vouchsafe for its authenticity,” the court said, adding that the state could place that report before the NHRC panel. Bench member Justice Harish Tandon wondered why the West Bengal State Human Rights Commission did not receive a single complaint even though 541 complaints reached the NHRCommission. “This is very dangerous and alarming,” he observed. Acting Chief Justice Bindal pointed out that complaints were pouring in one-and-a-half months after the assembly poll results. “The main allegation is that cops are not accepting complaints. How will people keep faith in the state administration?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-rejects-bengals-plea-to-recall-nhrc-probe-panel-order/articleshow/83731057.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Mela health officer, Haridwar CMO interrogated by SIT for six hours||DEHRADUN: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed by the senior superintendent police, Haridwar to look into the case of fake Covid tests conducted during the Kumbh, questioned the chief medical officer (CMO) Haridwar, Dr S K Jha, and the mela health officer (MHO), Dr Arjun Sengar, for over six hours on Monday. During the interrogation the CMO and the MHO passed the blame on each other, an official involved in the SIT told TOI. While the mela official said he was not responsible for the allotment of portal ID and passwords and the district health department was supposed to do the same and check what was being uploaded, the health department official claimed that it was the mela officials who hired Max Corporate Services despite the district rejecting it for not having proper credentials. The SIT had also issued notices to the private agency and two labs involved in Covid testing but their representatives couldn’t turn up citing delay in receiving the notice. The firms are currently under the scanner for having conducted one lakh fake tests during the Kumbh. “We have called Max Corporate Services’ representative and the authorities of the two labs, namely Nalwa and Dr Lalchandani path labs to record their statements. They have been given a deadline after which, if they don’t turn up, we will consider that they don’t have anything to tell us and we will proceed with the case accordingly. Till Monday, no one among the three private parties had turned up, claiming they received the notices late,” said an official from the SIT. According to an investigation by the health department, Max Corporate Services faked the tests, registered a single mobile number against dozens of samples and showed that hundreds of samples had been collected from just one house. Several sample collectors of the firm had never even been to Haridwar. After the scam was reported by TOI, an FIR has been registered and the police as well as the district administration have started their probes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mela-health-officer-haridwar-cmo-interrogated-by-sit-for-six-hours/articleshow/83725485.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Visakhapatnam||Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation moots ear-tagging cattle to end straying||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is planning on implementing a licensing and ear-tagging system to deal with the stray cattle menace in Vizag city. The radio-frequency enabled ear-tag is a 10-digit unique identification number. This would contain the details of the owner and the ward the cattle belong to. The GVMC has included this as an agenda item for its second council meeting scheduled to be held on June 23. The GVMC receives complaints about the stray cattle menace from the Vizagites on a regular basis. Under the new licensing system, the civic body would charge Rs 500 as the licensing fee for each pig and cow. The owners have to renew the licence every year. If the cattle or the pigs are found to be straying on the streets, a penalty of Rs 3,000 would be imposed on owners. The livestock should be reared in the designated places. The GVMC council would discuss a 136-item agenda, including the 11 supplementary items, in its second meeting on June 23. The agenda items pending from the first council meeting would also be discussed. The civic body has included an agenda item on collecting new user charges for garbage collection from the households as well as commercial establishments. While the monthly charges for the garbage collection from the households is fixed at Rs 120, the charges for the commercial establishments would depend on its size, capacity, and type of business. It would cost as high as Rs 15,000 for a five-star hotels. The agenda item would be introduced in the council for ratification. Opposition parties are against the GVMC’s proposal of collecting user charges for garbage lifting. CPI(M) corporator Dr B Ganga Rao said that the pandemic has caused severe economic distress to the public and businesses. “People have not still recovered from the losses caused by the pandemic. Now, these charges would only add to their burden,” said Dr Ganga Rao. The council meeting will discuss an agenda item on revision of honorariums to the mayor, deputy mayor and corporators. As per a government order, the honorarium of the mayor has been enhanced to Rs 30,000 from Rs 14,000. It has been increased to Rs 20,000 for the deputy mayor and Rs 6,000 for corporators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-moots-ear-tagging-cattle-to-end-straying/articleshow/83725482.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

In desperation, I contacted Hareshbhai, who came to Radhanpur where I live all the way from Palanpur to help me pay the fees. He was truly like a guardian angel who not only paid fees for the whole year but also assured me that fees for the entire BA three-year course will be taken care of!” an elated Rushda Ghanchi, 18, a first-year BA student at Radhanpur Patan district told TOI. She is not the only one. Hareshbhai Chaudhary, syndicate member of Hemchadracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) and also chairman of Sadbhavana Group, has been travelling widely during the pandemic helping hapless students who had lost their parents to the dreaded virus, find their feet once again. So far, Chaudhary has travelled to five districts of North Gujarat in the past seven days and has helped 68 such destitute Covid-hit students as part of the University’s social responsibility as an effort to ensure all of them complete their graduation without any financial interruption.“It is my responsibility,” says this ‘guardian angel’, “to help students who have lost their parental support to find a hand to hold. I am particularly concerned about their studies and that it should not get affected owing to financial distress.” Earlier on June 1, the registrar of HNGU had called for data from 400 colleges in five districts of North Gujarat to know the exact number of students who had lost their earning members of the family. These colleges are spread in five districts including Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Aravalli, Mehsana and Patan. It was revealed that 68 students were in dire need of financial help. It was left to HNGU syndicate member and Sadhbhavna group chairman Hareshbhai Chaudhary to go around assuaging the feeling of deprived students that they will not have to worry about their academic career over financial constraints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/hngu-syndic-turns-guardian-angel-for-covid-hit-students/articleshow/83725662.cms||---
---||Pune||Police book man for posing as Army officer, duping 50 youths with job bait||PUNE: A 21-year-old woman has accused her husband of posing as an Army officer and duping her brother and 49 other youths by promising them Army jobs. The woman has lodged an FIR with the Bibvewadi police, in which she claims the man issued bogus joining letters from the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla; and Ammunition Factory, Khadki. Police said they had yet to record statements of the other youths and pegged the total value of the scam to be around Rs60 lakh. As per the FIR, the woman stated she found the man’s lost Aadhaar card in May 2020 and returned it to him. The man became close to the woman, the FIR stated. “Eventually, the man claimed he was a major in the Army and showed her a photograph and identity card,” assistant inspector Rajesh Usgaonkar said on Monday. The couple got married on June 20, 2020. A week later, the man said he would help her brother get an Army job and took Rs2 lakh, police said. “The suspect also collected between Rs60,000 and Rs1.5 lakh each from his wife’s relatives and acquaintances in Khed and Ahmednagar and issued ‘appointment’ letters. He then said he was to be conferred a medal for gallantry and had to move to New Delhi for two months to practise for a parade,” Usgaonkar said. That was the last she saw of him. after a few evasive responses, the man stopped answering her calls. The woman eventually learned that he was not an Army officer; the youths realised the letters were fake when they reported for duty. “He said his parents were no more and he had no relatives. I got my daughter married to him as I thought he was from a good family,” her father said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-book-man-for-posing-as-army-officer-duping-50-youths-with-job-bait/articleshow/83730511.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Ahmedabad||More weight to Gujarat Common Entrance Test than Class XII results||AHMEDABAD: After announcing mass promotion for Class XII students with merit-based progression, the state government now plans to increase the weight given to the Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GujCET) over the Class XII (science stream) performance for admissions to engineering and pharmacy courses. Every year, a merit list for college admissions is drawn up giving 40% weight to the candidate’s percentile in GujCET and 60% to the percentile in the Class XII (science) board exams. “This year however, the state education department is planning to give 60% weight to GUJCET and 40% to the Class 12 performance,” sources in the education department said. Kamlesh Joshipura, former vice-chancellor of Gujarat University there is a need to increase weight given to GujCET so that deserving students don’t face injustice. He is also a member of the committee formed to look into the issues arising from the mass promotions and to find solutions to them, including evaluation of the academic performance of Class XII students. Navin Sheth, vice-chancellor of Gujarat Technological University (GTU) said that at a recent meeting between university vice-chancellors and state education department officials, the issue of giving 60% weight to GujCET for college admissions was discussed. The state-level exam is held annually for science students seeking admission to degree engineering, diploma and degree pharmacy courses at government, grant-in-aid and self-financed engineering colleges in Gujarat. The decision on holding GujCET will be taken after the Central government announces the dates for the NEET (National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test) and JEE (Joint Entrance Exam) for medical and engineering seats, sources in the state government said. The exam date for GujCET is expected to be announced shortly. Last year around 1.25 lakh students took the entrance test and this year more students are expected to take the exam. An estimated 1,40,000 students were to take the Class 12 board exams from the science stream this year. After cancelling the board exams this year due to the Covid-19 situation, Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) last week said that it will use students’ performances in Class XII, XI and X exams in a 25:25:50 ratio to tabulate their Class XII results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/more-weight-to-gujcet-than-class-xii-results/articleshow/83730509.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The HC had directed the state government to constitute a new board before Tuesday. Ever since the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA took over the reins of the government, there had been a dispute over the appointment of chairmen of trusts for two popular temples—Shirdi and Pandharpur. While deputy CM Ajit Pawar of NCP staked claim to the Shirdi trust saying six of the eight legislators in the district belong to the party, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat argued for a Congress nominee since he belongs to Ahmednagar and he is also the guardian minister of the district. After a marathon meeting on Tuesday, Thorat agreed to Pawar’s proposal to nominate NCP legislator Ashutosh Kale as the head of the Shirdi temple trust while a Congress nominee will lead the Pandharpur trust.The decision was taken at a meeting attended by Congress nominees Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan, Shiv Sena’s Subhash Desai and Eknath Shinde, and NCP’s Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil. The row over the Siddhivinayak trust was resolved in November 2019, as it was allotted to Shiv Sena and senior party leader Aadesh Bandekar was appointed as its chairman. The dispute to appoint heads for the Shirdi and Pandharpur temple trusts was long drawn though. The Shirdi temple trust has fixed deposits of Rs 2,500 crore, 500kg gold and 5,000kg silver, according to outgoing chairman and BJP leader Suresh Haware. Meanwhile, Thorat said no decision was taken on the appointment of chairmen for Mhada, Cidco and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board while an in-principle decision was taken for the rest of the boards and committees. “We have a total of 150 boards, corporations and committees. An allocation has been made among the three parties, which will have to decide their nominees,’’ Thorat told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/shirdi-trust-row-ncp-gets-to-name-chairman/articleshow/83763222.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The notification, issued by state health commissioner Jai Prakash Shivahare, stated that 213 of these doctors are currently working with private hospitals, whereas 799 others have not responded to the notice from the department. ‘A show-cause notice will first be issued on why action under the Epidemic Diseases Act should not be taken against them. If the doctors have already paid their bond, a copy showing this should be submitted to the CDHO of the district to cancel the notice. If a doctor is already working with a state government-run or GMERS hospital, proof of it should be presented to CDHO,’ the notification states. The notification states that if any doctor is on notice period with a private hospital, evidence of it should be presented. If candidates are not fulfilling any of these conditions and do not respond to the notice in seven days, they will face an FIR under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the notification adds.

---||Mumbai||Nipah virus found in two bat species in Maharashtra by NIV team||MUMBAI/PUNE: The deadly Nipah virus has been found in two species of bats in Maharashtra for the first time by scientists from the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV). The Nipah-carrying bats were found in a cave in Mahabaleshwar in Satara in March 2020. Dr Pragya Yadav, the study’s lead investigator, told TOI that none of the bat species in Maharashtra had previously shown exposure to Nipah. The virus, usually found in bats, features in the top 10 priority list of pathogens identified by the World Health Organisation, and its transmission to humans has resulted in deadly outbreaks across the world. The NIV findings were published recently in the peer-reviewed and indexed ‘Journal of Infection and Public Health’. The article states that India has witnessed four Nipah outbreaks (see box) so far. Nipah is considered dangerous as there is no medicine or vaccine, and the death rate is high. While the case fatality rate in Covid is between 1% and 2% in most Indian states, CFR in Nipah infections ranges between 65% and 100%. In recent years, bats have been found to harbour other risky viruses such as Ebola and Marburg that have caused outbreaks. The Covid pandemic, too, is believed to be linked to bats. The NIV team looked at Pteropus medius, Rousettus leschenaultii and Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats that are common in India. It trapped 65 leschenaultii and 15 pipistrellus bats and collected blood, throat and rectal swabs in the Mahabaleshwar cave from the anaesthetised bats. Detailed lab work showed anti-NiV antibodies in 33 leschenaultii and 1 Pipistrellus bat sample. “In investigations during the last decade, NiV (Nipah) activity could not be detected in leschenaultia bats, despite processing several hundred bats, including bats from the same location,” said the research paper. So, leschenaultii bats were found to harbour Nipah for the first time in India. “The roost which was sampled was age-old and the virus might have been circulating at low levels and not detected during earlier studies,” said Yadav. Alternatively, she said, the virus could have been newly introduced from medius to leschenaultii bats.The team isn’t worried about the pipistrellus bats. “Their role in virus spillover to humans appears remote as they are insectivorous,” said Yadav. As they shared the same habitat as the leschenaultii bats, they tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nipah-virus-found-in-two-bat-species-in-state-by-niv-team/articleshow/83732712.cms||Malathy Iyer

This was announced on Monday by Union home minister Amit Shah who was in Ahmedabad to attend a series of functions. Talking to reporters after visiting the vaccination centre at Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay hall in the city, Shah said: “We will fast achieve the goal of vaccinating almost everyone.” He went on to say: “The decision of the PM to provide free Covid-19 vaccination to everyone is a very important and historic decision.” Shah added: “We have a high vaccination rate in the world against 1 lakh population.” Shah appealed to people who are eligible for vaccination to get their first jab and those who have taken their first vaccine dose to take the second shot in line with the guidelines. “Now we will reach the target to vaccinate almost all very fast,” Shah said after visiting the vaccination centre in Bodakdev area of Ahmedabad. Later, speaking after a meeting with state government functionaries in Gandhinagar, Shah said, “I visited vaccination centres in Ghatlodia, Kalol, and Gandhinagar. The government has started vaccinations efficiently across 5,000 centres.” On Monday, the state launched a spot-registration facility for beneficiaries in the age group of 18 to 44 years along with a mega vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vaccination-pace-to-be-boosted-amit-shah/articleshow/83730593.cms||---

These differences of opinions came out in the open during an online meet on Sunday between academics from across the state and the education department. The meeting chaired by school education minister Varsha Gaikwad was part of the ongoing process to take inputs from various stakeholders before finalizing the policy on how to calculate marks for HSC. Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJTA), said overall the discussion was ‘fruitful’ but still clarity is needed on the crucial aspect of on the basis for tabulating marks. Gavhankar said, “During the meeting, we strongly backed the inclusion of SSC marks for HSC tabulation. This is because SSC was the last exam which was fairly evaluated by external examiners. I am not saying that internal exams are done unfairly, but during SSC, there is a level-playing field because question papers are prepared by a special committee. Then evaluation is done by unknown externals, so any chance of a bias is ruled out.” He added that opposition to inclusion of SSC marks came from some academics from western Maharashtra. “Some from Kolhapur and Pune districts felt that there was no need to include SSC marks as enough evaluation had been done in Std XI when there was no Covid-19. They believe that internal evaluation of Std XI and whatever tests conducted during Std XII should be the benchmark for HSC marks tabulation,” said Gavhankar. But ground reality in certain parts of Vidarbha is not conducive to such a policy, feels Gavhankar. “When it was my turn to speak, I pointed out that in places like Gadchiroli, there are many students who have not been able to attend online classes and as such, there’s no chance of them getting evaluated. Hence, using SSC as a benchmark solves multiple problems and gives us a strong basis for arriving at a policy that is fair and equitable,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/opinion-divided-over-hsc-marks-tabulation-policy/articleshow/83729846.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

A visit to the city’s largest mall in the Untawadi area revealed that all 108 shops had reopened. The mall authorities said that they are observing Covid-appropriate behaviour and the footfall will not go beyond the 50% limit. The malls were also optimistic about being allowed to operate over the weekends as the Covid situation in Nashik improves further. “We have received a lot of calls from people. We expect the footfall to start increasing after two or three days,” said Supriya Arora, the marketing officer of the City Centre mall. “We have introduced a footfall tracking system. It shows how many people are inside the mall at any given time. This helps us regulate the entry of customers,” she said. Pramod Dahe, an official of the electronic outlet in the mall, said, “We had around 150 people in just two hours after opening the shop on the first day. But most people are still unaware that the malls have reopened. The number of visitors will start increasing soon.” Ishant Ilode, another shopkeeper, said the majority of the business takes place on weekends. “We hope the Covid scenario will improve and the government will allow us to do business on weekends,” he said. “We were waiting for the mall to open. All Covid safety protocols are being maintained here,” said Sudhir Jagtap, a customer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-malls-welcome-customers-after-2-months/articleshow/83728182.cms||Tushar Pawar

My mother is a homemaker and I was left without any means to pay my college fees. In desperation, I contacted Hareshbhai, who came to Radhanpur where I live all the way from Palanpur to help me pay the fees. He was truly like a guardian angel who not only paid fees for the whole year but also assured me that fees for the entire BA three-year course will be taken care of!” an elated Rushda Ghanchi, 18, a first-year BA student at Radhanpur Patan district told TOI. She is not the only one. Hareshbhai Chaudhary, syndicate member of Hemchadracharya North Gujarat University (HNGU) and also chairman of Sadbhavana Group, has been travelling widely during the pandemic helping hapless students who had lost their parents to the dreaded virus, find their feet once again. So far, Chaudhary has travelled to five districts of North Gujarat in the past seven days and has helped 68 such destitute Covid-hit students as part of the University’s social responsibility as an effort to ensure all of them complete their graduation without any financial interruption. “It is my responsibility,” says this ‘guardian angel’, “to help students who have lost their parental support to find a hand to hold. I am particularly concerned about their studies and that it should not get affected owing to financial distress.” Earlier on June 1, the registrar of HNGU had called for data from 400 colleges in five districts of North Gujarat to know the exact number of students who had lost their earning members of the family. These colleges are spread in five districts including Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Aravalli, Mehsana and Patan. It was revealed that 68 students were in dire need of financial help. It was left to HNGU syndicate member and Sadhbhavna group chairman Hareshbhai Chaudhary to go around assuaging the feeling of deprived students that they will not have to worry about their academic career over financial constraints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/hngu-syndic-turns-guardian-angel-for-covid-hit-students/articleshow/83725679.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccination drives begin in slums with leg up from donors||MUMBAI: Last year, Indra Nagar area in Mulund was among the first slum pockets in the locality to be hit by Covid-19. On Monday, slum dwellers hoped the worst was behind them as they lined up at a temple hall to get vaccinated. With the civic body’s vaccination centre still not open to all, the drive was conducted by private hospitals and funded through donors. In other slum pockets across the city too, donorships are enabling vaccination drivesMLA Mihir Kotecha, who facilitated the drive in Mulund, said the plan is to take vaccination to the slums and give the jab to up to 10,000 persons across age groups. “We have started from Indra Nagar slum no. 2, but we want to take the drive to other areas in the constituency too. During Monday’s drive, the locals were initially hesitant and our party workers had to convince them to take the jab,” said Kotecha, who had sent out an appeal asking locals to sponsor a vaccine shot at Rs780 per dose for the less privileged. In 24 hours, Kotecha received close to Rs10 lakh. A similar vaccination drive has been organised in the slum pockets of Cuffe Parade such as Ganesh Murti Nagar, Shiv Shakti Nagar and Machimar Nagar. Local corporator Harshita Narwekar said they have already received a pledge for 5,000 vaccines. “We were also keen on going into the slums and getting the locals vaccinated, but Internet connectivity issues proved a hurdle and hence we selected Ashoka Hall at Nariman Point. The vaccination drive will be conducted in batches,” she said. In Andheri, MLA Ameet Satam said those from slums of Nehru Nagar, Kapaswadi will be vaccinated at Vidyanidhi High School premises in Juhu. “We have undertaken a registration drive over the past few days to get those from slum pockets vaccinated. We have managed to collect around Rs16 lakh through contributions from generous donors which will be used to vaccinate close to 2,000 people from slum pockets,” said Satam adding the drive will be held on June 25-26. Corporator Nehal Shah found a novel way to prevent vaccine wastage and provide vaccines to the less privileged when she organised a drive in her ward in Matunga recently. When a few people who had registered did not turn up, she asked them if they would want to donate their dose for the less privileged. “Most people were willing and through their slot we got a few hawkers, taxi drivers and shop employees vaccinated,” said Shah. Battling vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge in Ganpat Patil Nagar, one of the largest slum pockets in Dahisar, though. Shiv Sena’s Abhishek Ghosalkar said, “Many slum dwellers are daily wagers and house helps. We were ready to organise buses to get them to the centre, but the response has been poor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-drives-begin-in-slums-with-leg-up-from-donors/articleshow/83730618.cms||Richa Pinto

A public programme at the Kalol APMC was cancelled by Shah, keeping the pandemic in mind. He met a few people and left without giving a speech after the formal inauguration. Shah inaugurated Vaishnodevi flyover, Khodiyar Container Depot flyover, and the newly built railway overbridge on Chattral-Panser road. Shah tweeted: “Inaugurated Vaishnodevi and Khodiyar Container Depot flyover and Panser railway overbridge, which will make commuting easy...”. The tweet added: “I appreciate the work of the Gujarat government which has completed these developmental works on time under the leadership of Modiji in this coronavirus pandemic time.” Shah said later in Gandhinagar, “Central and state governments have jointly taken up the Rs 864 crore six-laning project of the 44km SG Road. Of the six overbridges planned, four have been completed.” He said that this will ease the traffic congestion on SG Road significantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bridges-apmc-building-opened/articleshow/83730648.cms||---

While the staff at this facility, including doctors, is still on duty, senior officials of the Covid facility said they will be now be reporting the status of the facility to police commissioner Deepak Pandey to seek his guidance. After the second wave of Covid, the Covid centre of the police was re-started in March. Nodal officer Prashant Devre said treatment was provided to over 400 patients over the past three months. A total of 133 police personnel or their relatives were admitted at the centre. Meanwhile, more than 2,500 antigen tests have also been conducted at this centre. Devre said the Covid facility was for the police personnel of the city, rural police and the Nashik Road Central Prison and the relatives of the personnel. Now when the overall infection rate has dropped in the district, the admissions have stopped at the Covid facility.  Pandey had set up the centre last year when the infection rate was at its peak during the first wave. The Covid centre was extremely useful for police personnel and their relatives. After the cases reduced, the centre was closed and re-opened in March when cases began to increase during the second wave. Pandey will be deciding on whether to continue with the facility or close it, said medical officers of the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-facility-at-police-hq-in-nashik-has-no-patients/articleshow/83728186.cms||Santosh Sonawane

There, in the lap of nature, where internet connectivity is the best in the region, students from primary to graduation levels, who live within the KDHP tea plantations, take up their socially distant seats to do online education. This, however, is not an isolated incident. Of the 1,02,762 school students in the Idukki district who have enrolled for online education, "over 14,000 students are facing connectivity issues hindering their online education," said a senior official in the education department who has preferred anonymity. While most of these students at least have gadgets, "presently, there are 1,185 students in the district who are deprived of any means to undergo online education," says Saseendra Vyas, Deputy Director of Education, Idukki. Even as the state government began its first-bell regular online classes on Monday, for the students in the tribal and plantation areas in Idukki, education during Covid-19 times remains a distant dream. The plantation areas in Munnar and tribal settlements in Adimali, Munnar, Mankulam, Edamalakkudy are mostly devoid of steady internet connectivity affecting the students in these regions. Samagra Shiksha Kerala (SSK), Idukki is planning to open 21 more centres in Munnar and other remote areas in the district to aid online schooling. "At present, 143 centres (113 run by SSK and 30 under the tribal department) are functioning in the district," said Bindumol D, district programme officer of SSK. She added that students of Edamalakkudy, the first tribal panchayat in the state have been accessing online classes on television sets. Meanwhile, Idukki district collector H Dineshan told TOI that plans are afoot to solve the network issues in the district. "The KDHP company has assured the district administration that they will ensure proper net connectivity under their estates soon. They have already arranged a proper network facility in Rajamala. "The private player Jio has begun setting up mobile towers in private properties. The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) will issue an order to fix Jio towers in 12 locations. The geographical condition of the district is also a hurdle to ensure proper network in all areas," the collector said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai and Maharashtra record lowest Covid cases and deaths in months||MUMBAI: Blame it on the weekend effect, but both Covid-19 cases and deaths in Maharashtra and Mumbai were low on Monday. The state reported 6,270 cases, lowest in 118 days since February 23 (6,218). Maharashtra also reported lowest fatalities in three months— 94, lowest since March 22 (58). The government’s daily update said Mumbai registered 518 cases—lowest since February 16—and seven deaths—lowest since June 8. The BMC’s Covid update said 26,286 tests were performed in a 24-hour span and test positivity on Monday was among the lowest registered in the city at 1.9%. However, due to dip in testing over the last 24 hours, daily positivity in the state rate rose to 4%. Only 1.5 lakh tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, down from the 2.3 lakh on the weekdays. Total caseload rose to 59.7 lakh and with 258 deaths added from previous weeks and months, cumulative fatalities touched 1,18,313. On the bright side for Mumbai, number of tests on Sunday were not as low as on previous Sundays, indicating that the infection rate is low in the city at the moment. However, a senior doctor said the second wave’s decline in Mumbai should have been sharper like in Pune and Delhi. The city still has 18,529 active cases including almost 1,000 critical patients. In most hospitals, both public and private, beds are easily available. In BMC-run Sion Hospital, less than 100 Covid-19 patients are admitted at the moment as compared to the 350-plus in April. “We have started non-Covid operations in the hospitals including some super-specialty ones,” said Sion hospital dean Dr Mohan Joshi. State officials also said that in certain districts like Satara, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri , Beed and Osmanabad, cases have begun to decline but the Covid indicators are at a relatively higher level. These districts have been asked to ramp up testing and focus on vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-and-state-record-lowest-cases-and-deaths-in-months/articleshow/83732794.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Nashik||Migrant workers start returning to Nashik||NASHIK: Migrant workers, who had left Nashik during the second Covid wave in March, have now started returning. A visit to the station on Sunday revealed that the bulk of the passengers deboarding trains from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, etc. at the Nashik Road railway station were migrant workers returning in search of work. “Staying back in my hometown Bhagalpur, in Bihar, is of no use as there is no employment opportunity there. Many of us are already here and others are about to begin their journey soon,” said Sanjay Prasad, a 19-year-old who alighted at the Nashik Road station. There are at least 100 passengers who deboard the trains coming form Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal etc., and most of them are workers. “The trend started in the beginning of June when the ‘Break the Chain’ relaxations were announced,” Rakesh Kuthar, the station manager Nashik Road railway station, said. Ramesh Pasi, a worker from Lucknow, said, “My uncle, who works in the factories in Malegaon and Sinnar. He came here and created an opportunity for me. He called me and three of my relatives. Here we have better prospects.” Most workers coming to Nashik generally work in the construction sector or at factories. “The workers from UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha work hard and do whatever they are told. They also tend to pick up the trade faster. The industries rely on this workforce. So when one worker says he has a relative who is ready to work, we call them,” said Sanjay Patel, an industrialist from Sinnar. It is the same in the construction sector. “These workers can work in highrise buildings — it is a sort of their specialty. When they had returned to their hometowns, there was a shortage of such workers. The trend has started to reverse,” said Ravi Mahajan, the president of Credai’s Nashik unit. Mahajan added only 20% of the workers have returned so far, but the pace is picking up and normalcy is likely by the end of June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/migrant-workers-start-returning-to-nashik/articleshow/83728195.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The boy Burhanuddin Jetpurwala’s aunt Mariyam and uncle Asgar Ali, who live in Kutiyana of Porbandar district, had planned to take their two children to the resort as it was Sunday. Asgar Ali had asked Jetpurwala’s father Murtuza, a trader, to drop him to the resort. He had said he would drop him back home in the evening. The family had lunch after the swim, but th boy insisted that he wanted to go to the pool again. Mariyam did not allow the boy to go and instead asked him to play with his cousins and other children in the garden. Jetpurwala, who studies in Class I, managed to slip out of the elders’ sight and went to the pool. In the evening, when they planned to return home, Jetpurwala was not found and after searching him around, he was found unconscious in the pool. He was taken to a private hospital and later to Rajkot Civil Hospital where doctors declared him dead before admission.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray who reviewed gaps in health infrastructure in the wake of the third wave, said this dashboard should be one of the best in the country, and will help plan resources for each district. Health minister Rajesh Tope sought an increase in budget so that projects can be completed and vacancies can be filled. As per Planning Commission recommendations, the health budget of the state should be 5% of total GDP, which is under 1% in Maharashtra. “We have raised a demand to ensure that health budget is given a priority so that more people can be covered under health schemes,” said Tope. Thackeray said there were many temporary centres that were created for Covid patients, and a study should be done if they centres can be continued for other patients. A detailed discussion was held on resources like oxygen and medicines; timely orders must be placed for them while preparing for the third wave. Tope also said funds under corporate social responsibility should be sought for completing pending projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-prepare-for-third-wave-dashboard-for-covid-updates/articleshow/83730667.cms||---
---||Goa||Taxi situation horrible, flight fares cheaper than cabs: AG||Panaji: The state government on Monday told the high court of Bombay at Goa that tourists and locals are being overcharged by taxis in the state, and that it is a “horrible situation” where taxi fares are often higher than flight tickets. Advocate general Devidas Pangam’s statement came in the hearing in a writ petition filed by the Cavelossim tourist taxi owners’ association, seeking exemption from fitting taxi meters. After Pangam told the court there’s no question of interim relief for contract carriages on fitting meters, the high court declined to grant interim relief. “It’s a horrible situation,” Pangam told the court. “They charge whatever they want. Some regulation has to be there... it has to be controlled, otherwise they don’t have any limit... forget about tourists, what they do to local people while charging, it’s impossible to pay. In fact, flight tickets are cheaper than taxis.” Admitting the petition, a division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar, observed, “According to us, grant of the interim relief would amount to restraining the state from implementing rule 140 of the (Motor Vehicle) Rules”. The rule requires every motor cab plying in the state of Goa to be fitted with a digital fare meter with printer and a GPS tracking device approved by the state transport authority “from the date notified”. The court further said that date has now been notified and, therefore, notices were issued to the petitioners to comply. The association, through its president Sanford Barretto, submitted to the high court that there is a distinction between motor cabs and contract carriage vehicles. The latter usually operate on the basis of fixed charges from point to point, and sought exemption under rule 140. The association stated that the functioning of such tourist vehicles/contract carriage vehicles will be extremely difficult if this rule is enforced. The advocate representing the association said that contract carriages don’t operate from taxi stands, and operate on contracted rates with hotels or travel agencies. He added that they don’t have a problem fitting GPS and tracking devices, but have a problem fitting meters as this could create a problem between them and passengers, he said. Dealing with the petitioner’s argument of arbitrariness, the bench held that at least in the facts of this case and prima facie, it cannot be said that some case of manifest arbitrariness has been made out. “However, having regard to the nature of requirement imposed by the rule, and the circumstances referred to by the learned AG, we cannot say that such a requirement is manifestly arbitrary at the prima facie stage itself. Therefore, no case is made out for grant of any interim relief, save and except to observe that the compliances can be without prejudice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taxi-situation-horrible-flight-fares-cheaper-than-cabs-ag/articleshow/83730631.cms||Lisa Monteiro

With this, the vaccination drive is expected to begin from Tuesday in Nashik city and district. Vaccines will reach the centres by Monday evening. The vaccination drive in Nashik city was affected during the past week due to scarcity of vaccines. On Monday, 20 of the 31 centres remained closed due to lack of vaccines. The vaccination drive is expected to begin at all the vaccination centres from Tuesday. Apart from Nashik district, Ahmednagar received 29,300 doses, Jalgaon 24,500, Dhule 16,800 and Nandurbar 11,000. Moreover, the vaccination for beneficiaries in the age group of 30 and 45 years started in the district. “Even though the Centre has allowed vaccination for the beneficiaries above 18 years, the state government has decided to begin with beneficiaries in the age group of 30 and 45 years due to shortage of vaccines,” said Ganesh Misal, incident commandant for vaccination drive in the district. “On Saturday, 10 centres were planned for vaccination to 30-45 years age group beneficiaries.

Police suspect that the incident is connected to the seizure of 2.33kg of gold, worth Rs 1.11 crore, by air intelligence unit of Customs (preventive) at Karipur airport. The flight in which gold was smuggled, arrived at 2.30am from Dubai and the accident happened by 4.45am. The truck involved in the accident reportedly came from Pandikkad in Malappuram and was heading towards Kozhikode. The deceased were identified as Muhammed Shafeer (26) son of Abdul Kalam of Pattambi; Thahir (23) son of Hussain of Cherpulassery, Nasar (28) son of Ibrahim of Mulayankaavu, Subair (36) son of Yusuf of Mulayankaavu and Hassainaar son of Muhammed (25) of Cherpulassery. “We suspect that there is a connection between the gold seizure and the incident. It is suspected that there was a chase between the two parties, who came to take the person who arrived with the gold, when the accident happened. We have booked the case under Section 399 as these people came with the intention of a robbery. The plan was to either abduct the person with the gold or rob. It seems like the chase was part of this move,” said an officer with the investigation team, adding that some of the persons who were booked had criminal antecedents. The officer said the incident was a freak road accident. Meanwhile, there are reports that another group from Koduvally was also involved. There were past incidents in which gangs had clashed over smuggled gold. Customs had intercepted the 23-year-old Malappuram native who arrived by an AI flight on Monday morning. The gold was concealed inside a coffee machine. Sources said police collected information from customs sleuths about the seizure. Earlier, Kozhikode commissioner AV George told the media that police were launching a comprehensive probe after they found it suspicious that 15 persons in three cars came to the airport from Cherpulassery amid lockdown. “There is doubt whether the persons involved had consumed alcohol. A proper scientific investigation is going on in this regard. Forensic scientists have collected evidence. Autopsy report has been sought to clarify this. The truck driver said that the car, which was not under control, caused the accident. This can be confirmed only after checking CCTVs at the spot. We found shattered bottles, soda and liquor bottles from the vehicle,” said George. Officers also seized an SUV in connection with the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cops-book-eight-persons-after-five-killed-in-accident/articleshow/83728428.cms||---

Despite rules of the Act being framed last year, its implementation was not visible on the ground. The UDH department has now directed all urban local bodies (ULBs) to send proposals of schemes for plots having a minimum area of 250 hectares. Other than residential schemes, the department has directed the ULBs to plan a proposal to develop hospitals, parks, stadiums and education institutes. A senior official said the government would promote the Land Pooling Schemes (LPS) as the model has been successfully implemented in many cities. Under the scheme, land owners can come and give their land and authorities would act as a facilitator and develop it as per layout rules. The civic body would later give developed proportionate piece of land with all necessary infrastructure including roads, parks and open spaces to the land owner. While as a facilitator, it can earn revenue by way of its share (including development cost), land owners get good value for their share of the land. An official source said, “The development authority can ask expression of interest (EOI) from farmers. Owners having a particular size of land can come forward.” Land pooling policy was devised as an alternative to the cumbersome process of land acquisition for development. As per the Act, part of land will be used for urban infrastructure development with the consent of the land owner. Under the scheme, a land owner receives 45% as compensation on developed land. The bill passed by the previous BJP government could not be implemented on the ground . A UDH official said, “The bill received the approval from the President of India, the (UDH) also released the notification for the same in 2018. However, it could not see the light of day even after the rules were framed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-dept-plans-to-implement-land-pooling-scheme-in-state/articleshow/83730721.cms||---

Police said that Prashant Bapodra, who lives in Kadiya Plot in Porbandar, had an argument followed by a scuffle with Manish Parmar, who also lives in the same locality. They entered into a verbal dual after Bapodra lit a cigarette in an air-conditioned salon that irked Parmar. After a minor brawl, the duo went to their houses. Later Bapodra talked about the incident to his father Raju, an auto-rickshaw driver. Since Raju knew Parmar, they decided to meet on Sunday night to resolve the differences. Bapodra decided to join his father along with a sword and asked his three friends too to tag along. When they reached Patel Mill, Parmar’s friends Pratap Parmar, Lakhu Parmar and Bharat Merkhi were also present there with iron pipes and wooden sticks. As Parmar insisted, Bapodra’s friends left from there, but Parmar’s friends refused to leave which led to a heated argument. In the heat of the moment, Bapodra’s father pulled out a knife and stabbed Lakhu a couple of times. Lakhu managed to snatch the knife and he stabbed Raju. Parmar too snatched the sword from Bapodra and injured his father. Bapodra also was beaten up. As the news of the clash spread in the locality, Bapodra’s cousin came to their rescue and called an ambulance. Bapodra and his father were taken to a government hospital where Raju was declared dead. Lakhu was also taken to GG Hospital in Jamnagar. Based on Bapodra’s complaint, an offence of murder and assault was registered against Parmar, Pratap, Lakhu and Merkhi. “We are yet to receive a complaint from the injured person from the other group so we have not booked Bapodra yet,” said inspector M N Dave of Kamlabaug police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/scuffle-over-smoking-in-salon-ends-with-mans-murder/articleshow/83725801.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Congress can expand only if it contests next polls on its own, reiterates Nana Patole||A day after AICC general secretary H K Patil said it was premature for Congress to take a decision on forthcoming elections, state Congress president Nana Patole reiterated that the Congress will contest the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections on its own. In an interview to TOI, Patole spoke on his proposal, on what the stand of the Congress would be in the event Shiv Sena join hands with the BJP and on Sharad Pawar’s move to form a third front. Excerpts:Q: For a long time, you have been saying Congress will go solo in the Lok Sabha and assembly elections, but AICC secretary H K Patil has distanced himself from your stand. A: As the head of the state unit, I have right to take all possible steps to expand my party and ensure it reaches the grassroots level. This will be possible only if the Congress contests the elections on its own. This is not for the first time that such a proposal has come forward. In the past too, Congress and NCP had contested elections together and later, they separated and contested independently following differences. Even BJP and Shiv Sena had experienced a similar situation. Q: According to reports, in view of contradictory statements made by prominent leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi, the government appears to be in turmoil. A: I don’t think that is the case. Our government is firmly in the saddle, and I am sure CM Uddhav Thackeray will complete his five-year tenure. As it’s a three-party government, differences may appear on key issues, but we are united by the common minimum programme. Q: What will happen in case Sena joins hands with BJP and forms the government? A: Given the circumstances under which the MVA government was formed, I do not think the CM will agree to such a proposal. However, if Sena takes such a step, Congress will not be part of that government. Then we will have to take an independent call. Q: State NCP President Jayant Patil has spoken of the possibility of an NCP-Sena alliance for the LS and assembly elelctions… A: Why wait till the 2024 LS and assembly polls? They should join hands now. Every political party has the right to take steps for its expansion. If NCP thinks it will have a bright future if it joins hands with Shiv Sena, my best wishes to them. We are constituents of the MVA, we will never stab them in the back. Q: NCP president Sharad Pawar has launched a mission for formation of a third front for taking on PM Modi… A: This is not for the first time Pawar has taken the lead. In the past too, he had made several attempts to form a third front. Let me make it clear: without Congress, it will be impossible to form the third front. Q: Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik has written a letter to the CM on harassment by the Central agencies… A: The NDA government is misusing Central agencies to destabilize the MVA government. We will not succumb to the pressure. Our government is firm, and we are firmly with the Shiv Sena and the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-congress-can-expand-only-if-it-contests-next-polls-on-its-own-reiterates-patole/articleshow/83730787.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

On June 8, fed up with the harassment, Manisha Kareliya hanged herself from the ceiling fan. After completing all the post-death rituals, Manisha’s father Kantilal Parmar approached police on Sunday. Police, on the same day, registered an offence under various sections of IPC including abetment of suicide, harassment and Dowry Prohibition Act at Malaviyanagar police station. Parmar alleged that after his daughter Manisha’s marriage to Gaurav Kareliya in January 2019, the latter and his parents Chandravadan and Lata and sister Neeta, all of whom live at Navalnagar on Mahudi Road, used to harass Manisha for dowry. In the complaint Parmar stated that Manisha often told him about the harassment she was facing from her husband and in-laws. When the victim’s mother-in-law Lata had to undergo surgery for treatment of gangrene, Manisha was asked to get money from her father, the complaint stated. On June 7, Gaurav called Manisha’s mother Vanita and asked for Rs 7 lakh, which he needed to set-up his office. Earlier too Gaurav had asked Parmar to loan him money. When Parmar said that he didn’t have the money, Gaurav had asked him to withdraw the same from his provident fund account. Gaurav had also threatened to divorce Manisha, the complaint said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/husband-in-laws-booked-for-abetting-womans-suicide/articleshow/83725860.cms||---

The pharmacists send the details of such patients to the respective ward clinics and then a team,under medical officer, is sent to screen the patients. If he or she is a suspected Covid patient, the person has to undergo Covid test. If the person tests positive he or she has to be either admitted to a hospital or a Covid centre. In the past few weeks, the health teams have verified the details of the 629 people who got medicines for fever and cold from the pharmacies. Of them, 209 people had Covid symptoms. As many as 112 people tested positive. SMKMC chief Nitin Kapadnis told TOI, “Many tend to use self-medication when they get fever and cold. This is due to ignorance and some want to avoid getting tested. We also observed that private hospitals do not share details of suspected Covid patients undergoing treatment. They write prescriptions for such patients. “We had appealed to the pharmacists to record the details of these patients and those with prescription. We wanted names, addresses and contact numbers. The pharmacists shared the details with us immediately on the WhatsApp number we floated,” he said. Kapadnis said he banned dispensing medicines for SARI and ELI symptoms without prescriptions. Many sispected SARI and ELI patients tested positive for Covid. He said earlier, doctors were asked to share details of the patients. While many general physicians were reluctant to provide details, some provided genuine information. “We got the details of 358 patients from general physicians and private hospitals. We tested 233 patients and 149 tested positive,” he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pharmacies-help-track-patients-in-sangli-miraj-kupwada-civic-limits/articleshow/83728423.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MLA’s letter ‘flouts Sena style, puts CM in a spot’||Mumbai: Shiv Sena MLA and spokesperson Pratap Sarnaik’s letter to CM and party chief Uddhav Thackeray is being seen by Sena insiders as an act that does not fit in with the party’s style of functioning. The letter, which calls for an alliance with the BJP in the face of alleged “harassment” of Sarnaik, Sena minister Anil Parab and former minister Ravindra Waikar by Central agencies, has put the Sena leadership in a spot, Sena sources said. A senior Sena minister, who did not wish to be named, said, “Sena functionaries are not known for writing such letters. It is quite uncharacteristic of the party. In fact, the letter has come as a shock for us too. The CM and the party leadership are not taking it too seriously, and it seems to be an attempt to seek protection, at least in terms of perception.” The minister explained that on all key issues, including those related to the MVA government, the relationship with the BJP and the upcoming civic polls, the CM had held discussions with ministers and Sena functionaries. The Sena, in view of the BMC polls, has started an internal analysis on whether to go solo or ally with the NCP. A political observer said, “If a leader or party office-bearer has issues, they are taken up directly with the leadership. Writing a letter to the CM and making it public is not the Sena’s style and may indicate the growing gap between Sena leaders and the top leadership, which is now part of the government. There seems to be a communication gap, and it is also alarming MLAs are claiming they are fighting lonely battles with little or no support from the party despite being in power.” Sarnaik, who is under the ED scanner in a money laundering case, had in his letter pointed to discontent among other Sena MLAs and the threat the Sena faced because of attempts by its current alliance partners, NCP and Congress, to weaken the party. He claimed an alliance with ex-partner BJP will be beneficial to him and other Sena leaders such as Parab and Waikar and stated that he, along with his family, had been fighting a legal battle for the last seven months without getting support from the party and state government. While Sena old-timers said the party should not have allied with its traditional opponents after the last assembly polls and should have preferred to sit in the opposition , the other view is that it is now a prestige issue for the party to stick to the NCP and Congress, having had a bitter parting of ways with the BJP. Sena MP Sanjay Raut and NCP minister Hasan Mushrif dismissed Sarnaik’s claims. Raut said there was no groupism within the party and there was a strong bond between MVA partners. He clarified the party was with Sarnaik. On a tie-up with BJP, Raut said a decision on contesting future elections would be taken at an appropriate time. “MVA government will complete its term, and the common minimum programme is the soul of the alliance,” Raut added. Replying to a question by mediapersons about which ‘asana’ he would suggest to BJP on International Yoga Day, he replied, “Shavasan.” Mushrif said it has been decided t NCP and Congress will not poach Sena leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mlas-letter-flouts-sena-style-puts-cm-in-a-spot/articleshow/83730809.cms||---

The Alpha variant was found in 31% of the samples. “The majority of these samples (92%) belonged to Chandigarh residents. Thus delta was the main circulating strain during the second wave of Covid in the city,” said Prof Jagat Ram, director, PGI. A total of 80% of patients who had died of Covid harboured the Alpha strain. “Fortunately, no case of Delta plus variant was reported in the samples sent,” said Prof G D Puri, dean (academics), PGI. All the samples from severe and critical Covid patients admitted to PGI’s Covid hospital, had Delta strain according to PGI. Prof Jagat said, “The department of virology has been carrying out testing by RT-PCR method since March 2020 and more than 2.5 lakh samples have been tested so far.” In another development, PGI has been sanctioned funds from the UT administration to carry out serosurvey among children. This survey is expected to start this week and will involve more than 2,000 children. It is likely to be over in a month. Prof Jagat said, “This survey will help in estimating the percentage of children who already have anti-SARS CoV2 IgG antibody present which is an indirect marker of previous infection and will be useful in policy matters regarding vaccination among children if launched in future. It will also help in making necessary arrangements for children since according to some experts, they may be at more risk during the third wave.” The serosurvey will be conducted by a team from virology and School of Public Health, PGI, under the supervision of G D Puri. There will be house-to-house visits as per study protocol. Samples will be collected from three different areas of the Chandigarh, sectors 3, 6, 22, 24, 29, 36, 46, 47, 48 and 56; Khuda Jasu, Dhanas, Maloya, Mauli Jagran, Makhan Majra, Raipur Kalan, Burail, Attawa, Kajheri, and Hallomajra and Colony No. 4, Bhaskar Colony, Sanjay Colony, Indira Colony, Bapu Dham, Mauli Jagran, Dadumajra, Colony No. 5, SBS Colony and Manimajra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delta-dominant-strain-during-2nd-wave-in-city-pgi/articleshow/83725885.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Police said they have registered a murder case against Dashrat Gunawat Bhatt for killing his son, Rajesh Bhatt. A two-page note written by Dashrat Bhatt was recovered by the police, in which he has claimed he was tired of his son’s illness and could not bear the burden anymore. Dashrat is survived by his wife and two grown up daughters. Police have registered an accidental death report in Dashrat’s death. The incident came to light on Monday morning when Dashrat’s wife, Sudha, woke up to find her husband hanging from the ceiling fan and their son lying dead inside the bedroom of their fourth floor flat at Crown Jewel building. Mulund police said prima facie investigations suggest that Dashrat called Rajesh to the bedroom while his wife was asleep and pushed his head inside a container filled with water. “After killing Rajesh, Dashrat is believed to have penned the note and ended his own life,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-66-year-old-murders-mentally-challenged-son-dies-by-suicide/articleshow/83732997.cms||Ahmed Ali

Meanwhile, the state-level association of ASHA workers could have no talks with government on Monday and, therefore, they have decided to continue their strike demanding better wages. The strike has paralysed the health care system. Netradipa Patil, the president of Kolhapur district ASHA workers’ association, said, “Our demand of increase in the wages will continue. However there are many local pending issues. We have not been paid the incentives for the survey we carried out after the 2019 floods. Also, many of us were hospitalised for Covid. The administration did not reserve beds for us and we had to take treatment in private hospitals. We want reimbursement for that. Also, many have lost family members to Covid.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Possessive of unmarried sister-in-law, man kills her, wife, 2 children, mom-in-law before ending life||NAGPUR: A 36-year-old man, who allegedly lusted after his sister-in-law causing domestic feuds, murdered his wife, two children, sister-in-law and mother-in-law in two different homes within a span of some hours on Sunday night at Badal Ka Akhada locality near Golibar Chowk. He later hanged himself with a nylon rope. The incident came to light on Monday, when the man’s father-in-law Devidas, the sole survivor in the family, returned home from his job as a watchman. Devidas, addicted to liquor, had returned home under the influence of liquor, and thought his wife and daughter were asleep. He then stepped out of the house to go to the residence of his son-in-law Alok Maturkar with mangoes, only to find that the neighbours had raised an alarm on spotting the motionless bodies of the family through windows. He returned home to find his wife and unmarried daughter also done to death. Maturkar had a love marriage with his wife Vijaya, and had two children, 10-year-old son Sahil and 14-year-old daughter Pari. Vijaya’s younger sister Amisha Bobde (20) had some time ago started assisting Maturkar in his tailoring work. However, she had discontinued the work three months ago. It’s learnt Maturkar had started torturing her for being friendly with other persons. Amisha had even approached Tehsil police station in April, complaining that Maturkar had thrashed her for speaking to a friend over the phone. Police had registered a non-cognizable complaint against Maturkar, taken preventive action and released him. Sources believe the murderous spree was triggered after Amisha called up her elder sister on Sunday night, and had a heated altercation with her about Maturkar. After this, Maturkar is suspected to have killed all five shortly before Sunday midnight. After spending several hours with the bodies, Maturkar pulled the curtains on the night-long drama by hanging himself. Maturkar hanged himself from the ceiling fan, below which lay the body of his wife Vijaya in semi-naked condition with her throat slit on the bed. Maturkar appears to have hammered his daughter to death, and pushed her body below the bed. Pari’s body was the only one found with hands and feet bound. Sahil had been smothered with a pillow and was lying on the sofa in the front room. Police also found the knives Maturkar had purchased online, which had been delivered some days back. This suggested he was planning the murder for some time, and it was not a crime of momentary provocation or passion. Some 200 metres away, in the Bobde home, Amisha and her mother Laxmibai were found in different rooms with their throats slit. Maturkar is learnt to have had sex with Amisha’s body, which was found naked. Police said the chemical analysis team found semen on Amisha’s body. Police are not ruling out the possibility Maturkar spiked chicken curry with some drugs before killing Amisha and her mother, as no one in the adjacent rented rooms heard any noise. Maturkar’s mobile phone gallery had porn clips and videos of black magic, said cops. With no eyewitnesses, theories abound about the manner in which the murders took place. An eyewitness claimed to have seen Maturkar returning from in-laws’ place towards his own rented apartment. So police believe Maturkar first killed his sister-in-law and mother-in-law before wiping out his own family. Also, his house was found locked from inside and police had to break open the door to enter. One theory says Maturkar’s mother-in-law Laxmibai was at his residence while he was at her place with Amisha, whom he killed first. Later, Laxmibai was targeted when she returned home. Another theory claims Maturkar first murdered his wife and children, then headed to his in-laws’ place and returned only to end his own life. A neighbour said the Maturkars had moved into the rented apartment last August. “We had spotted the sister-in-law staying and working with the family. Her complaint at Tehsil police station had been amicably settled,” said a woman from the neighbourhood. “He used to play with his son and loved the children. He escorted his daughter to-and-from her tuition every day,” she said. The neighbours had first spotted the motionless body of Sahil through the window grill. They sprinkled water and tried to wake him with a stick, but there was no response. The neighbour had called up Amisha, but there was no response. When a neighbour peeped inside and saw the body of the mother and daughter, they alerted Tehsil police. Police have registered a murder case against deceased Maturkar and also accidental death for his suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/possessive-of-unmarried-sis-in-law-man-kills-her-wife-2-children-mom-in-law-before-ending-life/articleshow/83730828.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Rajkot||Jamnagar: GG Hospital’s paediatric ward set for major overhaul||RAJKOT: With the government anticipating the third wave of Covid-19 in next 2-3 months, the paediatric ward of Jamnagar’s GG Hospital is set for a major overhaul. The 200-bed children ward of Jamnagar’s biggest government hospital will be converted into a fully-fledged children’s hospital with 300 beds and the latest equipment and machinery for speedy diagnosis. The decision to upgrade the paediatric ward was taken as experts have expressed concerns over more children getting infected with cornavirus in the third wave. Jamnagar district collector Ravi Shankar said that the GG Hospital currently has 2,000 beds including the children’s ward, which is not designed for the needs of kids. “We will be installing the best possible medical equipment available in the world. Some machines and equipment are being imported from South Korea, USA and from across the globe. This new paediatric hospital will be a benchmark for other hospitals in the country,” Shankar told TOI. The funding for the hospital upgradation will be provided by the Reliance Foundation. The new hospital with children friendly infrastructure is expected to be ready within the next two-and-half months. “The hospital building will be made more children friendly. There will be special toilets and beds for a child’s comfort. It is difficult for a 3-4 year old kid to stay in the hospital without any one parent present. A special chair on which an adult can sleep will be installed near each bed,” said Shankar. Director of corporate affairs at Reliance Industries Ltd, Parimal Nathwani said, “We are planning for 50 ICU beds at the hospital. The infrastructure will be created inside the GG Hospital premises. The planning has started and we have also ordered the equipment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gg-hospitals-paediatric-ward-set-for-major-overhaul/articleshow/83725961.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Known for their free-flowing game, Goa have been the most consistent team in the Indian Super League, making it to the semifinals a record six times in seven seasons. For the last four years, Goa strikers have won the Golden Boot three times. For two successive years, it was Coro who finished among the top, and while his replacement – Angulo – also scored regularly and won the top award last season, Goa are looking at a new striker. “We are looking at someone with different characteristics,” said Ravi Puskur, the club’s director of football. “It’s undeniable that Coro is the best striker the league has seen and replacing a player of his quality was never easy. He is known for his all-round game and not just the goals. Igor is the best finisher I’ve seen in the league. “Now we will find someone who is best of both worlds, who can stylishly fit into what we are looking from a striker and what we want him to contribute. We want a striker who can score 15 goals minimum. That is what will take us to the top,” said Puskur. Angulo scored 14 goals last season to win the Golden Boot, while Coro scored 18, 16 and 14 during his three years in ISL. It is no secret that Goa’s first-choice striker for next season was Dioni Villalba. According to sources, the Spanish striker had agreed personal terms but later changed his mind due to the raging Covid-19 pandemic in India. Instead, he joined Atletico Baleares, stepping into the boots of Coro, who left the Segunda B club after just a year. “We are not too far away (from confirming the striker). Hopefully, by the end of this month, we will have pen to paper,” said Puskur. The next edition of ISL will be played inside a bio-secure bubble, so convincing players to come to India won’t be easy. Puskur, however, remains confident that they will find a good enough replacement for Angulo, who was not surprisingly angered by his exclusion from the AFC Champions League squad. “It’s well-publicised that we missed out on a player (Dioni) due to the pandemic. Our efforts are ongoing. We do have a couple of profiles in mind, but we will put pen to paper only when we know it’s worth it. “We have been a little stubborn from our end in terms of who we want. We have not lowered our expectations. If we get the name who is on our table at the moment, he will be a very good stylistic fit and contribute with the goals as well,” said Puskur. Goa’s preference for a Spanish striker needs no reminding. But whether the new signing remains as sharp as Coro and Angulo remains to be seen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-on-the-hunt-for-striker-who-can-score-15-goals-or-more-in-isl/articleshow/83761180.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 10% rise in Sarus crane numbers in Anand, Kheda||AHMEDABAD: The annual Sarus crane count on Monday revealed that numbers the threatened Sarus crane in Kheda and Anand District increased by nearly 10%, against the 829 birds counted in 2020. The count which is taken up every June revealed that this year the two districts of Kheda and Anand had 915 bird. Apart from this, Sarus are also spotted in Ahmedabad district.  Jitendra Kaur, who was instrumental in forming the Rural Sarus Crane Protection Group, said the result of the count which was revealed on Monday shows that these were the highest numbers since 2015. She said the count is taken up annually in Kheda and Anand districts.  The Sarus crane count of 2021 was done with the active participation of 35 Rural Sarus Protection Group volunteers, five volunteers from Voluntary Nature Conservancy, teachers from various schools, the social forestry division of Nadiad, and other volunteers covering 128 villages in 12 talukas of Kheda and Anand districts. She said 89 protection groups, a citizens initiative, in 35 villages of Kheda district are active in protection of the species from egg stealing, nest destruction and poaching. The annual count is held in June as during this period most wetlands and marshes are dry and the cranes can be seen in large congregations at perennial water bodies. The summer congregations help determine the population of Sarus cranes in the region She said the group has been documenting population, breeding trends and threats to the species in Kheda and Anand districts since 2015. Recently a study by the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) revealed that pesticides in fields pose a major threat to the birds by either killing them or affecting their calcium metabolism and making the egg shells very fragile. The study pointed out that chlorpyrifos (one of the most widely used pesticides in agricultural insect control products) showed a strong correlation with eggshell thickness in Ahmedabad, Anand and Kheda districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/10-rise-in-sarus-crane-numbers-in-anand-kheda/articleshow/83730900.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Congress claims CM Rawat can't get elected, crisis is looming||DEHRADUN: A former Congress MLA has warned that Uttarakhand was heading towards a "constitutional crisis" as BJP chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat - who took the oath in March this year and needs to win an assembly seat by September 10 - cannot contest bypolls as per law since assembly elections are less than a year away. Uttarakhand is set to go to polls early next year. According to Nav Prabhat, who was transport minister in the Harish Rawat government, provisions of section 151A of the Representation of the People Act mandate that a bypoll cannot be held in a situation where only a year is left for state polls. "The state is heading towards a constitutional crisis. CM Tirath Singh Rawat's six-month tenure ends on September 10, BJP will have no option but to name a new chief minister," Prabhat told TOI. He said that in one instance in Punjab, the Supreme Court termed the reappointment of a minister - who was not elected within six months - as invalid and unconstitutional. Uttarakhand agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal, however, asserted that the Congress was trying to mislead people through half-baked information." Two assembly seats - Gangotri and Haldwani - are lying vacant. Gangotri seat fell vacant on April 22 after the demise of Gopal Rawat while Congress MLA from Haldwani, Indira Hridayesh passed away this month. Tirath Rawat is likely to contest from Gangotri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-congress-claims-cm-rawat-cant-get-elected-crisis-is-looming/articleshow/83734034.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Surat||Surat: 11-year-old girl dies while making dance video||SURAT: In an unusual accident, an 11-year-old girl got strangulated when a dupatta got entangled around her neck when she was believed to be making a dance video at her home in Jadakhadi locality of Mahidharpura area. The girl was found hanging from the iron grill of the window when her father returned from work on Saturday evening. A case of accidental death was registered at Mahidharpura police station on Sunday. Police said that the girl’s mother had left for work after lunch and had instructed her not to leave the house and take care of her brother. The girl’s father, who works as a security guard of a building in the same area, was also away at work. When he returned late in the evening, the son was playing in the house, but the girl was standing numb near the window. On looking closely, he found her unconscious and was not responding to his call. He took the girl to SMIMER Hospital where she was declared dead before admission. Police were informed by the hospital authorities as her death was suspicious. “Prima facie it seems that she got strangled because of the cloth she had tied on the grill while dancing. Her parents told us that she used to like dancing and would record her dance videos,” said a police official. Several of her dance videos were also found on her father’s mobile phone. “We are waiting for a detailed postmortem report and forensic investigation report to know the cause of death, but when her father saw her the cloth was entangled around her neck,” said RK Dhuliya, inspector of Mahidharpura police station. The family originally hails from Nepal and the girl’s parents have two older daughters too who live back in their village. On May 12 too, a 13-year-old boy had died under similar circumstances in Sarthana when he was trying to perform a stunt for a video. The boy was found hanging from a rope on the balcony of his house on the backside. Due to his obsession with performing stunts and recording videos, his mother had barred him from using a mobile phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/11-year-old-girl-dies-while-making-dance-video/articleshow/83726030.cms||---

NCB officers intercepted the woman named Sharon Chigwaza, 30, on her arrival at Cial. “On close inspection of her trolley bag, heroin concealed in its specially-made false bottom was recovered and seized. Sharon was scheduled to travel to Delhi soon after arrival in Cochin,” the statement said. NCB said that the woman was arrested and it has identified a trend of reverse trafficking of heroin into India. NCB said that over the last one year, NCB has identified an unusual pattern of trafficking heroin produced in southwest Asian countries. “Traditionally, the heroin from this region was pushed into Indian territories through land borders with Pakistan, especially through Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir. Attempts to traffic it via maritime channels have also been noticed by NCB,” an official said. Amit Ghawate IRS, zonal director, Chennai and Ashish Ojha, superintendent with the NCB, Chennai zonal unit, are monitoring the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/heroin-seized-in-cial-sent-from-south-africa/articleshow/83728584.cms||---

Sub-division wise ambulances with teams are being deployed for taking the vaccines to the doorsteps, said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. “To avail home vaccination, registration has to be done by filling details of persons to be inoculated and their addresses in a Google-sheet. But it is mandatory that at a given point of time there are at least a group of 10 people in the area who are to be vaccinated,” said Dayalan. The condition is set to avoid vaccine wastage since per vial 10 doses are available and once open, it cannot be preserved for later use, said the DC. Similarly, home vaccination facility will be extended to women. Door-to-door facility will be extended to organisations, associations, NGOs , RWAs or volunteers if they want to vaccinate over 30 persons at a given point of time in a given place, even if they are not aged or infirm. “Although our top priority is elderly and disabled but for the ease of people, if a resident welfare association (RWA) seeks home-vaccination but does not have sufficient number of senior citizens, it will be provided the service on the condition that at least half of the total number of people to be vaccinated are 60 plus, disabled or differently abled and the remaining can be anyone over 18 years of age,” the DC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-to-start-need-based-door-to-door-vaccination/articleshow/83726008.cms||---

Despite a minor altercation of villagers with the police force, which was present on the spot, the possession process was completed by the authorities. Lachman Singh from Koom Kalan said, “Today authorities along with heavy police force came in the area for handing over the possession of land to Glada, registry of which was done sometime ago. Dozens of villagers tried their best to oppose the action on the grounds that a civil suit against some land being used for the industrial park project is still pending in the court and the possession process cannot be initiated until it is disposed off. But unfortunately, the officials who were present on the spot did not accept our plea and they went ahead with their action.” Malkit Singh from Sekhowal village said “The entire action done by the authorities today was unjustified as the Glada officials came unannounced and destroyed the crop that was standing on a chunk of the land and took it into possession. Moreover, the promises that were made to us by the government officers recently, that our village will be given 200 acres alternate land and government schemes will be implemented in our village at the earliest, turned out to be false, as nothing has been done.” According to Kuldeep Singh Khaira, a RTI activist, “The authorities cannot do this when the matter is under status quo with chief secretary. Also, the government has yet to decide on objections raised by the public on call by Glada.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/glada-takes-posession-of-400-acre-land-for-industrial-park-project-despite-protests/articleshow/83730973.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this regard was signed by GMB-backed Gujarat Maritime University with the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) on Monday. The maritime university has proposed the development of a specialist Alternate Dispute Resolution Centre (ADRC) - the Gujarat International Maritime Arbitration Centre (GIMAC), to organize and manage arbitration and mediation proceedings in disputes related to the maritime and shipping sector. GIMAC will be an integral part of the Gujarat Maritime Cluster. It will come up at the special economic zone at GIFT City which houses India’s first International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). “GIMAC, an alternate dispute resolution centre focused exclusively only maritime/shipping, will facilitate faster dispute resolution resulting in economic benefits and ease of enforcing contracts for the regional maritime fraternity, which currently depends on international centres for their dispute resolution needs,” said a GMB official. The MoU was signed by Avantika Singh, provost of GMU and Injeti Srinivas, Chairman, IFSCA, he further said. Singh is also VC and CEO of GMB. Through this MoU, IFSCA and GMU plan to usher in changes in the maritime sector by providing companies an advantage over litigation, thereby allowing parties to avoid the complexities and the stress caused by approaching courts which are already over-burdened in the country. There are over 35 arbitral institutions in India, however none of these places exclusive focus on the maritime sector, said sources in GMB. Approval for GIMAC has already been received from the development commissioner, Kandla SEZ. As a part of the MoU, IFSCA would be providing technical expertise to the Gujarat International Maritime Arbitration Centre (GIMAC) during the course of its establishment and operations for a period of 5 years, said sources in the state government. The services of GIMAC would be promoted on various forums, nationally and globally by both GMU and IFSCA, according to sources. IFSCA is the first and only statutory unified regulatory body setup under the department of economic affairs, ministry of finance, government of India under the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019. The regulator is based out of GIFT City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mou-inked-for-intl-maritime-arbitration-centre-at-gift-city/articleshow/83730937.cms||---

Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) has taken up development of the 500-hectare park. Once complete, the new park is expected to attract fresh investments of around Rs 15,000 crore. M Thennarasan, vice-chairman and managing director of GIDC said that to enhance growth of the ceramics industry in Morbi district and counter haphazard industrial development, GIDC is in the process of developing a ceramics park over 500 hectares. “The planned industrial park at Morbi will cater to the ceramics industry and ancillary units. The proposed park is approximately 11km from Morbi town. After the chief minister’s directions, a stakeholder meeting was held with industry associations and their suggestions have been taken,” he said. “A consultant has been appointed for the base line study and demand survey. Industrial infrastructure facilities such as road upgradation, water supply, CFCs, ancillary units, dry port and common display centres have been planned. The master plan of the park is expected to be ready soon. Ground-level surveys and stakeholder meetings are in progress. GIDC will submit a report to the government for approval within three months. We expect to start work on the ground in three or four months,” he added. Termed the ceramics hub of India, Morbi has more than 800 ceramics and tiles manufacturing units. The Morbi ceramics industry cluster contributes more than 95% of the tiles produced in the country. While most industries were struggling to grow during the pandemic, the ceramics industry of Morbi was one of the fastest growing. According to Morbi Ceramics Association (MCA), exports from the cluster amounted to approximately Rs 15,000 cr in 2020-21. Exports went to countries like US, UK, Mexico, Indonesia and Europe as well as the Middle East. With the deferral of ADD (anti-dumping duty) on Indian ceramic tiles, exports to GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries and newer export markets — the US, Indonesia and Thailand — are opening up, Morbi exports are expected to gain traction over the next few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-allots-land-for-ceramics-park/articleshow/83730971.cms||Kapil Dave

The decision to start vaccinating people in the 30-44 year age group is expected to be taken on Tuesday. The vaccination of beneficiaries in the age group of 18-44 years was halted over a month ago due to the shortage of vaccines. By then, only 1% of 18 lakh potential beneficiaries in this age group was given the first dose and only 5,800 got the second dose. Farukh Desai, the vaccination nodal officer for the district said, “We have received a fresh lot of vaccine. We expect more to arrive. We have decided to vaccinate those in 30-44 group first as most of them are working and need to be protected at the earliest. The decision on whether to start vaccination for this age group will be taken on Tuesday and centres for the same will be fixed. Priority vaccination for the age group above 45 years will continue.” The citizens between 30 years and 44 years have to book vaccination slots online. The vaccination for those above 45 years of age is also slow due to the shortage of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dist-gets-17000-vax-doses/articleshow/83728556.cms||---

Parents under the banner of All Students’ and Parents’ Welfare Association said that the DEO had not been taking any action as the issue was sub-judice so far. “The school had moved the high court against the DEO’s earlier probe report that it had collected capitation money, but the high court last week gave an order in our favour,” said Chirag Thakkar, president of the association. He added that the DEO’s earlier probe had concluded that the school had collected capitation money. “Since the issue is no more sub-judice we want the DEO to bring a final decision in 10 days otherwise we will sit on a dharna,” Thakkar said.

Emissions from household solid fuel usage for cooking and space heating was the primary contributor, followed by road dust and transport. Track the pollution level in your cityAt 31.4%, stubble burning dominated the phase from October 15 to November 15, 2020, according to the study. Local sources were mostly responsible for the pollution in the peak winter season as household heating and cooking significantly increased to 39.6% during the phase from December 15, 2020, to January 15, 2021. The average contribution of road dust and transport sectors remained around 12% and 14%, respectively, during the winter. Waste burning’s contribution to PM2.5 was estimated at 9%. Emissions from power plants and diesel-generator sets largely remained unchanged at 7%. Kurinji Selvaraj, programme associate, CEEW, told TOI: “While emissions from regional sources, such as stubble burning, dominated at the start of the winter last year, contributions from local sources, such as household emissions (space heating), primarily drove the second episodic 'peaking' of the pollution levels in Delhi in the subsequent months. This makes a case for active control of local sources in the upcoming winter to keep pollution under check.” Delhi should proactively use air quality forecast and early warning systems to execute emission control measures in advance, targeting prominent sources during forecasted high-pollution days, Selvaraj said. The study was jointly conducted by Kurinji Selvaraj, Adeel Khan and Tanushree Ganguly. According to the study, the average transport contribution to Delhi’s air in the winter period last year was 14%, but the congestion levels were almost 92% lower in April 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. As the lockdown restrictions began to be relaxed and economic activity resumed in the latter half of the year, congestion levels were only 20–25% lower between August and December 2020 than the corresponding congestion levels in 2019. The lower congestion levels are representative of the reduced traffic volumes and vehicular emissions. The study stated that the average PM2.5 concentration was 240 micrograms per cubic metre in phase 1 (October 15 to November 15, 2020), 160 micrograms per cubic metre in phase 2 (November 15 to December 15) and 200 micrograms per cubic metre in phase 3 (December 15, 2020 to January 15, 2021). Delhi residents were exposed to air that does not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (60 µg/m3) for more than half of 2020 despite low economic activity levels due to the pandemic-induced lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-cooking-took-over-from-farm-fires-as-number-1-toxin/articleshow/83728678.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The Congress members demanded a CBI probe in the entire matter. Congress state secretary Amit Singh said, “The district administration is hand in glove with the hospital owner and trying to cover up the entire matter. We want the state government to order a CBI probe. CCTV footage of the hospital, dated April 26 and 27, should be put in public domain.” “The party will continue to protest across the city till authorities provide justice to family members of patients who died due to oxygen supply cut off at the hospital,” he said. Meanwhile, the district administration has sent the complaints received from the family members of the deceased for further investigation. The hospital was in news earlier this month after a purported video went viral wherein owner of the hospital Dr Arinjay Jain was found allegedly claiming that a mock drill was conducted at the hospital by stopping oxygen supply for 5 minutes on April 22 and 26 of the patents were ‘eliminated’. Last week, the probe panel investigating the alleged deaths of patients at the Shri Paras hospital had given a clean chit and said there was ‘no mock drill’. The four-member death audit committee and two investigating officers looking into the deaths at Shri Paras Hospital on April 26 and 27 said in their report that the conclusion from the owner’s statement in video that 22 patients had died ‘is entirely untrue’. They added, “No mock drill was conducted, no one’s oxygen was cut off, there’s no evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/oxygen-mock-drill-congress-stage-protest-at-collectorate-against-administrations-clean-chit-to-hosp/articleshow/83726032.cms||---

Health minister Raghu Sharma inspected JK Lon Hospital on Monday for reviewing the preparation for treatment of children infected with Covid. “Special attention is being paid on strengthening medical facilities in all the children’s hospitals of the state. Since, JK Lon Hospital is the biggest child specialty hospital in the state, it will have all facilities for treatment of children with Covid,” said Sharma, adding that soon around 200 ICU beds would be available at the 800-bed facility. Besides, 600 beds will be kept reserved for Covid patients. All the 600 beds can be converted into ICU beds when needed. All beds in the hospital are connected to the centralized oxygen system. Sharma said an oxygen plant was being set up in the hospital and soon JK Lon will have around 1,500-litre oxygen production capacity. Officials assured that the preparations for Covid treatment will not affect the 200-bed NICU unit and the treatment of non-Covid children will continue as usual. Apart from this, if there is shortage of beds for treatment of non-Covid children, then arrangements can be made for their treatment in Sethi Colony and Gangaur hospitals. Sharma inspected the under-construction and development works including the place where CT scan unit has to be set up. He directed to pay special attention to complete all the work within the prescribed time while maintaining quality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/non-covid-ward-for-kids-to-be-shifted-from-jk-lon-hosp-if-required-during-third-wave/articleshow/83730975.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Earnings down 90%, pandemic bleeds men in red||CHANDIGARH: The coronavirus pandemic has badly hit porters at the railway station. The men in red who ferry luggage of weary travellers have lost their daily earnings up to 90%. They cite two reason for their condition: passengers fear catching Covid if they carry their luggage and escalators and lifts allows them to easily carry their bags. Coming to the railway station is a routine for them despite knowing they will not earn a single penny the entire day. They sit at the empty platforms, sharing their woes with each other. Radhey Sham (28), Mukesh (31), Kuldeep (27) and Uday Partap (20) said they, like 39 other porters, come daily and return with empty pockets. “I have been working as a coolie for 15 years here. We used to earn around Rs 500 daily but now we do not even manage to get Rs 50,” said Sham. They said that seven porters have already left for their hometowns. “Many porters have either left for their native villages or have shifted to railway stations in Delhi, Lucknow and Meerut, where they still able to earn to feed their families,” said Sham. Most of them sit in a room allotted to them near the parking. Sawar Khan, the president of a porters’ body, said people are reluctant to hire porters as they don’t want anyone handling their luggage amid the pandemic. Another reason, he says, is that the trains line up on platform number one, from where people can easily drag their luggage to the exit. “We could get more work if the two trains, Jan Shatabdi and Paschim Express, line up on other platforms.” The phased revival of passenger trains under Unlock 2.0 had brought only momentary respite to porters who stood a chance at recovering from lockdown-triggered financial lows during March, April and May, even this year. Since then, the coolies have been weighed down by the burden of debt and are battling a crippling economic meltdown. They are now banking on resumption of all trains to make their both ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/earnings-down-90-pandemic-bleeds-men-in-red/articleshow/83726119.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: ‘Spat with K Sudhakaran a closed chapter now’||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Hinting at the CPM plans to downplay the virulent attack unleashed by KPCC president K Sudhakaran against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, CPM state secretary A Vijayaraghavan here on Monday said that the KPCC president has already been given a befitting reply and the spat with Sudhakaran is a “closed chapter”. “What Sudhakaran said about chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was unbecoming of his position as KPCC president. That’s why CPM replied to him in the same fashion. There is no need to give him replies everyday. It’s a closed chapter now,” Vijayaraghavan, who is also the LDF convener, told reporters after the LDF meeting here. The chief minister has not responded to the new challenges and charges that Sudhakaran raised against him in response to the CM’s harsh criticism against him last week. Vijayaraghavan said that the LDF was of the opinion that the state government had taken ample steps at the right time in the illegal felling of trees. He repeated the argument that the controversial order was issued with the sole objective of helping farmers. “The order was issued considering the demands from farmers. When the misuse of the order came to the notice, the government took swift and stern actions. Those who misused the government order would be punished,” he added. According to Vijayaraghavan, the state government could do little to bring down the prices of petroleum products. “In fact, the demand by a section of media and UDF is that the state should forgo the tax revenue. This could only be seen as an effort to justify the BJP government at the Centre,” he said. Vijayaraghavan said that the LDF constituents would organize protest programmes against the alleged anti-people policies of the Union government, including oil price hike, on June 30. Protests would be staged in front of households in all local body wards. A group of four people, adhering to Covid-19 protocols, would participate in the mass protest against the Centre, planned at 4pm on that day, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/spat-with-sudhakaran-a-closed-chapter-now/articleshow/83728705.cms||---

Police arrested Rohit Yadav, a resident of Koparkhairane, based on a complaint by the medical officer of Panvel Municipal Corporation. Police said Yadav had been working as resident medical officer (RMO) at the hospital in sector 15 of Khargar for the past two months. “Acting on a tip off, we trapped Yadav post-midnight when he was on duty. We sent a decoy patient along with a police witness. The patient pretended to be suffering from a stomach ache. Yadav told the patient he needed to get admitted to the hospital and handed over a prescription for injections. The decoy patient alerted the civic medical team waiting outside,” said senior inspector Shatrughna Mali of Kharghar police station. He said when PCMC medical officer Dr Bhaktaraj Bhoite asked Yadav to furnish the Medical Council of India’s certificate, he said he didn’t have it.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Six day custody for cyber crook who duped woman||JAIPUR: A day after arresting the cyber crook who duped Rs 2.5 crore of a Sawai Madhopur based woman, police on Monday said the accused used to pose himself as chartered accountant in Mussoorie and a case is pending against him in Maharashtra. The SOG wing of Rajasthan police said the accused was sent to six-day police remand. The sleuths are now planning to retrieve data from his mobile phone, laptop and other gadgets. Niraj Soni was arrested from his Mussoorie-based office in a case in which he had posed himself as one ‘Rebecca Christine’ and duped a Sawai Madhopurbased woman of Rs 2.5 crore on the pretext of making her the heir of a 3.9-million-dollar inheritance. “He was produced in a court from where we have taken him to police remand for six days. His criminal antecedents would be checked and we will also apply to retrieve data from his laptop, mobile phone and other electronic gadgets,” said Sharat Kaviraj, DIG, SOG. The matter had come to light in 2017 when the victim alleged that she was duped of Rs 2.5 crore by a woman who had introduced herself as Rebecca Christine on a social media website. “It has also come to our notice that the accused had a pending case of cheating in Maharashtra and he has been into the crime for a long time. He was earlier been interrogated in a cheating case by Delhi police but was released. Also it is found that at Mussoorie he used to pose himself as a chartered accountant,” Kaviraj added. As Christine, the accused claimed that she was a wealthy woman living alone after her husband died recently. A few days later, Christine messaged the victim on Facebook that she was suffering from cancer and wanted to give her property worth 3.9 million dollars. The victim agreed to become the inheritor of Christine’s property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/6-day-custody-for-cyber-crook-who-duped-woman/articleshow/83731000.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat State Petronet Ltd’s cross-country pipeline project delayed||AHMEDABAD: The commissioning of the ambitious cross-country pipeline of Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL) from Mehsana to Bhatinda has been delayed by three to four months due to the second wave of Covid-19. The 1,670km pipeline linking Mehsana in Gujarat to Bhatinda in Punjab was earlier scheduled to be commissioned in June. The natural gas trunk pipeline project, which passes through Jaipur in Rajasthan, is estimated to cost Rs 5,500 crore. “This project is now expected to be up and running by September or October,” according to a senior company official aware of the development. “The delay has been due to Covid-related restrictions including in the neighboring state of Rajasthan,” the official said. “Also, the shortage of labourers during the second Covid wave contributed to the delay.” Earlier, GSPL, a Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) group company, had proposed to take the pipeline project all the way to Srinagar, covering a distance of another 750-odd kilometres in the process. However, GSPL abandoned its plans last year due to financial viability issues, the official said. Contracts for laying the pipeline infrastructure have been awarded to companies such as Kalpataru Power Transmission Ltd and Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Ltd. More than 93% of the project is complete, said a GSPC official. The pipeline project is a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan for the National Gas Grid. A consortium led by GSPL has formed a special purpose vehicle called GSPL India Gasnet Ltd to implement the project. GSPL has a 52% stake in the SPV, with Indian Oil Corp Ltd holding 26%, and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd having 11% each. In 2011, Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board had authorized GSPL, a subsidiary of the Gujarat government, to lay the Bhatinda-Jammu-Srinagar gas pipeline. The project comprises 840km main line of 36 inch diameter and 785km spur line. GSPL has already put in place a pipeline network of about 2,696km, covering 25 districts in Gujarat. It is developing cross-country pipeline projects of over 4,800km covering nine states through its two subsidiaries, GSPL India Gasnet Ltd and GSPL India Transco Ltd. The company recently announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Results showed its consolidated net profit had risen 8.82% to Rs 416.68 crore from Rs 382.89 crore. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the total gas transmission volumes stood at 33.84 mmsmcd compared to 39.36 mmsmcd in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gspls-cross-country-pipeline-project-delayed/articleshow/83730998.cms||Maulik Pathak

The female leopard cub had suffered serious injuries that damaged vision in one eye earlier. This time, the leopard fell into a well nearly 30 foot deep while chasing prey.  Forest officials were happy that the leopard cub has survived and is growing healthy. This time too, the cub was rescued and released safely. The leopard was identified through Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).  The cub was earlier rescued while injured near Tarsada village. “It was around three months old and had an injury on its face. It used to fall even while standing due to the vision loss in one eye,” said U D Raulji, range forest officer, Mandvi.  The leopard was hit by some vehicle while crossing the road and separated from its mother. It was later treated at Mandvi, but as its condition did not improve, it was sent to Navsari Veterinary College for treatment. After treatment for over two weeks, its condition improved.  “We kept the cub near a spot where the mother leopard frequented daily with another cub. After checking the cub for two days, she picked it up on the third day,” Raulji added.  Due to its long stay with the forest team, the adorable cub was named Rani. On the 19th day since its rescue, the cub was reunited with its mother. The forest team installed an RFID chip in the cub.  On May 22, it had fallen into a well near Tarsada and was unable to come out on its own. Forest team used a fiber cage to rescue the leopard. Since the leopard was rescued in a cage, its RFID could be checked.  “It is an unusual reunion in a short period and we could identify the leopard due to the RFID. It was rescued for the second time in seven months,” said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forest, Surat.  So far, 45 leopards have been tagged with RFID in Surat district forest area. Of these, 12 were rescued again by forest officials and their identity could be confirmed. “RFID helps us monitor movement of leopards. Majority of the leopards in the district are tagged with RFID and we can confirm that they are safe along with the humans in that area,” Nayyar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/leopard-rescued-for-the-second-time-in-seven-months/articleshow/83726146.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

He said the lockdown was lifted based on the health department’s reports following a sharp decline in Covid-19 cases in the state. He elaborated further that there was no surge in positive cases when the government enforced a 12-hour lockdown while extending relaxation between 6 am and 6 pm. “If there is any another wave in future, it is likely to arrive in October. But, it is important that people should not die due to lack of livelihood or starvation,” the CM said. While many districts have zero number of cases, the positivity rate in some districts is below 2%, he pointed out. The CM said there were reports in the media that children would be vulnerable in the third wave. “Did anybody call them and tell them that the third wave would hit children badly. This is not good for the society. It will have a psychological effect on people and some have died watching TV news. Media should sensitise people on issues like wearing masks and not create panic among people,” he said after inaugurating the integrated collectorate complex in Hanamkonda. While urging the electronic media not to sensationalise the Covid-19 and black fungus cases, the CM said even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had shared some information that people in Delhi bought medicines, injections and oxygen cylinders and kept them at their houses. Meanwhile, the chief minister also announced that Palle Pragati, Pattana Pragati and Haritha Haram programmes would be taken up from July 1 to 10 where all the elected representatives would take part. The CM said a preparatory meeting will be held on June 26 to finalise the programmes. He said the government would release Rs 100 crore special grant for Devadula Irrigation Project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/had-to-lift-lockdown-for-livelihoods-cm/articleshow/83730960.cms||Koride Mahesh

The weekend business had seen an uptick in the past fortnight with resorts on the outskirts of Jaipur clocking occupancies of about 50-60% even as city markets and shopping outlets remain closed after 4pm per the new guidelines.Hotels in Mt Abu witnessed about 80% occupancy on Saturday while other destinations closer to Gujarat like Udaipur and Kumbhalgarh saw first inflows of tourists after the restricted unlocking. Sanjay Singhal, vice-president of Mount Abu Hotels Association said, “The hotels were almost running full in Mount Abu last Saturday. Tourists from Gujarat also visited destinations like Kumbhalgarh and Udaipur. However, the rush disappeared completed Monday.” However, Jaisalmer will have to wait for a couple of months more to witness any significant flow of tourists. “First, this is not the season for Jaisalmer and secondly, the flights are not operating right now. The hospitality industry will have to wait for some time,” said Vikram Singh Bhati, a hotelier in Jaisalmer.Pushkar has started receiving tourists from Delhi, NCR and Jaipur but the hoteliers said it’s only limited to weekends and the volumes are negligent. “An occupancy of 30-40% is almost nothing. The Sunday curfew, requirement of negative RT-PCR report, prohibitions on gatherings for birthday or anniversary celebrations, prohibitions of weddings are major impediments to the revival of tourism,” said Pankaj Saboo, a resort owner in Pushkar. In Jaipur, the occupancy at city hotels is negligible. However, the resorts beyond the city limits have seen an increase in occupancy. Sunil Mehta, a resort owner, said, “With rains starting in the mountains, people are now preferring destinations like Rajasthan instead of Uttarakhand and Himachal, etc. On week-ends, the occupancy has risen up to 50-60% but there are still a lot of prohibitions which need to go for attracting larger number of tourists.” Rajesh Rajpurohit, general manager of a leading hotel in the city said, “The tariffs are on the lower side today. Some people are taking advantage of that. But corporate travel has started now. We expect this to pick up pace in coming months.” But all eyes are on the government decision on allowing weddings after June 30. The industry has lost good part of the wedding business so far this year. July has a few wedding dates. Weddings are a big source of business for hotels in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hospitality-sector-sees-early-signs-of-biz-covid-curbs-weigh-on-revival/articleshow/83731001.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Jaipur||Problem of plenty after tiger count in Rajasthan crosses 100 mark||JAIPUR: Rajasthan is now home to more than 100 tigers in the wild. The count breached the century mark after tigress T-111 gave birth to a set of quadruplets in Ranthambore National Park (RNP). The exact figure stands at 102. The state houses two major tigers reserves, Ranthambore and Sariska, having 69 and 23 big cats, respectively. The Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR), which was declared as a tiger reserve in 2013, houses only one tigress after the state forest department efforts to re-populate the reserve went futile. In the past three years, the births of 33 tiger cubs have been recorded and Rajasthan now has the ninth highest population of big cats among all states. State forest minister Sukhram Bishnoi said, “We are carrying out a study to develop a new habitat for tigers. A proposal to upgrade Ramgargh Vishdhari Sanctury to a tiger reserve has also been sent to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).” In its budget last year, the government had announced to develop the sanctuary as a tiger reserve to provide additional habitat to Ranthambore tigers, improve ecosystem and strengthen tourism. The Ramgarh Vishdhari sanctuary is spread across 1,071 sq km, of which 302sqkm will be made into a critical tiger habitat and the rest into a buffer zone.Though the news of crossing the 100 mark is a great achievement for wildlife enuthusisats, it has brought worries to the park managers as area in RNP is bursting at its seams. As tigers in the reserve are squeezed for territory due to high density, the chief conservator of forest (CCF) had put forward a proposal to relocate six of them. But many believe the proposal will never see the light of the day as Rajasthan does not have a safe habitat to relocate these tigers. An wildlife expert said, “There is enough scope to improve the wildlife habitat in adjoining areas of Ranthambore. Also, more tigers can be accommodated in Sariska Tiger Reserve after putting up proper target in place. The forest department should meanwhile work to develop new tiger reserves in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/problem-of-plenty-after-tiger-count-in-raj-crosses-100-mark/articleshow/83731034.cms||---

The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 1,930 per quintal as against Rs 1,851 per quintal on the last working day i.e. Saturday. According to an APMC official, the rise in demand as compared to supply has led to marginal rise in prices. Moreover, the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) has also started procurement of onions on behalf of the central government to create a buffer stock. “Apart from this, the demand from North India for onions from Nashik has also increased. This has overall led to rise in average wholesale onion prices,” an APMC official said. Around 21,000 quintal of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Saturday, but the supply increased by around 10,000 quintal on Monday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 800 and Rs 2,320 per quintal, respectively. Currently, the onions arriving at the wholesale market are summer onions harvested in the month of March and April. These onions have a shelf life of around six months. Hence, farmers prefer storing them with a hope of getting better price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/avg-wholesale-price-of-onions-up-by-rs-80-at-lasalgaon/articleshow/83728709.cms||Tushar Pawar

Witnesses will be questioned and evidence will be recorded by the court,” said special public prosecutor P N Parmar. “We have requested the court to admit the documentary evidence and the next hearing has been scheduled on July 5,” said Piyush Mangukiya, lawyer representing families of the victims. On May 24, 2019 fire had engulfed a tuition class running on illegally constructed 4th floor of Takshashila Arcade. A total of 22 students died and 19 others were injured in the incident. Some lost lives as they jumped from the fourth floor to save themselves. Initially, the accused were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including causing death due to negligence. Later police added sections for forging papers after more evidence was found. “The court proceedings got delayed due to the pandemic. But we expect that the proceedings to speed up now and the verdict to be announced soon,” said Jaysukh Gajera, father of one of the deceased students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/charges-framed-against-13-in-takshashila-fire-case/articleshow/83726227.cms||---

A decision in this regard was taken at a syndicate meeting held at the university campus on Monday. Till now only 10% of the total intake of the university was available for students belonging to boards other than GSEB. Now, the university has decided that 80% seats will be reserved for GSEB students while the remaining 20% will be available for students from other boards. Also, the university syndicate decided to impose a fine on MTB Arts College for late submission of exam forms. The syndicate ordered a fine of Rs 25 per form from the college. “Students had submitted the forms in college well in advance. But the college officials delayed the submission of the same at the university. Hence the college has been fined,” said a university official. The syndicate also decided to form a committee to find a solution to the NaMo tablet issue. VNSGU has earlier announced to give tablets for Rs 1,000 to each student. The announcement was made more than one and half years ago, yet many students have not received the tablet till now. Several protests were staged at the university campus by different student groups over the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vnsgu-increases-seats-for-other-board-students/articleshow/83726287.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: ‘Bid to cover up tree felling scam’||KOZHIKODE: Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said that attempts were underway at the highest-level to cover up the illegal tree felling scam in state. Addressing the media on Monday after visiting various locations in Muttil South village in Wayanad where mass felling of rosewood trees took place, he said forest and revenue departments were blaming each other on the issue, which was aimed at protecting the guilty. Chennithala asked why authorities are shying away from interrogating or arresting the accused though the timber involved in the case was seized. He added that the tree felling scam was yet another corruption that took place during the pandemic like the Sprinkler deal and deep-sea fishing contract. Chennithala said that the chief minister, revenue minister and forest minister had direct responsibility for the lapses that happened in this case. He added that the statement made by CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran that political leadership had responsibility for revenue department’s order meant that the order was issued with the knowledge of the chief minister. “Corruption in this scam will not be uncovered if probe is done by forest, vigilance or other government departments. The government should institute either a court-monitored probe or a judicial probe,” he said. Chennithala said the attempts are on to make farmers, on whose land the trees stood, the accused in the case. “What happened is a large-scale theft of trees in eight districts by giving paltry sums to farmers and tribesmen,” he added. Chennithala said that the residents of the Avilatt colony told him that they were paid just Rs 5,000 for the three rosewood trees which were worth lakhs of rupees. He said that UDF will organize a protest in all panchayats on June 24 raising the issue by following Covid guidelines. Chennithala also alleged that the authorities have not registered a case in connection with the 35 loads of spirit transported to the state in the guise of making sanitizer and added that more details about it will be revealed later. MLAs T Siddique and IC Balakrishnan, among others were present during his visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/bid-to-cover-up-tree-felling-scam/articleshow/83728770.cms||---
---||Delhi||City breathes easy for fourth day, no rain relief on horizon||New Delhi: Delhi enjoyed a clean spell of air for the fourth consecutive day. The capital’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was 84 on Monday, which is classified as ‘satisfactory’ by the Central Pollution Control Board. Experts said strong winds and rain recorded in neighbouring areas helped in improving the air quality. However, Delhi is unlikely to receive rain for the next four days and there is a possibility of thundershowers on June 26. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “Strong winds that have been sweeping Delhi for the past few days have played an important role in cleaning the air. A few neighbouring areas of Delhi received rain that helped in washing out the pollutants from the air. Besides, the wind direction has been largely easterly.” AQI is likely to deteriorate and stay in the ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderate’ category for the next three days, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research. Meanwhile, the Met department said the onset of monsoon in Delhi was unlikely over the next four days as the weather was expected to remain dry. Very light rain or thundershowers is predicted on June 26. “Only parts of Delhi may witness very light rain on June 26,” said a Met official. IMD had earlier forecast the arrival of monsoon in Delhi by June 15 but the advancement of monsoon slowed down. The normal meteorological date of onset is June 27. On Monday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 37.4 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. The minimum temperature was reported at 25.5 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 87% and 45%. The maximum and minimum temperatures are predicted to rise from Tuesday and day temperature may touch 40 degrees Celsius on June 24. The minimum temperature may hover around 29 degrees Celsius over the next four days. IMD forecast says strong surface winds at the speed of 20-30 kmph are expected on Wednesday and Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-breathes-easy-for-fourth-day-no-rain-relief-on-horizon/articleshow/83728792.cms||---
---||Delhi||Not just another bhavan, complex to promote brand Delhi||NEW DELHI: From Arunachal Pradesh to Lakshadweep and Jammu & Kashmir to Kerala, every state and almost all union territories have a State Bhavan or Sadan in Delhi, or at least a guesthouse to provide accommodation to dignitaries and officials from the respective state visiting Delhi. Delhi, being in Delhi, has missed out on having a bhavan of its own in the capital, but not for very long. Delhi government is coming up with a ‘Dilli Sadan’ in Sector 19, Dwarka and since unlike other states and union territories, its dignitaries and officials live in NCR, Delhi’s Sadan would house dignitaries and government officials invited by the Delhi government from different parts of India and abroad. The Dilli Sadan, however, will go way beyond the traditional brief of a ‘state bhavan’ and help establish ‘brand Delhi’ as a tourism destination, according to officials of the Delhi government. Delhi Tourism & Transportation Development Corporation Ltd. (DTTDC), a Government of Delhi undertaking, has been assigned the project of construction of the State Guesthouse ‘Dilli Sadan’ at Dwarka on a plot spread over nearly an acre (3899.42 sqm). DTTDC has started the process of engaging services for comprehensive architectural and engineering planning and design of the Sadan by consultants who have experience of state guesthouses, foreign embassies or four or above star hotels. “All the states have their own bhavans in Delhi. Similarly, Govt. of Delhi intends to set up its ‘Dilli Sadan’ for providing reliable and economic accommodation for staying of dignitaries/officers coming to Delhi for various purposes,” the request for proposal (RFP) states. State Bhavans perhaps carry forward the legacy of the palatial state ‘houses’ of princely states that came up in New Delhi and where maharajas and nawabs would stay during their visit to the new capital. While only very few are situated in the hallowed Princes Park, the state bhavans are located mainly between KG Marg and Kautilya Marg. Despite getting a legislative assembly well before states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand, Delhi didn’t get a bhavan, situated as it was, in Delhi. Sources said that though the idea to have a bhavan might have started with the feeling of being left out, the vision for the ‘Dilli Sadan’ has now gone far beyond the brief of a traditional State Bhavan, which served as home away from home for visiting dignitaries and officials of other states. Unlike other bhavans and Sadans, the Dilli Sadan will play host to ‘international as well as domestic dignitaries’ who are guests of the Delhi government. Located near the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the government wants the Sadan to showcase Delhi’s cultural and historical heritage at one place so that the visitor wouldn’t need to go to a hotel at all. The government plans state-of-the-art facilities of international standard, ensconced in a complex that contains elements of the ancient and medieval architectural heritage of Delhi. From the boundary wall to an ‘elegant entrance gate’, the government wants the Sadan to make an unforgettable impression and that is why the consultant would be chosen by an expert jury. The Sadan would not only offer comfortable VIP and VVIP suites, single-room suites and guest rooms at affordable rates but also conference and seminar halls, meeting rooms and a grand entrance lobby for informal meets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-just-another-bhavan-complex-to-promote-brand-delhi/articleshow/83731086.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Kolkata||West Bengal Transport Corporation set to convert bus fleet from diesel to CNG||KOLKATA: West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) and Bengal Gas Co Ltd (BGCL) on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that paves the way for the introduction of compressed natural gas(CNG) as the fuel to operate its diesel bus fleet.  “CNG will give us immunity from the rising diesel prices and also check pollution significantly,” said transport minister Firhad Hakim. The agreement was signed between Bengal Gas CEO Satyabrata Bairagi and WBTC managing director Rajanvir Singh Kapur in the presence of transport secretary Rajesh Sinha. WBTC will convert the buses from diesel to CNG in a phased manner. “Apart from building CNG stations at WBTC’s bus depots, we are working out on an incentive scheme to attract private bus operators to run their fleet on CNG. There can be a two-year tax holiday for running electric and CNG buses,” Hakim added. Acknowledging that the demand for fare hike by private bus operators in the wake of the sharp rise in fuel prices was justified, the minister said that the government was constrained to give the nod as commuters were equally hard pressed. The shift to a cheaper fuel alternative, he reasoned, was a viable alternative. The CNG stations for WBTC buses will be in place within six months. “We are exploring the technology, by which we can run our diesel buses on CNG. For a car, the conversion from diesel to CNG costs Rs 30,000 but for buses, it is a bit expensive. We have asked Kapur to find the appropriate technology for this conversion,” said the transport minister. Such conversion had been carried out in Delhi over decades ago. Thereafter, it has purchased CNG buses from the manufacturers. BGCL, a joint venture company of GAIL & Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation Ltd (CGSCL), was authorized by Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) for the supply of CNG through pipeline in Kolkata metropolitan area. BGCL and WBTC on Monday entered into a five-year agreement, where BGCL will be setting up CNG facilities within the premises of WBTC and supply CNG to buses. In the first phase, BGCL will set up eight stations at bus depots at Howrah, Salt lake, Thakurpukur, Nilgunj, Belghoria, Santragachi, Karunamoyee and Kasba. BGCL will be investing Rs 3.5 crore to build up CNG infrastructure at each depot. About 15 buses can be refuelled in an hour with two bus dispensers in the CNG stations at bus depots. Hakim said, “We are focusing on electric buses and now CNG so that the city can become greener and cleaner.” It is because of the land issues with the laying of the final phase of the pipeline from North 24 Parganas to Kolkata that BGCL will supply CNG in tankers. But within next six months, the pipeline laying will be complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wbtc-set-to-convert-bus-fleet-from-diesel-to-cng/articleshow/83728751.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Mumbai||Not only ex-home minister, ex-CP may also be probed: CBI||MUMBAI: The CBI on Monday told the Bombay HC that not just former state home minister Anil Deshmukh or policeman Sachin Waze, but everyone—including former commissioner of police Param Bir Singh—will be open to investigation. The HC was hearing the state plea against the CBI for including certain objectionable paragraphs from the FIR against Anil Desmukh, including probing Waze’s reinstatement last year when Singh was the commissioner, but the CBI stated it is an issue-based investigation. “Whether there is large-scale scam of transfer and postings. Sometimes complainants can also become accused,” said solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for CBI. ‘Waze reinstatement part of mandate, CBI doesn’t hold a brief for anyone’The CBI on Monday argued that its mandate from the HC and the Supreme Court includes probing reinstatement of policeman Sachin Waze last year. Appearing for the CBI, SG Tushar Mehta said, “may be Param Bir Singh aided (reinstatement), may be he did it at someone’s guidance? But what prompted a home minister to have access with API-level officer.’’ Waze, who was under suspension for 16 years for the custodial death of a 2002 bomb blast accused, was reinstated last year. The SG said it usually doesn’t happen that an API (Waze) has free access to a home minister. The FIR followed a petition by Singh and an advocate in the high court levelling corruption charges against Deshmukh. Singh had alleged that Deshumukh had asked Waze to generate Rs 100 crore every month by collecting money from bars and restaurants. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar asked CBI who comprised the committee to reinstate Waze. Mehta said, “Param Bir Singh and two others”. Later the HC asked him if CBI would also investigate the committee members, Mehta said, “the problem is we are not getting papers (from the state). CBI argued that its mandate from the HC and the Supreme Court includes probing reinstatement of Waze as it is part of “extortion” allegation. Mehta also said, “CBI doesn’t hold a brief for anyone.” The CBI extended its assurance to not pursue its request to the state for ex-commissioner (SID) Rashmi Shukla’s phone-tap report and other documents from police establishment till Wednesday when the HC will continue the hearing. “Whoever is responsible for his reinstatement will be held responsible. That is precisely why the state doesn’t want the two paras to be probed,” said Mehta. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh’s submission was that the CBI is within its right to investigate transfers and postings, including Waze’s, and how can the state now say that the letter was “restricted” to merely the allegation of a command for Rs 100 crore collection. “Why should the state be bothered or scared by it? It is in everyone’s interest to investigate the allegations…we have to clean the administration.” Singh said, pointing out that the SC too had made it clear that ‘rampant corruption in corridors of politics’ has to be investigated. Senior counsel for state Rafique Dada said CBI must stop a “roving” investigation into API Sachin Waze’s reinstatement last year and police postings and transfers, as both these aspects were beyond the scope of the HC’s April 5 order. The state investigation into transfers and posting was an “overreach” of the HC order as it had clearly granted Singh the liberty to raise this issue before an appropriate forum elsewhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-reinstatement-part-of-mandate-cbi-doesnt-hold-a-brief-for-anyone/articleshow/83731105.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Kolkata||New spot identified for New Town crematorium after locals’ protest||Kolkata: Following the opposition from a section of locals in New Town for the proposed electric crematorium near a residential area in Action Area 1D, the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has identified an alternative spot, about 5km from the boundary of New Town project area at Hazratala Samshan, Rajarhat. The Hidco officials will now prepare an alternative detail project report (DPR) for setting up the crematorium there. The authorities on Monday initiated the process to select an architectural firm that will prepare the DPR for the crematorium at the alternative site. The DPR will include a concept planning and a master plan of the proposed project. Earlier, following the instructions from the state government for all municipal bodies across Bengal to set up crematoriums in their respective jurisdiction areas, a two-acre plot had been earmarked near CNCI hospital’s New Town campus in Action Area 1D. The Hidco had prepared a DPR and placed it before the state urban development department for approval and clearance. However, as soon as the proposed plan was announced, a section of residents in the township opposed the proposed project. The authorities then started looking for an alternative site for the crematorium and found the existing crematorium at Rajarhat. “Some residents were opposing the project on the site that had been selected earlier. Later, we chose the Hazratala Samshan Ground as an alternative spot for the crematorium. The local villagers also wanted the existing infrastructure at the existing crematorium to be ramped up and they agreed to the Hidco taking over the area,” said an official. Sources from Hidco said that the earlier proposed site behind CNCI hospital campus was yet to be officially cancelled as its DPR is with the government and is still under consideration. “However, an alternative DPR will also be prepared in consultation with an agency for having an electric crematorium at the newly identified site,” said an official. As per plans, the crematorium will have four electric furnaces along with a mortuary.“Pollution-free measures will be taken for the crematorium,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-spot-identified-for-new-town-crematorium-after-locals-protest/articleshow/83728818.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The MLAs alleged that in many regions of the district and in Ajmer city as well, water is supplied after a gap of 72 to 96 hours. Almost every constituency — including Ajmer south, north, Kishangarh, Masuda, Pushkar — is facing mismanagement of drinking water supply, they added. District collector Prakash Rajpurohit instructed officials to ensure water supply after a gap of 48 hours. He also asked to remove hurdles in piped water supply in every corner of the district. He also asked the PHED to repair all hand pumps within a week and to develop a local monitoring system. Masuda MLA Rakesh Pareek demanded to prioritise work of water projects and said until there is water supply bottlenecks in the rural region, alternative arrangements should be made. He also asked for information on the development of Janta Jal Yojana to be provided to MLAs and to construct 40 hand pumps and 10 borings as announced by the state government. He demanded water supply in Kharwa and Piplaj villages. Kishangarh MLA Suresh Tak demanded check on illegal boosters and water connections and to provide power supply according to the increasing population. Ajmer North MLA Vasudev Devnani said frequency of water supply in his constituency should be reduced to 48 hours from 72-96 hours. MLA Anita Bhadel demanded new water tanks in her constituency and removal of high-tension power lines from the Dholabhata dispensary. She also complained about Tata Power, alleging they are demanding more money from new customers.

Both these MLAs are from wealthy background and the jobs could have been given to more deserving candidates or those belonging to the poor families. State government and cabinet has dashed the hopes of thousands of people of Punjab and it has been proved that the ruling party is least bothered about the future of the common citizens of Punjab.” Stating that as a concerned citizen, one must raise voice against the wrongdoings of the state government, Rawal said, “I have sent a letter to the chief minister giving him ultimatum of 15 days and if the decision is not rolled back, I will sit on fast unto death and the state government will be responsible for this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-must-rollback-decision-to-give-jobs-to-mlas-sons/articleshow/83731113.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Must end ‘agent culture’ in govt offices, says Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: There is a section among the government officials, who are degrading the sheen of civil services by resorting to corrupt practices, who are resisting to positive changes, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Monday. Speaking at the webinar on the topic “creating a new Kerala and civil services” organized by Kerala NGO Union, the chief minister said that when the LDF government came to power in 2016, the target of the government was to end corruption that had affected the civil services. To a large extent, it was achieved. “But a minority in the civil services are still engaged in activities that are degrading the glory of civil services. Some officials are having an attitude that they will not change,” he said. The chief minister said that corruption means not just accepting money illegally. Some do not accept money or gifts directly, but would remain mute witness to government funds reaching ineligible hands. This is also corruption, the chief minister said. He added that it is the responsibility of the officials to ensure that every penny out of the funds meant for various projects are spent only on those projects. Those causing lapses on such matters will have to face serious action, he said. Mentioning the “agent culture” prevailing in some government offices, he said that it should be completely wiped out. “What is the need for a third person or an intermediary between the public and the officials? All officials should have a clear understanding that government services are meant for the people,” he said. The government wishes that people get the best, friendly services from government offices. The office atmosphere should be in sync with that policy. In all government offices, the front office system is mandatory in the present times. He instructed that the officials should behave in a decent and polite manner with all those visiting government offices and should listen to their requirements with patience. Similarly, all representations and petitions submitted by the people should be responded properly with accurate facts and reasons. The chief minister said that change in governments after every five years and the associated policy changes have been adversely affecting consistent development of the state. It has affected the overall development of the state, and the people felt that it needs to be changed. He said that the civil services had a major role in tiding over the calamities that have hit the state in the last five years, like never before. If civil services are weakened, corporate entities will tighten their grip on the government. It is to ensure that it does not happen that the government is taking all steps to uphold the morale of the civil services, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/must-end-agent-culture-in-govt-offices-says-cm/articleshow/83728830.cms||---

Sambhaji Raje, along with convenors of the Maratha Kranti Morcha, held a meeting on Monday in Nashik after their scheduled second silent march. Sambhaji Raje, along with several activists, had sat on a silent sit-in protest at the Shahu Samadhi Sthal in Kolhapur last Wednesday. Speaking to the media, Sambhaji Raje said the government had sought 21 days to work on the community’s demands, but “we will wait for a month.” He said, “Silent march protests will not be held for a month, but we will hold meetings at district levels.” He added a decision was taken in a meeting with Maratha Kranti Morcha conveners to give time to the government, but the protest had not been withdrawn. The demands include provision of benefits to students and youths from the community in the fields of education and business, hostels for Maratha youths at every district headquarters and funds for the Sarthi institute. Last week, a delegation of the Sakal Maratha Samaj led by Sambhaji Raje had met CM Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar over key demands pertaining to the Maratha community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-maratha-outfits-put-off-protests-by-a-month/articleshow/83731157.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Artifical intelligence vigil for driving licence tests||MUMBAI: The online learner licence system will have artificial intelligence (AI) based checks to make it ‘foolproof’, state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said. He was reacting to last week’s incident of a Maha e-Seva kendra offering to ‘clear’ tests for several candidates for a fee. The department has got an FIR registered against the firm. “We have asked the NIC to introduce AI-based camera checks to ensure that bona fide applicants appear for the test and not any cyber cafe owner, RTO agent, driving school instructor or an e-Seva kendra staffer,” he said. Sources said NIC will use a licensed AI software to conduct a series of tests this week before incorporating it in the online learners platform. The process will be simple — your live camera picture will be taken and compared with pictures in the Aadhaar database. This will ensure the person giving the exam is the applicant. Another check introduced this week is of computer “IP address” in which officials will check if multiple tests are given from the same computer (5-10 or more), and zero in on the agent/ seva kendra or driving school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-artifical-intelligence-vigil-for-driving-licence-tests/articleshow/83733201.cms||Somit Sen

We are, however, ensuring the construction work for new and improved classrooms is done at a fast pace so that when children do end up returning to school, they are welcomed with the new and colourful classrooms with the best facilities,” said Sisodia. He visited four Delhi government schools — SKV Kondli, GGSS Kalyanpuri, Government Co-ed School at IP Extension, and Government Co-ed Senior Secondary School in Preet Vihar— where new classrooms are being built. The construction work at SKV Kondli school is 90% complete and will be ready by end of this month. At present, 20 new classrooms are being constructed at SKV Kondli. Similarly, 97% of construction work is complete at GGSS Kalyanpuri School, with 20 new classrooms in the process of being constructed. The construction work to build 84 new classrooms at Government Co-ed, IP Extension is 90% complete and the school construction will be ended by July. The classroom construction work is 84% complete at Government Co-ed Senior Secondary School, Preet Vihar. It will be ready by August and will host 48 new classrooms. “Classrooms should be equipped with state-of-the-art facilities. The schools and classrooms should be designed keeping in mind the psyche of the children. We should design schools in a way that they are interactive, so that when students return to schools and look at their colourful classes, they are motivated to learn and engage,” Sisodia told the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-in-city-wont-open-anytime-soon-says-sisodia/articleshow/83736689.cms||---

Talking to media on his arrival here on the statement of some Raje supporters — ‘Raje is BJP and BJP is Raje in Rajasthan,’ — Singh said, “Vasundhara Raje is our leader and the national vice-president of the party.” Refuting any rift in the BJP, he accused the Congress of indulging in factional fights affecting the functioning of the government in the state. Raje has been running parallel to the state leadership over the last many months. Her supporters have been running ‘Vasundhara Jan Rasoi’, when the party has been running ‘Seva hi Sangathan’ campaign to help the needy during the pandemic. Also, she has not been attending any meetings — virtual or physical — of the party. Over the last few days, Raje followers had gone overdrive in the state after her posters were removed from the state party headquarters. Many of them have spoken out in her support claiming that Raje is the only popular leader of the saffron party in the state, aggravating the factional feud in the party. Former BJP MLAs from Kota region, Bhavani Singh Rajawat, Prahlad Gunjal, Pratap Singh Singhvi along with former MP Bahadur Singh Koli, have publicly declared Raje to be their only leader in the desert state. In their statements, they had said, “Raje is BJP and BJP is Raje in Rajasthan”, inviting counters from state BJP chief Satish Poonia and leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria. They reminded the leaders that, “The constitution of the party is paramount and no person is bigger than the party.” The party leadership had warned that, “It is necessary that the prominent people of the party, whether an MLA, MP, or any office bearer, should avoid unnecessary statements as it neither serves them nor is in the party’s interest,” he added. Poonia said, “Every person is given an opportunity to speak on the party platform, but it is against the constitution of the party to say such things in public forums. The interest of the party is paramount for us. Even though a few workers are giving such statements for some reason on personal basis, but it doesn't fall within the limits of the party. The party knows such people and there is no need to discuss what will happen and when will it happen, however, whatever will happen will be known in some time.” Leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said that if someone thinks that ‘I am above the party’, then it is not right. Kataria also cautioned Raje supporters that in the BJP, first comes nation, then the party and the third comes the leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-state-in-charge-in-raj-amid-talks-of-factional-feud-within-party/articleshow/83731161.cms||---

The decision comes amid demands by students to reopen the library. On June 11, the university had said that it would reopen the library soon in line with government’s orders. “After due deliberations, keeping in line with government orders and the academic interests of the student community, the university administration has decided to take appropriate steps to open the library soon,” it had said. “This will comply with the expected announcement of the government regarding further unlocking measures in Delhi,” it had said. However, on Sunday the varsity said, “Due to the prevailing situation of Covid-19 and curfew announced by Delhi government, Dr BR Ambedkar Central Library will remain closed till further orders.” Earlier this month, the university administration had alleged that a few students broke into the library and scuffled with security guards, following which they “occupied” the library. It had also lodged an FIR against them for allegedly breaking into the facility and clashing with the staff.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: PCC ex-chief Narayan Singh wants leadership to give power to party workers||JAIPUR: Former Congress state president Narayan Singh on Monday issued a statement saying the Congress leadership should ensure participation of party workers who helped form the state government. Coming at a time when chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot are logged in a power tussle, Singh's statement is being seen in support of the latter. In a written statement, Singh said the Congress government in the state was formed when party workers and leaders toiled and shed their sweat. “Therefore, there is a need for Congress workers to be given participation in power at the state and district levels. It will boost their morale. It is the moral responsibility of the Congress leadership to do so,” Singh wrote. “Congress high command should listen to old and loyal workers who kept the party’s flag high in the face of adversity,” the ex-PCC chief added. After Congress lost the 2003 state election, Singh was appointed the party state president. He soon fell out with Gehlot. The two reconciled when Congress returned to power in 2008. Singh lost the assembly election in 2008 but Gehlot appointed him chairman of the state farmers commission. In 2013, Singh won the assembly election from Danta-Ramgarh in Sikar district. In 2018, his son Virendra Singh contested from the seat and got elected. It is believed the father-son duo have now moved closer to Pilot. The senior Jat leader’s statement has stirred in the tussle in the state Congress. Legislators supporting Pilot have been demanding redressal of their issues by the AICC committee formed 10 months back. As a counter move, six BSP-turned-Congress MLAs and 13 independent MLAs have expressly vowed support to Gehlot. These 19 MLAs have scheduled a meeting to discuss their future strategy on the current turmoil in state Congress here on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pcc-ex-chief-wants-leadership-to-give-power-to-party-workers/articleshow/83731193.cms||---

The only space we have for one is at Sarangpur at the moment,” said Prof Jagat Ram, director, PGI. He said, “We need to take permission from the government. We have deliberated on the requirement and shall work on the finer details soon to check the feasibility.” Sarangpur satellelite centre spans across 50 acre of land. The building is almost on the verge of completion. “This facility will house a mortuary and laboratory for infectious diseases only,” the director said. Presently, Nehru Extension hospital is functioning as Covid hospital with a 300-bed facility. PGI had no other option other than to utilise this building for Covid treatment as it was some distance away from other non-Covid care services and had all the required ICU settings. Sources said there will be a governing body meeting at PGI next month and the proposal will be submitted to health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan. But there are others who feel there is a need to classify infectious diseases as most patients in the PGI have some or the other infection. “The Nehru Extension hospital was built to cater to ENT, radiotherapy, hepatology and endocrinology departments. Patients of these departments who need surgery, admission and follow ups have to be soon shifted here once the curve flattens. We cannot wait for years for this to happen. So, the immediate plan is to have a separate hospital from the present campus. Most of the patients do not feel at ease to come to the PGI as there are Covid beds in the Covid hospital and even in Nehru hospital wards,” said a faculty member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-plans-300-bed-infectious-disease-hospital-in-sarangpur/articleshow/83726425.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president, DSGMC, said they were united in raising their voice and would act against any form of disrespect shown to the sanctum sanctorum of Sikhs. However, Mukesh Suryan, mayor, SDMC, said Sirsa was not the lone representative of the Sikhs and wider consultations would be taken with other religious leaders. “The park has replicas of temples and important monuments from all religions. It is being developed to showcase our nation’s heritage. It is not meant to disrespect any community. Sirsa should not play politics over such an issue,” the mayor said, adding that Sirsa and Union minister Hardeep Puri were present at the foundation laying ceremony of the park. Meanwhile, Sirsa tweeted, “Darbar Sahib, Amritsar is not a tourist spot that can be replicated. It is the sanctum sanctorum for Sikhs and seeing a replica for touristy offends us to the core (sic)” A municipal official said people from the Sikh community arrived at the site on Monday morning to damage the structures, but were stopped. The mayor said, for the time being, the work on this structure would be kept pending and consensus built on the issue. The councillor from Punjabi Bagh, Kailash Sankla, said this was a non-issue that was being blown up in view of the upcoming municipal elections. “When the foundation stone was laid, Puri and the gurdwara committee chief were also present. If anyone wanted to raise any objection, it could have been done then. Artists are trying to showcase our national heritage and people should not try to stroke religious sentiments over this issue,” he added. Bharat Darshan Park is being set up after the success of the Waste to Wonder Park, which showcases the seven wonders of the world. It will host replicas of important heritage sites and monuments, including Konark Temple, Charminar, Nalanda ruins, Golden Temple, Meenakshi Temple and Sanchi Stupa. An official said the park was spread over 8 acres and would host 18 replicas. With an estimated cost of Rs 1.12 crore, the Golden Temple replica is expected to be the most expensive. As much as 12 tonnes of scrap has been used for the structure, which is around 22 feet high, the official added. “Meticulous work of so many artists is being destroyed,” an official remarked. The park was expected to be completed by March-April, but Covid delayed the work by three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/golden-temple-replica-at-sdmc-park-sparks-row/articleshow/83731215.cms||Paras Singh

The affected candidates include those who have been selected for the posts of deputy collector and deputy superintendent of police among others. In a memorandum submitted to the government, the would-be bureaucrats said they were facing immense trauma due to non-appointment in government service for the past one year. “The state government has been citing legal tangles over the Maratha quota issue as the reason for the delay in confirming our appointments. However, the Supreme Court has already given a clear verdict on Maratha reservation and, therefore, we should get the appointment letters at the earliest,” said Manoj Chavan, one of the affected candidates. The recruitment process in question was started by the MPSC in 2019 and the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota for the Maratha community was made applicable. But the same was struck down by the Supreme Court. “A solution can be worked out to decide on the fate of Maratha students who qualify the MPSC examination of 2019 under the SEBC quota. However, it is wrong to hold all students at ransom for the sake of a few students,” said another candidate. The candidates also narrated their struggle spanning over a decade to qualify for the MPSC. “Many of us hail from humble backgrounds and have put in years of hard work to crack the exam. The stalemate over recruitment is affecting us in many ways. The government should end our wait,” another candidate said. An official mail sent to MPSC seeking its stand on the issue remained unanswered till Monday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/a-year-on-mpsc-qualified-candidates-await-job-letters/articleshow/83728875.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Kochi||Kerala: Decide on plea to bring petrol & diesel under GST, Centre told||KOCHI: Kerala high court has asked the central government to decide on a representation seeking to bring petroleum products under goods and services tax (GST) regime. A division bench comprising chief justice S Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly asked the government to take a decision on the representation raising the demand within six weeks after considering a petition (WP-C No. 12481/2021) filed by Kerala Pradesh Gandhi Darshanvedi through advocate Arun B Varghese. It was alleged by the petitioner that petrol and diesel rates differ in various states as the tax levied by each state is different. Unification of tax on petrol and diesel is required, the petitioner had demanded in the petition while alleging that frequent price increases are adversely affecting the life of citizens as prices of common goods also increase with the increase in fuel prices. The petitioner had also pointed out that central and state governments intervene and control the fuel prices when elections are imminent even when they say that the petroleum marketing companies decide the prices. Opposing the petition, central government contended in court that the matter falls within the policy realm of the government and that the court should not interfere. Following the submissions, the court asked the central government to decide on the representation filed by the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/decide-on-plea-to-bring-petrol-diesel-under-gst-centre-told/articleshow/83728887.cms||---

Presiding over a meeting in his office, the DC said now the supply of the Covid vaccine is far better and the need is just to vaccinate all adults against Covid-19. He added that the need of the hour is to further scale up the vaccination drive to prevent any fresh wave of a pandemic by sending teams to every nook and corner of the district. According to him, the accelerated vaccination drive would help to build herd immunity thus would break the transmission chain. The DC also appealed to people to come forward for the vaccination in huge numbers, especially youngsters, to maximise the coverage. Sharma further asked the IMA to share the details of teams with the health departments so that more new inoculation camps can be organised in the district as soon as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ludh-eyes-33000-covid-vaccine-jabs-daily/articleshow/83731192.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But Usha Lodaya had to abandon her aspirations after she got married at the age of 20. But almost five decades later, the gritty lady fulfilled her dream when she passed her viva for PhD on Sunday. At the age of 67, Usha, a resident of Harni Road, has got a doctorate degree! “It was a dream come true. I can now prefix Dr in my name. It took me almost 50 years to achieve something that I had aspired for when I was a teenager. Though not medical but I did get a doctorate degree,” an elated Usha told TOI. She completed her PhD in Jainism from Maharashtra-based Shatrunjay Academy with focus on the peace tenets preached by the religion. “I had made up my mind to become a doctor when I was in seventh standard. I got engaged by the age of 16 but I continued my studies and pursued BSc at Jhunjhunwala College in Mumbai. But I had to quit in the first-year after I got married when I turned 20,” Usha, who shifted from Mumbai to Vadodara after wedding, said. She was in tears as she wanted to study further. “I got busy with family life later but the urge to complete my studies always remained. So, I decided to pursue academics again nine years ago,” Usha added. She first completed her bachelor’s degree from Shatrunjay Academy in Jalgaon, Maharashtra and then pursued Masters in Jainism. Four years ago, Usha got registered for PhD under her guide Dr Jaydarshita Shriji Maharaj who was a professor in a Mumbai college. “Pursuing PhD was tough as I had to study and take all the guidance online. Sometimes I had to travel to the academy at Chaalisgaon in Jalgaon but my family including my son Bhavesh and daughter Minal fully supported me,” Usha said. Tragedy struck when just one-and-half years after she started her PhD as her husband Khirendra Lodaya passed away. But she collected herself and remained committed to her doctorate studies. It took her four years to do the research and write the thesis. “The self-imposed lockdown was, in fact, a blessing for me as I could focus on writing my thesis,” she said. “She was always a determined lady. We are proud of her as she pursued her dreams in an age when people prefer to retire,” Bhavesh said. So what are her future plans? “Well, I would like to teach the students interested in pursuing Jainism studies,” Usha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/at-67-this-grandma-fulfills-her-50-year-old-phd-dream/articleshow/83726617.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Trichy||Trichy: Desilting tough for corporation workers with solid waste deposit in drains||TRICHY: Trichy Corporation has taken up a synchronised desilting drive across the four zones of the corporation, and the sanitation workers, who are clearing the stormwater drains that serve as drainage canals, face an uphill task. With most of the drains uncovered, people dump solid waste into the canals and the waste deposit makes the process laborious and time-consuming. Ahead of the monsoon, the corporation has proposed to desilt 2,000m of drainage canals in each of the four zones every day. The civic body has been completing work in the wards that were not covered under the underground drainage scheme. However, wards that have a UGD network that also use stormwater drains for discharging sewage have caused a concern. Officials supervising the desilting process said that the deposition of solid waste in the drains causes the process to be challenging. The quantity of silt removed from the canals exposes the amount of waste dumped in the drainage carriers. “Plastic and even glass bottles were dumped in the drains. We are ensuring that the workers wear safety boots and hand gloves while clearing the drains. The process could be easier if people avoid dumping waste in the drains,” a sanitary officer told TOI. Experts suggested the civic body to cover the drains with RCC slabs, which would prevent stray animals and even children from falling into the drains, besides preventing waste dumping. Most of the drains passing through Jaffer Shah Street, Big Bazaar and Palakkarai lack proper slabs to cover the drains. While officials said that the slabs will obstruct the clearing of silt, residents said that they can be placed without applying cement or concrete so that they can be removed when required. “We will close the drains in a phased manner,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/desilting-tough-for-corpn-workers-with-solid-waste-deposit-in-drains/articleshow/83728912.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Delhi||Two to tango: Parking for 3,000 cars, a metro station to come up in central Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has paved the way for an underground Delhi Metro station with a multi-level car parking (MLCP) facility above ground. This second-of-its-kind facility in the capital will come up at Nabi Karim in central Delhi. The congested area will get a busy Delhi Metro interchange station in the next few years as part of the Janakpuri West-RK Ashram Marg corridor of Phase-IV. While the Metro station will connect this part of the city to other parts of the capital, the MLCP will help residents and traders by providing ample parking space, the lack of which is a major problem at present. Recently, DDA approved the change of land use of the 6.4-acre plot for the MLCP “to cater to the acute demand of parking in the area” from “Residential (Redevelopment)” to “Transportation (MLCP)”. A DDA official said the proposed modification would help North Delhi Municipal Corporation construct the MLCP at Nabi Karim Metro Station at Idgah Road. DDA has invited objections and suggestions from the public regarding the land-use modification. The fully automated facility, which will have enough space to accommodate more than 3,000 cars at a point of time, is going to be jointly developed by DMRC and NDMC as part of an integrated station complex. An MoU for the Nabi Karim project was signed last year. DMRC has planned the underground interchange facility for the upcoming Janakpuri West–RK Ashram Marg corridor and the proposed Inderlok–Indraprastha corridor of the Phase-IV project. The Metro station will come up with four underground levels and, on the surface, the building will have nine floors, including the six-storey car parking facility and a three-storey commercial complex. The total land area will be around 25,000 square metres. DMRC will construct the integrated sub structure for the station and NDMC will build the super structure for the parking as well as commercial facilities through a concessionaire. NDMC would also operate and maintain the parking facility and the commercial block, officials said. DMRC had identified the piece of land as it had to construct an interchange station. NDMC, which owns the land, also had plans for a MLCP-cum-commercial facility. After a series of meetings, a solution was found by combining the two projects as an integrated complex, the official said. DMRC had earlier constructed a multilevel parking facility at the New Delhi Metro station of the Airport Express Line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-to-tango-parking-for-3k-cars-a-metro-station/articleshow/83731393.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He submitted that she is globally renowned and posted the content “based on news reports” of a man allegedly being attacked. However, she deleted her June 14 posts after two days. Her petition says she was neither the ‘original author of the news report’ nor the first to tweet but she was “being singled out unlawfully and unjustly” and “falsely implicated”. Desai also submitted that Ayyub recently underwent a surgery and needs a few weeks to approach a court in UP for regular pre-arrest bail. The HC granted her relief and directed that in the event of her arrest, she must be released on a PR bond of Rs 25000 with one or more sureties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/up-assault-video-journo-ayyub-gets-pre-arrest-bail-in-mumbai/articleshow/83733272.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Jaipur||2 Raj labourers continue to be held captive in Saudi Arabia||Kota: Two Rajasthan-based labourers continue to be held captive by their employer in Saudi Arabia's Yanbu city for the last six months despite assurance by authorities that they would return home by April-end, a state Congress leader alleged on Monday. Gaffar Mohammed (49) and Vishram Jatav (46) from Bundi and Bharatpur districts, respectively, had gone to Saudi Arabia three years ago on a work agreement. The pact expired in November last year and the two requested their employer to send them back to India. According to the Congress leader, the two are still being held captive under inhuman conditions. “The website of the Prime Minister's Office, on a complaint dated April 3, responded that the case was closed on April 26 as the sponsor of the two Indians granted them permission to exit by end of the month,” Charmesh Sharma, Congress’ Bundi district vice-president, said. “The fact is that the two Indians are still living in captivity,” Sharma said and claimed that he has spoken to them four days ago over the phone where they again narrated their plight. “The two labourers have somehow managed to survive on leftovers given to them by other workers out of pity,” he said. He also claimed that the duo has been kept in a room without power supply where the temperature hovers around 50C. “The two labourers said that their employer had threatened them they would not be allowed to leave for homeland till next year and they must work for them without salary as their work visa had already expired,” Sharma said. Sharma said he has written to President Ram Nath Kovind to intervene in the matter and ensure the safe and immediate release of the two Indians. In March, after hearing the plight of the two labourers, Sharma had lodged an online complaint with the ministry of external affairs and wrote to the PMO, foreign minister and home minister requesting them to facilitate their safe return. The ministry directed the Indian embassy in Saudi Arabia that handed over the matter to consulate general of India in Jeddah Dr Mohammad Alim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-raj-labourers-continue-to-be-held-captive-in-saudi-arabia/articleshow/83731237.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||State all set to fund 3rd phase of Rajiv Gandhi canal project||Jaipur: The state government has decided to operate the proposed Rajiv Gandhi Lift Canal Phase-3 project with state funds to meet the demand for industrial and drinking water needs of Jodhpur city as well as five other towns and more than 2,000 villages. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot approved the proposal of this project that will cost Rs 1,454 crore. As per the approved proposal, the project has been prepared with the objective of providing drinking water to 76.47 lakh people including the population of Jodhpur city, five other towns and 2,104 villages. It is also proposed to meet the industrial requirements of water in the proposed Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), Rohat district in Pali and RIICO area in Jodhpur. According to the project, water will be brought from Indira Gandhi Main Canal to Jodhpur with the help of four pumping stations through a 205-km pipeline parallel to the existing open canal. The project was earlier proposed to be funded by Japanese International Cooperation Agency(JICA). But the cost of the project is increasing due to the delay in getting loan from JICA for more than 14 months. It might still take a minimum of two years to sign a loan agreement with JICA and 6-7 years to start it by issuing work orders. It has therefore been decided to run the project using state funds, said a government statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-all-set-to-fund-3rd-phase-of-rajiv-gandhi-canal-project/articleshow/83731233.cms||---
---||Delhi||Pilot project to create reservoir in Yamuna floodplain enters final leg||NEW DELHI: The third and final phase of the pilot project for creating a mega sub-surface reservoir in the Yamuna floodplain will be carried out during this monsoon season. A strip of 45-acre area has been prepared in Palla for this purpose. “All the preparations have been made for the third and final year of Yamuna flood harvesting and recharge in Palla area. During the last two phases, a rise of 0.5 to 2 metres in ground water level was observed. In the third phase, a total of 35 piezometers have been installed to measure the rise in groundwater levels during the flooding cycles,” said a senior official associated with the project. In the long run, the irrigation and flood control department plans to create a 1,000-acre recharge pond so that the excess water can be used when the city faces acute water shortage during summers. Another official said that in the first phase in 2019, a very high flood was experienced when the swelled-up river was flowing 2 metres above pond with over 8 lakh cusecs discharge during monsoons. “In 2020, we experienced less water during the flooding with only 36,000 cusecs peak flow. After the 2019 flooding period, there was a massive siltation and we had to spend Rs 8 crore for desilting the site. Very less siltation was observed in 2020 and only Rs 16 lakh is being spent on desiltation now,” the official added. Data from last decade suggests that on average, 18 flooding cycles happen in the Yamuna floodplain every season when water levels go above 208m. With each cycle yielding 2,100 million gallons (MG) of water, it had been initially estimated that over 37,800MG water will be stored. Delhi has aj demand-supply gap of 250-300 MGD and the government says that excess water will be used to meet peak summer demand. The selected site in Palla near Sungurpur lies between the Yamuna shore and embankment created by the flood control department. Top 1-1.5 m of soil layer has been removed so that pesticides/fertilisers do not seep into the water to pollute the aquifers and arrangements have been made to hold the water so that it can seep in through the sandy river bed. Officials have in the past argued that studies using ‘Modflow’ software found out that the flow of underground water and the slope is towards the Alipur belt, and all the water that seeps in is expected to move towards the Alipur side.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pilot-project-to-create-reservoir-in-yamuna-floodplain-enters-final-leg/articleshow/83728965.cms||Paras Singh

The investigation team headed by Crime Branch DSP Manoj Kumar began investigations into the case by recording statements of rebel JRP leaders who had raised allegations against Surendran and Janu. Sulthan Bathery police had recently registered a case under IPC sections 171 E (punishment for bribery) and 171 F (punishment for undue influence or personation in elections) over allegations that Surendran paid Rs 50 lakh to Janu in two instances. The case was registered the case after Kalpetta judicial first class magistrate court issued directions after considering a petition filed by Muslim Students Federation (MSF) state president P K Navas. Meanwhile a three-member Crime Branch team headed by Manoj Kumar recorded the statements of JRP state treasurer Praseed Azhikode at her house at Azhikode on Monday, It is learnt that Praseeda reiterated her charges that Surendran paid Rs 10 lakh to Janu at a hotel in Thiruvananthapuram on March 7 for her reentry to the NDA. The investigation team also recorded the statements of JRP state secretary and secretary Prakashan Morazha who had also raised allegations against Janu. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cb-takes-over-probe-against-surendran-janu/articleshow/83729025.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is now setting up a new strong room in its Vazhuthacaud compound to hold more ivory stock as the existing one is crammed with ivory, tusks, valuable wooden and historical objects worth crores of rupees. Of the total ivory and tusks stored in the strong room, nearly 10 tonnes came from captive elephants. Officials said the present jam-packed strong room is under CCTV, security personnel surveillance 24 hours a day. The department had once submitted a proposal in 2014 to burn the ivory but it was rejected by the government. The department pays huge amounts for security and the additional strong room too will need additional monetary spend. “The question before us when we put forward a proposal to burn the ivory was why should such valuables be destroyed. No other state burned ivory and tusks though such actions were reported in Tanzania and some African countries. The tusks of our elephant are solid while that of African elephants is hollow,” said a senior official He added that nothing more can be said about the stockpile and the strong room can be opened jointly by three officials with individual keys in the presence of senior department officials. “The structure of the new strong room, bigger than the existing one, is ready. The earlier one was not permanent and that’s another reason to construct a new one. Ivory trade is banned. As to burning of ivory, it is the policy decision of the government,” said another official. Ivory and tusks of wild and captive elephants are kept in the strong room. When the department submitted its proposal (to burn the ivory stock) to the state wildlife board in 2014, the latter decided to exhibit ivory trophies in museums and deferred the decision on burning. But, the ministry of environment and forests told the government in 2016 that the Wildlife Protection Act does not encourage display of wildlife trophies. The ministry told the government on two occasions that the old stock of ivory, not involved in cases, needs to be burnt. Despite national laws and international practices, government is reluctant to greenlight the burning proposal that gives a stern message to illicit ivory dealers and deters poaching. Kerala had witnessed poaching of 13 elephants at Kuttampuzha in 2015 and 450kg of ivory were recovered by the department and moved to the strong room in Malayattoor. Meanwhile former director of Kerala Forest Research Institute P S Easa, one of the members of the board when the proposal for burning ivory came up, said, “Burning ivory could be a deterrent and a strong message. There is nothing wrong in keeping it at a museum. The question is how much you can exhibit and under what criteria.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ivory-storage-forest-dept-to-set-up-new-strong-room/articleshow/83726657.cms||T C Sreemol

Rajappan, who is physically challenged with both his legs paralyzed from birth, had filed a complaint with the police that the financial assistance and boats he received was looted by his sister Vilasini, husband and son. Police have collected the transaction details from the bank and applied for a copy of the transaction documents, including the cheque presented to withdraw money. Meanwhile, police said that all the three accused are absconding. “The investigation is in its final stage and we will take action as soon as we get the copy of the transaction details on Wednesday,” said Kumarakom station house officer. Police said the copy of the documents was needed to verify the signature on the cheque. Police confirmed that the said amount in the complaint given by Raju was withdrawn on those days. Police said the CCTV footages on the days when the money were withdrawn was not available as the camera did not have the facility to store old footages. In the complaint, Rajappan said that Rs 5 lakh was withdrawn from his account without his knowledge on February 12 and another Rs 8,000 on March 17. He also said that both the boats he had got as gifts were in the custody of Vilasini and family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/accused-absconding-probe-in-final-stages-police/articleshow/83729120.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Laabh Singh, the face of Chandigarh’s farm stir, detained, released after protest||CHANDIGARH: Laabh Singh, a Nihang Sikh farm activist who is aged over 80 and has been camping near Matka Chowk here to protest against the Centre’s farm laws for nearly three months, was detained by Chandigarh Police on Monday morning, triggering a protest by hundreds of people outside the Sector 17 police station, the site of his detention. Laabh was released around 5pm, after farm groups agreed to shift the activist’s tent 100 metres away from Matka Chowk. Kisan Ekta Chandigarh (Matka Chowk) president Satnam Singh Tanda said Laabh was picked up around 11am, after police came to them to ask them to dismantle a tent they had pitched on a divider next to Matka Chowk. He said when they had gone to discuss the matter with a police official, a police team came from behind and picked up Laabh when he was alone. They also dismantled the tent. When contacted, a police official said no charges had been pressed against the senior citizen and that they wanted the tent to be removed from the divider due to security concerns. Within an hour of Laabh Singh being picked up, a team of farm groups’ representatives started talks with police officials. Tanda said they had agreed to shift the tent slightly away from Matka Chowk, but protests would continue at the spot. He added the Chandigarh Police’s action had been taken in view of activists protesting when Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar was crossing Matka Chowk on Friday. Tanda said activists of Pendu Sanghash Committee, Naujawan Kisan Ekta and other farm groups had started gathering on getting news of the protest. By 2.30pm, as the number of protesters swelled, duty magistrate for the day Pradhuman Singh, an HCS officer who is posted as Chandigarh Registering and Licensing Authority, also reached the police station. On coming out, he told TOI that they wanted the tent to be removed from the divider as it was a security concern. By 5pm, Laabh was released from the police station, eliciting celebrations outside the police station amid cries of “kisan ekta zindabad” (long live farmer unity). Tanda said people who were part of the negotiations included Rajan Bains, Jagjeet Bajwa, Amandeep Singh Mann, Gurjeet Singh Dhillon, and Gurpreet Singh Chahal. Tea, juice, samosas for all During the day, the protesters started bringing water bottles, snacks and tea outside the police station for the crowd. They could also be seen serving police personnel and journalists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/laabh-singh-the-face-of-chandigarhs-farm-stir-detained-released-after-protest/articleshow/83726578.cms||Siddarth Banerjee
---||Delhi||Let’s not relive the ordeal: Mask up, join fight, say Covid warriors in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Long working hours without breaks, the deaths of near and dear ones — the doctors who manned the Covid-19 wards during the recent wave of infections in the capital have faced it all as they struggled to save lives. “We have never encountered such a catastrophe and pray there is no recurrence,” said Dr Atul Gogia, senior consultant for internal medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “We, as a society, have to ensure it does not happen again by following Covid-appropriate behaviour. I appeal to all the citizens to kindly observe the norms lest we lose more of our fellow citizens.” According to Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of AIIMS Trauma Centre, the sheer number of those infected by the coronavirus overwhelmed the healthcare system leading to a shortfall of everything required for the treatment of the infected and turning finally into a tsunami of death and disease. “The numbers rose and multiplied rapidly essentially due to the blatant disregard of the Covid precautions by the public at large,” Malhotra claimed. “Whether it was the so-called Covid fatigue, a feeling of suffocation and helplessness or perhaps an urge to break free, or even the mistaken belief that we were somehow protected from severe Covid, the people’s brazen behaviour overlooked the fact that India has a large population that is vulnerable not only to Covid, but also deadly complications.” Malhotra asserted that a significant deterrent to Covid-19 norms was the misconception that once vaccinated you didn't need to take precautionary measures. “Nothing is further from the truth because even if you are vaccinated and protected, you can still be an asymptomatic carrier of the virus and can spread it,” cautioned the doctor. “There are apprehensions that the infections will surge again if we do not change our behaviour and so halt the cycle of new infections, increased hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths.” Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, chairman of neurosciences, VIMHANS, said a third wave was inevitable but if people inculcated Covid-appropriate behaviour — mainly, wearing a mask, maintaining physical distance and practising hand hygiene — its intensity could be reduced. “But clearly, that is not happening at the moment. People are crowding the markets with little regard to Covid norms,” said Dwivedee. At Ujala Cyngus Hospital, Dr Shuchin Bajaj despaired of having to go through another wave of infections. “I have been on Covid duty for a really long time now. I am exhausted. I have lost many kilos because I have sweated buckets inside my PPE suit. I’ve lost countless friends and loved ones to the virus. I don’t want to lose more,” he said. After such a stressful experience, Bajaj is naturally appalled to see people going around without masks or blatantly ignoring social distancing requirements. “None of us need to go through the recent experience again. All you have to do is wear a mask, take the vaccine and avoid standing close to someone. It’s not too much to ask for,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lets-not-relive-the-ordeal-mask-up-join-fight-say-covid-warriors/articleshow/83729070.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Kochi||Kerala: Woman found dead at husband’s home in Sooranad||KOLLAM: Vismaya S V, daughter of Thrivikraman Nair and Sajitha, was found dead in the bathroom of her husband’s home in Sooranad on Monday morning. Before she died, she had messaged her relatives on WhatsApp that she had been repeatedly beaten up by her husband Kiran Kumar, demanding more dowry. Kumar, an official with the motor transport department and the son of Sadasivan Pillai and Chandramathi, had married Vismaya on May 31 last year. Vismaya’s father told the media that he had been given 1.2 acres, a car worth Rs 10 lakh and 100 sovereigns of gold as dowry for her wedding. But Kumar was dissatisfied with the car and wanted more money. But the family couldn’t pay him as they had already availed a loan to buy him the car. Vismaya, in her WhatsApp chat, had stated that Kumar used to shower abuses on her and her father and that he had repeatedly beaten her up demanding more dowry. She had said that a day ago she was beaten up and had shared pictures of the bruises she sustained in the attack. “He used to beat me up whenever he was angry. He was unhappy with the car my father gave. He showered abuses on my father for some time. When it was too much to bear, I tried to exit the room. He then stopped me, pulled me by my hair and slapped me right on my face. When I fell, he put his foot on my face,” she wrote in the chat she shared with relatives. Vismaya’s brother Vijith and her father were adamant that Vismaya would never commit suicide and it was a clear case of murder. They alleged that Kumar was using his official position to save himself in this case. But, women’s panel member Shahida Kamal said she has sought a report from the rural SP and the statement of Vismaya’s in-laws and autopsy report are awaited. Sooranad police registered a case and have started the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/woman-found-dead-at-husbands-home/articleshow/83726594.cms||---
---||Delhi||Major blaze at Delhi's Udyog Nagar godown, 6 workers missing||NEW DELHI: It took around 30 fire tenders over nine hours to douse a major fire that broke out at a godown in Udyog Nagar near Peeragarhi on Monday morning. Four people were rescued by noon, while two others had managed to escape earlier. Families of six labourers — all aged between 22-35 years — told cops that they did not return home. Rescue operations were on for the missing men. The call about the blaze was received at 8.22am and till late afternoon the firefighting operations continued. Firemen said that the fire spread rapidly and engulfed the adjacent portion of the building as inflammable material were stacked inside. The building, consisting of a basement, ground and two other floors did not have a valid fire NOC. Officials had tobreak the front portion of the building to douse the fire from both sides. Meanwhile, the municipal corporation declared the building as dangerous after portions of the second and first floor collapsed. DCP (outer) Parvinder Singh said the building was being used as a godown and not a factory — primarily for storing shoes. “It also had other items such as packaging material and plastic, which could have spread the fire. The area was evacuated for safety measures,” said Singh. “Due to poor visibility inside from the smoke and the heat, limited number of firemen could be pressed into action. The building was being cleared bit by bit,” said an official. By around 1 pm, four men had been rescued while two others had managed to escape initially. Witnesses told TOI that the area had quite a few shoe factories and storage warehouses. Labourers and staff often slept at the units in the night. Locals said the fire actually broke out an hour before the call was made. “The fire may have occurred at around 7am and by 8am, there was smoke in the area,” said Prem Kishen, a labourer who works in a nearby storage unit. Jugnu, another labourer working in the Peeragarhi industrial area, said people from nearby warehouses had already evacuated their buildings on the first sight of smoke. “The area was cleared out within minutes,” he said. The blaze was fully doused by 6.48pm, a fire department official said. “Cooling and search operation is on. The owner of the building is absconding, which is why it was difficult to gather details about those trapped inside,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services. A case under section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) has been registered against the owner.

---||Delhi||Health workers in Delhi fear the worst, call for caution||NEW DELHI: “The entire hospital had patients on oxygen at a time when there was an oxygen scarcity in Delhi,” recalled Anish TS, a male nurse at Saroj Hospital in Rohini. “That musn’t happen again. It is the citizens’ responsibility not to step out of the home unless there is an emergency.” Healthcare workers, especially paramedics and ward boys who were the primary caregivers, were overburdened during the recent Covid-19 wave, and they insist that the lessons of this disastrous period should be learnt by one and all. Seeing the indiscipline about Covid-appropriate behaviour after the city opened the markets and malls, the paramedics fear people are inviting not just a third, but perhaps a fourth and a fifth wave of infection too. “I am afraid that people are just not accepting how important it is to stick to proper Covid behaviour,” said Sachin Kumar, 32, a ward boy at Karkardooma’s Shanti Mukund Hospital. “We hospital staff learnt to maintain a distance from our family members to ensure their safety, but people ignore this necessity.” Kumar tended to a 75-year-old Covid patient in the ward until he was moved to the ICU before succumbing and that corona trauma is burnt into his psyche. Donna Mary Moncy, 28, clinical instructor at Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka, has served as a Covid worker on both sides of the table — she has been involved in the ICU and has also been engaging with the attendants of the Covid patients, trying to keep their morale high. When asked about the stressful time dealing with the huge surge in Covid cases, Moncy said, “People perhaps think it's over now. But my friend’s husband has been admitted to the hospital since the first week of April. I see him every day. My friend asks me about his health frequently but I don’t know what to say to her or how to console her. It’s been many days since her husband’s hospitalisation and one can’t even imagine what the family must be going through, especially the 12-year-old daughter whom he hasn’t met for so long now.” Moncy said that while the healthcare workers had quickly learnt how taking precautions would boost their safety, the population at large hadn’t yet realised the reality of what another surge of coronavirus would do. “So often I see people removing their masks and spitting. They don’t realise the damage this can cause to their health. People should mask up all the time and not come out of the house for leisure activities. These are tough times and we all need to fight the pandemic together.” Nutan Bisht, a nurse at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, hit the nail on the head when she remarked that people recognised the deadly impact of Covid only when they lost their kin. Others are blasé about the infection. “While on duty, I saw a 30-year-old woman lose her life. She did have other complications, but it was still a very young life gone,” said Bisht. “She had been coming for treatment to the hospital for two years and most of us knew her. So many people lost their lives in the second wave and yet people have begun to get careless. It’s disheartening to see this. We can’t let our guard down, it will endanger our lives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/health-workers-fear-the-worst-call-for-caution/articleshow/83729109.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Mumbai||MSRTC goof-up: Raigad staff gets pay, told to return it after few hours||MUMBAI: In a major goof-up, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees from Raigad district, including Pen and Karjat, who were awaiting salaries for the past two weeks finally got their pay, but they had to return it within a few hours as it was an “erroneous disbursement”. “The staffers were thrilled to finally get the pay, but the joy was short-lived,” said union leader Shrirang Barge from Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress. “The accounts department had wrongly credited all salary accounts in Raigad on Monday. This led to confusion as employees from other districts, including Mumbai, did not get their pay which has been delayed by two weeks. Just then, the Raigad staffers got a message from their superiors that they will have to return the money. It was upsetting,” Barge added. Confirming the incident, the MSRTC spokesperson said there will be an inquiry. “The salaries will be returned and all staffers will get their pay at the same time in the future,” he said. Nearly a lakh employees from MSRTC are yet to receive their monthly salary even as the state government recently approved the third financial aid of Rs 600 crore for the corporation, of which Rs 300 crore was expected to be used to pay workers’ salaries for two months. The previous two financial aids received were Rs 550 crore in July 2020 and Rs 1000 crore in December 2020. Last year, MSRTC workers had waited for over two months to get their salaries. The accumulated losses are close to Rs 9,000 crore, sources said. The Maharashtra government has now set up a sub-committee to look into various avenues through which the MSRTC can increase its revenue and try to bail itself out from the red.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/msrtc-goof-up-raigad-staff-gets-pay-told-to-return-it-after-few-hrs-in-maharashtra/articleshow/83733360.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mumbai||Let possession of Esplanade be handed to landlord, Bombay HC urged||MUMBAI: The owner of Esplanade Mansion at Fort has moved Bombay high court (HC) afresh with a plea to pass appropriate orders directing the state’s housing authority, Mhada to hand over possession of the building to the landlord and to others, including the civic body, to grant necessary permissions expeditiously on submission of the plans. The owner, Sadiq Ali Noorani (78), has also sought orders to Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, which wants the property acquired and restored by the government for public purpose, or any other agencies to not interfere in the project of restoration of the building at any point. He had in 2015 filed a petition, seeking permissions to restore the building. In February last year, the HC had granted Noorani the liberty to file an affidavit to set how the building’s owner would proceed with its restoration and reconstruction, he said and hence he now filed the affidavit and sought a hearing. The HC is scheduled to hear the matter on Tuesday. Noorani had last February informed the HC that he, along with eligible and bona fide tenants, is willing to bring Rs 50 crore for the restoration of the Unesco Nations World heritage structure, formerly the cast iron-framed Watsons Hotel. His counsel, Cherag Balsara, had during that hearing furnished a letter written by the owner and submitted that he would also formulate a scheme on disbursement of the amount. The landlord said that on April 12, 2021, in a subsequent letter, he set out his financial capacity and showed Rs 20 crore “already lying in my personal bank account”. He added that unless the building is handed over to him by Mhada, in whose custody it is, he would be unable to proceed with its restoration work. He seeks a direction that once handed over, the landlord will carry out its conservation and restoration as recommended in a structural audit report of January 2020 prepared by conservation structural engineer Chetan Raikar. The landlord said he had on February 29, 2020 appointed Raikar as the conservation structural engineer for the restoration project which he estimates would take 40 months to finish once all permissions are in place. The landowner said, “Keeping the historical importance of the building” and its features, he would endeavour to restore it to its past glory with “best in class” professional experts in heritage conservation.  An HC-appointed panel comprising conservation architects Abha Lambah and Pankaj Joshi along with Raikar had recommended its restoration. Earlier an IIT committee had suggested that it be razed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/let-possession-of-esplanade-be-handed-to-landlord-bombay-hc-urged/articleshow/83731493.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kochi||Kerala to receive heavy rains for next two days||KOCHI: The India meteorological department (IMD) has issued a heavy rainfall alert of 7-11cm for the next two days in the state. A yellow alert has been sounded for seven districts -- Ernakulam, Idukki, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod – on these days. IMD also warned of strong winds with speeds reaching 45-55kmph gusting to 65kmph likely over southwest and west-central Arabian Sea till Friday. Coastal regions will be on alert and fishermen are advised not to venture into these sea areas during this period, IMD has warned. Private weather agency Skymet Weather said that the southwest monsoon 2021 has typically played truant this year. Within six days of its mainland arrival, the monsoon reached Mumbai, announcing a resounding onset with extremely heavy rains. In just 24 hours, between June 5 and 6, it covered the entire northeast India and also reached Sikkim and Sub Himalayan West Bengal. It took merely 48 hours, from June 11-13, to advance over West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, East Madhya Pradesh and East Uttar Pradesh. The southwest monsoon covered 80% of the area in just 10 days, nearly going supersonic and rarely observed in the recent past, it said. This is the second consecutive year that the monsoon has been weak in Kerala. From a month which is the harbinger of the monsoon, rainfall in June has been deficient in its spatiality. If one were to look at the week-wise rainfall data of the IMD, the state has 18% deficiency in the last three weeks from June 1-21. Districts showing rainfall deficiency are Alappuzha (-31%), Kannur (- 23%), Kollam (-22%), Kozhikode (-20%), Palakkad (-32%), T’puram (-42%) and Thrissur (-32%). According to data, June first week saw 75% deficiency in Wayanad. Other districts that had deficient rainfall are Kannur (-26%), Malappuram (-49%), Palakkad (-32%) and Thrissur (-27%). Three districts had high excess rainfall — Alappuzha (79%), Kollam (44%) and Pathanamthitta (76%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-to-receive-heavy-rains-for-next-two-days/articleshow/83726698.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi unlock: Marriage halls tied in knots as no nod yet for weddings||NEW DELHI: The latest Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s order has come as a big disappointment for the banquet and entertainment industry. As per the order, no permission has been granted for holding weddings and other social events at banquet halls, marriage halls and hotels. Owners of these places have been asked to either return the advance money paid by customers for conducting marriages or they have to mutually agree to organise events at a later date. The owners claimed that the whole industry will face a major crisis and more job losses if no respite is given by the state government soon. “The entire industry is tense despite us having best safety measures in place.We have sent a fresh petition to the LG Baijal and the chief minister urging them to immediately allow weddings with restrictions on the number of guests so that we can start preparations immediately,” said Rajeev Jain of Event and Entertainment Management Association. Traders emphasised that after July 18, there are no auspicious dates till November and they can’t wait till next week for the decision. “Weddings are starting from July 1 and we want to perform all the scheduled weddings till July 18 with all protocols. Most of these bookings were postponed in April. In the absence of permission from the government, people will start cancelling them now because no one would like to get his or her money stuck for long,” added Jain. When markets, malls, salons, gardens, clubs and restaurants, where daily footfall runs into thousands, are allowed to open, why has the operation of banquet halls/marriage halls been still restricted, they wonder. “We had recently assured the authorities of following strict guidelines and even forwarded the draft SOP to the LG and the CM. We are ready to accept any changes, as suggested by the authority. Besides the 3 sqm per person space formula, we have also suggested allowing 100 to 200 people depending upon the space of the wedding venue,” said Sanjay Khullar, president of Delhi Catering Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/marriage-halls-tied-in-knots-as-no-nod-yet-for-weddings/articleshow/83729165.cms||Vibha Sharma

According to the department sources, 46 cases have been registered in connection with the felling and transport of teak and rosewood trees which are categorised as ‘royal trees’ and should not be felled without special sanctions. The sources said that as per estimates of the officials, nearly 300 cubic metre of logs, valued around Rs 4 crore, were transported under the cover of the controversial order. The felling was mainly detected at Machad and Pattikkad areas. The officials seized nearly 150 cubic metre from different areas in Thrissur and neighbouring Palakkad and Malappuram districts. Interestingly, the stumps of some of the felled trees were found burnt earlier in the Akamala area, apparently to destroy evidence. The forest officials made it clear that all the felled trees were in the assigned land and not on forest lands. They point out that as per law, forest officials can intervene only if trees are felled from forest areas, and they have limited powers when the trees are from revenue land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/500-teak-nine-rosewood-trees-felled-in-thrissur/articleshow/83729203.cms||---

Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers’ protection association led by its district secretary S Vimalanathan staged a novel protest across Cauvery river near Mela Cauvery bridge at Kumbakonam by drowning the effigy of Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa, against his decision to go ahead with the project despite opposition from the agrarian belt of Tamil Nadu. The association also criticised the neighbouring state for its deliberate delay in releasing the due share of Cauvery water to TN and demanded CM M K Stalin to convene an all-party meeting to take the issue forward. “The all-party meeting with the presence of the representatives of the farmers’ association should reflect the sentiments of the people of Tamil Nadu over the Mekedatu issue. The CM should take the delegation to the PM to insist on preventing Karnataka from constructing the dam,” said Vimalnathan. Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam also took out protests across several places in the delta districts. Leading a protest at Mannargudi in Tiruvarur, its general secretary P R Pandian demanded the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) to step in and turn down the proposal for constructing the dam. “TN government should make CMB operational. If CMB remains silent, we will move the SC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-in-delta-oppose-karnatakas-move-to-build-dam/articleshow/83729164.cms||---

While their repeated complaints remained unattended, water supply was restored by officials on Monday after a 17-year-old Class XII student took up the matter with the district collector. Jenifer Jesintha Mary was one among the 60 people from Karur district who managed to attend the virtual grievance day petition (GDP) meeting organised by the Karur district administration on Monday. District collector Dr T Prabhushankar directed the block development officer to visit the village and rectify the issue. Water supply was restored in the evening, said Jesintha’s parents, while thanking the collector for his prompt action. Similarly, S Shanthi, a resident from Aravakurichi, complained to the collector about a bakery in her neighbourhood. The low-lying chimney of the bakery was creating inconvenience to the family as the smoke from the chimney was entering their house. A block development officer visited her house and took up the issue with the bakery owner, while assuring her a solution at the earliest. “We have never seen a collector asking officials to act on such issues, which were never in the priority list of the officials. I am touched by the gesture of the collector,” said Shanthi. The Bharat VC android mobile application came handy for our requirement, said the collector. While it didn’t require large bandwidth, there were negligible network issues. Around 100-odd people viewed the GDP meeting virtually where 60 people aired their grievances from 11am till 2pm. From next week, the GDP will continue after 2pm where the next level officers will listen to the grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karur-dist-collector-addresses-issues-via-e-grievance-meet/articleshow/83729149.cms||Sampath Kumar

During this time, theywant the state government to take steps to provide relief to the Maratha community members. The Maratha Kranti Morcha had started a silent agitation across the state from June 16 to stress on the demand of reservation for the community members. “The state government recently accepted most of our demands and said it would take some time to complete the administrative formalities. We have decided to give 30 days. During this time, the agitation would continue without any gatherings and protests. We will also continue with our scheduled meetings across the state,” Sambhajiraje said. Speaking to the media after the meeting of agitation coordinators from across the state, Sambhajiraje said, “The government had accepted most of our demands and is ready to file a review petition in the Supreme Court. We have also asked it to be ready to request the President of India to set up a commission for undertaking the study of the Maratha community for reservation purpose through a proper channel.” Earlier in the day, an open session was organised by the MKM near the Raosaheb Thorat auditorium, where all the elected representatives of the district were invited to present their stand on the demand of reservation. Addressing the gathering, state food, civil supplies and consumer protection minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the he and his party (NCP) were with the Maratha community and all the oppressed classes who needed reservation. “There are elements who are targeting me for no reason. It is unfortunate that at time of such demands there are some miscreants who are trying to divide the society. But let me reiterate that I stand with the Maratha community in its fight for reservation, but without affecting the quota of any other community,” Bhujbal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/maratha-kranti-morcha-gives-state-government-30-days-to-act/articleshow/83729172.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||Four shooters of gangster Sangwan held after face-off in southwest Delhi||NEW DELHI: Three shooters of absconding gangster Kapil Sangwan were shot at by Delhi Police’s Special Cell in southwest Delhi during a face-off early on Monday. Their fourth associate was arrested unharmed as he did not fire at the cops. The four men are shooters of a gangster and were on an extortion spree, police said. According to DCP (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav, with these arrests, the gang’s plans to extort a dozen businessmen in the coming days had been foiled. “The accused are wanted in several cases of murder, extortion, robbery and carjacking. Four pistols and 10 live cartridges have been recovered from them,” DCP Yadav said. The men were arrested by a team comprising ACP Sanjay Dutt, inspector Maan Singh and others, who had received information that shooters of Sangwan gang were coming to Malikpur village to kill a businessman, who had refused to pay them protection money. A trap was laid and the team members tried to stop the men riding on bikes, however, instead of stopping, they tried to flee. During this, one of the riders lost control, while the other dropped his motorcycle on the roadside and tried to escape. While the raiding team went behind them, they whipped out their firearms and started firing at the cops. Police shot back at three of them in the legs. They were taken to a hospital and arrested upon discharge. The four men have been identified as Vinay, Robin Baliyan, Sumit Poonia and Deeou Dagar. The suspects are members of Nandu-Jyoti gang. Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu is absconding and believed to be in London, while Jyoti Baba is running his nexus from behind bars. “Of the four, Vinay has over 40 cases against him. The accused were in touch with their masters, who are lodged in jail. They were directed to create terror among businessmen residing in Bijwasan Village, Samaspur Village, NanakPiau Najafgarh, Dinpur etc., who had failed to deliver the extortion money (in crores),” DCP Yadav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-shooters-of-gangster-sangwan-held-after-face-off/articleshow/83731485.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Thieves enter bank from next-door building, steal Rs 55 lakh in cash||NEW DELHI: In what looks like a plot straight from a movie, a group of men entered an under-construction building next to a bank and then broke a wall to sneak into the bank. They then cut open the safe of the bank using a gas cutter and made away with more than Rs 55 lakh.  The incident took place in northeast Delhi’s Farsh Bazar area near Shahdara on Sunday night. Police are trying to identify the accused and arrest them. The matter came to light on Monday morning when the bank staff found the safe cut open and cash missing. According to the bank officials, at least Rs 55 lakh, that was deposited on Friday and Saturday, was stolen. Since the bank was shut on Sunday, police believe it was most likely looted late on Sunday night. Police also found during its probe that the CCTV cameras inside the bank were all switched off. “The accused had switched the digital video recorder off soon after entering the bank,” said a senior cop. Police are now checking CCTV footage from the nearby areas and stretches that lead to the bank in order to spot any suspicious activity or vehicle used by the suspects. Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said, “A case under relevant sections has been registered to trace the suspects. Multiple teams have been formed and all efforts are being made to identify them.” Bank officials are also being examined to see if there was some insider involved. The guard who was on duty is also being questioned, the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/thieves-enter-bank-from-next-door-building-steal-rs-55-lakh-in-cash/articleshow/83729257.cms||---
---||Delhi||Lengthy sentence: JNU computer operator with a nose for typing||NEW DELHI: What sets Vinod Kumar Chaudhary apart from others is his passion for success. Having let go his dream of becoming a champion athlete, he worked hard — and now has success at the tip of his fingers, literally. He is a champion typist. However, it’s not only his fingers that fly on the keyboard. He also types with his nose or with a pen in his mouth when he is not creating records with a tennis ball. The 41-year-old computer operator at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) recently added the latest record to his name after juggling a tennis ball on his hand 205 times in one minute without dropping it, the most by anyone. His days are spent working at JNU, taking typing classes in his institute and then surfing the Guinness website for challenges. The tennis ball act came from that. “Competitiveness is a part of my life,” Chaudhary proclaimed. “I am obsessed with taking up and finishing tasks. I saw there was a world title for most tennis ball touches under one minute and attempted it. If I focus on anything, I can do it.” At his Nangloi home, Chaudhary told TOI that his records took him months of practice. But his perseverance is proved by the bright nameplate at his home announcing his status as a Guinness world record holder. “In 2014, I watched as one Mohammad Khurshid Hussain talked on TV about his world record in typing with his nose. I thought this wasn’t beyond me because I have been typing since 2001.” After a few months of nose practice, he broke the record by typing a 103-character text with his nose in 46.3 seconds, the fastest time recorded. “Typing is what earns me my bread. I work in JNU and also run the Keyboard Champion Success Institute. I constantly practise quick typing because I am scared that if I lose my speed, I will lose my job,” said Chaudhary. “On one occasion, someone mocked me mercilessly but I used my anger to propel me to a world record.” This obsession with titles was engendered by a deep disappointment in his younger days. “I used to be a champion runner in school and would have done well if my school and family had supported me. My best timing over 100 metres was 11 seconds. I also had a liver ailment and had to forego my dreams of becoming a sportsperson.” He has a vicarious life as a sportsperson these days, training youngsters in his locality to clear the army physical trials. Chaudhary’s own children too have inculcated the spirit of competition. They egg him on and help him prepare for his attempts at records too. “I got nine records to my name, and while a few have since been broken, I am proud of having done something for my country.” He is also very appreciative of his family for their support and to the professors and students of JNU who encouraged him and also connected him to the officials at Guinness World Records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lengthy-sentence-jnu-computer-operator-with-a-nose-for-typing/articleshow/83729228.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Random tests in Delhi markets to check spread||NEW DELHI: With the capital gradually being unlocked after a complete lockdown of six weeks, Delhi government is focusing on conducting random tests in markets and other places that have been witnessing a high footfall. People who had been waiting for long to buy necessary items are currently thronging the markets. Several activities, however, are still prohibited due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation. District authorities are using mobile vans and special teams to carry out random tests among shopkeepers, their workers and visitors to the markets. Each of the 11 districts are conducting 6,000-8,000 tests daily. Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has also asked the district authorities to focus on markets and crowded places and take strict enforcement action against violators. “The idea is to keep a vigil and ensure that the possibility of crowded places becoming super-spreaders of the novel coronavirus is nipped in the bud,” said a health department official. Most of the testing teams are finding a very low positivity rate in markets, weekly markets, outside Delhi Metro stations, bus terminals and other places. Times ViewThis is a welcome move. Random tests are a good way of finding the true state of Covid-19 in the city and of catching any spread at its early stage. However, the government should also find ways of spreading vaccine awareness. After all, getting vaccinated is the only longterm way to control the virus.At Khari Baoli, Asia’s largest spice market located in the Central district, 400 Covid-19 tests were conducted on visitors, shopkeepers, workers and other people on Monday. None of the 150 people who underwent rapid antigen tests (RAT) were found positive. The results of RT-PCR tests conducted on 250 people are still pending. An official said that 450 people were tested at Khari Baoli on Sunday by a mobile unit and none of them were found positive. All 250 samples taken for RT-PCR tests and 200 for RAT were found negative. Niranjan Poddar, president of Automotive and General Traders Welfare Association of Mori Gate, said customers not only from across the national capital, but also other states visit the market. This makes it necessary to carry out tests in Mori Gate and Kashmere Gate markets. “The market associations are creating awareness about Covid-appropriate behaviour and also distributing masks,” he added. Covid tests are also being conducted at Azadpur and other mandis in the city. “The tests are also being conducted on drivers who bring vegetables from different states. The same exercise is being carried out in Okhla and Ghazipur wholesale markets. Regular announcements are being made in all mandis to encourage people to get tested and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Adil Khan, chairman, Agriculture Produce Market Committee, Azadpur. The positivity rate in Delhi is on a constant decline since April 20, when more than 28,000 cases were reported in a single day. On June 21, the positivity rate was 0.16% and 0.17% the day before. The positivity rate on June 18 was 0.22%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/random-tests-in-mkts-to-check-spread/articleshow/83729182.cms||AlokKNMishra

While the number of daily fresh cases has come down to around 100, the mortality due to the infection has not witnessed a similar fall as the city continues to report four to six deaths per day. On June 20, Trichy city logged 783 active cases, among them 495 people were under home isolation. While there were only 82 people at the Covid care centres, the number of people tested positive but under hospitalisation plunged to 206. Until two weeks ago, Trichy city had 4,212 active cases of which 1,024 people were under institutional treatment on June 5. In a positive development, even the hotspots of the city such as K Abishekapuram and Ponmalai zones have recorded less than 40 fresh infections each in the past few days. Till May, the two zones each had been reporting 200 fresh cases per day. As a result of a fall in the number of fresh cases for the past two weeks, the city has become containment zone free. “Bulk number of people testing positive is completely down. As the vaccination drive is picking up pace, we expect fresh infections and active cases to plunge further,” a corporation official said. Themortalities in the city that was around nine per day during late May are down to four to six cases per day. While the number of deaths has undoubtedly come down, the rate of fall is quite low compared to the rate of fall in fresh cases. Corporation sources said that doorstep screening to identify vulnerable cases was efficient in identifying the potential positive cases and ensuring the swift hospitalisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/active-cases-in-trichy-city-fall-below-1000/articleshow/83729201.cms||---

Rescue officials said the first body was fished out at 2.30pm, while the body of the second boy was trapped deep inside, and it took nearly seven hours to locate and retrieve it. The drownings on consecutive days raise questions on the apathy shown by the authorities in sealing the porous access points to these vulnerable spots despite the Thane collector recently issuing prohibitory orders. Vartak Nagar police have now decided to deploy staff at the spot to deter picnickers who sneak in. Times ViewThese tragic drownings could have been avoided if the authorities had patrolled these dangerous spots. However, the youths too need to be counselled about the perils of entering such vulnerable spots. Local schools and elders in the village should take the initiative to spread awareness.Assistant commissioner of police Pankaj Shirsat said the teenagers was part of a group of seven, all schoolchildren from Thane. “The boys were stopped by villagers ahead of the spot, but they ignored the warnings and dived into the pond,” Shirsat said. Santosh Kadam, chief at regional disaster management cell, said the teenagers were unable to gauge the depth and started drowning. “Their friends cried for help and even tried to rescue them, but failed,” Kadam said. “The spot is in the core area of the jungle and there are mobile network issues. Rescue teams and police, including Thane disaster relief force, had to walk down for nearly a kilometre to reach the stretch,” said an official. A case of accidental deaths will be registered. The 16-year-old son of a constable and a Rabodi resident had drowned at the same spot on Sunday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-yeoor-pond-claims-two-lives-for-2nd-day-in-row/articleshow/83731566.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Bajwa said, “I appeal to my younger brother Fatehjung Singh Bajwa, and my own associate Rakesh Pandey to voluntarily give up the offer from the Punjab cabinet for jobs to their kin on compassionate grounds. I am certain that this would be the best way to honour the memories of the departed leaders.” “Satnam Singh Bajwa and Joginder Pal Pandey, former ministers, were mass leaders who served the public with distinction for many decades. They laid down their lives defending the unity and integrity of the nation during the dark times of militancy in Punjab,” the MP said. Bajwa added, “The two great leaders of the Indian National Congress in true spirit of Panjabiyat engaged in selfless service and strove for the betterment and prosperity for the people of the state. They upheld the flag of the Congress and its ideology.” The decision has divided the Congress, and Bajwa’s statement will give a new twist to the controversy. While five ministers had opposed the move when the proposal came up before the council of ministers last week, the opposition parties have also been targeting the Congress over the “out of turn” favours to the MLAs at a time when there is regrouping happening in the party ahead of the next assembly elections. The cabinet gave approval to appoint Arjun Pratap Singh Bajwa as inspector (Group B) in Punjab Police and Bhisham Pandey as naib tehsildar (Group B) in revenue department. Arjun is son of MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa, Bhisham is son of Rakesh Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bajwa-appeals-to-brother-to-give-up-punjab-cabinet-job-offer-for-his-son/articleshow/83733409.cms||---

Also, there were private guards engaged through a concessionaire. Visitors often take them seriously, which is why we have now deployed some more staff in proper uniform. They were not only present at the entrance but also taking rounds in the middle of parks to check on those having the habit of removing masks after they enter the place or start walking. Though 90-95% of people are usually careful, avoid gathering in groups and wear masks, we don’t want any visitor to violate norms,” said an NDMC official.Teams from the enforcement department were also seen taking rounds to challan the violators on Monday. “On the first day, our emphasis was on requesting and informing the visitors about wearing masks mandatorily even when they are walking alone. However, enforcement teams are also there to challan violators, if required,” said the official.NDMC’s public health department has been instructed to clean the grilles, swings, etc, in parks and gardens frequently. “On Monday, team members were present even before the parks were open and they sanitised all swings, grilles, common sitting area, benches and other sites before visitors started coming to the place. They carried out the exercise ardently,” the civic official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/additional-staff-at-parks-gardens-in-ndmc-areas-to-keep-tabs-on-covid-norm-violations/articleshow/83729274.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: ‘Wives of murder accused have right to livelihood’||KOZHIKODE: Kasaragod district panchayat president has justified the appointment of wives of three accused in the Periya twin murder case in temporary jobs at the district hospital. District panchayat president Baby Balakrishnan said that there was nothing unusual in the appointments and that it was a coincidence that the wives of the accused were selected to the posts. She added that the three women too had the right to earn a livelihood but added that the hospital authorities were unaware of their family background while appointing them as temporary sweepers at the hospital. “There is nothing wrong in the appointment from the angle of human rights. Don’t they have the right to earn a livelihood by working just because their husbands happened to be accused in murder cases? The women would have come forward to take up the job because of the adverse conditions they were facing,” she said, adding that the women were facing social isolation and could not even get employment under MNREGA in their locality. She added that the team which conducted the interview, including medical college superintendent and nursing superintendent, did not have knowledge about the family background of the women. Balakrishnan said that she was told by hospital authorities that the three women were selected as they were ready to arrange a common vehicle to come to work since they were from the same locality. She said that the protests by opposition parties on the issue were politically motivated. Meanwhile, the protests against the decision continued on Monday with Youth League activists taking out a march to the district panchayat against the alleged illegal appointments. Youth Congress workers Kripesh and Sarath Lal were murdered on February 17, 2019.

At the same time, the relaxation of the Covid-19 lockdown has also led to traffic snarls on the roads leading to Indira Gandhi International Airport. Traffic officers said that two of the major reasons why traffic jams are being reported in this part of the city were due to the repair work on the Palam railway bridge and the massive cave-in at Madhu Vihar in Sector 2, Dwarka. “There is a jam on the roads every day now. We weren’t used to such snarls because of the lockdown all through last year and till June this year,” shrugged Himanshu Chhabra, a resident of Sector 2, Dwarka. “After the first lockdown was lifted last year, there was quite a bit of traffic, but the road situation still wasn’t like what it is these days. And there’s barely any space for pedestrians on these roads. It doesn’t seem like the city is in the grip of a pandemic.” A Delhi traffic police officer said that vehicles coming from the direction of the airport and going to the Palam side had to be diverted to other roads as the railway crossing in the area was being repaired. It will take till June 29 at least for the stretch to see normalcy. The officer said, “On top of this, there is heavy traffic on the roads near Madhu Vihar and adjoining areas because of a cave-in. Along with the repairs under way at the Palam railway crossing, it is a double whammy for the traffic managers. The repair work of the damaged pipe on Nallah Road will go on for a few days, only after which will the traffic come back to normal.” A Delhi Jal Board official informed that a sewer line near Dwarka on the intersections between sectors 2, 5 and 6 had been damaged. As an interim measure, DJB had diverted the sewage to the Palam drain and an electric motor had been installed to pump slurry and avoid unhygienic conditions. DJB said that a loop trunk sewage line would have to be laid at an estimated cost of Rs 2.5 crore employing trenchless technology because there was no possibility for using the open cut method on the heavily used road. A senior DJB official said that an inspection of the collapse site had been carried out on Sunday and several decisions had been taken to control the sewage flow as well as the future repair of the drain. “The main sewer line from Jeevan Park sewage pumping station, which is discharging waste water in the affected trunk sewer on the upstream side, has been diverted to Palam drain to give relief to the people and prevent unhygienic conditions in the area,” the official said. "An electric trolley is being installed on the branch sewer line to avoid discharge of sewage into the open. These diversions and installations of trollies will take care of the sewage discharge of the trunk sewer.” DJB has also directed its project wing to lay a loop trunk sewer line of around 95 metres. “The loop sewer line will be laid using trenchless technology and micro tunneling as there is no possibility of using the open digging method as this road intersection sees very heavy traffic,” the officer said. “The financial estimate of the project will be finalised by next week.” The water utility will invite short notice tenders so that the work can be completed within a period of 45-50 days, the official said, adding, “Meanwhile, the Public Works Department has been advised to restore the drain and the road on a war footing in view of the coming monsoon season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-manic-monday-for-commuters-on-road-to-igi-delhi-ggn-e-way/articleshow/83729350.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

The 33-year-old woman, daughter of a city-based hotelier, married the man, a pharmacy wholesaler, on December 3, 2020. Within days of the marriage, she found out that her husband is impotent and was undergoing treatment for the same. Pundaliknagar inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne said, “The woman, while lodging the complaint, submitted all the medical records of her husband’s treatment.” Based on her complaint, the suspects have been booked for cheating, criminal breach of trust and domestic violence. The woman has also alleged that the at the time of marriage, her family had given ornaments and cash to the tune of Rs 40 lakh. The woman has stated that within days of the wedding, she came to know about the health issues being faced by her husband. She then objected to being kept in the dark about his condition. This was followed by her in-laws allegedly pressurising her to remain silent on the issue. After the woman refused to relent and brought the matter to the notice of her parents, her husband and in-laws allegedly started ill-treating, harassing and even assaulting her. She has also stated that after she decided to end the marriage, the in-laws refused to return the valuables given as dowry at the time of the wedding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nashik-man-kin-booked-for-cheating/articleshow/83729303.cms||---

Roland Moesle, a 52-year-old engineer, had entered India in 2006 with a German passport valid until 2011 and had obtained a PAN card and Aadhaar card later, leading him to believe that he was naturalized. He had also started a company, which was registered with the Registrar of Companies at New Delhi, and had obtained a PAN card for the company too. However, Agatti police booked him for violating Passports Act and Foreigners Act and the HC had granted him anticipatory bail on strict conditions in August, considering the Covid scenario. Granting bail, the HC had said ignorance of the law is no excuse and that he should have consulted somebody knowledgeable about India’s naturalization process. Moesle allegedly visited Bangaram Atoll after getting permission from a PWD assistant engineer to construct 32 wooden huts. However, he has now been detained for allegedly violating bail norms and is now under house arrest in Lakshadweep, the petition said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/german-moves-hc-against-detention-in-lakshadweep/articleshow/83729325.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Lab named by Haridwar police in Covid testing scam approaches HC||NAINITAL: After Max Corporate Services, another private path lab associated with it, Dr Lalchandani Labs, has now approached the Uttarakhand high court (HC) seeking the quashing of FIR against it and protection from arrest in the Kumbh Covid testing scam. The petition has been filed by the lab directors - Anchal Gupta Lalchandani, Arjan Lalchandani and Mohit Lalchandani. They have argued that the state government did not contact them nor were any guidelines issued to the company. Instead, it entered into a "commercial relationship" with Max Corporate Services and all the tests were conducted based on the terms and conditions of the agreement between the two firms. The petitioners have refuted the allegation that they conducted hundreds of tests showing just one address. "There were no guidelines or standard format given to us as to the procedure and mentioning of address of persons tested as per the instructions of the police and government authorities," read the petition. It went on to claim that the FIR has been filed due to "media pressure". The directors of the path lab said that the FIR discloses “no commission of offence” by them nor does it disclose any cognisable offence. "The allegations in the FIR are pertaining to the tests conducted by other labs," they said. The petitioners have demanded that the FIR registered by the Haridwar police be quashed. Further, the directors have also asked the court to direct the state and police to not take any coercive action against them. As reported by TOI, after allegations surfaced that around a lakh Covid tests conducted during Kumbh Mela were fake and in several instances, the agency involved in the testing showed fake addresses, fake mobile numbers and even fake sample collectors, the state government ordered an inquiry in the scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/lab-named-by-haridwar-police-in-covid-testing-scam-approaches-hc/articleshow/83726817.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Eight on duty at Ajanta caves test positive||AURANGABAD: The mandatory testing of staff at the Ajanta caves, a world heritage site, found many as eight of them as Covid positive. After learning about this development, senior officials from the district administration, zilla parishad, Archaeology Survey of India (ASI) and health department rushed to the Ajanta caves to review the situation there. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said, “There is no need to panic. At the time of granting permission to reopen tourism spots and other important monuments, we had made it mandatory for everyone to get themselves screened.” Claiming that vaccination has been made mandatory for all staff members, Chavan said mandatory screening will go a long way in ensuring safety of the staff as well as the tourists. Seven employees posted outside the caves and one from the back0office team tested positive for the infection in the reports that came on Sunday evening. ZP CEO Mangesh Gondawale said even those owning stalls and shops in the vicinity of tourism places as well as the guides have been asked to resume work only after undergoing compulsory testing, followed by vaccination. The development has come less than a week after the world heritage sites of the Ajanta-Ellora caves and other monuments in the Aurangabad district were allowed to reopen after a gap of around five months. The decision was taken by the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) after the number of Covid-19 cases started going down in the district. Only 1,000 tourists are allowed in the first half of the day and equal number during the second half with strict adherence to Covid prevention norms sought on behalf of ASI and other stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/8-on-duty-at-ajanta-caves-test-positive/articleshow/83729327.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Early hospital visit saving lives of mucormycosis patients||HYDERABAD: As against nearly 95 per cent of mucormycosis (black fungus) cases reported in the initial weeks coming in advanced stage and requiring surgical intervention, the number has come down to 70 per cent now. With rising awareness about black fungus infection, patients are — increasingly — turning up at hospitals within the first two days of symptoms. This has led to many of them being cured without any surgical intervention. Of the total 924 admissions in Government ENT Hospital so far, 528 have been operated. “Previously, almost all the black fungus cases came in a highly advanced stage. Patients waited for 2-3 days enduring the pain before they came to the hospital. By then, in a majority of the cases, the infection had reached the orbit (of the eye) and at least one eye had completely swollen up, which caused an alarm,” Dr Manish Gupta, ENT surgeon and associate professor, ENT hospital, Koti, said. Dr Gupta further said: “In this scenario, the underlying tissue was found to be totally damaged and it was essential to remove it surgically. However, we are seeing many black fungus cases in the early stages now and a lot of them do not require surgeries.” At Gandhi Hospital, the other nodal centre for mucormycosis cases, number of surgeries when compared to number of cases is in decline. The hospital has had nearly 500 patients so far and over 150 have been operated upon. “While recovery is good in cases that were detected early, in cases with advanced fungal infections, surgery is essential. In some cases, even mortality is reported as we get patients having Covid-19 and fungal infection. owever, the number of patients requiring surgery is slowly decreasing,” said a senior Gandhi Hospital doctor. So far, nearly 900 black fungus patients have been discharged from ENT and Gandhi hospitals. Mucormycosis is an aggressive fungal infection in Covid-19 recovered patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/early-hosp-visit-saving-lives-of-mucor-patients/articleshow/83730542.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||BMC uses second wave traffic lull to make 3 junctions safe||MUMBAI: Before the pandemic, a busy junction located near the popular Lalbaugcha Raja mandal witnessed 26 road crashes over three years. In the absence of road markings, pedestrians would dart across at will at Jagnade Chowk in Lalbaug. Post the second Covid wave, though, Jagnade Chowk is no longer the unsafe stretch that it used to be. The BMC utilised the lockdown-like restrictions to create protected pedestrian crossings and waiting areas to make the stretch safer for all road users. Two other crash-prone junctions, Worli’s Mela junction and Kandivli’s Namaha Hospital junction, have got makeovers too. Sant Jagnade Chowk at LalbaugThe civic body’s Comprehensive Mobility Plan, 2016, says half of all trips in the city are on foot. After easing of Covid-related curbs, many people have begun to prefer travelling by foot rather than using crowded modes of transportation. This category of road users is also the most vulnerable though. Namaha Hospital junction at Kandivali“We would tear our hair out watching pedestrians break into a sprint at Jagnade Chowk. The elderly found it most challenging,” said a traffic policeman who has had to halt vehicles at times so pedestrians wouldn’t get hit. This junction—used by 3,500 pedestrians during peak hours—witnessed five fatalities within a 500-metre radius between 2016 and 2019. Under the Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS), the junction was made compact by aligning traffic lanes, shortening turning radii and creating refuge areas out of unutilised spaces for pedestrians to halt before crossing. These interventions reduced the crossing distance by almost 30% and vehicle speeds were kept in check. A first-of-its kind removable refuge island will be fitted at the junction shortly to allow Ganeshotsav processions to pass uninterrupted. With three and five casualties, respectively, between 2015 and 2019, Worli’s Mela junction and Kandivli’s Namaha Hospital junction were high-risk zones in pre-Covid times. Located at a three-arm intersection of the Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan Road and Annie Besant Road in Worli, the Mela junction lacked any sort of pedestrian infrastructure. The Love Grove flyover also runs just above the junction. Mela junction had an inaccessible traffic island. “The footpath had broken paver blocks and was not continuous,” said Nikhil Parbat, a resident who walks to work and back. After the BMC redid the footpath with stamped concrete and provided pedestrian crossings with two median refuges, Parbat said his journey has become safer. “We converted the inaccessible traffic island to an accessible refuge area. Travel lanes and stop lines were marked,” said Rohit Tak, urban mobility expert with WRI India, a BIGRS partner. The Namaha Hospital junction is one of the 50 critical junctions identified by BMC in its Comprehensive Mobility Plan that had regular traffic conflicts. At this junction, the traffic islands were too high and vehicle visibility had become an issue for pedestrians. “A portion of the divider was broken down to create a waiting area for pedestrians. The civic body widened the footpath which used to be quite narrow,” said corporator Leena Patel. The new design improved accessibility for all users by providing 11 wheelchair-accessible ramps on footpaths, and six ramps in the two refuge islands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-uses-2nd-wave-traffic-lull-to-make-3-junctions-safe/articleshow/83724938.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Three pharmacists arrested for illegal sale of mucormycosis drug||HYDERABAD: Task force police arrested three pharmacists for indulging in illegal sale of Amphotericin-B injection used to treat mucormycosis and seized 35 vials from them. Acting on specific information, central zone team of task force laid a trap to nab three members of the gang at Necklace Road. The accused were identified as 37-year-old K Kranti Kumar who owns a pharmacy in VV Nagar in Kukatpally, 28-year-old N Venkat Dinesh, owner of a pharmacy in Vivekananda Nagar in Kukatpally, and 51-year-old Srinivas who owns a pharmacy in Jagadgirigutta. “The accused were trying to sell each vial to patients suffering from black fungus for Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000,” informed Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar. The trio, who are in the business of operating pharmacy stores, confessed that they had illegally procured Amphotericin-B injections with an intention to sell them for exorbitant prices and make a quick profit. Posing as customers, task force sleuths contacted the accused and laid a trap at Necklace Road on Monday. “The three accused had procured the injections from the family members of black fungus patients who used only part of the injection vials they had purchased for the treatment. Some hospital workers are also collecting Amphotericin-B vials from such patients and giving it to the people like the three accused who have been arrested,” task force officer on special duty (OSD), P Radha Kishan Rao said. So far, Hyderabad police has arrested 136 persons for indulging in illegal sale of Remdesivir and Amphotericin-B vials and registered 58 cases against them. “All the offenders we arrested were linked to hospitals and medical stores. Some offenders even created a Whatsapp group and approached people with offers to sell unused Amphotericin-B vials. Some have also used fake hospital letters and Aadhaar card copies of patients to obtain vials from authorised dealers,” the OSD said. The accused along with the seized material were handed over to Ramgopalpet police for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-pharmacists-arrested-for-illegal-sale-of-mucor-drug/articleshow/83730216.cms||---

As many as 25 hotels have bagged bar licenses in a span of five months -- from November 1 till the elections in the state. The list includes five bar hotels in Thiruvananthapuram, four in Ernakulam, three each in Kozhikode and Thrissur, two each in Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Kollam and one each in Wayanad, Alappuzha, Kannur and Malappuram. There are 639 bar hotels and 300 Bevco and Consumerfed outlets in the state at present. The state is slowly adding more numbers to its count of bar hotels, which had once touched an all-time low of just 29 bars. The Supreme Court order for the closure of 418 “unhygienic” bar hotels had opened up a turbulent period in the state, which was followed by the bar bribery case and the division in the Congress party and the UDF regarding the reopening of bar hotels and issuing licenses to new ones. This reduced the number of bar hotels from 748 in 2013-14 to 324 in 2014-15, which further dropped to 30 bar hotels in 2015-16 and to 29 in 2016-17, when the UDF government decided that only five star hotels will be granted bar licenses in the state. Though the LDF came to power in 2016, the excise policy of the new government did not come that year. After the LDF declared its liquor policy on June 13, 2017, that all the three star hotels and above will be eligible for bar license, the number started increasing again. “When the bar hotels were shut in 2014 owing to the liquor policy of the then government, there were close to 750 bar hotels in the state. So offering licenses at this pace is no threat to the sales of existing bar hotels,” said president of the federation of Kerala hotels’ association Sunil Kumar. However, the latest decision of the government to increase the profit margin of Bevco by 25% has forced the bar hotels to temporarily close the sales just a day after resuming the sales after 51 days of break owing to the lockdown in the state. “We are effectively running into huge losses after the increase. All we have demanded is that the losses should be shared by Bevco as well and not just the bar hotels alone,” Kumar said. In the meantime, the number of Bevco outlets has not changed much from 2013-14 to 2019-20. In 2013-14, there were 384 Bevco retail outlets in the state, which due to political reasons got reduced to 345 the next year and then to 306 in 2015-16. Since then, no new ones have been granted though a few more of them had to be further shut due to other reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/25-hotels-bag-bar-license-in-5-months/articleshow/83726973.cms||KP Saikiran

Police said that Raj Kumar, who had returned from Dubai a few years back, had invested in online betting operations and lost the money. He had previously been arrested in a different case after duping people by trying to offer them loans at low interests. Raj Kumar came across Divakar on social media and became friends with him. Divakar too had lost money in online betting. The two hatched a plan to float fake advertisements offering Remdesivir and Amphotericin-B injections given their high demand amid the pandemic. The duo had duped a person over Rs 1 lakh but the police was able to trace the funds as the victim had made an online fund transfer. In another cases, a person who had threatening women on social media was arrested in Kothapet. Police said the person would send invites to unacquainted women on social media and later ask them to share their private pictures. He would threaten to morph their pictures and share them on social media if they refused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-held-for-floating-fake-ads-for-meds/articleshow/83730370.cms||---

With many not choosing not to venture out even after relaxation in restrictions, postmen have played a key part in delivering goods ordered through e-commerce options. All this while many postal department is said to have been hit by several cases among its own staff. “Their performance can be measured in delivery of the parcels. In May 2021, post offices in Hyderabad ensured timely delivery of 22,403 e-commerce parcels, and increase of 62% compared to April. This is down to the dedicated team of postmen,” Hyderabad regional postmaster general, PVS Reddy told TOI. With several private courier companies having shut their services due to various reasons, e-commerce bigwigs approached the postal department following which a roadmap was prepared to deliver these parcels. “We have set up six nodal delivery centres (NDCs), mapped them with 37 major post offices. Apart from this, we also used GPS-enabled four-wheelers and motorcycles to deliver parcels without delay,” the postmaster general said. The use of technology, according to the postmaster general, was behind the delivery rate reaching almost 98% in May and recording a 62% growth over the previous month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/postmen-use-tech-ensure-smooth-delivery-of-parcels-across-city/articleshow/83730571.cms||Sunil Mungara

The fully solar-powered machine will function during day and night too. At night, it is powered by the battery solar-charged during the day. The machine has been developed by the students of the electrical and electronics engineering branch at Vidya Engineering College, Kechery, in the district. The project was part of their efforts to address the widespread pest attack in the farm area in Manalur constituency, where their college is located. The constituency is one of the major farming areas of the district. Dim light is used at night so that it uses less power. Hormones are used to attract insects to the machine, according to a release received from the college. The machine uses ultrasonic technology and yellow and blue lights to attract the insects at night. Pests are destroyed using high voltage. The machine can be used by even those who are not tech-savvy because of the low current flow. The release said the machine also has the facility to combine these dying pests with organic matter and compost it into organic manure. It helps to prevent other animals which enter the farm to eat the pests. In addition, the machine is equipped with a safety feature during rainy seasons. The students have set up compartments for storing the belongings of those working in the fields and a mobile phone charge point in the machine, the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-device-to-turn-pests-into-manure/articleshow/83729361.cms||---

The guidelines on collection of swab samples from captive animals and the protocol to be followed for Covid-19 test gain significance in view of recent cases of novel coronavirus in zoo animals in parts of the country, including Nehru Zoological Park in the city. The Laboratory for the Conservation of Endangered Species (LaCONES), a constituent laboratory of CCMB, has framed the guidelines in association with the Central Zoo Authority (CZA). Incidentally, LaCONES is one of the four laboratories in the country selected for Covid-19 tests in animals. The lab has been testing animal samples for possible Covid-19 since August 2020 when the first wave was peaking. The guidelines would help zoo frontline workers to look for Covid-19 symptoms in wild animals, collect swab samples and send them to laboratory for tests. CCMB director Dr Vinay K Nandicoori said the guidelines provide detailed protocols that include pictorials and frequently asked questions for an easier understanding for zoo frontline workers collecting samples for Covid-19 tests in wild animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-test-protocol-for-captive-animals/articleshow/83730507.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Ludhiana||Took Covaxin shot? Can’t travel to UAE||LUDHIANA: Almost two months after banning entry of passengers from India, the UAE on Saturday announced that it will allow Indians with residence visa to travel. However, the travellers will need to have taken two doses of a UAE-approved vaccine. As per the decision of UAE’s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management, such passengers can fly to UAE from June 23. The development has upset the eligible persons who have got jabs of India-made Covaxin, as it is not in the UAE approved list. Emirate authorities have, however, cleared Covishield under the name Oxford-AstraZeneca. Sputnik-V, too, is in the approved list. Rakesh Sharma, head of a travel agency, said, “Entry of Indians holding a valid resident card of the UAE is allowed subject to fulfilment of some conditions. Firstly, the person should be double vaccinated with a UAE-approved vaccine, secondly passengers must have a negative test result for a RT-PCR within 48 hours of departure and a rapid PCR test four hours prior. We are getting a lot of calls from people who have UAE resident cards, but have been vaccinated with Covaxin. They are asking us to suggest a way out, but unfortunately we cannot say anything.” People, especially businessmen, are saying that the government should get Covaxin approved at the earliest as other most-frequented countries by them, like Thailand, have also given approval to entry of tourists vaccinated with Covishield. However, at present the country is not accepting any Indian passenger, but may allow entry soon. Some business associations have taken up the matter with the government of India. Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of the Knitwear Club, said, “It is good news that entry has been allowed after two months to the UAE. My son, who has a resident card and a business there, will now be able to fly soon. Luckily, he had got himself vaccinated with Covishield, but our government should make efforts to get Covaxin approved too from the WHO and other countries because a huge population has got this vaccine.” Dr Harman Sidhu, in charge of a dispensary where Covaxin jabs are being administered, said, “Several people who have already got two doses of Covaxin come to us and ask what option they have for travelling abroad. We tell them that they will have to wait as senior doctors have been saying that the WHO is likely to approve Covaxin in a month or so. Other issue they now face is that foreign countries want passport as an identity proof, but during vaccination we have registered Aadhaar card, so for that now the solution is that we (or the beneficiary) can change the ID proof by applying for correction.”  ‘It will impact lakhs of Indians’ “Non-approval of Covaxin by WHO and other countries is a serious issue and will impact lakhs of Indians wanting to travel abroad. Prospects of Indians, like students, businessmen and tourists, will be dashed in case countries do not approve this vaccine. We have taken up the matter with Union health minister Dr Harshvardhan to expedite the approval of Covaxin,” said Harish Kairpal, finance secretary, Knitwear Club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/took-covaxin-shot-cant-travel-to-uae/articleshow/83726875.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Hyderabad||Taking vaccine does not mean invincibility, say doctors||HYDERABAD: Health experts on Monday cautioned vaccinated Hyderabadis to not let their guard down and maintain social distancing when out on the streets, a day after Telangana authorities unlocked the city. Experts say new infections happen when people stop wearing masks and do not maintain social distancing. They said people specially in the age group of 18- 45 are letting down the guard after vaccination. Professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru’s Centre for Infectious Diseases Research, Dr Shashank Tripathi, advised that the vaccines offer their full efficacy protection mostly after two weeks post-administration of two doses. “Please don’t be under the impression that vaccinated people cannot spread it to others. The capacity to infect others is same whether a person is vaccinated or not. If a person who is not vaccinated and does not have high immunity level, there is every possibility that he or she will catch the virus from breakthrough infection of a vaccinated person,” Dr Tripathi said. Meanwhile, Dr Perugu Shyam, assistant professor with the department of biotechnology in NIT Warangal, said that one cannot get vaccinated when infected therefore people need to maintain Covid-19 appropriate behaviour for this reason as well. “Many people assume that they will not get infected after taking the first dose. This is not true as even after two jabs there is every possibility of infection. The current generation of vaccines only offer improved immunity, not complete protection,” he added. Doctors say that many who contracted the infection after being administered the vaccine, had come to them with a sense of shock. “Most people even flaunt their vaccine status on social media, but consciously or unconsciously they drop their guard. That is a huge risk, not only for them, but also for others. Vaccines prevent severe infection and mortality,” informed Dr M Jayaram, public health expert and academic registrar of Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH- Hyderabad). Dr Jayaram added that it is better to be 90 per cent safe with the vaccine and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour rather than partial safety with only vaccine-induced immunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/taking-vaccine-does-not-mean-invincibility-docs/articleshow/83730143.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Overuse of ‘kadha’ & antibiotics to ward off, cure Covid sees spike in anal fissure||PUNE: Over-zealous consumption of ‘kadha’, antibiotics and vitamin pills has led to a spike in cases of constipation-induced anal fissure among patients in suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients, doctors say. “We diagnosed 481 people with anal fissure between April 10 and May 20. They were either highly suspected or confirmed patients of Covid-19. During the same period, 223 non-Covid individuals were diagnosed with the condition (anal fissure). This indicated high presence of anal fissure among people,” said proctologist Dr Ashwin Porwal. When probed, almost all 481 people admitted to having indulged in extensive use of ‘kadha’, over-the-counter vitamin pills and antibiotics to either ward off or cure Covid, in addition to prescribed medication, said the doctor. “Extensive and excessive consumption of ‘kadha’ can cause side-effects such as hyperacidity, burning sensation and acute pain in the stomach and intestine. It may also cause diarrhoea or constipation due to its hot potency and penetrating and drying property of mucus membrane—the lining in the stomach and intestines. Constipation, diarrhoea and gases may lead to fissure,” Porwal said. Other doctors confirmed the trend. “We are witnessing a sizeable chunk of patients with anal fissure, among mainly those who have recently undergone treatment for moderate to severe Covid,” said physician Dr Akshay Sonone, who has so far treated over 1,000 Covid patients. “I am seeing an average of 5-6 patients with bleeding fissure per day with a history of Covid since 3-4 weeks,” said surgeon Dr Paresh Gandhi. Porwal said, “Excess Vitamin D can lead to constipation. This can cause fissure due to passing of hard stools. Similarly, excess Vitamin C or zinc can cause diarrhoea that can trigger multiple abrasions over the anus due to friction.” He said antibiotics lead to disturbance of gut microbiome by damaging the healthy gut bacteria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-overuse-of-kadha-antibiotics-to-ward-off-cure-covid-sees-spike-in-anal-fissure/articleshow/83724513.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Only a few months ago, the corporation felled well-grown trees along the roads citing safety of the road users. However, the authorities are now digging up several arterial roads to plant hundreds of native species including gigantic peepal and tamarind trees along the roads. Sources said that the civic body has received the government funding to plant tree saplings in the city to increase the green cover. However, instead of identifying appropriate locations, the corporation has dug up trenches measuring three to four feet in depth and two feet in width along the Karur Bypass Road, Anna Nagar Link Road, Thillai Nagar Main Road and Sastri Road. Ironically, the roads were few of the arterial links that are in good condition. As the width of these roads is no match to the growing number of vehicles, the saplings with tree guards adds to the woes of road users. In future, the shrinking road space will also dampen the proposal to build medians. “Poor coordination and lack of public interaction are exposed in the hasty plantation drive. The trees once grown will interfere with the live wires, CCTV cables and optical fibre cables passing above and below the road surface, the branches will intrude the right of way,” C Balasubramanian, advisor, Trichy district Exnora, said. The civic body was criticised for ignoring the spacious localities including residential streets and pedestrian platforms for planting the saplings. “The corporation removed grown-up trees on Karur Bypass Road citing accidents. But it is now planting hundreds of samplings on the same roads,” said K C Neelamegam, an environmental activist. Locals also expressed apprehension over the survival of the saplings as their roots will have very limited soil to penetrate. “Rainwater draining through the roadside will water the saplings, and we have also appointed workers to maintain the trees. There is no proposal for widening the roads as available space was exhausted,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/unscientific-tree-planting-by-digging-up-roads-draws-flak/articleshow/83729317.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Kolkata||Dip in sari, jewellery business as Covid second wave hits weddings in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The second wave of the pandemic has shrunk the big fat Indian wedding with several couples cancelling or postponing their weddings tying up the entire “marriage economy” in knots. With most couples planning to get married between April and June cancelling their marriages due to the second wave of the pandemic and the restrictions imposed by the government to prevent the spread of the virus, the entire industry of apparels, jewellery, catering, venues, music and other service providers have witnessed a sharp dip in their business. Last week TOI reported how registration of marriages with the government between mid-April and first half of June has come down to only 10% of marriages between November and February. An official of Adi Mohini Mohan Kanjilal, famous for its Banarasi saris, said the sale had dipped both due to the cancellation of the marriages and suspension of public transport. “Our saris are synonymous with weddings and sales surge before and during the wedding season. Cancellation of weddings has impacted the sales,” said an official of the company at the Mahatma Gandhi Road outlet. While announcing the restrictions last month, the government had given special exemption to saris stores and jewellery stores due to the marriage season. “Even after the restrictions have been eased there are hardly any buyers because people cannot commute and even those who have cancelled their marriages will take some time to reorganise it,” said Biswanath Sarkar of Dutta and Sarkar Jewellers on the BB Ganguly Street. Last year as the restrictions eased several families went ahead with their plans by conducting ceremonies spread over many days and going for “bio-bubbles” at hotels to protect the guests as well as the family members but this time stakeholders are not expecting an immediate turnaround. “Though the cases have declined now but the virus has left deep scars this time. Many families have lost somebody in close or extended family. Others have had critical patients. In such a scenario even if people go ahead with the weddings we expect it to be a simple affair sans celebrations and the usual paraphernalia associated with them,” said Vikram Saraf, owner of VS events which design marriage ceremonies. Another casualty has been the bachelor’s parties. “I was booked to play for eight bachelor parties in the next few weeks but all of them have been cancelled because of the second phase. The norm is that 50% fee is paid in advance, so I will have to provide dates when the clients decide to hold the party again,” said Pratim Ghosh, a DJ by profession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dip-in-sari-jewellery-biz-as-cov-2nd-wave-hits-weddings/articleshow/83729359.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The supply of Amphotericin B injections has increased from an average of 200 per day to about 300 per day. Still the supply is way less than the daily requirement. “There is marginal rise in supply through the government as well as private suppliers. The doctors are doing their best in treating the patients,” civil surgeon of Nashik civil hospital Dr Ashok Thorat said. According to the civil surgeon, there are 233 active cases of mucormycosis across Nashik district and they have been admitted in private as well as the government hospitals. Each patient requires at least four injections per day and accordingly the demand for drugs is placed at around 1,000 per day. However, the delivery of drugs is around 300 which is erratic. The medicines under government quota is used for patients in government establishments, while the ones available in private medical shops is distributed to the patients in private hospitals. The best part at this time is the numbers of the mucormycosis patients is falling as fresh cases are very low in number. The total number of mucormycosis cases has gone up to 611 from 570 a week ago and the number of recoveries has also increased from 283 to 317. The active cases have decreased from 253 to 233, which is also a good sign. Also, he number of deaths due to the infection have gone up from 59 to 61.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/supply-of-amphotericin-b-improves-in-nashik-dist/articleshow/83729356.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Illegal mining suspected, survey begins along Gap Road in Munnar||IDUKKI: The district administration has begun a survey to find out the quantity of rocks mined along the Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway in Munnar. According to Devikulam sub-collector S Premkrishnan, Devikulam and Udumbanchola taluk survey team will check the quantity of rocks mined from the Gap Road stretch. “The district geologist’s team will inspect the site and submit a report to the district collector and government. Further steps will be taken based on it,” Premkrishnan told TOI. Large-scale mining had taken place under the guise of road widening along Gap Road, source said. “In our assumption, nearly Rs 1,000 crore worth stones were mined from the Gap Road region. As per rule, the blasted rocks are supposed to be used for the construction of the proposed road. But the rocks were sold out. Last week, revenue officials seized two vehicles which were used for shifting of rocks illegally,” said a senior revenue official. “Along Gap Road, the road widening was largely done in very rocky areas. Most portions of the road had normal width but the rocky areas were widened more. The aim of widening so much was to blast and cart away stones along the stretch,” said the official. Idukki district geologist Sunil Kumar told TOI that he asked the taluk surveyors to submit a detailed survey of the Gap Road stretch. “After getting survey details, revenue, PWD and geology departments will conduct a joint survey of the area. After the survey, we can find how many stones were blasted and how much was used for road construction,” said the official. In a report submitted by Premkrishnan to revenue principal secretary in September last year, it was stated that road widening work on the Gap road stretch of Kochi-Dhanushkodi national highway in Munnar cannot be resumed in the present condition. The report also recommended a probe into lapses by the contractor and national highway officials who undertook the ‘unscientific road widening work that caused a series of landslides’ in the region. According to revenue sources, even after ten months of the report’s submission no probe has been announced. Road traffic along the Gap Road stretch was suspended following a major landslide on June 17 last year. Another major landslide on August 6 night last year in the area caused large-scale damage to farmlands. In the two landslides, vast areas of farmland on the downhill area were destroyed. The last landslide resulted in washing away nearly 200m of the road. The work resumed only last November and is not yet complete. The Rs 268.2-crore road-widening work on the 41km-long Munnar-Bodimettu stretch was started in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/illegal-mining-suspected-survey-begins-along-gap-road/articleshow/83727012.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Delhi||2.3 crore vaccine doses needed without delay: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday claimed that the Centre would provide only 15 lakh vaccine doses to Delhi for July, expressing the fear that it might again lead to slowing down of the drive. He said at this rate, it could take the capital over 15 months to fully vaccinate all citizens. Sisodia said the vaccination drive led by the Modi government was not only India’s longest, but also “the most mismanaged, derailed and messed-up” one. “Delhi needs 2.3 crore vaccines to inoculate its entire above-18 population with two doses, but so far only 57 lakh doses have been given to us,” he said. Meanwhile, with all the 312 vaccination centres for the 18-44 age group located at 124 locations in the city accepting walk-ins, there was a huge increase in the footfall on Monday. A health department official said that 50% of the slots were available for booking, while the other half was meant for walk-ins. Several centres saw people having to return because each could vaccinate only 200 people a day. Addressing a press conference, Sisodia said that the drive was running at a snail’s pace. “Central government has completely botched the whole vaccination drive in the nation. Delhi needed vaccines for a cumulative 2.9 crore citizens. We still need 2.30 crore doses to vaccinate all Delhiites.” He added: “When chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Delhi needed 2.9 crore vaccines to inoculate citizens within three months, why did we receive only 57 lakh doses (including those bought by the Delhi government) in total? Delhi still needs 2.3 crore doses to inoculate all its citizens and if we are going to receive only 15 lakh next month, it indicates that we would need approximately 15-16 more months to vaccinate everyone in Delhi.” Sisodia claimed that the Centre had distributed vaccines to other countries for image management and, then, asked the state governments to float global tenders. “Now, the Centre is claiming that it will inoculate all citizens for free from June 21. But under this campaign, not a single dose of free vaccine has been distributed in Delhi. Only 15 lakh doses of vaccines have been earmarked for July, which are are not enough,” he said. Underlining that vaccination was the only way to defeat Covid, Sisodia said most countries prioritised vaccinating their citizens first and when most of them were inoculated, they announced with pride that the citizens could go mask-free. “These countries are examples of how if the Union government decides, it can vaccinate all citizens and emerge as a nation with zero Covid cases. All it takes is intention and action,” he claimed. Releasing the vaccination bulletin, AAP MLA Atishi said the Centre had still not allowed WHO-approved vaccines like Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.“Delhi currently has 8,27,000 vaccines for 45+; five days’ stock of Covaxin and 57 days of Covishield. For the 18-44 age group, only a day’s stock of Covaxin and 13 days of Covishield are left. In May, Delhi received nearly 13.2 lakh doses of vaccine. In April, we received 23 lakh doses. But now when a full-fledged universal campaign is being executed throughout the country, only 15 lakh doses are being made available (in July),” Atishi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-3cr-vax-doses-needed-without-delay-sisodia/articleshow/83731653.cms||AlokKNMishra

Even though agencies started repair work after a few hours of the crack, the locals fear things could become worse during monsoon. Similarly, various road stretches near ISBT, Kargil Chowk and Signal Mandi are in urgent need of repair. The road under the ISBT flyover has been in disrepair for a long time. Driving smaller vehicles and two-wheelers at night during the rainy season is risky. Raj Shekhar, a commuter, said, “I wonder if officials ever travel on this road. It has been raining in the city for two days, and the potholes are full of water. Sometimes, we are not aware how deep the potholes are and end up damaging the vehicles. It can cause injury to people.” Anup Dhoundial, a commuter at the ISBT flyover, said, “Despite being a slope, the water collects on the flyover which does not speak well about the construction work."

As per the policy, the government will provide free Covid vaccine to all Indian citizens above 18 years of age. District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja said vaccination would be done mostly after offline registration from Monday. “Those above 18 years of age can walk in at vaccine centres and get themselves jabbed. Though there was overcrowding last month, we have now streamlined things to check rush at the sites. We have been sensitizing people about the vaccination process, which has brought about a change.” He said of 175 session sites on Monday, more than 125 were in the peripheral areas and 44 in the city. “As of now, we have 25,000 vaccines available and will vaccinate more people,” he added. Ground reports showed that there was no rush at session sites on the first day of the government policy. “I was among the first few who had reached a hospital for vaccination. The hospital premises was clean and the vaccination area was well organized, with two rows for people to wait for their turn. There was no rush. I did not suffer any discomfort or pain after the injection. The hospital asked us to wait for half-an-hour to check any reaction,” said Navjot Singh, 26, a banker. “As there was no reaction, the hospital gave us a paracetamol each and allowed us to go home after 30 minutes.

Police investigated the case, collected evidence and filed a chargesheet against the accused duo in the court within 10 days. The state government has also agreed to rope in a special public prosecutor for the trial. “We began investigation swiftly and collected clinching evidence against the accused. The motive behind filing the chargesheet within 10 days is to send a strong message of deterrence. Such crimes will be taken very seriously and all efforts will be made to punish the culprits,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. In the chargesheet, the cops have included statements of the eye-witnesses recorded under CrPC section 164 and voice spectrograph of the girl’s boyfriend. Also, the girl’s voice recording that she sent to her boyfriend wherein she said that something bad happened to her, has been included in the chargesheet. Police are waiting Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) tests of the semen sample to ascertain if both the accused - Dishant Kahar and Nazeem Mirza - had raped the girl. “In the chargesheet, Dishant has been named as a prime accused while Nazeem an accomplice in the crime. Nazeem also tried to rape the girl but she warded off his attempts,” said a police official. “I have talked with the state government on Monday and it agreed to hire a special public prosecutor for a speedy trial,” Singh added. The girl, who worked in a private firm, was raped at her residence in Laxmipura area by her colleagues on June 8. Her boyfriend informed her father who then called the accused to his home the next day. Police said that he made them delete all the photographs they had of her along with the chats. The girl, though, committed suicide on June 10 following which the police was informed. The cops then filed an FIR against Dishant and Nazeem and arrested them immediately.

---||Lucknow||How ‘nazul’ land was sold to temple trust in Ayodhya? No one’s speaking||Lucknow: The controversy over the sale of a piece of nazul land to Ram Janmabhoomi Trust for the expansion of the proposed Ram Temple complex took a curious turn when Devendra Prasadacharya who sold this land to Deep Narayan -- who in turn sold it to the temple trust -- claimed in the sale deed that he was the ‘owner’ of the said property and had the ‘full right to sell the land’. As per the Government Grant Act, nazul land is owned by the government and can’t be sold. The government gives these lands on lease for development activities. Prasadacharya sold this 890 sq mt land to Deep Narayan, said to be the nephew of Ayodhya mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay, for Rs 20 lakh in February this year. Deep Narayan sold the same land to the Ram temple trust for Rs 2.5 crore in May. The value of this land as per the DM circle rate is approximately Rs 35 lakh, but the going rate -- after the 2019 SC verdict on the Ram temple -- is several times higher. Both Prasadacharya and Deep Narayan are not willing to speak to the media after controversy erupted over the deal. But, Prasadacharya has accepted before camera that he sold this land for ‘whatever money he got’ as it was a nazul land and he wasn’t getting anything out of it. “Hum to ye jaan rahe they ki ye zameen nazul ki hai...humari hai hi nahi...jo mil raha hai wahi bahut hai,” (All that I knew was that the land belonged to nazul, not me. Whatever I was getting was good enough),” he can be seen telling a TV channel reporter. TOI, too, found this piece of land being mentioned as ‘nazul’ on Bhulekh, the official website of land records. The sale deed registered between Prasadacharya and Deep Narayan on February 20, 2021, further mentions that land was “not for public purpose use” and was “out of the ambit of acquisition process by any government department”. What’s more, it also says that Narayan got all the facts related to the land “properly checked” and “was satisfied with the ownership of the land” before buying i Deep Narayan sold this land to Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerath Kshetra for Rs 2.5 crore on May 11, 2021. In this case, too, the registry records show Narayan mentioning that he “had full rights” to sell the land to the trust which was represented by its general secretary and VHP international vice-president Champat Rai. The registry mentions that Rai also “got all the facts checked” before buying the land on behalf of trust. Champat Rai could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts. Ayodhya DM, Anuj Kumar Jha, too, did not respond to the calls made to him. He is also a member of the trust. The case pertaining to sale of nazul land to the temple trust comes amid reports of one Harish Pathak -- who reportedly sold 1 hectare of land directly to the trust on March 18, 2021 -- turning out to be a known absconder. Pathak, who is wanted in several cases related to a company, Saket Goat farming, has been on the run since 2016 after allegedly cheating investors of around 50 crore. Pathak earlier was in the middle of a row after he sold 12,080 sq mts of plot to one Ravi Mohan Tewari and Sultan Ansari for Rs 2 crore on March 18, 2021. The Aam Aadmi Party later accused the two of selling the same plot to the trust for Rs 18.5 crore. The temple trust members refuted the allegations claiming that the trust bought the land much below the current market price and earlier deals were done several years ago when land rates were very low. However, they are not willing to say how Deep Narayan managed to buy and sell nazul land to the trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/how-nazul-land-was-sold-to-temple-trust-in-ayodhya-no-ones-speaking/articleshow/83731669.cms||Pankaj Shah

Prescription will help at nakas||KOLKATA: You can take your pet out in case of a medical emergency without fearing prosecution by cops for violating restrictions. Police have clarified that pets can be taken out for vaccination, sterilization or treatment. Like in the case of people, a prescription — in this instance from a veterinarian — will be all that people need to carry when taking their pets for medical purposes. The clarification from Kolkata traffic police on Monday came after several pet owners and animal lovers tried to obtain an e-pass citing the medical condition of pets. The applications were rejected by police. One pet owner recounted how she was forced to return home while taking her dog for vaccination and check-up as she did not have a document. “I had to take my four-year-old dog Choco to the vet but was stopped by the traffic guards at the nakas and had to turn back. These are yearly vaccines and it is not always possible to have a prescription for something that is routine and takes place once a year,” pointed out Ananya Mitra, who owns a German Shepherd. Enraged by the persistent rejections of e-pass applications, pet owners had taken to the social media and pointed out that while autos were plying unhindered and people were travelling in cars to shop at malls or eat and drink at restaurants and pubs, the police need to take their cases into consideration when it comes to taking pets for treatment. In response to a specific tweet by a cat owner who wanted to take the pet out for sterilization, DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha tweeted on Monday: “Please carry a prescription (online prescription would be sufficient) given by a veterinary doctor.” Police said that there were no restrictions on movement of pets for medical purpose. “The rule basically remains the same for people and animals. You will need a document to explain why you and the pet need to travel. If the answer is satisfactory, there is no problem. There have been instances when we have helped rush pets to vets amidst the pouring rains last week,” said an officer. Pet owner and breeder Aniruddha Bose, who has 11 dogs, said some policemen were compassionate but a rule needed to be set. “I had to take a few pups to the doctor for check-up. I was stopped at the nakas but when they saw that I had a dog that needed treatment, they allowed me to go. With this directive, I hope other pet owners are also able to go to the vet,” Bose said. Veterinarian Subhas Sarkar, who has kept his Maniktala chamber open during the restrictions, welcomed the police clarification. Several of his patients had faced issues while trying to reach the chamber. “Many pet owners had problem commuting for vaccination or regular check-up. This led to delay in their vaccination schedule which has adverse effect on their health. I have on multiple occasions sent online advice requesting the traffic authorities to let people travel with their pets for treatment,” Sarkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/want-to-take-your-pet-to-the-vet-prescription-will-help-at-nakas/articleshow/83729393.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The couple had initially claimed that they took the girl to a hospital after she lost consciousness. However, the autopsy, on Monday, stated that the girl was strangulated.  The deceased has been identified as Bharti. She lived with her mother, Pinki, and the latter’s paramour, Narinderpal Singh, at a factory at Humbran Road. Police said after separating from her husband, Pinki shifted here with her daughter. Assistant commissioner of police (West) Gurpreet Singh said, “The couple took the unconscious girl to a private hospital, where doctors declared her dead. The body was sent to civil hospital for postmortem. On Monday, a board of doctors said the girl was strangled to death.” The police rounded up Pinki and Narinderpal and questioned them. “The accused were arrested after they confessed to have committed the crime. They have been charged with murder. The accused said the girl was a burden as Narinderpal was not ready to accept her,” the ACP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/woman-lover-held-for-killing-daughter-9/articleshow/83727104.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Business||Ban on mis-selling among tighter norms mooted for e-commerce||NEW DELHI: Electronic marketplaces such as Amazon and Flipkart may have to tweak some of their policies after the Centre on Monday proposed tighter norms aimed at providing more transparency, including checking sale by companies where e-commerce players own a stake and curbs on sharing of data. From proposing to prohibit “flash sales” that benefit only preferred sellers to holding online marketplaces responsible for the actions of a seller registered on the platform, the slew of intended measures by the consumer affairs ministry come against the backdrop of local trader bodies demanding action against alleged malpractices by e-commerce giants. The revised Consumer Protection (E-Commerce Rules), 2020, also propose that all e-commerce companies operating in India will need to be registered with the government. E-tailers may have to register with govt, curb sales by related partiesThe proposal is a bid to rein in foreign e-commerce companies such as Chinese players Club Factory and Alibaba that were found selling goods directly to Indian consumers by evading taxes and duties. They will have to appoint a chief compliance officer and a nodal contact person for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies. They will also need to have a resident grievance officer to address consumer complaints. “By requiring e-commerce entities to register with the DPIIT and appoint a chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance officer who are citizens of (and resident in) India, the proposed rules seek to hold e-commerce entities which operate in India accountable,” said Archana Tewary, partner, J Sagar Associates. “The proposed rules also seek to regulate the manner in which consent will be obtained from consumers for the sharing of their data with other persons.” The revised proposals seek to mandate the sharing of information by e-commerce entities with governmental authorities within 72 hours and require e-commerce marketplaces to ensure that none of its related parties and associated enterprises are enlisted as sellers for sale to consumers directly. “The definition of associated enterprises also seems to be wide. These changes are wide-ranging and will have significant implications,” said Tewary. Released for stakeholder consultations, the draft notification comes 11 months after rules for e-commerce were first notified. This time, it also brings under purview in-house logistics companies operated by e-commerce players. The draft rules said no in-house logistics provider will offer differentiated treatment to sellers of the same category. The ministry said these proposed changes in the rules have become necessary due to unfair trade practices by online platforms. These included engaging in manipulating search results to promote certain sellers, preferential treatment to some and indirectly operating the sellers on their platform. It said all these impinge on the free choice of consumers and companies using the platform sell goods that are close to expiration. Senior executives at large e-commerce companies termed the draft rules as archaic measures that fall under “license raj”.

Known for their free-flowing game, Goa have been the most consistent team in the Indian Super League, making it to the semifinals a record six times in seven seasons. For the last four years, Goa strikers have won the Golden Boot three times. For two successive years, it was Coro who finished among the top, and while his replacement – Angulo – also scored regularly and won the top award last season, Goa are looking at a new striker. “We are looking at someone with different characteristics,” said Ravi Puskur, the club’s director of football. “It’s undeniable that Coro is the best striker the league has seen and replacing a player of his quality was never easy. He is known for his all-round game and not just the goals. Igor is the best finisher I’ve seen in the league. “Now we will find someone who is best of both worlds, who can stylishly fit into what we are looking from a striker and what we want him to contribute. We want a striker who can score 15 goals minimum. That is what will take us to the top,” said Puskur. Angulo scored 14 goals last season to win the Golden Boot, while Coro scored 18, 16 and 14 during his three years in ISL. It is no secret that Goa’s first-choice striker for next season was Dioni Villalba. According to sources, the Spanish striker had agreed personal terms but later changed his mind due to the raging Covid-19 pandemic in India. Instead, he joined Atletico Baleares, stepping into the boots of Coro, who left the Segunda B club after just a year. “We are not too far away (from confirming the striker). Hopefully, by the end of this month, we will have pen to paper,” said Puskur. The next edition of ISL will be played inside a bio-secure bubble, so convincing players to come to India won’t be easy. Puskur, however, remains confident that they will find a good enough replacement for Angulo, who was not surprisingly angered by his exclusion from the AFC Champions League squad. “It’s well-publicised that we missed out on a player (Dioni) due to the pandemic. Our efforts are ongoing. We do have a couple of profiles in mind, but we will put pen to paper only when we know it’s worth it. “We have been a little stubborn from our end in terms of who we want. We have not lowered our expectations. If we get the name who is on our table at the moment, he will be a very good stylistic fit and contribute with the goals as well,” said Puskur. Goa’s preference for a Spanish striker needs no reminding. But whether the new signing remains as sharp as Coro and Angulo remains to be seen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-on-the-hunt-for-striker-who-can-score-15-goals-or-more-in-isl/articleshow/83759847.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops propose left lane for city cyclists||KOLKATA: Kolkata Police is discussing the possibility of reserving the left lane for cyclists till the restrictions are withdrawn and public transport is back on city roads. At present, the left lane on the MG Road that links Strand Road near Howrah Bridge to Sealdah is reserved for cyclists. At least 25 traffic guards in the city have called for separate lane for cyclists to segregate them from the rest of the traffic and prevent accidents. Reserving the left lane, feel cops, should not be an issue now since buses, trams and and autos aren't plying. If the proposal is approved, guard rails or cones will be installed along the edge of the lane to demarcate it from the rest of the road. However, the feasibility of the proposal will depend on when restrictions are expected to be eased further to reintroduce public transport from next month. Should that happen, the idea may get scrapped. Cops said for the time being, they are trying to ensure that cyclists stick to basic traffic rules. “Whether a cyclist reaches an intersection or turns left, right or does a U-turn, we hope he or she adheres to traffic signal like other motorists,” said an officer. In accidents that have happened involving cyclists, they have been found to be at fault on multiple occasions. A policeman who does duty on Strand Road-MG Road intersection said not all cyclists stopped at red light. “Many are seen violating the stopline or never bothering to stop at signals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-propose-left-lane-for-city-cyclists/articleshow/83729435.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The announcement was made by the water department officials during the general body meeting on Monday. The proposal will be presented before the elected members for approval. “The demand to fetch 5-7 TMC water from the dam has been made considering the likely increase in demand for water in future,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water department.“The administration has drawn up a proposal, which will go to the city improvement committee, standing committee and the general body for final nod,” said Pawaskar. He said once approved, the proposal will be sent to the state for consideration. PMC officials said the dam is operated and controlled by a private company and due process for getting water from the dam has to be followed through the government. Work like laying of pipeline, building water tanks will be carried out once the state government gives the green signal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-readies-proposal-to-fetch-water-from-mulshi-plan-to-be-presented-for-nod/articleshow/83729443.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to have another CM before polls? Former Cong MLA claims Tirath Rawat can’t contest bypolls as per law||DEHRADUN: A former Congress MLA has warned that Uttarakhand was heading towards a “constitutional crisis” as BJP chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat — who took the oath in March this year and needs to win an assembly seat by September 10 — cannot contest bypolls as per law since assembly elections are less than a year away. Uttarakhand is set to go to polls early next year. According to Nav Prabhat, who was transport minister in the Harish Rawat government, provisions of section 151A of the Representation of the People Act mandate that a bypoll cannot be held in a situation where only a year is left for state polls. “The state is heading towards a constitutional crisis. CM Tirath Singh Rawat’s six-month tenure ends on September 10, BJP will have no option but to name a new chief minister,” Prabhat told TOI. Prabhat said that in one instance in Punjab, the Supreme Court termed the reappointment of a minister — who was not elected to the state assembly within six months — as invalid and unconstitutional. “In the legislative assembly, it’s only once that a person can avail the benefit of being a CM or minister without being its member for a maximum of six months,” he said. But government spokesperson and Uttarakhand agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal asserted that the Congress was trying to mislead people through half-baked information. “The section of the Representation of the People Act is related to the election and it states that election for a vacant seat must be carried out within a period of six months. But in matters, where the by-election is in a period of less than a year from the state polls, it is the discretionary power of the Election Commission to take a call.” At present, two assembly seats – Gangotri and Haldwani — are lying vacant. Gangotri seat fell vacant on April 22 after the demise of BJP legislator Gopal Rawat while Congress MLA from Haldwani, Indira Hridayesh passed away this month. Poll analysts had predicted that Tirath Rawat was likely to contest from Gangotri. Gangotri is an important constituency for both Congress and the BJP as there is a widespread belief in Uttarakhand that the party winning here forms the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-have-another-cm-before-polls-former-cong-mla-claims-tirath-rawat-cant-contest-bypolls-as-per-law/articleshow/83727190.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Despite third wave projection, plan for jumbo Covid hospitals dropped||NAGPUR: With second wave receded and Covid-19 cases plummeting by the day, the plan to develop jumbo Covid hospitals at Mankapur and Wardha has been reportedly dropped. The plan had not materialized even during the peak of first and second waves when patients struggled to find beds. Now, the district will not have a jumbo hospital even if the third wave strikes. As per the recent projections of the state government, the third wave is likely to arrive in July and August. Guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI that there is no need for a jumbo Covid hospital for the district which already has over 8,000 beds, which is highest in the state. “Projection is that third wave will hit hard in rural areas which had not seen many cases in the first and second waves. Also, the vaccination is low in these areas. It’s meaningless to develop jumbo Covid hospital in city and bring patients from rural areas,” he said. On preparations for the projected third wave, the minister said Rs25 crore approved under corporate social responsibility have been disbursed for strengthening health infrastructure in rural areas. “More funds will be given in coming days. Plan is to provide treatment to patients at their respective tehsils. This will also ease burden on hospitals in city,” he said. The district had witnessed highly contagious and virulent second wave from third week of February. Active cases had reached record 77,556 on April 25. Around 20% patients require admission, as per the government. Going by this calculation, the district needed enhanced bed capacity. The cases started declining from beginning of May. Now, the district has reported below 40 cases for the last three days. Raut on May 8 had directed officials to complete work for jumbo Covid hospital before the third wave strikes. He also said in-principle approval has been received for 600-bedded jumbo hospital proposed at divisional sports complex, Mankapur. The minister had earlier proposed a 1,000-bed jumbo hospital at Mankapur during the peak of first wave witnessed from third week of August. The plan was dropped in October after cases dropped. Many patients did not get beds during the peak of second wave in March and April. Few died at homes and reportedly even in ambulances. Many patients were also declared brought dead and died within 72 hours of hospitalization. Again, Raut proposed two jumbo Covid hospitals at Mankapur and at an industry in Wardha. Corporator Virendra Kukreja said the government is not at all serious about saving lives. “This is the perfect time to prepare for third wave. Mini-jumbo or dedicated hospitals, equipment etc, especially for children, should have been ready by now. Unfortunately, we are likely to witness same hapless situation in third wave due to the government’s negligence,” he said. According to activist Joseph George, the administration fooled people by announcing jumbo Covid hospitals during peak of first and second waves. “Announcing makeshift facilities is nothing but administration’s attempt to hide its failures. The authorities did not develop permanent Covid hospitals between October last year and February, which led to people’s suffering during the second wave. If not permanent hospitals, jumbo Covid hospital should have been developed by now. Healthcare workers would have started preparations for the third wave at this makeshift facility,” he said. On Monday, 33 positive cases were detected from 5,533 tests. After zero deaths a day ago, the district registered two deaths. One deceased was from other district and another from rural area. There was no death in rural for eight days. The city reported zero death for the fourth consecutive day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-third-wave-projection-plan-for-jumbo-covid-hospitals-dropped/articleshow/83727192.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The collective stock in the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle — Varasgaon, Panshet, Temghar and Khadakwasla — reached 7.85 TMC (above 25%) on Monday, while the stock in Bhama Askhed increased to 3.16 TMC.An official from the irrigation department said, “There has been continuous rainfall since last week in the catchments of most dams around Pune, which has led to increase in water levels. Temghar has received over 450mm rainfall, so far, while Panshet and Varasgaon recorded over 300mm rainfall each. For two consecutive days half TMC water was added in the dams.”Monday’s collective stock of 7.85 TMC was 2 TMC higher than last year’s collective stock on the same day. The city requires 1.5 TMC water every month. The existing stock is equivalent to city’s water requirements of around five months. Water storage in Khadakwasla increased to 62% on Monday, while storage in Temghar, Varasgaon and Panshet ranged between 13% to 35%. An official said that Khadakwasla was the smallest among the four dams, which is why its storage could reach to its full capacity in the next few days if its catchments continued to receive heavy spells.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/five-reservoirs-store-citys-1-month-stock-in-a-week/articleshow/83729440.cms||Sarang Dastane

Autorickshaw driver Gajanan Lonkar committed suicide after a person from whom he had taken Rs10,000 loan during lockdown demanded keys and papers of his autorickshaw against the loan amount. Taju Sheikh (30) hanged himself after he failed to get any work during unlock phase. In the last two weeks of unlock, Nagpur city has seen more than 50 such suicides. Records maintained by the Suicide Prevention Campaign, an initiative run by activist Rahul Motwani, most of those who took the extreme step in June were breadwinners of the family. The average age group is 35-40 years, and they committed suicide due to financial reasons. “In the week between June 9 and 16, 25 persons committed suicides. More than 80% of them were due to financial crisis. Youngsters from families who struggle for daily bread and butter are committing suicide,” said Motwani. Suicides are being reported from all parts of the city. “Be it Gittikhadan, Koradi, Amabazari, Hudkeshwar, Sonegaon – almost every police station has reported suicide cases in June. We have reports from Nagpur city only. But suicides are happening everywhere,” he added. Reasons for suicides post unlock are very serious. The struggle to regain lost jobs, unable to repay debts taken during lockdown, thefts, and forceful recovery by anti-social elements are some of them. Senior pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat had TOI that 40% of people will face psychiatric problems due to the loss of a family member, money, and jobs during Covid second wave. “Domestic violence, loneliness, professional burnout, post-traumatic stress etc are making people restless,” he said. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani said, “We are in the midst of mental health epidemic.” “What is on record are the number of suicides, but at least 40 times more suicide attempts are not documented. The 15-29 age group is most vulnerable,” said Dr Virani, adding that 1 in 7 people is suffering from mental health issues post-Covid with depression, stress, finance, study, and relationships being major reasons. “Loneliness and hopelessness are the drivers for depression and suicide. But remember, depression is curable and suicide is preventable. When you feel like giving up, just remember the reason why you held on for so long,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/spate-of-post-unlock-suicides-blamed-on-financial-crisis/articleshow/83727213.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The traders have claimed that the positivity rate of Kolhapur city is below 10% and it fits into level 3 of Covid restrictions. This allows shops to remain open till 4 pm. Currently, Kolhapur city is not considered as separate administrative unit and is counted in the district. The district is under Level 4 of Covid restrictions since last two weeks. “I will speak to CM. I will request him to consider Kolhapur city as separate unit for fixing level of restrictions. I will try to get all shops opened as early as possible,” he said. The traders want the shops to be allowed to open on odd-even basis immediately. They also said that either the positivity rate or the bed occupancy must be considered to fix the level of restrictions. Local administrations in Kolhapur and Ichalkaranji have assured the traders that testing and oxygen beds would be increased to bring down the positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy rate. The traders from Ichalkaranji were planning to open the shops at any cost from Monday onwards, however the plan was shunned after the intervention by district superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade. Abhijit Patwa, traders leader from Ichalkaranji said, “The SP has told us that the testing will be ramped up to 15,000 per day. Also, the administration is planning to add 100 oxygen beds. These measures will help bring down the positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy rate. This will help move the district into level 3.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satej-patil-to-meet-cm-over-traders-demand/articleshow/83729448.cms||---

The bridge has rusted, and its reuse will not be safe,” said Shrinivas Bonala, traffic planner, PMC. Bonala, while speaking at the general body meeting on Monday, said that the material retrieved after dismantling the foot overbridge will be scrapped. The elected member demanded that the bridge should be reused in areas like Hadapsar, where a proposal to build foot overbridge has been given. “Funds for the foot overbridge came from taxpayers, so the structure should be recycled and reused. The possibility should be explored,” said the elected members. Bonala said that a CoEP committee was appointed to check if the overbridge can be reused. The committee conducted a structural audit advised against its reuse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dismantled-fob-at-sndt-not-to-be-reused/articleshow/83729472.cms||---

Every year, during the flood, these villagers are shifted to the Sontali village by the administration. Now, with Covid care center and isolation facility in place at Sontali, the villagers feel a little relieved. They feel even if there is flooding this year too, they will not have to move in with their relatives or in schools elsewhere. Dhanaji Chougale, Kewalsingh Rajput, Raghunath Patil were the village residents who made the efforts to set up the Covid facility. Chougale, the brain behind the initiative, said, “Every year, in July, all the villagers have to relocate because of the floods. Given the Covid situation, it would have been difficult to move to our relatives’ homes in Kolhapur city or Sontali village this year. Recently, during a rapid-antigen test drive in our village, around 25 people were found to be Covid positive. After that, the youths in the village decided to set up a Covid care centre. We took contributions from the villagers. Roughly Rs 1 lakh was collected in a day. That is how we were able to set up the Covid facility at an ashramshala at Sontali village.” “We have set up a 100-bed Covid care center. Currently, there is one oxygen concentrator facility. Treatment and meals at the unit will be free. We are depending on mass contribution for the same. There are four visiting doctors and two residential nurses. Now, within a day of its commencement, 16 patients have got admitted to the Covid facility,” added Chougale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/wary-of-floods-prayag-chikhali-residents-set-up-own-covid-unit/articleshow/83929310.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Two BJP functionaries and a Congress Seva Dal worker joined AAP along with their supporters in the presence of state convenor Rahul Mhambre and state vice-president Surel Tilve. Senior BJP functionary from Saligao constituency and former BJP executive committee member Sandeep Pednekar joined AAP after working for BJP for two decades. Pednekar said that the BJP has stopped caring for the common man on whose votes it came to power. Pednekar’s wife Pragati is the Bardez taluka vice-president of Gomantak Bhandari Samaj. Pednekar said that there is intense anger against the BJP on the ground. Vignesh Apte, a grassroots BJP karyakarta from Porvorim, said he joined AAP after seeing the relief work of AAP volunteers during the Covid pandemic. Apte said AAP did more for the common man than even the elected MLAs or the BJP government. Rasesh Bondre, a Congress Seva Dal worker from Pernem joined AAP along with his supporters from Pernem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-gets-boost-for-saligao-pernem-porvorim-seats/articleshow/83729476.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Ayurvedic doctors to prescribe allopathic medicines in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat and Ayush minister Harak Singh Rawat, on the occasion of International Day for Yoga on Monday, announced that Ayurvedic doctors in the state will now be able to prescribe select allopathic medicines. The move will essentially help victims of natural disasters and road accidents, sources told TOI. The decision will involve changes in the Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Chikitsa Adhiniyam, 1939, Ayush minister Harak Singh Rawat said. He termed the announcement “a boon for people in the hills, where primary health facilities are largely manned by Ayurvedic doctors”. TimesViewAyurved and allopathy are two entirely different streams of medicine. They require different kinds of training. Ayurveds or even chemists prescribing allopathic medicine on their own in remote areas may be commonplace, but sanctioning it officially is totally another matter. The government should not facilitate such makeshift practices.The minister added: “Uttarakhand has around 800 Ayurvedic doctors and an equal number of Ayurvedic dispensaries out of which 90% are in the remote hills. By facilitating this move, we are helping our villagers – who stay close to the border areas and guard our frontiers – stay healthy. Uttarakhand will also become the first state in the country to have an ‘Ayurvedic Cancer Research Institute’ in Haridwar soon." With this, Uttarakhand will become one of the few states in the country where Ayurvedic practitioners can prescribe around 70 allopathic medicines to patients for emergency use. The practice is also prevalent in states like Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The government’s announcement comes close on the heels of the recent tiff between Yoga guru Ramdev and the Indian Medical Association after Ramdev raised questions on the role of allopathy in the treatment of Covid-19, sparking an ‘Ayurveda versus allopathy’ debate. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) vehemently objected to the government’s new policy. “This is bizarre. Such ‘mixopathy’ must stop,” said Dr Ajay Khanna, secretary, IMA Uttarakhand. Calling it “contempt of the Supreme Court”, Khanna added that the apex court in a detailed order has said that Ayush doctors cannot practice allopathy in any way. “This is a crime. We must not play with the health of people even as the third wave of Covid is approaching. As MBBS doctors, we are trained to prescribe medicines as per the condition of the patient. Such prescriptions cannot be done by those who are not trained. Medical profession is not a joke but this government has made a mockery of it,” Khanna said. Ayurvedic doctors in the state, predictably, welcomed the move. Dr MP Singh, director (Ayurveda & Unani services) of the state government, said it was a long pending demand by them. “We have written several times to the state government to allow Ayurvedic doctors to prescribe medicines for fever, stomach ache, antibiotics etc. Even the office of the director general (health) has recommended it,” he said. They added that rather than protesting, allopathic doctors should look at the ground situation. “In Uttarakhand, after the tehsil level, allopathic doctors are usually nowhere to be found and people are left to fend for themselves. Either government allopathic doctors do not join their posting in remote areas or they allow pharmacists to take charge of things,” said Hardev Singh Rawat, general secretary, Ayurvedic and Unani Services, Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-yes-for-ayurvedic-docs-to-prescribe-allopathic-meds/articleshow/83727219.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Board formula: Students seek more weightage to pre-boards||LUCKNOW: A day after UP Secondary Education Board (UPSEB) announced the evaluation formula for awarding marks, the students of Class 10 expressed satisfaction over the arrangement while those of Class 12, along with academicians, said more weightage should have been given to pre-board examination. As the Board examinations will not be held this year due to the pandemic, the state government has decided that the final results of Class 12 will be calculated after giving 50% weightage to Class 10 marks, 40% to Class 9 (half yearly/annual examination) and 10% to Class 12 (pre-board). For Class 10, 50% weightage each will be given to Class 9 (half-yearly/annual examination) and Class 10 pre-board examination. Yashika Pandey, a Class 12 student at Nishatganj Inter College, said: “The formula gives only 10% weightage to Class 12 pre-board. I missed 90% in Class 10 by one mark and was working hard in Class 12 to improve my performance, but now it seems I will not be able to achieve the target.” Ankit Srivastava, a Class 10 student at SKD Academy, said: “As most schools resort to strict marking in pre-board, marks obtained are often less than expected. It would have been better if more weightage, at least 70%, was given to final examination of Class 9.” Anshul Agarwal, a Class 12 student of Jubilee Inter College, described the formula as “perfect” as the students who have been consistently performing well would benefit from it. Abhay Garg, a student of Class 10, said equal weightage to Class 9 and 10 meant that those who worked hard in both the years would benefit. Former president of the Uttar Pradesh Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh, RP Mishra, said: “The formula for Class 10 is fine but I feel in Class 12 at least 20% weightage should have been given to pre-board examination.” Director, SKD Academy, Manish Singh said more weightage to Class 12 pre-board would have been better. He suggested that there should be uniformity in the evaluation formula of central and all state boards so that students across the country could be examined on equal parameters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-board-formula-students-seek-more-weightage-to-pre-boards/articleshow/83731778.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani reopen; Covid negative report must for stay||KOLHAPUR: Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani in Satara district have now reopened for tourists after months of Covid-related restrictions. However, there are strict conditions in place. A negative RT-PCR or rapid antigen test report — done not more than 72 hours prior to the visit — has been made mandatory for those looking to stay overnight. The district administration will also conduct rapid antigen testing at the checkpost. Meanwhile, Kolhapur district, which is still Level 4 category, has decided to keep its monsoon tourism spots shut for tourists. The waterfalls in the Radhanagri region and the Dajipur wildlife sanctuary will remain closed throughout the monsoon. The Satara district administration will be conducting the rapid antigen tests of visitors coming through the Dandeghar Naka checkpost. Sangeeta Chougale Rajapurkar, the sub-divisional officer for Wai, said, “A negative report is not a must for tourists entering for a day visit. However, those planning to stay at any hotel, farmhouse, or private bungalow need to have a negative report. Standard operating procedures have been given to the hotel owners. The market will remain open from 8am to 4pm and the tourist viewing points like Arthur’s Seat, Lodwick point, Venna lake etc. will remain closed for now. The decision on opening the viewing points will be taken next week.” Rohan Komti, the secretary of Giristhan hotel owners’ association in Mahabaleshwar, said, “We welcome the decision to reopen Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani. However, customers are not willing to spend on RT-PCR or rapid antigen testing. They do not want to pay as much as Rs 3,000 for tests to stay in a room costing Rs 700? Most rooms are empty, but restaurants are getting good response.” “We have been asked to conduct the RT-PCR test for our employees after gap of every 10 days and get them inoculated when vaccines are available,” added Komti. Satara collector Shekhar Singh said: “We were in Level 4 earlier. Now, with 37% bed occupancy and with a positivity rate of 8.6%, Satara is in Level 3. We are allowing tourists to enter Mahabaleshwar and Panchgani with proper Covid measures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mahabaleshwar-panchgani-reopen-covid-negative-report-must-for-stay/articleshow/83729493.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Nagpur||Vaccine for 18-29 to start in Nagpur district from tomorrow||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and zilla parishad (ZP) will resume Covid-19 vaccination for 18-29 age group in the district from Wednesday. Also, the civic body has allowed 50% of total slots at all centres to be offline for 30-44 age group on Tuesday. The Centre had on June 8 announced resumption of inoculation of 18-44 age group free of cost at government centres from June 21. The state had started vaccination of 30-44 group from June 19. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar and additional district health officer of ZP Dr Asim Inamdar told TOI, “Government directive to start vaccination of 18-plus came in the evening on Monday. By that time, vaccination sessions of all centres for Tuesday had been planned. If the planning was to be changed, all online appointments would also have to be cancelled. To avoid this, the government has allowed us to start vaccination of 18-29 age group from Wednesday.” The central government had allowed vaccination of 18-plus from May 1. But the responsibility of procuring the doses and inoculation was put on the states. Maharashtra government had started vaccination on May 1, but stopped it on May 12 citing vaccine shortage. Four private hospitals in the city — Kingsway, New Era, HCG Cancer and Wockhardt — have procured Covishield doses from Pune’s Serum Institute of India and started paid vaccination of 18-plus. Director of Kingsway Hospital Amit Somani said, “The hospital has received 10,000 doses of Covishield on Monday. Therefore, we could continue the vaccination without break. On Monday, 599 people took the jab.” In the last 17 days, total 13,588 people, of which 13,375 were from 18-44 age group, have taken the jab at Kingsway Hospital. Wockhardt Hospital did inoculation of 294, revealed NMC’s data on Monday. As per the civic body’s data, vaccination did not happen at New Era Hospital and HCG Cancer Hospital on Monday. Vaccination of 30-plus happened at 266 government centres on Monday of which 106 were in the city and 160 in rural areas. Total 20,424 took the jab of which 15,179 were from 30-44 age group. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Government has directed us to also provide slots offline for 30-44 age group. Therefore, 50% of total slots at all centres will be online and the rest for offline.” This is likely to cause crowding at the centres. There was reportedly no crowding till now as the vaccination was carried out only after online appointment for 30-44 years age group. TOI on Monday reported about Care Hospital likely to start administering Russian vaccine Sputnik V in next 8-10 days. Alexis Hospital’s deputy director (administration) Dr Nilesh Agrawal said, “Our hospital plans to start administering Sputnik V from June 29. We have also requested Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to provide storage facility as this vaccine needs to be kept at minus 18 degree Celsius. Price would be Rs1,145 per dose as fixed by the government. Second dose will start 21 days after the first one. Component of the first and second doses are different in Sputnik V.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-for-18-29-to-start-in-district-from-tomorrow/articleshow/83727283.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Joint commissioner of police (rural) Sachin Gupta said, “All the accused have several criminal cases against them. They met at Hoshiarpur jail, where all of them were lodged. After coming out of the jail about a year ago, they formed a gang and started executing crimes.”  Before striking at the fuel station, Gurdeep recced it and informed Kulwinder about it. “Then, Kulwinder, Hardeep and Vijay reached Ludhiana on their two-wheeler. They all met at Gurdeep’s house and made the robbery plan. A day before they struck, Gurdeep took all his accomplices near the fuel station and told them about an escape route. For the robbery, Kulwinder had purchased two weapons for Rs 11,000 and Rs 9,000 from Uttar Pradesh,” he added. On June 11, they reached the fuel station and asked its employees to refill their bike. Soon, they overpowered and thrashed the employees before fleeing with Rs 81,000.

They were planning to rob another fuel station when the police arrested them.” Kulwinder has seven criminal cases against him, including those of snatching and theft. Himanshu has two cases against him of forgery and theft. Vijay was booked in a rape and a drugs case. Satnam has three cases of drug peddling and murder bid against him. And Hardeep was booked in two cases of drugs and scuffle.

---||Pune||Phursungi pipeline work to be over in two months||Pune: The crucial work of laying of water pipeline up to Phursungi to augment water supply in the area is likely to be over by August. Residents of Phursungi and Urali Devachi are currently receiving inadequate water supply. After the pipeline work is completed, water will be directly supplied to two overhead water tanks in the area. This will reduce dependency on water tankers. The Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP), which is executing the project, said the pipeline will pass through the Cantonment and defence areas. Most work in the Cantonment area has been completed, while work in the defence area will begin in the next eight days. “The formalities relating to laying of pipeline through the defence area are in the last stages. Once the permissions are through, the work will be completed within a month,” said officials from the MJP. The MJP said that two overhead water tanks of 38lakh litre capacity each are ready in Phursungi area. Other infrastructure work like installation of electric motors and water pumping equipment is also in the last stages. The work had slowed down in last three months due to Covid-19 restrictions. A meeting was held recently in presence of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to review the progress. Ganesh Dhore, local corporator said, “We have asked the authorities to expedite the work as most hurdles pertaining to laying of pipelines have been cleared now. We have discussed the issues pertaining to laying of distribution network as well.” Water distribution pipeline network of about 35km has been planned in Phursungi and adjacent areas. Many stretches in the vicinity have concrete roads. The MJP and the PMC are now discussing the road reinstatement plans after the pipelines are laid. Dhore said that a breakthrough would be reached soon on the issue. “We will hold a joint meeting with civic chief and MJP officials on the expenses to be incurred for the work,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/phursungi-pipeline-work-to-be-over-in-two-months/articleshow/83729529.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Nagpur||‘Covid can lead to fast weakening of cognitive abilities’||NAGPUR: Several middle-aged and elderly persons recovered from Covid are complaining about forgetting things like what they have eaten, way to their home or within the home, whether they are married or have a family as well as their name. Mental health and neurological experts have attributed this condition to stress, anxiety and depression-linked memory impairment as much as virus possibly attacking the brain. They say brain degeneration is not unheard of in advancing age but Covid has expedited the condition. Some younger and mild Covid patients too have complained of feeling weak in cognitive abilities. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani said some of his patients would repeatedly keep asking for food, some had to be escorted by cops and some had to be counselled about their identity. “In detailed assessment, it is found not only weakening memory but also stress, financial problems, anxiety and depression were probable causes,” he said. Dr Sonakshi Jyrwa, assistant professor of psychiatry, AIIMS Nagpur, said they have started post-Covid rehabilitation OPD and post-Covid mental health OPD to diagnose and manage long-term persistent symptoms called long Covid. “While patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms, neuro-psychiatric and cognitive symptoms have been increasingly observed. Complaints range from anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, memory disturbances, poor attention and concentration and dysexecutive symptoms,” she said. Dr Virani said after evaluation, patients realize a cluster of problems. “They agree they were unable to explain their problems. Two weeks counselling and treatment make them feel better,” he said. Talking about clinical reasons for impact on brain, Dr Jyrwa said, “It is hypothesized that the cognitive symptoms are possibly due to direct effect of virus on the brain/ body’s immune response or due to hypoxia (oxygen starvation of the brain) during the illness. These symptoms although commonly observed in hospitalized, severe Covid patients, need of supplemental O2/ventilator requirement have been noted in those recovered with mild Covid too. Often undetected depression and anxiety present with memory disturbances (pseudo-dementia), which resolve on treatment and intervention,” he said. Dr Virani said he has been seeing elderly patients having pre-existing memory issues. “After Covid, it is seen that Alzhimer’s or Dimentia condition is aggravated. This is because of denegration in the brain,” he said. Neurologist Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram said blockage in blood vessels in the brain leads to varied symptoms. “As D-Dimer increases during Covid, we had seen a 40 to 50% increase in paralysis cases. Short headache lasting 8 to 10 days, memory impairment, fatigue and gullian barre syndrome and depression too have increased. If has been found that Covid leads to confusion called fogging of brain, disorientation and the patient is unable to recall,” he said. Dr Meshram said data is still being compiled. “After 20 to 30 years of Spanish Flu, cases of Parkinson’s disease had suddenly jumped. So, time will tell how much long-term degeneration is taking place,” he said. Matter of memory - Alzhimer’s or Dimentia condition is aggravated in elderly patient post-Covid - Increased D-Dimer leads to clotting of blood vessels in the brain, causing varied symptoms - Paralysis, short headache lasting 8 to 10 days, memory impairment, fatigue and gullian barre syndrome and depression have increased - Cognitive symptoms possibly due to direct effect of virus on brain/ body immune response or due to hypoxia (oxygen starvation of the brain) during the illness - Though symptoms common in hospitalized and severe Covid patients, need of supplemental O2/ventilator support noted in those recovered with mild Covid too AIIMS Helpline - Post COVID Rehab OPD is on Tuesday and Friday 11am-12 noon - Post Covid mental health OPD on Tuesday 2pm-4pm - Mental health support line 0712- 2352033||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-can-lead-to-fast-weakening-of-cognitive-abilities/articleshow/83727262.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The deceased man’s 26-year-old son alleged that his father committed suicide as he was being harassed by the corporator. Police have registered a case under IPC sections 306 (abetment of suicide), 504 (intentional insults) and 506 (criminal intimidation). “No suicide note was found in the shop. The FIR was registered after the family of the deceased recorded statements alleging that the corporator was harassing the deceased since April this year,” senior inspector Krishna Indalkar told TOI. “The complainant’s father left for his shop at 8am on Monday. He entered the shop and downed the shutters from inside. A newspaper delivery person noticed him hanging around 9am and raised an alarm. We are still collecting evidence in the case and will record more statements to establish the claims made by the family members,” Indalkar said. TOI attempted to call the corporator multiple times, but his phone remained switched off. In the FIR, the complainant claimed that his father had allowed a cellphone service provider to install a mobile tower on the terrace of their building. The corporator, who represents another ward, was demanding money to ensure that the tower was not dismantled by Pune Municipal Corporation, the FIR stated. The complainant alleged that when his father refused to submit to the corporator’s demand, the latter had a team from PMC dismantle the tower on June 10. The FIR further stated that the corporator threatened to have their home demolished in a similar manner. “Unable to bear the mental harassment, my father committed suicide,” the complainant alleged in the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporator-booked-in-suicide-abetment-case/articleshow/83729520.cms||---

That was 2004. In the 15 years that followed, she came to be recognised as the country’s first international level female para shooter. But her troubles began in 2019. First, her father died. The Covid-19 pandemic hit. Then, her brother died. And the winner of 30-odd national-level medals — including a gold this year at the 20th Uttarakhand State Shooting Competition — is now selling chips at a roadside kiosk with her mother in Dehradun. “Initially, we sold these near our house in Govindgarh. But my mother suggested we start selling near Gandhi Park, which is more centrally located,” Kaur told TOI, breaking down. Kaur was considered the country’s best para air pistol shooter at one point. She has represented India in the International Paralympic Committee World Cup in 2015. She has officiated in several selection committees and shooting competitions, including this year’s International Shooting Sport Federation World Cup in Delhi. “My father died in 2019. He was on dialysis and it was expensive. My brother died in February this year. He had fallen off a building, hurt his head and had severe brain injuries. We tried our best to save him and spent all we had on his treatment, more than Rs 1 crore. But he died, too. Now, we are buried in debt, left with nothing,” she said. “Those in the sports fraternity of Uttarakhand know me but no one has come forward to help me. Neither the association nor politicians.” She doesn't want a government handout.

This break has paved way for farmers to start sowing for the ongoing Kharif season. As per official data, only around 2.2% sowing had taken place in Aurangabad agricultural division till June 14. Out of the total 20.23 lakh hectare area expected to be under cultivation during the kharif season, sowing had taken place only on about 45,521 hectare. Farmers’ leader Deepak Joshi said sowing was expected to gather momentum during the remaining period of June. “The rainy season had witnessed a timely start this year by early June. Farmer may start with the sowing activity as the soil has developed desired moisture at many places,” he said. As per official data, Parbhani district has reported the highest 199 mm rainfall since June 1 followed by Hingoli (179 mm), Nanded (169 mm), Latur (149 mm), Beed (141 mm), Jalna (127 mm), Osmanabad (96 mm) and Aurangabad (94 mm).

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: First hepatic specialization surgery performed at Mettupalayam government hospital||COIMBATORE: In its 100 years of history, the Mettupalayam government hospital performed its first hepatic specialization surgery on June 17. In a six-hour-long procedure, surgeons removed a large tumour-like cyst from a four-year-old child’s bile duct and reconstructed a new bile duct with a portion of her small intestine. The child has now recovered completely. Daily wage labourers Thambiraja and Meena, residents of Thekkampatti, had been visiting doctors for a few months for their four-year-old child who had been complaining of chronic stomach pain and digestion issues since her birth. Many doctors had told them that there was an obstruction in her bile duct which had to be removed by a complicated surgery. Dr D Vijayagiri, who visits Mettupalayam GH as an honorary surgeon, was approached by the parents a few months back for a diagnosis. “The baby had a congenital defect where the bile duct and pancreatic duct, instead of merging just before it enters into the large intestine or duodenum, merged differently. The pancreatic duct joined the bile duct higher up, leading to bile juices and pancreatic juices mixing and the pancreatic juices began eating away at the bile duct’s wall creating a tumour,” he said. “It’s a pre-malignant condition and can even turn cancerous. Bile, which digests fat, and pancreatic juices which digest protein, being powerful enzymes should never mix, but that what happened in the child’s case causing severe digestion issues including fever, vomiting and stomach pain,” he added. As the parents couldn’t afford a private hospital, Dr Vijayagiri agreed to perform the surgery for free at Mettupalayam GH. “In a procedure called ‘Excision of Choledochal cyst’, we first removed the cyst in the bile duct, which was complicated because many crucial blood vessels, including the portal vein and hepatic artery, are extremely close to it, and then recreated a biliary bypass for the bile juice to drain into the intestine using a procedure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/1st-hepatic-specialization-surgery-performed-at-mettupalayam-gh/articleshow/83729597.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vidarbha: Fewer deaths due to railway mishaps amid Covid||NAGPUR: Even as Covid-19 took a huge toll on patients last year and this year, there was a big fall in the number of people dying due to freak mishaps across the Government Railway Police (GRP) jurisdiction in the Vidarbha region. Information sought under the Right to Information (RTI) Act by city activist Abhay Kolarkar revealed that in 2019, 447 people had died while crossing railway tracks, falling from running trains, suicides, electric shock, during travel and other reasons under GRP’s Nagpur, Itwari, Gondia, Wardha, Badnera, and Akola police station jurisdiction. However, in 2020, the number of deaths recorded was 150, followed by 61 in the first five months of 2021. GRP sources say one of the reasons for fewer deaths was limited trains in operation last year and the current year. In 2019, there was no Covid and train operations were normal. “As the passenger train traffic for most months was almost zero last year, the number of travellers falling off the track and while crossing the tracks is also negligible,” says Kolarkar. However, in the last 2.5 years, a total of 681 people have died due to various reasons under the GRP jurisdiction. During the same period, the railway police recorded 3,818 thefts in trains, recovering stolen material worth Rs7.80 crore. Of this, material worth over Rs1.13 crore was returned to its bonafide owners. The RTI query reveals that material worth Rs23.64 lakh is still lying in custody (malkhana) of the GRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fewer-deaths-due-to-rly-mishaps-amid-covid/articleshow/83727297.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore Covid care centres on standby to face third wave||COIMBATORE: With the number of active Covid-19 cases falling to 10,000-odd on Monday, several Covid care centres (CCC) are inching towards zero occupancy. Out of the 16 government-run CCCs in the district, two had less than 10 occupants and among the 12 interim CCCs, six had occupancies in single digits. The situation is similar in other districts like Chennai, Trichy and Madurai. However, unlike after the first wave, when districts closed empty CCCs and kept only a minimum open, this time, most districts have decided not to close them. They will continue to hold on to the infrastructure but reduce manpower temporarily. Patients will be allotted to or concentrated in a few specific CCCs as active cases further slide. Less than a month after May 27, when Coimbatore had 37,488 active cases and officials and patients were ramping up bed strength in CCCs and providing many with oxygen facilities, the district has only a little more than a fourth of the number of active cases. As a result, despite home isolation not being allowed in 85% of fresh cases, CCCs have begun emptying out. As on Monday, four CCCs, including Karunya University at Mathampalayam and Srinivasa Kalyana Mandapam at Gandhipuram had only eight and seven occupants each, recording occupancy rates of 1% and 14% respectively. Two other CCCs including Government Arts College, Valparai and GGHS Kottur also had occupancy rates of less than 20%. Interim CCCs also saw meagre occupancy rates including Karamadai, which had just two patients, Nallatipalayam PHC and Arisipalayam PHC, which had one patient, and Negamum and V Chandrapuram with four patients each. While total occupancy of CCCs were at 27%, ICCCs stood at 41%. However, collector G S Sameeran said they plan to retain the CCCs, specifically the physical infrastructure, as preparation for the third wave. “We don’t plan to close any of the CCCs or give back the buildings. We will hold the infrastructure including space, beds, desks, partitions and even oxygen lines in some of them,” he said. “In emptying CCCs, we will reduce manpower and shift them to larger CCCs instead.” It is the same scenario in other districts like Madurai, where 29 out of the 38 centres have less than 10 occupants and 2,475 out of the 2,689 beds are vacant. In Trichy, occupancy in CCCs dropped from 1,703 on May 31 to less than a fourth of the number to 421 on Monday. As a result, CCCs set up at Government Engineering College at Sethurapatti, Agricultural Engineering College & Research Institute at Kumulur and Kurinji College of Engineering at Karumathampatti are not being used. Even in Chennai, out of the 17,039 beds, hardly 7,000 are occupied and at least 12 out of the 34 CCCs are empty. However, authorities plan to close empty CCCs and not allot patients to the emptying ones to save maintenance cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-care-centres-on-standby-to-face-3rd-wave/articleshow/83729541.cms||---

According to the association, the district average price for June has been fixed based on the auction sale that happened in May. President of NBLTMA Dhananjayan said the entire issue that we are facing today is because the buyers/transporters are not moving teas out of the warehouse for reasons best known to them. The letter said, “Tea Board being the licensing authority approving the prompt extension such as sale postponing and sale cancellation should understand that the cancellation of sale in auction at Coonoor centre has totally crippled the financial system of the Bought Leaf Tea Factories and we are finding it impossible to make the payments to the small tea growers’. It added, “This will have a chain reaction affecting every element of the manufacturing process, right down to the procurement of the green leaves. Therefore, it has become necessary that the price fixation for June be fixed at the end of the month. This exercise could be followed in the future as it would greatly help the industry, especially during such difficult times.” Dhananjayan said, “Fixation of the district average green leaf price at the end of the month has been our long pending request.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/owners-of-bought-leaf-factories-write-to-tea-board-on-pricing/articleshow/83729612.cms||---

In a letter to UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh, Sharma said he was “fully confident” that the party would win more seats than in 2017 assembly elections. Sharma, a former bureaucrat of Gujarat cadre, said people’s confidence in Modi has not shaken since 2014 and his name was enough to help BJP win the next assembly elections as well. "The name and guidance of this great leader is enough to win the elections," he has written. As a bureaucrat, Sharma has been associated with Narendra Modi when the latter was the chief minister of Gujarat. In January this year, Sharma took voluntary retirement from service, joined the BJP and got elected to the Uttar Pradesh legislative council. Sharma maintained that he had a very small role to play in the massive popularity of Modi over the years. A resident of a small village Kajha Khurd in Mau district, Sharma joined the Indian Administrative Service in 1977. Sharma said he was deeply attached with his village, region and society. He has been actively working in 21 districts of east UP after being elected as MLC. He has been focusing on PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi and even successfully executed in what was termed as the ‘Varanasi model of Covid management’. The model was also hailed by the PM during his visit to Ahmedabad on May 20 and then later during a virtual address to the people of Varanasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-will-register-big-poll-victory-under-yogi-ak-sharma/articleshow/83731867.cms||---

The BJP legislator said that all 10 Congress MLAs who jumped ship to BJP are satisfied in the saffron party, and that no one will jump (back). Monserrate was reacting to Congress’ Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao, who said that there is no scope for defected MLAs to rejoin Congress. Monserrate said that all the former Congress MLAs who joined BJP did so for development in their constituencies, and over the past three years, there has been development in their constituencies. “Had they not joined BJP, their constituencies would have totally been neglected,” he said. Speaking to reporters, Monserrate said that BJP would win all five assembly seats in Tiswadi. He also said that in Covid times, the government has done its best. “Let the people see other states; we have done better than other states,” he said. Monserrate also said that he has joined BJP and will retire here. “I am in BJP and I will continue to remain in BJP,” he said, referring to speculations that he could dump BJP on the election eve. Reacting to Congress’ claim of winning the next assembly election, he said they would not be able to win in 2122, let alone 2022. Meanwhile, transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that the state government has “done development” in the state. “We will get a comfortable majority and will definitely beat the record of the 2012 assembly polls,” he said. Speaking on an alliance with MGP, Godinho said that as a matter of strategy, there are different cards that a ruling party can play. “For strategic reasons, I cannot disclose, and I would not like to disclose,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-will-win-more-than-25-seats-babush/articleshow/83729642.cms||---

Following states like Assma and Delhi, the Tirupur district administration opted the system, where residents were given tokens as per their names on the voter list, specifying date and time for visiting vaccine booths. Each polling booth, invariably a government school, was allotted 100 to 200 vaccine shots depending on the need and availability. Officials said that the booths, which were used as vaccination centres, would be announced to residents through public address systems by respective local bodies. As per the plan, people visited polling booths they would usually go for voting. Collector Vineeth had ordered officials to deploy a team comprising revenue and health staff. As people came, their names were verified and vaccine shots were administered. In booths like Iduvampalayam, Karuvampalayam and Andipalayam, several people who did not have votes in those localities, started gathering demanding vaccines. They pointed out that the method would affect people who are from other districts and states, but are living in Tirupur for work. Since they have their votes in native places, they would be left out of the vaccination process. “Under this system, neither can I get vaccine here nor can I travel to my native because of the lockdown,” said an Iduvampalayam resident. Some people were confused about the allotted polling booth and had to be sent to neighbouring booth to get the shot. This resulted in arguments between the public and officials at few places, delaying the vaccination process. At Karuvampalayam, where vaccine stocks ran out, public staged a protest.

---||Lucknow||KL Santhosh, Radha Mohan Singh begin Uttar Pradesh visit, hold talks with RSS leaders||LUCKNOW: The UP BJP went into a huddle on Monday as party national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh, turned to the RSS leadership in UP before holding a high-level core committee meeting with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Soon after reaching Lucknow, the two leaders, along with UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, headed straight to the office of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Niralanagar. While the agenda of their meeting with RSS functionaries was kept under the wraps, the development generated much curiosity given the Sangh’s keenness to ramp up activities in coordination with the BJP ahead of the 2022 UP assembly elections. It is learnt that Santhosh, himself a close affiliate of RSS, took feedback from Sangh leaders on the functioning of the government and the loopholes which need to be plugged. Sources said some RSS leaders pitched for better coordination with the state government to consolidate BJP’s position. RSS has been lending support to the Yogi Adityanath government in carrying out relief operations for people hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Later, UP BJP leaders participated in the core committee meeting with the CM at his official residence. While there was no official word on what transpired in the meeting, sources claimed that discussions were held on the promises fulfilled by the party vis-a-vis its ‘Sankalp Patra’ (party manifesto of 2017) and the forthcoming visits by senior BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda, in the coming months. The developments gain significance in the backdrop of Yogi’s recent meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda, amid speculations about the central leadership’s plans to effect changes in UP government. Earlier, speculations were rife that PM Modi’s close aide and former bureaucrat Arvind Kumar Sharma would be accommodated in the Yogi cabinet and given a plum portfolio. However, all rumours were laid to rest last week when the BJP accommodated Sharma in its UP unit as vice-president. The efforts of the Yogi government in tackling the pandemic recently received support from top leadership, which was seen as a pointer to BJP plans of projecting Yogi’s leadership. This came amid claims by some UP BJP leaders that the party’s central leadership would decide the face for the assembly elections. The visit of Santhosh and Singh comes almost 15 days after the two met PM Modi and JP Nadda on June 5 to discuss the feedback they collected from UP BJP leaders and ministers during their three-day visit to the state from May 31 to June 2. Their visit was also an exercise to pass on the directives of the national leadership to the state unit before setting the organisational machinery in motion to take on the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/santhosh-radha-mohan-begin-up-visit-hold-talks-with-rss-leaders/articleshow/83731907.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||NABL nod to 3 more Uttar Pradesh labs to test industrial effluent||LUCKNOW: The National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) has granted accreditation to three regional laboratories of UPPCB in Ghaziabad, Bijnor and Prayagraj for testing of river water quality and industrial effluent. With prime focus on clean Ganga mission, the laboratories will test the discharge of effluents into the rivers from over 1,000 major polluting industries such as sugar, distillery, papermill, leather — and 25,000 water populating units of dying and washing, food beverage, dairy, chemical, sewage treatment plants and others. The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board also expects NABL accreditation for four more regional labs in Bulandshahr, Kanpur, Rae Bareli and Varanasi. Until now, UPPCB had only one accredited lab in Lucknow. Two private labs in Lucknow and Ghaziabad also had NABL accreditation. UPPCB member secretary Ashish Tiwari told TOI, “With NABL accreditation, industries can now approach regional laboratories for sample testing instead of sending samples to Lucknow central lab or private accredited labs.” “We have given the option of online request and payment for sample collection or testing, but industries and STP operators can also visit the labs,” added Tiwari. “Data generated from the accredited labs will be authentic and accurate and help UPPCB in constant monitoring of river water quality and effluent discharged into the rivers,” said Tiwari. He added, “UP has now become the state with the highest number of river water testing accredited labs.” A team was constituted under Dr Neelima Deepak, in-charge of central lab in Lucknow, for the modernization of laboratories and funds were provided from UPPCB resources and from the national mission for clean Ganga under strengthening of the laboratory project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nabl-nod-to-three-more-up-labs-to-test-industrial-effluent/articleshow/83731965.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Coimbatore||International Yoga Day a low-key affair||For the second consecutive year, the International Yoga Day turned out to be a low-key affair on Monday due to the lockdown. With much of the colleges and schools functioning online, the institutions had to make do with only online yoga sessions. Almost all schools had organised such online sessions in the morning which lasted for about an hour. Students were asked to login to their computers and perform yoga poses from their houses. Some institutions took the services of yoga experts who taught postures online to the students. The sessions, however, lacked the usual enthusiasm displayed by the students during offline yoga sessions which were held till Covid pandemic stuck, when large groups would gather in grounds and perform yoga. Covid patients in the care centres joined the rest of the fitness enthusiasts to perform yoga on Monday. Male and female patients, young and old alike joined the yoga session conducted at CODISSIA covid care centre. District collector D G Sameeran, who visited the centre also participated in the session with covid patients. Covid-19 patients are given the option to attend yoga sessions conducted by specialists daily to improve breathing and blood flow. A few more covid care centres and hospitals also organised such sessions. Isha Yoga centre had provided a video link to learn yoga sessions online as part of its initiatives to spread yoga. Yoga instructors said that though they had organised online sessions, the participation was very low compared to the offline sessions they would hold in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/international-yoga-day-a-low-key-affair/articleshow/83729675.cms||---
---||Mumbai||CA final exam students get centres across India||MUMBAI: Shalini Jaiswal, a candidate from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh slated to take her final CA exam, has been allotted a centre in John Cox Memorial Institute in Thiruvananthapuram. Another student, Saurabh J, who opted for the risk management paper, has company law on the admit card. Candidates are flummoxed at the fact that many have not been allotted the exam centres of their choice. Several students in cities like Ahmedabad, Pune, Chennai, and Aurangabad will be forced to travel 20-odd kilometres to reach their exam centre. Some others have wrong papers printed on their admit cards. “A total of 3.6 lakh candidates at different levels are taking the July CA exam. About 7,000 students changed their exam centre from what they had originally selected as they migrated. We will surely look into the issues students have and make sure that no student will have to travel out of their hometown to take the exam,” said a senior officer from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The ICAI is holding all the levels of CA exams —foundation, intermediate, final, and post-qualification course exams which start on July 5. In its statement, the ICAI said, “Due to paucity of accommodation in certain Zones opted by the candidates in the cities of Ahmedabad, Aurangabad, Chennai, and Pune some of the candidates have been allotted examinations centres in the zone other than the zone opted by them in the said cities. Given this, it is not possible to accede to the request of the candidates for transfer to an examination centre in a particular zone of the city opted by them. Similarly, students who had opted for Dimapur (Kohima) City have been shifted to Guwahati. Moreover, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has allowed students to opt-out of this exam cycle. Candidates who “opt-out” will have to submit an RT-PCR certificate that indicates that either the examinee or a relative has Covid. “It is heartening that ICAI has finally taken cognizance of students’ request and hardships, and granted the opt-out facility like in the earlier attempt ever since the pandemic set in. I request students to use it only for genuine reasons. I say this because it was noticed that last time many students took the opt-out facility after a particular paper because it was difficult and they didn’t want to see failure on the mark sheet,” said professor Jinesh Shah, Study Circle Classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ca-final-exam-students-get-centres-across-india/articleshow/83736215.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Goa||Goa cops to be trained to treat tourists better||PANAJI: Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said on Monday that the state government has decided to conduct workshops to sensitise departments like Goa police and the transport department to “treat tourists properly”. “Earlier, they used to stop tourists everywhere and ask them for documents,” Godinho said, adding that there were complaints that tourists were “stopped and harassed”. “The chief minister (Pramod Sawant) lectured them (government departments and Goa police) on how they should be more sensitive and understanding towards treating tourists arriving in the state.” Sawant met Goa police and transport officials over the “inconvenience” caused to tourists visiting Goa in their own vehicles. Godinho said that “it is not right” to stop tourists’ vehicles while in the state. He said that during the meeting, one idea brought up was to provide holograms at the border, but it was dropped because it would cause a long queue at the state checkposts. “If we issue stickers to non-Goa registered vehicles when they enter the state, it would be counterproductive,” Godinho said. “It would be like stopping them at the border, and then there would not be smooth movement of traffic.” Under GST, there should be smooth movement of traffic, he said Since May 9, tourism activities in the state have come to a standstill. Last week, Sawant had said that the state government does not plan to restart tourism activities till the first dose of the vaccine against Covid-19 is administered to all of the state’s eligible population. The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), which had met Sawant and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar recently, had said that the state government would reopen the hospitality sector fully only after the Covid-19 positivity rate drops below five per cent. “The TTAG has put forth some demands which are under consideration. We are not starting tourism in Goa till the state’s eligible population receives the first dose of vaccine,” Sawant had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cops-to-be-trained-to-treat-tourists-better/articleshow/83729901.cms||---

Goa board is likely to announce results for both public exams next month. Director of education Dilip Bhagat said that the department is in the process of finalising the scheme for this counselling. He said that teachers would be explained the procedure of how to hold these sessions. “Counselling will be done virtually,” he said. Bhagat said that teachers would be asked to find out the students’ interests and guide them accordingly. Sawant said that the state government has yet to take a decision on calling students to schools. Sawant said that while teachers have started going to schools, the directorate of education has instructed them to teach their students by sending them worksheets and recorded videos, as TOI reported in its Monday edition. “The schools have to support their students by suitable alternative means, including online. The schools have to come up with alternatives for students who can’t participate in online teaching,” Bhagat had said. “On the commencement of regular classes, the teachers will cover up the entire syllabus for the academic year 2021-22 so that no student is left out.” “Till such time schools reopen, teachers should prepare worksheets and lectures and reach out to students not connected via online means, in addition to carrying out online teaching,” the directorate had stated in a circular, adding that this shall not apply to schools in containment zone, teachers residing in containment zones and schools taken over by the disaster management authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-teachers-must-counsel-students-on-career-choices/articleshow/83729755.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Many come forward to help out children orphaned due to Covid-19||Dehradun: Left with the trauma of a grave loss and no support to finance a stable education, several children who were orphaned during the Covid-19 pandemic are receiving help from social organisations and a few individuals in Uttarakhand. Jai Sharma, the founder of NGO JOY (Just Open Yourself), told TOI that his organisation has been extending financial support to a total of 28 children. Sharma said, “These children are based out of Uttarkashi, Joshimath, Rudraprayag and Dehradun districts. We aim to finance the education of these students for the next 2-3 years till they become self-reliant.” Besides the volunteers of social organisations, officials of some Dehradun-based colleges have also come forward to help such students carry on with their education. Chakrata-based SMR Degree College — affiliated with Sri Dev Suman University — is running graduation batches for students who lost their parents (or an earning family member) to Covid-19 and underprivileged students. “Our management has decided to provide free education to one child each from the 227 panchayats in the two blocks of Chakrata and Kalsi. Our institution has been running batches for underprivileged students since 2010 but this year, we decided to include the students who were orphaned during the pandemic in the batch as well,” said Anil Singh Tomar, chairman of SMR Degree College. In a similar initiative, the UIHMT/CIMS group of colleges in Dehradun has adopted 100 students who either lost their parents or the earning member of the family to Covid-19. These students have been allowed to enroll in any one of the 35 courses being run by the institution. Their education will be free of cost. “Every year, we take 25 students from economically-weak backgrounds and provide them free-of-cost education but this time, we are taking 100 students who were orphaned during the pandemic,” said Lalit Mohan Joshi, chairman of the UIHMT/CIMS group of colleges. Raghav Juyal, popular dancer, choreographer, actor and television presenter, is also working with his team to support orphans. A Dehradun resident, Juyal is distributing ration kits to hundreds of children in Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Champawat, Dehradun and Uttarkashi districts. "We are planning to collaborate with the state government and run our drive at a bigger scale to reach the maximum number of kids. We have also begun our preparations to help out people during the third wave of the virus,” Yashasvi Juyal, Raghav's brother, told TOI. Apart from helping children, Juyal and his team are also helping people from marginalised sections of the society in the state.

---||Mumbai||Youth not involved in Vakola musician’s murder plan, says court, grants him bail||MUMBAI: Nearly two years after Vakola musician Bennett Rebello (59) was killed and his body chopped into pieces and dumped into the sea allegedly by his adopted daughter and her boyfriend, both minors, the sessions court granted bail to the third accused, now 20 years old, arrested in the case. The court observed that only because the two minors had expressed before Alimiya Chaus their intention to kill Rebello, it did not amount to him entering into any conspiracy with them. “The entire chargesheet does not contain any single material to show that the accused had any involvement in commission of the murder,” it held. The court further said that since the chargesheet only showed Chaus responsible for disappearance of evidence, it was not “desirable” to treat him on a par with the juveniles. “The investigation is over. The accused has been in custody since December 13, 2019. His further detention considering his limited role in the crime does not seem necessary,” it said. The two minors are being tried separately. It was alleged that on the evening of November 26, 2019, the juvenile duo killed Rebello, cut his body into pieces, stuffed them into three suitcases and dumped them in Mithi river at Bandra-Kurla Complex over the next three days. The murder came to light after one of the suitcases was found in the sea behind Mahim dargah on December 2, 2019. The crime branch identified the body parts as those of Rebello’s and arrested his adopted daughter and her boyfriend on December 7, 2019. They later found the other two suitcases too—in Kurla, and on the beach near Shivaji Park. Chaus was arrested for allegedly helping the juvenile couple chop the body and dump the suitcases. Granting bail on a surety of Rs 25,000, the court imposed certain conditions on Chaus. He was directed to attend the office of DCB-CID twice every month for two hours until the conclusion of the trial. “He shall not tamper with the prosecution witnesses and evidence in any manner,” the court directed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/youth-not-involved-in-vakola-musicians-murder-plan-says-court-grants-him-bail/articleshow/83732040.cms||Rebecca Samervel

GFP said that RTI documents show that the government has failed to approve the proposal. GFP said that the information provided by the directorate of health services and the directorate of accounts shows that the government’s assurances cannot be relied upon. The government, said GFP, is either lying or bankrupt. “How can anyone trust a government to create 10,000 jobs when it lies about 20% hike in payment to doctors and frontline health workers?” said GFP functionary John Nazareth. On April 6, 2020, CM Pramod Sawant announced that health warriors and frontline health workers would get a 20% hike in their salary along with a Rs 50 lakh insurance cover. On May 13, 2020, Sawant announced that the government has given in-principle approval. “The director of accounts has written to DHS and said that no government approval or sanction has been received to disburse additional 20% from 2020 till date,” said GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-didnt-approve-20-hike-for-docs-nurses-gfp/articleshow/83729831.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: On first day, schools draw up new teaching strategies||PANAJI: The first day of the new academic year 2021-22 began on Monday with teachers drawing up teaching schedules as per the latest instructions from the directorate of education (DoE). Schools are altering their schedules to conduct live teaching sessions on a more regular basis this session, with notes and pre-recorded videos shared over WhatsApp acting only as supplementary material to live classes. As school heads and teachers are chalking out a revised schedule, actual classes in most schools will only begin in two to three days, institutes said. Monday also being international Yoga Day, teachers marked the day by performing yoga asanas inside the school premises, while videos of the event were sent to students to observe the day by repeating the asanas. “Today, the teachers spent the day conducting meetings to decide the schedule of classes for the first term of the academic year. Last academic year, there was no uniform pattern given to schools to conduct classes. This year, as per the latest instructions, we will hold live teaching classes on a daily basis through Google Meet platform. Videos of these live sessions will be recorded and saved on a Google drive where students can access it,” said Satyesh Kakodkar, manager, New Educational Institute, Curchorem. In a 45-minute long class, teachers will spend most of the time teaching, while only ten minutes or so will be utilised to clear any doubts students have. Earlier, schools were forwarding prerecorded instructional videos and notes to students and holding online class only to clear the doubts students have. This year, the state government has also trained some teachers from schools to introduce coding and robotics classes. Schools had to draw up a schedule for this class too with students. “On Monday, teachers spent time forming WhatsApp groups for online teaching and distributing work load, we geared up for the online class. Therefore, no teaching was possible it on Monday and it will take another two-three days for actual teaching to begin. School teachers are also engaged in preparing results for Class X students. We have to confirm students’ mobile numbers and then start teaching after we ensure that we have at least 75% of children on board,” said Mariano Valadares, headmaster of St Andrew’s High School, Goa Velha. President of All Goa Secondary School Teachers’ Association Dattatrey Naik said that actual classes in most schools are expected to start around Thursday. “It will take another two days to form groups, prepare attendance registers, etc. Schools celebrated Yoga Day only with teachers. Once classes begin, live teaching will take place through Google Meet classes every day,” said Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/on-first-day-schools-draw-up-new-teaching-strategies/articleshow/83729855.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

While the district administration will start survey after the Covid situation eases, a team of teachers and panchayat members of Kunariya village about 20 KM from Bhuj town will visit the children’s houses to formally enrol them. The usual paraphernalia of including playing drums, welcoming the child with tilak and offering chocolate and a study kit will be followed. Talking to TOI, sarpanch Suresh Chhanga said, “This is the third year when we could not organize Praveshotsav. Last year there was Covid and before that there was a cyclonic situation in Kutch. We decided that we could not organize the formal seating and so, we decided to admit the eligible children by going house to house. It will also send a message to the child that he or she is part of the educational activity even during Covid.” The school provides every newcomer with a kit that includes a booklet published by the state government, a school bag, pen, pencil, notebooks, slate, compass box among other necessary things. The panchayat has also been planting a tree at every child’s home asking the parents to take good care of it. While the teachers are enlisting parents’ help in making the young children learn from the YouTube videos they have prepared, the school envisages street education where five to six children from one street will be taught. Bhavesh Aahir, a parent said, “Praveshotsav is a memorable moment in the life of a child when people welcome them aboard and celebrate the entire education process. I am happy that my child is not deprived of this precious moment because of Covid.” The panchayat collects data of eligible children from Anaganvadi and thereafter collects required documents of parents for admission. “As per guesstimates, nearly 20,000 eligible children were left without schooling in Kutch district last year because of Covid. We don’t want any child left uneducated in our village,” Chhanga added. Meanwhile, the village is witnessing reverse sex ratio in 2019-20 with 74 girls among the total 123 newborns in the village. The village population is around 3,500. The same is reflected in school admission too with 20 girls getting admission in school among the total 31 children who were enrolled since Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kutch-village-hold-pravesotsav-for-school-enrolment-at-every-doorstep/articleshow/83724835.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

"We will maintain this pace throughout the month," he added. The state has set a target of vaccinating between 6 to 7 lakh persons per day from Monday till June 30 to reach a target of 1 crore for the month of June. From July 1, it aims to vaccinate at least 10 lakh persons a day so that by the end of August, the state can achieve its goal of having vaccinated 10 crore people. “Vaccination is necessary to ensure our safety from the virus, especially in the third wave, and also to end the pandemic. The government has set up special booths for women, parents whose children are less than 12 years old and is also carrying out special vaccination drives in blocks,” said Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary (information). He added that there were close to 8,500 vaccination centres in the state, of which 89 were private hospitals. Till Monday, 2,21,90,836 have been administered the first dose while 12,49,021 have been administered both doses. Where Lucknow continues to top the list of districts with the highest number of doses administered till now, at 12,49,021, Ghaziabad inched its way to the top of the daily tally on Monday, having administered 27,925 doses. A close second was Gorakhpur which vaccinated 25,164 people, followed by Lucknow which vaccinated 21,671 people. Chitrakoot, with 96,234 doses administered till Monday, is the only district in the state which has not crossed the 1 lakh tally. On Monday, it was also the district which administered the least number of doses at 2,660. Auriya was a little better having vaccinated 3,034 people followed by Sambhal, which administered 3,083 doses on Monday. In view of vaccine shortages in May and the early part of June, UP had issued a global tender to procure vaccines but later cancelled it as the Centre revised its strategy. Now the Centre is procuring 75% vaccines and providing them to states free of cost while the remaining 25% are being procured by private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-breaks-own-record-inoculates-over-7-lakh-beneficiaries-in-a-day/articleshow/83732072.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Mumbai||School denies 8-year-old RTE seat, Bombay HC raps BMC over delay in action||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court pulled up the BMC for delay in action against an IB school in Bandra-Kurla Complex that refused to admit an eight-year-old boy under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. “Take action if they [school] have not complied with your order. What are you waiting for?” said a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Chandrak-ant Bhadang, after hearing a petition by Saym Khan, filed through his mother Afsha, on June 17. All unaided non-minority schools in the city are expected to reserve 25% of their seats at the entry level for students from economically weaker sections. Admissions to these RTE seats are conducted through a series of online lotteries conducted by the BMC. In February 2020, Afsha filed the online RTE admission application for Saym in the economically weak category. Saym was allotted a seat in Ascend International School, which is within the permissible distance of his Bharat Nagar residence in Bandra (E). In June 2020, the ward-level education officer, appointed under the RTE Act, issued a formal allotment letter to Saym, but when Afsha went to complete the admission formalities, the school said it would not be able to admit the boy and gave no reasons for it. The education officer, on November 3, 2020, issued a notice to the school directing it to admit Saym to the online classes within two days and threatened to cancel its recognition under Section 18 (3) of the Act in case of non-compliance. The school did not respond. Afsha filed appeals to committees at the ward, district and state levels, but in vain. She even wrote to the education minister. The Khans’ advocate, Meenaz Kakalia, urged that the school must be specifically directed to admit Saym in the 2021-22 academic year. But the judges said they first want to know what the municipal corporation has done after issuing the notice to the school. BMC’s advocate replied that they will examine the issue and proceed to take necessary action. The judges, in their order, said, “If the BMC has already put the school to notice of the consequences of its failure to implement the order, it is expected that it will proceed to take the action as stated in the co-mmunication.” Posting the ne-xt hearing on July 1, the HC said, “It is open to the school to take remedial action to avoid any coercive action under the RTE Act or under the direction of the court before the next date.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-school-denies-8-year-old-rte-seat-hc-raps-bmc-over-delay-in-action/articleshow/83732129.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh cops nab duo who ‘converted’ 1,000 to Islam||LUCKNOW: The ATS of the UP Police on Monday claimed to have busted a racket involving illegal conversion of poor individuals and children with speech and hearing disabilities belonging to other religions to Islam. The accused - identified as Mohammed Umar Gautam, who himself is a convert and a resident of Batla House area and Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi, the chairman of Islamic Dawah Center (IDC) In Jamia Nagar in Delhi -- are allegedly involved in religious conversion of around 1,000 people, the ATS said. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said that the names Umar and Jahangir had cropped up during the interrogation of Kashif and Vipul Vijayvargiya who were arrested in connection with a conspiracy to attack Guru Yati Narshighanand Saraswati of Ghaziabad on June 2. During the interrogation, it was revealed that Vipul’s real name was Ramzan and he had adopted a Hindu name merely to avoid suspicion and enter Guru Yati’s temple complex in Dasna area of Ghaziabad. “The two were called for questioning on several occasions and arrested after collecting proper evidence against them,” the ADG said. “We are looking into the financial aspects of the group to get more details about the funding from anti-national groups including ISI, and will be presented before the court,” ADG Prashant Kumar said. IGP, ATS, GK Goswamy, who led the operation, told TOI that Jahangir Qasmi is a mufti (Islamic Preacher) and the head of Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) in Jamia Nagar area of Delhi. Jahangir allegedly used the centre for the purpose of mass conversion and arranged annual convocation for the new converts. Umar Gautam converted to Islam a few years ago and looked for vulnerable people for conversion. “We have recovered a register from the possession of the accused that contains details of over a 1,000 people who were converted by the duo in the past 18 months,” said the IG. Names and addresses mentioned in the register are that of individuals from Maharashtra, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi. In Uttar Pradesh, people from Varanasi, Mathura and Kanpur find a mention in the register,” the ATS chief said. “The accused targeted vulnerable groups in the society and lured them with promises of jobs and occupations. The also tried to instil hatred in the people against their previous religion to make the conversion easier. The accused went out for children with speech and hearing disabilities and living in various institutions and converted them without even intimating their parents. In one such instance, a family in Kanpur lodged an FIR regarding the mysterious disappearance of their son Aditya Gupta who was enrolled at a society in Noida. The boy was later found to have travelled to Kerala and was now offering namaz five times a day and converted to Islam. He returned to his family after he came to know that his mother was critical and hospitalised,” Goswamy said. “A team will meet Aditya in Kanpur soon to record his statement and confront him with Umar and Jahangir once we get their police custody,” the IG ATS said. Citing another instance related to the same Noida society from where Aditya went missing, another boy Mannu Yadav, son of Rajeev Yadav, was also converted. “The duo also lured girls from poor background to give up their religion and accept Islam promising them job and eventually got them married to Muslim men,” he added. IG ATS also said that heavy funding from middle-east countries have been detected while going through the bank accounts of Umar and jahangir. Charges against the duo, some unidentified persons and IDC, include those of cheating and dishonesty, criminal conspiracy, promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion, imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration, injuring or defiling place of worship, attempt to commit offences and sections of Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act. “We will take the duo in police custody and know more about their modus operandi,” said the IG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/religious-conversion-racket-busted-2-held/articleshow/83732130.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Houses, jobs, roads and drainage facilities, the villagers’ list is long. Sarpanch Pogula Anjaneyulu said people have a lot of expectations from the CM. “We expect the very face of our village to change. We have great expectations from his visit and we are sure that the CM will agree to our requests,” he told TOI. Little wonder, officials have already conducted a survey on the economic status of each family in the village. Officials have also conducted vaccination camps and almost all those who were available in the village were given Covid-19 vaccine. “The villagers need houses. Most of the houses are old and are in dilapidated condition,” Anjaneyulu said. The villagers are also hoping that employment opportunities will be created for the youth and agricultural implements provided for farmers. The villagers want internal roads laid and underground drainage facilities. The village has a population of 2,600. The invitation for lunch and also for the meeting to be followed at another location in the village is strictly for only the villagers. The villagers are being given passes for identification and entry. The lunch and the meeting will take place under rain-proof tents on a piece of land that has been readied for the purpose. On October 31 last year, the CM had stopped by at Vasalamarri and interacted with the villagers and promised to pay a visit to the village. A few days ago, the sarpanch received a call from the CM that he would visit Vasalamarri on June 22. In the last three days, officials and political leaders have been camping at the village to make arrangements for the CM’s visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-just-lunch-vasalamarri-has-a-big-wish-list-for-cm/articleshow/83732161.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Nagpur||Defying Covid, Income tax mop up in Vidarbha grows 106%||NAGPUR: Income tax collections in Nagpur region have also grown in line with the national trend, defying calls by businessmen that the pandemic has taken a toll on the earnings. The tax mop up shows a different picture altogether. The collections have gone up despite no actions like raids or surveys, which have been withheld by the department due to the Covid-19 situation. The net income tax collection from Nagpur region, which covers entire Vidarbha, has grown by 106% at Rs1,543 crore as on June 17. As against this, the mop up stood at Rs748 crore during the same period last year. This includes tax paid for the earnings in financial year 2020-21 and also advance taxes which are paid on current year’s income. The trend reflects that tax-payers earned well not only in the last financial year, but going has been good in the current fiscal too. This goes for both corporates and individual tax-payers. The growth rate in net collections in Nagpur surpasses the national average by 21%. Nationally, net collections for the period had gone up by 85% at Rs2,35,229 crore. Advance tax collection till June 17 has grown more than double at Rs332 crore in the region. Out of this, advance tax collections from corporates is up by 150% and that by individuals has grown by 96.19%, shows data maintained by income tax department. This is the first instalment of advance tax. Collection through self-assessment in the region has grown by 1133%, which is the highest under all the heads. Not much in absolute terms, but self-assessment tax payment from corporates, which stood at mere Rs2.70 crore last year, has touched Rs33.30 crore this fiscal. Payment of self-assessed tax by individuals has grown by 49% at Rs60 crore as on June 17. If there is any shortfall in payment of advance tax during a financial year, it is covered by self-assessment in the subsequent fiscal. The massive growth under this head is noteworthy, said sources. Tax deducted at source (TDS) on sale of properties is another area of growth. Tax under this head has gone up by 353% at Rs12.70 crore till June 17. The tax collections may have gone up, but refunds have come down. According to the data, refunds to both corporates and individuals clubbed together are down by 64% at Rs142.90 crore. Refunds to corporate tax-payers have gone down by 90% at Rs12 crore as against Rs135 crore as on June 17 last year. Chartered accountant and income tax practitioner Kailash Jogani said this shows that there has been no change in overall income, except in the retail segment that was affected due to the lockdown. The corporates have also performed well and the collection has happened without any coercive action, he said. IN A NUTSHELL * Net collections in Vidarbha were at Rs748 crore as on June 17 last year * It has touched Rs1,543 crore as on June 17, 2021 * Refunds are down by 64% * Growth rate in net collections in Nagpur surpasses national average by 21%||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/defying-covid-i-t-mop-up-in-vid-grows-106/articleshow/83730036.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Leopard spotted at Ellora Caves ticketing counter||AURANGABAD: A full-grown leopard was seen at the Ellora Caves, located 30km from here, at around 2am on Monday. The big cat was roaming around the ticketing counter of the world heritage and tourist site presumably in search of prey. The staff of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) working the night shift at the caves saw the leopard before it vanished into the nearby greenery. Monument attendant Devidas Jagtap said they were alerted to the leopard’s presence after a few dogs sleeping near the ticketing counter started barking on seeing the big cat. “It was a big leopard and the staff initially thought it to be a tiger. The forest department later confirmed it was a leopard. We checked the footage of two CCTVs at the ticketing counter in which the animal’s entry and exit before its brief stay of around one-and-half minute are visible,” he said. ASI staffers said a leopard was spotted around one-and-a-half months ago in the mountain range that nestles the Ellora Caves. “However, this is for the first time a big cat has actually entered the premises of the caves,” Jagtap said. Divisional forest officer (wildlife) Vijay Satpute said there was no need to panic. “The mountain range near the caves is adjacent to the Gautala-Autramghat wildlife sanctuary and it is part of the natural habitat of leopards. The animal must have strayed into the caves in search of prey such as monkeys or dogs. Such movement by leopards out of the sanctuary would happen only during the night hours, not during the day,” he added. While the last wildlife census of 2019 put the official count of leopards at the sanctuary at 26, the number is expected to have gone up over the past two years. Earlier, a tiger was seen a couple of kilometres away from the Ajanta Caves, another world heritage site in Aurangabad district, in January last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/leopard-spotted-at-ellora-caves/articleshow/83730032.cms||Prasad Joshi

More than a win or defeat in the election for them, it is going to be a double-edged sword for the TPCC. If TRS wins on one hand they can be happy that their rival opposition also lost, but it also sends a strong signal no one can take on chief minister KCR in the state. “The fighting spirit in the opposition camp itself will be over,” a top congress leader said. If BJP wins it will be big blow to TPCC, as the rival opposition further consolidates its position. Though there is currently one name of Kaushik Reddy doing the rounds for the Congress candidature, the cooperation from the local leaders seem to be far-cry, as he even met minister KTR after Eatala joined saffron party. Congress sources say that confusion over new PCC chief also will play a role in the current scenario.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-congress-in-a-fix-over-huzurabad-by-election/articleshow/83732205.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Madurai||Ration not reaching Paliyar in Madurai, mortgage of cards suspected||MADURAI: An inquiry by a team of officials into distribution of rice and other items through ration shops in Alagammalpuram Colony in Madurai district, where people belonging to Paliyar tribal community are settled, have brought out many irregularities including suspected mortgage of ration cards. After the district administration received complaints that ration items distributed by the government through PDS are not reaching the beneficiaries in the colony, a team led by the Usilampatti RDO K V Rajkumar conducted an inquiry on Sunday. But, on checking the delivery bills at the ration shop in the village, the officials found that all materials were issued to beneficiaries every month. Rajkumar said he suspects that the ration shop employee or someone on his behalf could have mortgaged the ration cards. But there was no complaint from the beneficiaries. “We understood that the villagers were trying to save someone. They said they were getting things regularly. However, I went door-to-door asking people to show the supplies they received. Except for one or two, others did not have anything to show,” he said. However, he has recommended action against the employee. “Mortgaging ration cards for paltry money is rampant among paliyars and other tribal people as they do not have access to financial institutions. It cannot take place without the collusion of ration shop employees,” said G Dhanraj, a tribal rights activist. There are many tribal people who could not access government welfare due to the absence of ration cards. They should be surveyed and issued cards at the earliest, he said. There is also the practice of ration shop employees withholding ration cards and using it without the knowledge of the card owners. V Thangaraj, a member of the Paliyar community settled in a village near Elumalai, applied for a ration card two years ago. With the government announcing Rs 4,000 as Covid-19 dole, Thangaraj, who was struggling to make his both ends meet, checked the status of his ration card application. To his shock he was told that his card was issued months ago. Meanwhile, ahead of the visit by the officials, the salesman of Nagamanayakkanpatti ration shop reached Thangaraj’s house and handed over him his ration card, rice supplies and the government dole of Rs 4,000 (Rs 2,000 pongal gift and Rs 2,000 first installment of Covid relief) early on Sunday morning. He also pleaded not to disclose the issue to the officials. Ration card belonging to two more people withheld by the employees was also promptly delivered, Thangaraj said. Rajkumar told TOI that he did not know about the issue. They inquired only about the complaints that rice and other materials distributed by the government are not reaching the beneficiaries. He said that separate inquiries will be conducted in Kurinji Nagar and Muttukattanparai, where sizable numbers of Paliyars live.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ration-not-reaching-paliyars-mortgage-of-cards-suspected/articleshow/83730080.cms||V Devanathan
---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad: TRS bastion, Eatala Rajender stronghold||HYDERABAD: The TRS has never lost an election in Huzurabad assembly constituency ever since the party came into being in 2001. Captain V Lakshmikantha Rao started the winning streak for the TRS in Huzurabad in 2004 elections and retained the seat in 2008. After Kamalapur constituency was merged with Huzurabad in the delimitation exercise in 2009, it has been Eatala Rajender all the way winning every election, including a bypoll, up to 2018. While the presence of BJP is almost negligible in the constituency, Congress had last won the seat in 1978. Only solace to the Congress is that it finished runners-up in 2018 and 2014 elections in the constituency. The selection of candidate by the TRS to take on Eatala would be crucial, political analysts said. Prior to the formation of TRS, it was the TDP and independents who ruled the roost in Huzurabad between 1985 and 1999. It is predominantly an agriculture-based constituency and home to a large number of rice mills. Though the TRS has not lost an election in Huzurabad, political analysts said contemporary politics cannot be judged by electoral history as the poll outcomes also undergo dynamic changes. Though it will be a combination of many factors, analysts said Huzurabad is a TRS bastion and Eatala’s stronghold too. Analyst professor K Nageshwar said the ensuing bypoll has the potential to witness a keen contest as it would not only be an electoral battle among the political parties but also at stake is popularity of a candidate (Eatala), image of the government and its leader, resources to be pooled by the parties and contesting candidates and the political narrative. Also, how much strength the BJP will be able to add to Eatala’s poll prospects, he said. Even the role of Congress in a polarised political battle will matter a lot, said analysts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huzurabad-trs-bastion-eatala-stronghold/articleshow/83732231.cms||Roushan Ali

The officials said the drives were supposed to resume from Tuesday but were delayed because orders from the state government arrived on Monday evening, too late for civic bodies to revise planned schedules. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “We received communication from the state government regarding resumption of the 18-44 group from Tuesday. Drives for the 30-44 group, which have been ongoing for the past few days, will now be superseded by the 18-44 programme." Deshmukh said as per instructions, only the Covishield vaccine will be available for the 18-44 age group vaccination. Covaxin reserves, because of supply shortages, will be set aside as second doses to those who've already received the shot. The 18-44 drive at civic sites was paused to increase focus on vaccination of the 45-plus group. The younger category was being vaccinated only at private hospital sites. Deshmukh said vaccine volume to the region is expected to improve, now that the Centre has taken over supply. “We have already received 3.8 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin this month. By June-end, the figure will cross the 5-lakh mark. In May, we had received only 4 lakh doses," he said. Officials from the PMC said nearly 181 centres will vaccinate the 30-44 group on Tuesday. Around 15 centres will conduct Covaxin-only drives (for those who are due for the second dose). In PCMC limits, officials said nearly 38 sites will host drives for the 30-44 group. Two PCMC centres will offer Covaxin to second-dose beneficiaries. On Monday, 38,659 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district. A total of 22,056 were from PMC limits, 8,893 from Pune rural and 7,343 were from PCMC limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/18-44-age-group-vaccination-drive-to-resume-from-tomorrow/articleshow/83730079.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The court was taking a serious view over the dispute between two elected representatives with regard to location of establishing a direct procurement centre (DPC) in Pudukottai district. The court passed the order while dismissing a public interest litigation filed by M Sumathi, president of the Rankiyanviduthi village panchayat in the district seeking to reopen the DPC in the same location where it was functioning for the past 10 years. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the petitioner who is the panchayat president wants to establish a DPC in a particular place and she wants the district administration to abide by her commands. Similarly, Mala Rajendran who is the chairperson of Karambakudi panchayat union wants the DPC to be established in a location of her choice. The judges observed that the court will not even hesitate to close the DPC but it does not want to do so as the public would be affected. The present litigation is itself on account of the personal ego of the petitioner. Therefore we will not entertain the same, said the judges. The judges said that the senior counsel appearing for the authorities submitted that regional manager of Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation of Pudukottai region had stated that due to this issue, a committee had to be constituted by the district collector and the DPC has been now shifted to a government poramboke land at the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/elected-reps-cannot-treat-people-as-slaves-says-hc/articleshow/83730050.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Madurai||Show sympathy while dealing with students: High court to Tamil Nadu education department||MADURAI: The school education department needs to show more sympathy and understanding, while dealing with students, particularly during this pandemic period, the Madras high court has observed while granting relief to a student by directing the authorities to declare him as pass in Class X. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that children studying in schools are facing a new challenge, wherein, they have been asked to attend the classes, which are conducted online. “There is already a surge in the number of cases before the psychiatrists to whom children are taken for counselling during this pandemic period. The children are facing a new problem and their energy is getting dissipated by confining them inside the house. This has been going on for more than one year and the society needs to attend to this problem by being more kind with the children and not to add more pressure on them.” The judge said that ultimately, when it came to conducting the examinations for classes IX, X and XI, the state government found that it was impossible to conduct them and expose the students to the deadly Covid-19 virus. Therefore, a policy decision was taken by the government to declare ‘all pass’ to the students studying in classes IX, X and XI as per GO dated February 25. The GO clearly contemplates all the students to be declared as pass and the only requirement is that their names must find place in the nominal roll that is submitted by the school. The court was hearing a petition filed by D Suresh Kumar of Theni district challenging the order passed by the authorities rejecting his request to declare his son pass in Class X for the academic year 2020-21, on the ground that he did not have required attendance. The judge observed that authorities have rejected the request made by the petitioner on the ground that his son did not properly attend the school and therefore, he is not entitled for the benefit under the GO. “The GO does not anywhere stipulate that the benefit will accrue to a student only if he fulfils the attendance requirement. It is not known from where the directorate of government examinations gathered such a requirement in the GO. The directorate of government examinations cannot add something to the GO, when it is not available in the GO,” observed the judge. Hence, the judge quashed the rejection order holding that the ground raised by the directorate of government examinations for rejecting the request made by the petitioner is unsustainable. The judge directed the authorities to declare the petitioner’s son as pass in Class X within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/show-sympathy-while-dealing-with-students-hc-to-edu-dept/articleshow/83730063.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Mumbai||Third FIR in vaccination scam; Kandivli doctor may be kingpin, say police||MUMBAI: Even as a third FIR was registered on Monday into the ‘vaccination scam’ in the city, a Kandivli doctor could be the real brain behind the racket. The doctor, who is on the run, not only sourced and controlled vaccine supplies, but also sent students from his paramedics training institute to administer jabs at some of the bogus camps, said the police. Khar police registered the latest FIR based on a complaint by Tips Industries about 206 staffers being fraudulently inoculated. The FIR states that the vials contained “adulterated liquid” instead of Covishield vaccine. The BMC is yet to hear from Covishield manufacturer Serum Institute of India on whether it had manufactured the vaccines that were administered at the bogus camps. The BMC has also asked the police to find out the source of the vaccines as these were not procured from any civic centres. Police have found that one of the arrested accused, Kareem Ali, was a student at the paramedics training institute. Ali has been booked for ferrying the vaccines. “The doctor got two nursing students from his institute to be present at the camp in Hiranandani Heritage society in Kandivli to administer shots. He paid them a nominal sum. We are verifying if the students were sent to other vaccination camps too and if they were aware of the fraud,” a police officer said. The institute has since downed shutters. Vaccine scam: After housing society, Ramesh Taurani's production house and a Mumbai college get dupedSleuths also found that the vials used at the bogus camps were re-used. “We have not been able to recover any vials yet. The accused tried to destroy as much evidence as they could. Key accused, Mahendra Singh, who accepted payments for all the camps, smashed his phone while in hiding at Panvel. We were able to recover only his SIM card,” the officer said. “Finding the vaccines’ sou-rce is important to verify if th-ey were fake or genuine. Also, if they were genuine, but were procured from outside Maharashtra, we will have to find out how they were transported,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The FIR filed by Khar police has booked former employee of Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital Rajesh Pandey, vaccination camps’ organiser Sanjay Gupta, and four others for allegedly duping Tips Industries’ staffers and their families of nearly Rs 2.5 lakh. The camp had been organised on June 3, but most of the beneficiaries did not receive their vaccination certificates. The gang is believed to have conducted bogus vaccination camps at Parel, Andheri, Versova, Kandivli, Borivli and two locations in Thane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/third-fir-in-vax-scam-kandivli-doc-may-be-kingpin-say-police-in-mumbai/articleshow/83732352.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Madurai||Allow us to operate for few hours daily: Madurai textile store owners to Tamil Nadu government||MADURAI: Small scale textile store owners from Madurai have urged the state government to allow them to operate at least for a few hours every day to help them come out of their financial problems. A large number of owners and employees from the sector gathered at Vilakkuthoon on Monday morning to stage a demonstration. A police team reached the spot and made them disperse citing the Covid-19 restrictions. Textile store owners said that it has been close to two months since the stores were closed due to lockdown. While the state government has announced some relaxations including public transportation in Chennai and its neighbouring areas, they were disappointed that relaxations to open textile stores were not given in places like Madurai, where the number of cases has come down. They added that they are already facing various financial issues as they continue to pay wages for their employees and rent of the shops. They will fall into deep debts if they are not allowed to open soon, they said. A V S Britto of Madurai textile association said that they are struggling to pay their employees. “We have heavy debts for which we need to pay interest. We have to pay electricity bills and rent. We are not in a position to spend any more. State government should allow us to operate for a few hours regularly. They can also allow us to operate on alternative days,” he said. There are 2,000 textile stores in Madurai, employing around 10,000 people. The livelihood of all these people will be affected if the government does not come forward to heed to our demands, owners said. Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has urged the government to allow opening of jewellery stores functioning in less than 3,000 square feet space as employees are losing their livelihood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/allow-us-to-operate-for-few-hours-daily-textile-store-owners-to-govt/articleshow/83730115.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune’s weekly CFR eases up after rising for over a month||PUNE: The weekly Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has started to drop in the district after constantly rising for over a month, which health experts have attributed to fall in the positivity rate and the number of critical patients. As per the data from the district health department, the CFR rose to 2.3% during May 13-19 and kept on rising in the consequent weeks to 2.7% and 2.9%. It touched 3% during June 3-9 period. However, it dropped to 1.8% in the week ending June 16. This was also the first time that the CFR fell below 2% in the last 40 days in Pune district. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that there was approximately a 2-week difference between fall in Covid positivity curve and death curve. “Mortalities follow the trend akin to positivity. The CFR in general has been lower in the second Covid wave in comparison to the first wave. One of the reasons being the number of mild to moderate Covid cases in the second wave being much higher,” he said, adding that availability of medication and oxygen had also eased in the last few weeks, which too have played a role in CFR coming down. Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force, said, “Covid hospital admissions have dropped to minimal in comparison to the peak in the district, which has played a role in reducing the CFR. Percentage of acute deaths (mortalities occurring within a short period due to acute Covid after admissions) has dropped.” He said mortalities seen now may be in case of serious patients having undergone Covid treatment for a prolonged period. “Such deaths could be occurring three to four weeks of ICU stay due to various reasons, such as low blood oxygen levels,” he said. The data showed that from the 930-odd deaths reported in the district during the week May 6-12, the weekly toll has been gradually decreasing, with the June 10-16 period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-weekly-cfr-eases-up-after-rising-for-over-a-month/articleshow/83730180.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||21 Delta-plus cases found in Maharashtra, 2 in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The emerging Delta-plus variant has been detected in 21 cases across six districts of Maharashtra, public health minister Rajesh Tope said on Monday. Maximum have been found in Ratnagiri (9), followed by Jalgaon (7), Mumbai (2) and one each in Palghar, Sindhudurg and Thane districts. The highly infectious Delta variant (B.1.617.2) that is believed to have driven the second wave has further mutated to form the Delta plus or ‘AY.1’ variant. Delta-plus carries all mutations present in Delta—that was first detected in India and is currently found in 80 countries—plus an additional one ‘K417N’. The mutation is in the spike protein, the region that interacts with the human cell. Experts have cautioned that since it has emerged from the highly transmissible Delta variant, there is every reason to stay extra vigilant. In Maharashtra, it was detected in Ratnagiri in May last week. Since last month, the state has sent around 7,500 samples for genome sequencing to Pune’s National Institute of Virology and New Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (IGIB), Tope said. He said all index cases with this variant will be closely studied. “Their travel history, vaccination status, health condition; and testing of high risk and low risk contacts will be done,” he said. Officials maintained that all those infected in Ratnagiri had mild Covid. In Mumbai, civic officials were unaware of cases with variants in the city till Tope’s announcement. “We have not been told of these cases yet,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. Health officials said they will seek information from the state and begin surveillance. Dr TP Lahane said that in the next three weeks, 100 samples from each district will be sent to laboratories for genome sequencing. “We are also expecting a report of some samples that we had previously sent in the next few days,” he said. At least five more states have reported the presence of Delta-plus. Dr Rajesh Pandey, principal scientist at CSIR-IGIB, said district authorities must adopt aggressive measures to keep a close watch to guage how it spreads. “A reflection of its infectivity would be, say, if a district that has five cases today ends up with 500 in two weeks,” he said. Delta could infect many in a quick turnaround time. “Whether Delta-plus will behave the same way is not known but looking at the mutation of Delta variant there is all reason to be extra vigilant,” he added. Diligent contact tracing combined with containment has to be at the heart of efforts to control its spread, Dr Pandey said, adding Delta-plus is a variant of interest at the moment. More studies have to be done to tell whether it has immune escape properties or if it makes a dent on the effectiveness of vaccines. CSIR-IGIB has signed an MOU with the state to sequence its samples. Following its detection, Dr Pandey said there are plans to increase sequencing from bigger cities like Mumbai, Pune, among others. “How quickly we respond to these findings on ground is one area that has to be focused upon,” he said. The lab now takes around 7-10 days to sequence the samples and communicate the findings to the state. While Delta-plus was first isolated in Europe in March, authorities in UK found contacts of the first five cases had travelled from or passed through Nepal and Turkey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/21-highly-infectious-delta-plus-cases-found-in-maharashtra-2-in-mumbai/articleshow/83730289.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Villagers crowdfund Rs 1.7 lakh for 2 roads, yet Rs 3.5 lakh claimed for work||AURANGABAD: Two roads, 1.5km and 2km in length, were constructed by the residents of Talwada village in Vaijapur tehsil of Aurangabad around eight months ago with Rs 1.7 lakh collected through crowdfunding. However, the villagers say that the administrator and gram sevak of the village put up bills of Rs 3.48 lakh for the work and claimed the amount, saying the construction was done by a contractor. Speaking to TOI, village deputy sarpanch Bhausaheb Magar said, “I have obtained all the documents through RTI and have lodged a complaint. We want a criminal offence registered against all those involved.” Magar and some villagers even reached out to the anti-corruption bureau on Monday to lodge a complaint. Villagers said that after the term of the village gram panchayat was over, an administrator was appointed in place of the sarpanch as fresh elections had to be deferred due to the pandemic. The villagers said that since the two mud roads — one at Nagwadi and the other from Talwada to Daukvasti — were largely deserted during the lockdown, they decided to construct them for the benefit of students after the restrictions were lifted. A total of 32 villagers took the lead in getting the work done. Gram panchayat member Wahid Shaikh said the students had a particularly torrid time in the monsoons trudging along the slushy roads. After the gram panchayat elections were held this year, the newly-elected body went through the records of all development works and found that bills had been put up for the road construction done through crowdfunding. ZP CEO Mangesh Gondawale said, “We will definitely look into the matter. Anyone found at fault will face action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/villagers-crowdfund-rs-1-7l-for-2-roads-yet-rs-3-5l-claimed-for-work/articleshow/83730205.cms||Mohammed Akhef

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing petitions filed by Nayini Lingam and 35 others, who questioned the attempts of the authorities in seeking to evict them even after the lapse of the land acquisition notification issued long ago to acquire their properties. Another set of petitioners, G Sreelekha and 50 others, questioned the inaction of the state in awarding separate rehabilitation package for those who became majors but were staying in the same house. Their properties were being sought by the state for constructing Mallannasagar reservoir, a part of the state’s ambitious Kaleshwaram project. Petitioners’ counsel sought restraint order in respect of closing access to the village. The bench, however, declined to accord any new reliefs and posted the case to September 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-breather-for-mallannasagar-victims/articleshow/83732381.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||TOI Impact: Karateka forced to sell tea on Mathura streets gets job as sensei||AGRA: Hari Om Shukla was 13 when he first started training to become a karateka. By the time he was 25, he had won 60 medals at karate tournaments. But without state support and little demand for his skills, he found it difficult to make ends meet. The pandemic struck the final blow — the Rs 4,000 a month he’d make teaching kids also stopped, and he started selling tea at his father’s stall. A week since TOI reported his plight, help has come his way — the Mathura district magistrate intervened and, now, he will be teaching karate at a private university in the city. “I thank the DM and TOI for helping me. I was desperately in need of a job,” said Shukla, adding that he has accepted the formal offer from GLA University and is ready to join. Mathura DM Navneet Singh Chahal said he read about Shukla in TOI and knew he had to do something. “I put in a word with a few places. He has been appointed as a teacher at GLA University with a salary of Rs 20,000 a month. It is not just a job but also what he loves doing,” he added. Shukla has a bachelor’s degree in science, a copy of which he doesn’t have because he couldn’t pay for it. He used to work at a private academic institute earlier but lost that job. Then, he started teaching kids, which stopped during lockdown. He has a two-year-old son and has always wanted to help his father out. Now, he can. The university’s promoter Narayan Das Agarwal said they introduced karate in the curriculum after a conversation with the DM. “We offer many games at our institution — basketball, football — but karate was not on the list. After reading TOI and with the DM’s initiative, we decided to include it as an extracurricular option while helping Shukla,” he added. Shukla got his first karate medal just three years into his training, in 2009, when he got a bronze in a Kumite tournament (sparring, one of three main parts of karate training) at the 14th International Funakoshi Cup Karate Championship in Mumbai. His first win on foreign soil came in 2013, when he won gold and silver medals at the the World Kumite Organisation’s East Asia Karate Championship in Thailand. Two years later, he bagged a gold at the Senior Men’s Kumite tournament in the 75-80kg category and a silver in the Senior Men’s Kata Open Group (kata is another of the three parts of karate training, which focuses on form) at the International Shotokai Karate-DO Federation event in Sri Lanka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/toi-impact-karateka-forced-to-sell-tea-on-mathura-streets-gets-job-as-sensei/articleshow/83725203.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Some of the vials that had been confiscated were labelled in Bangladesh. Kolkata Police has registered two separate FIRs at Park Street and Alipore police stations. Remdesivir, an anti-viral medication, was being administered to Covid patients in hospital. With production limited till last month, they were being sold in the market at a premium, even after the government had stopped its sale in the open market and reduced its MRP. In Bengal, hospitals were barred from asking patient parties to procure the vials and had put the onus of procuring and administering the drug on hospital authorities. The vials seized from the gang were manufactured at Ghazipur in Bangladesh in the month of April. These had been siezed by cops here in April and May. The gang operated through their social media contacts and would complete all their business dealings in the Park Circus-Park Street, Baguiati and Bangur areas. More than 200 vials of remdesivir were siezed from the gang.

The letter, which calls for an alliance with the BJP in the face of alleged "harassment" of Sarnaik, Sena minister Anil Parab and former minister Ravindra Waikar by Central agencies, has put the Sena leadership in a spot, party sources said. A senior Sena minister, who did not wish to be named, said, "Sena functionaries are not known for writing such letters. It is quite uncharacteristic of the party. The CM and the party leadership, however, are not taking it too seriously, and it seems to be an attempt to seek protection, at least in terms of perception." Read AlsoNo groupism in Shiv Sena, says Sanjay Raut after Pratap Sarnaik's 'letter to CM'Shiv Sena stands behind Pratap Sarnaik, says Raut.The minister explained that on all key issues, including those related to the MVA government, the relationship with the BJP and the upcoming civic polls, the CM had held discussions with ministers and senior Sena functionaries. The Sena, in view of the BMC polls, has already started an internal analysis on whether to go solo or ally with the NCP. A political observer said, "If a leader or party office-bearer has any issues, they are taken up directly with the leadership. Writing a letter to the CM and making it public is not the Sena's style and may indicate the growing gap between Sena leaders and the top leadership, which is now part of the government. There seems to be a communication gap, and it is also alarming that MLAs are claiming that they are fighting lonely battles with little or no support from the party machinery despite being in power."

He claimed an alliance with ex-partner BJP will be beneficial to him and other Sena leaders such as Parab and Waikar and stated that he, along with his family, had been fighting a legal battle for the last seven months without getting support from the party and state government.

Police have detained a few people while a probe is on. According to police, cousins Arvind Kumar and Anil Kumar were at loggerheads over family land. What started as a heated argument between them turned so ugly that a group led by Arvind allegedly opened indiscriminate fire during the brawl leading to a fatality. “The deceased was identified as Bholu while another man, Ashok, has sustained a bullet injury,” said Keshav Kumar, superintendent of police (rural areas). According to the family, in the past also the cousins have clashed over the land owned by one of their uncles. “The uncle, who is without a son, gave his land to nephew Anil and this did not go down well with Arvind.

---||Mumbai||Free vaccination for all above 18 years to resume in Maharashtra from today||MUMBAI: Free vaccination will resume for all above 18 years in the state from Tuesday, weeks after it was put on hold following a brief 12-day drive in May. In Mumbai, the drive for the 18-plus is likely to start Wednesday since the announcement came late in the evening after schedules were already created, civic officials said. On a day when the country recorded its highest immunisations in a single day, Mumbai too crossed the milestone of over 1lakh doses administered. A total of 1,08,148 got vaccinated in the city, highest so far since the drive began in January, pushing the number of those who have received at least one dose to 45.70lakh. Inoculation at the public centres saw a big jump after sluggish performance for over a month. Public-run centres vaccinated nearly as much (49,208) as private facilities (58,940). In June, private hospitals had accounted for the biggest share so far, accounting for up to 75% daily doses. Urging youths to get vaccinated, public health minister Rajesh Tope said the decision to open up for all above 18 was taken to generate momentum. Since vaccination was put on hold for the younger age groups in public centres, they had to opt for paid immunisation at private sites. About 34lakh people from this age group have got vaccinated since May, of the eligible population of nearly 6 crore in the state. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, said the state will have about 17 lakh doses when the sessions start on Tuesday tomorrow. The decision to vaccinate those above 18 came two days after the state opened vaccination for the 30-44 age group. On Monday, even as India hit the milestone of 81lakh vaccinations, the state could, in all, vaccinate 3.8lakh, far less than Karnataka (10.6lakh) or Madhya Pradesh (15.42lakh). Monday was also the first day when 50% of the vaccinations were done through online registrations and 50% through walk-ins. Many centres were kept busy as hundreds thronged for the limited walk-in spots. At Dahisar jumbo vaccination centre, many above 45 years had to return without getting vaccine shots. At other sites, the 30-44 group were turned away. Private hospitals, meanwhile, demanded a timeline and clarity about vaccine supply. Many said they were left with doses only for a few days. From June 21 onwards, their orders are supposed to be routed through the state, but there is little clarity on the modality. Mulund’s Fortis Hospital officials said they have stocks only to last a week. Dr Santosh Shetty, CEO of Kokilaben Hospital, said he had placed orders in the last week of May and is yet to receive supply. “We are not doing any tie-ups till we have more clarity on supply,” he said. The public centres received stocks of over 1.11lakh doses which should last them a day or two, said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/free-vax-for-all-above-18-years-to-resume-in-maharashtra-from-today/articleshow/83730316.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Agra||German ‘gau rakshak’ claims threat to life in Mathura||AGRA: For 16 years, Friederike Irina Bruning, 63, a German woman who also goes by Sudevi Dasi, has been running a cow shelter at Radha Kund in Mathura, tending to at least 2,500 abandoned, sick and injured cows and calves. Now, she alleged, she is being "threatened with death" by the caretaker’s son who is attempting a land grab. She has filed a police complaint and an FIR has been registered. The Radha Surabhi Gaushala was set up on land registered in the name of the presiding deity of the Shri Thakur Gopinathji Maharaj Virajman Temple, and runs on donations and money Bruning receives from her parents in Germany. “Daily, we bring between 8 and 15 injured cows in our gaushala ambulance,” she wrote in her complaint to the police. Bruning was awarded the Padma Shri in 2019 for social work (animal welfare). That year, the caretaker of the shelter, Hariom Sharma, passed away. That was when, Bruning said, the trouble began. Hariom’s son, Giridhari, started threatening her to give up the land. “He tried to kill me by getting gunmen and opening firing on me (sic), however, I had a lucky escape and was saved,” she wrote in her complaint. “While Giridhari Sharma along with his family members ... (have) no rights on the land, they forcefully enter the premises and threaten me and my manager Dhaval Sachdev.” Giridhari, 40, refuted the allegations. “It is our land, our temple. I have never threatened her. I used to assist my father as a caretaker of the cow shelter. After he died in 2019, she would not let us come in anymore,” he told TOI. Giridhari lives half a kilometre from the temple premises. He claims when he was young, his farmers’ family would bring their cows to the place where the shelter is now to graze. When Bruning got here, he added, she slowly turned it into a shelter and “took over our work.” Govardhan SDM Rahul Yadav confirmed what Bruning said. “The land belongs to the trust of Shri Thakur Gopinath ji Maharaj Virajman temple and is not owned by any individual. A PIL was filed in high court about this ownership and is being investigated,” he added. In its last hearing on the case, disposing of the petition, the high court had stated on January 18 this year that the Mathura DM would take a call on the matter “within a period of eight weeks from the date of receiving the representation.” SP (traffic) Kamal Kishore, who now has additional charge as Mathura SSP, said he has received the complaint. An FIR has been registered at Haja police station against Giridhari, three others and six unidentified persons for rioting, house-trespass, voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult to provoke breaking of public peace, criminal intimidation, extortion and mischief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/german-gau-rakshak-padma-shri-winner-says-threat-to-life-over-land-grab/articleshow/83725264.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Pune||Stop going overboard with ‘kadha’,vitamin, antibiotic pills, alert docs||Pune: Over-zealous consumption of “kadha”, antibiotics and vitamin pills has led to a spike in cases of constipation-induced anal fissure among patients in suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients, doctors say. “We diagnosed 481 people with anal fissure between April 10 and May 20. They were either highly suspected or confirmed patients of Covid-19. During the same period, 223 non-Covid people were diagnosed with the condition (anal fissure). This indicated the high presence of anal fissure among the people,” said proctologist Ashwin Porwal of Healing Hands Clinic, a dedicated proctology unit in the city. When probed, almost all 481 people admitted to having indulged in extensive use of “kadha”, over-the-counter vitamin and antibiotic pills to either ward off or cure Covid symptoms, in addition to the prescribed medications, he said. “Extensive and excessive consumption of ‘kadha’ can cause side-effects such as hyperacidity, burning sensation and acute pain in stomach and intestine. It may also cause diarrhoea or constipation due to its hot potency and penetrating and drying property of mucus membrane — the lining in the stomach and intestines. Constipation, diarrhoea and gases may lead to causing fissure,” Porwal said. Other doctors have also confirmed the trend. “We are witnessing a sizeable chunk of patients with anal fissures among mainly those who have recently undergone treatment for moderate to severe Covid,” said physician Akshay Sonone, who has so far treated over 1,000 Covid-19 patients. “I am seeing an average of 5-6 patients of bleeding fissure per day with the history of Covid in the past 3-4 weeks. We follow the grade-wise treatment protocol,” said surgeon Paresh Gandhi. Porwal said, “Excess vitamin D can lead to constipation. This can cause fissure due to passing of hard stools. Similarly, excess vitamin C or zinc can cause diarrhoea that can trigger multiple abrasions over the anus due to friction. This is called acute anal fissure,” Porwal said. Too many antibiotics are also to be blamed. “Antibiotics lead to disturbance of gut microbiome by damaging the healthy gut bacteria. This can lead to diarrhoea or at times constipation. Altered bowel habits with increased stool frequency mount up pressure on anus. This can cause a cut or multiple cuts in the lining of the large intestine near the anus,” Porwal said “Physical activity maintains the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of our body. Work from home and excessive rest will decrease the BMR. This leads to impaired digestion, which in turn causes constipation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stop-going-overboard-with-kadhavitamin-antibiotic-pills-alert-docs/articleshow/83730274.cms||Umesh Isalkar

He applauded the efforts of the health department in tackling the Covid-19 crisis so far. Cautioning people against the predicted third wave, Nitish urged everyone to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated. “Do get vaccinated. It is the only tool to protect oneself from the virus. Also maintain distance, put on a mask and wash hands regularly,” Nitish said on the occasion. He also talked about his government’s efforts in the first and second wave of Covid-19 and assistance provided to the people, be it tests, vaccination, medicines or other help. He said the state government had been working vigorously following the Centre’s guidelines and despite being the third most populous state, Bihar was on the 21st position in numbers of active Covid-19 cases now. “We don’t indulge in publicity, but work. At several places, we see people advertising much. But we believe in direct work,” said Nitish while lauding the decision to provide free vaccines to all the 18-44 years age group beneficiaries. He said over 1.16 crore people in Bihar have got first doses and another 22.54 lakh their second doses. Vaccinating another six crore people with two doses of vaccines require a lot of planning and would need huge amount of vaccines and manpower, he said. Nitish also mentioned his government’s decision to give Rs4 lakh to the next of kin of the Covid-19 victims. He said there were 9500 such deaths, still a poor state like Bihar was ready to provide all possible help to its people. Recalling how the number of Covid-19 cases increased all of a sudden during the second wave, the CM said, “Many people fell victims to it and there was shortage of oxygen across the country, which had never happened earlier. But now all the arrangements have been made,” said Nitish, adding the state government was focused on tests, treatment and vaccination. State health minister Mangal Pandey called it a big day in terms of health as two mega initiatives were launched —six crore vaccination campaign and free vaccines to the beneficiaries of 18-44 years age group by PM Modi. Pandey said this vaccination drive will play a crucial role in making Bihar Covid-free. State health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit thanked the CM for guiding the department in the crisis. He said the six crore vaccination drive will be officially started from July 1 and will continue till December. However, the health department will try to achieve this target before the set time frame. Amrit also talked about the work being done in creating awareness among the people. Both the deputy CMs, Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and other cabinet ministers along with senior officials were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-launches-drive-to-vaccinate-6-crore-in-6-months/articleshow/83726694.cms||Sheezan Nezami

NKDA, has already installed LED lights on the main arterial road, and plans to replace all streetlights in the inner lanes and cross roads with LEDs. BMC too has started replacing old streetlights with LED lights in several parts of Salt Lake. South Dum Dum Municipality officials said that a Rs 9.5 crore proposal has been placed to the state government for approval. “The proposal is still under process for clearance. Once cleared, work will start,” said a civic official. Officials said that presently, the civic body pays around Rs 13 to Rs 14 crore as electricity bills because of the conventional street lighting system. “The amount will get reduced considerably once the streetlights are replaced with LED,” said an official. In New Town, LED lights have been installed on the main arterial road stretch and on few other stretches of the township, there are several old sodium vapour or metal halide street lights in many places of the inner roads in Action Area I, II and III which needs to be replaced. NKDA is in the process of engaging an agency for the same. Since 2013 NKDA had started installing LED lights. The LED lights have been installed with a gap of 20 meters between each pole. In Salt Lake, BMC had also received an approval of Rs 17 crore sanctioned by the state government earlier and is working to replace the existing sodium vapour lights with LED lights. As per rough estimates, BMC pays a monthly energy bill of about Rs 1.5 crore. “About 60% of the electricity bill will get reduced once all the streetlights are covered with LED,” said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/south-dum-dum-civic-body-plans-to-replace-streetlights-with-led/articleshow/83728105.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Pune||Experts seek expanded sequencing to spot variants||PUNE: Districts with high Covid positivity rates should be allowed to send more samples for genome sequencing, given the emergence of the Delta Plus variant, experts have said. Maharashtra has reported at least 20 cases involving the new variant. Each district is allowed to send 100 samples for genome sequencing to labs part of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genetics Consortium (INSACOG). But experts said high-incidence districts should be allowed to send more samples for tests. The Delta Plus is a “variant of interest”. National and state task force member Subhash Salunke said with a third wave likely, the Centre has to increase genome sequencing capacity to process samples from states. “There should be mechanism to send more samples. There should also be more facilities,” Salunke said.  State task force member Shashank Joshi said the earlier norm was to sequence 5% of the tested population. But that rule was modified with some restrictions during the second wave, when Covid cases increased. “Now that the cases are waning, INSACOG should revise it to the earlier 5% of the tested population for genomic surveillance. This would mean more samples from each district,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-seek-expanded-sequencing-to-spot-variants/articleshow/83730286.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The gram panchayat had also allowed students from standards III and IV to attend school from Monday, and those from standards I and II from July 1. All schools in the state are closed till further orders. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Monday said the Hiware Bazar zilla parishad school will close with immediate effect. “There are talks of a Covid-19 third wave in the state and the decision to keep schools closed was taken after discussions with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Until the state revises its decision, after looking at all circumstances, all schools must remain closed. I have spoken to the education commissioner to look into the matter. The Hiware Bazar school will be told to shut down immediately. The health department experts and the chief minister will meet on Tuesday to discuss the reopening of schools and a decision will follow,” Gaikwad told TOI. But Hiware Bazar’s sarpanch Popatrao Pawar said the gram panchayat will meet after they receive a written order and decide about the school’s functioning offline. Pawar said, “Till the time we get a written order, we will keep the school open. The gram panchayat has all the rights to decide for a village. The resolution to open the school was passed by all gram panchayat members in agreement with the villagers.” Education officer of Ahmednagar Zilla Parishad Shivaji Shinde said while the thoughts behind reopening was for a good reason, they had not sought permission. Pawar said they had written to the Zilla Parishad, but they got no response.  Hiware Bazar was unaffected by Covid-19 in the first wave, but recorded cases and a death in the second wave, but rallied to stamp out the virus. Pawar said a survey in May among the students clearly indicated that they were unhappy with online classes and wanted to attend school in person. “We talked to the parents and discussed the academic loss due to online classes. We assured them of a Covid-safe experience in school. The gram panchayat decided to take the responsibility of a student’s treatment if any one fell ill,” Pawar added. Equipped to handle The village contributed money for bigger classrooms that are 24 by 30ft and 12ft in height. “Now, there is enough space to accommodate one student per bench. We have 190 students in the primary classes and 130 students in the secondary section. About 50% of these students come from nearby villages. Their parents drop and pick them up so that students do not loiter,” Pawar added. A teacher from the school said they have had full attendance since the first day. “The school starts at 10am, but for an hour, we check the students’ temperature and oxygen levels. They sit according to their roll numbers, one student on a bench with enough distance between the benches. The school ends at 1pm. There is no lunch break or a sports period. We ensure that the students do not loiter or stop at local eateries. We have followed a strict hygiene protocol too,” he added. The village may not agree to closing the school as per the government’s order, he added. “I won’t go to school if the government tells me not to teach. But the villagers may not close down the school. They will rope in the educated youths to continue with the teaching,” he added. Local decision Vasant Kardile, whose daughter studies in Std X and son in Std VII, said all the parents trust the gram panchayat’s word. “For one and half years, there has been no physical school and online education is not effective. The future of our children is at stake and hence we decided to allow the reopening which made all the students happy,” he said. Vasant Kalpande, former director of education and state board chairman, said the Union and state governments can decide for the larger good, but freedom must be given at the local level for schools’ reopening. “If there are no Covid-19 cases and if all precautions are strictly taken schools in rural areas can reopen as online education is not at all effective. We can always close them if cases surface,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hiware-bazar-school-ordered-to-shut-down-after-opening-offline/articleshow/83730291.cms||Ardhra Nair

All of them were later released on bail. A large number of people had gathered for the function, disregarding the social distancing norm. The Shivajinagar police had on Sunday registered a case against the office-bearers and 150 members of NCP for violating the Covid rules. Senior inspector Neelima Pawar of the Shivajinagar police said, “We arrested the six office-bearers of NCP and as the offence was bailable, the arrested persons were released on bail.” Apart from Jagtap, NCP’s youth wing president Mahesh Hande, committee member Pradeep Deshmukh, former PMC corporators Nilesh Nikam and Balasaheb Bodke, and Rohan Paygude were arrested. Deshmukh said “We received a call from the police station on Sunday night regarding the FIR registered against the NCP members. We presented ourselves in the police station and we were arrested. We were later released on bail.

---||Goa||Unusual occurrence: Fist-size tar balls wash ashore at Benaulim||Colva: Unlike the tiny tar balls that usually line the shore during the pre and early monsoon season, fist-size tar balls have been washed ashore at Benaulim beach. While small deposits of tar balls, all along the coastal belt, during different times of the year have become a common phenomenon, the fist-size tar ball deposits are unusual. A green activist said it could be smaller units of oil getting aggregated on the seabed that must have been pushed to shore by the violent undercurrent prevailing during the last few days. Tar balls are lumps of solidified crude oil found in or on the sea that get washed up on the shore. As per experts, tar ball pollution has severe consequences as they not only destroy the scenic beauty of the beach but threaten marine life like crabs, shrimps and several other species. An ex-scientist from NIO, while stating that the large tar balls need to be analysed, a former scientist from NIO said the tar balls on beaches are fundamentally the result of washing off of crude oil on open ocean. “During this process of transportation — a layer of oil over the sea water — it undergoes physical and chemical alteration called weathering. It is finally washed and deposited on beaches as sticky black lumps or balls. They are indicative of oil spills and are hazardous to marine and beach environment,” he said. Environment minister Nilesh Cabral while explaining to villagers of Cavelossim on environment day earlier this month had stated that the source of oil causing tar balls or the generation of black sand on Goa’s shoreline was traced to Bombay High rigs. He referred to the study conducted by NIO. He had said the Goa government has written to the ONGC about their findings while urging them to take corrective steps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unusual-occurrence-fist-size-tar-balls-wash-ashore-at-benaulim/articleshow/83730449.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune study suggests measles shot effective against SARS-CoV-2||PUNE: A study by researchers from BJ Medical College here has found early evidence showing measles-containing vaccines (MCVs) might offer children some protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The case-control study analysed 548 participants, aged 1 to 17, who were put in two groups — those who have tested positive for Covid (via RT-PCR) and those who haven’t. Researchers found the MCVs had vaccine effectiveness of 87.5% against SARS-CoV-2 and that vaccinated participants had less severe Covid symptoms than the non-vaccinated. The Pune findings support a much-discussed hypothesis that children are fairly protected against SARS-CoV-2 because of “non-specific immunity” following inoculation with live attenuated vaccines, including MCVs and the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) shot. The measles vaccine has been part of India’s universal immunization programme for the last 36 years. The BJ Medical College research was published in the peer-reviewed international journal, Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics, this month. The researchers said although their findings are encouraging, larger trials would be needed before a definitive conclusion, about protection offered by MCVs against SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be made. “The results of our study indicate that MCVs can be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed further through prospective randomized clinical trials,” said paediatrician Nilesh Gujar, the study’s lead investigator. In India, the measles vaccine is given at 9 months and 15 months. In 2018, the Union government launched the measles-rubella elimination campaign to cover children under 18 who had not received the vaccine at these ages. The children enrolled in the Pune study had documented evidence of vaccination. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 has been less on the pediatric population compared to adults. But experts have said that children can be important facilitators in the transmission of the virus. Currently, only the Pfizer vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (not yet available in the country) has been approved for children (aged 12-15). Trials are on in India to find a suitable shot for children. “The case-control study assessed the effectiveness of MCVs in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reducing its severity,” said community medicine expert Muralidhar Tambe, dean of BJ Medical College and Sassoon hospital and one of the researchers. As per available data, during 2019-2020, nationwide coverage of the first MCV dose ranged between 72.5% and 96.2%. Second-dose coverage ranged between 11.7% and 44.4%. The researchers said their study assessed the MCV’s effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and not its efficacy. “Efficacy is the degree to which a vaccine prevents disease, and possibly transmission, under ideal and controlled circumstances (comparing a vaccinated group with a placebo group). Effectiveness refers to how well it performs in the real world,” said vaccine researcher Prasad Kulkarni, one of the investigators of the study. Other members of the research team included Malangori Parande, Nandkumar Salunke, Ganesh Jagdale, Sarah Anderson, Abhijeet Dharmadhikari and Anand Lakhkar. Infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, member of the National Task Force on Covid-19 said, “Science is incremental, in a sense that it goes on adding to existing knowledge. Such studies add up to what we already knew and bolster them."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-study-suggests-measles-shot-effective-against-sars-cov-2/articleshow/83730326.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) on June 16 resumed its airport service with 10 e-buses on six routes. The response has so far been dismal despite an increase in the number of flights and footfall at the airport. “The rise in the number of flights and passengers is marginal. ABHI (Airport Bus for Business, Home and Hotel Connectivity) service has failed to attract passengers. The number of flights to and from Pune needs to go up further,” a senior PMPML official told TOI. The cumulative numbers across all routes for the first five days are paltry. June 16: 266 passengers, June 17: 297, June 18: 306, June 19: 265 and June 20: 289. Another PMPML official was optimistic about the service’s chances of becoming popular going by these numbers. “We saw a rise in the number of passengers and the income. For example, on June 16, we earned Rs9,515. On June 17: Rs10,500; June 18: Rs11,095. Almost all airports have a bus service and I see no reason as to why Pune can’t have one?” he said. Despite the slow start, the PMPML is not considering stopping the service. “The numbers are not good, considering an average of 5,000 travellers are using the airport. We have opted not to increase the number of ABHI buses. We believe the passenger count will go up,” an official said. The PMPML had launched ABHI bus service last October with 35 e-buses. By January, the fleet was reduced to 10 due to poor response. The fares were also reduced. An airport official said that things will improve slowly. Pre-pandemic, Pune had 140 flights daily. Currently, the number is 52.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-to-continue-with-airport-bus-service-despite-dismal-response/articleshow/83730385.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Rising fuel rates act as fodder for increasing veggie prices||PUNE: Fish and chicken preparations or dishes of the humble potato have replaced the traditional brinjal or cluster beans curries in the menu of the Navarkar household owing to the skyrocketing vegetable prices. Vegetable prices are on fire this season, owing to the combined blow the transportation sector has suffered due to the rise in fuel prices and the rain. “Prices of practically all vegetables have shot up in the past 10 days. I end up spending anything around Rs400-500 each time I go to buy vegetables. To balance the budget, we are now eating more non-vegetarian food. And if we get bored, we opt for a simple potato curry. Earlier we used to have different vegetable curries almost five to six times a week,” said Abhijit Navarkar, an insurance agent. The rising fuel prices, in addition to the recent rain, have led to prices of vegetables soaring in both retail and wholesale markets. According to those involved in the business — including retailers and transporters — incoming stocks in Pune have been slightly affected due to the monsoon. The high fuel price was the major factor behind the rise in the vegetable prices. “For quite sometime, the transporters were abstaining from increasing (transportation) charges fearing loss of business. However, with practically everything having opened now, the transporters have increased transportation charges, triggering an overall price rise of vegetables in the markets,” Sharad Sawant, a retailer told TOI. Vilas Bhujwal, the president of the Pune Commission Agents Association said the wholesale prices of many vegetables have also gone up. “Potatoes, which cost Rs10 per kg in the wholesale market a week ago, are now being sold at Rs15-16. The price of onions has increased from Rs15 to Rs22 per kg in the wholesale market and the same can be said about other vegetables. While transportation costs are rising due to the high diesel prices, the rains have also slowed down supply to some extent. With restrictions being relaxed, everything from small eateries and restaurants are open and the demand is more. Hence, transporters can now increase their rates to deal with the rising fuel costs,” Bhujwal said. Vegetables come from places like Sangli, Solapur, Satara, Nagpur and Ahmednagar to Pune. Vegetables also come from other states like Himanchal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The price of diesel was Rs93.63 per litre in the city on Monday. “We waited for long and suffered losses as increasing transport charges would have meant losing business as many transporters were sitting idle due to the restrictions for two months or so. However, things are different now and many businesses have opened up. With restaurants and eateries opening for dine-in, they need more produce so transporters have started to get work,” Ajay Kadam, a transporter said. Baba Shinde, the president of the Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatna, told TOI, “There is a nationwide protest against the fuel price hike on June 28 and if prices don’t reduce, a chakka-jam will happen in August. The price rise of all commodities including vegetables is inevitable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rising-fuel-rates-act-as-fodder-for-increasing-veggie-prices/articleshow/83730374.cms||Joy Sengupta

Compared to that, the April-May surge saw a peak of 14,605 on April 30, nine times higher. Except Ahmedabad, which recorded 16-fold rise (from 354 to 5,790), three other major cities recorded below or at-par with state average increases. Surat recorded a nine-fold rise (238 to 2,176), whereas Rajkot and Vadodara recorded seven-fold and five-fold increases, respectively. “The analysis can be seen as a surge in areas outside the eight municipal corporations. The biggest takeaway from the second wave is there is a need to look beyond urban areas to ensure control of the pandemic. Compared to urban areas, there is still a smaller number of tests carried out per capita to find new cases,” said a city-based epidemiologist. There was a slight increase in the share of the eight municipal corporations – Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Junagadh and Gandhinagar – in the 31-day comparison of Nov-Dec 2020 and Apr-May 2021. Compared to 56% last year, this year it was 61%. Analysis of the deaths in the second wave changes the picture – compared to 87% of deaths from cities in one month of the first wave, the share plummeted to 52% in one month of the second wave. While the highest number of deaths in a day doubled for Ahmedabad during the two peaks – from 13 to 27, the increase was greater for other cities – seven-fold for Surat, and more than ten-fold for Vadodara and Rajkot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-wave-peak-was-16x-in-city/articleshow/83730426.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Pune||P1/P2 parking system on two roads in Vimannagar||PUNE: The traffic police department has issued a notification introducing a P1/P2 parking system on two road stretches in Vimannagar. The system is to be implement on a 200m stretch between Konarknagar and CCD Chowk, and the 100m thoroughfare between CCD chowk and Oakwood society. The notification — aimed at streamlining traffic in the area — has invited suggestions and objections from citizens for a fortnight. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said they would review the plan based on the suggestions/objections. “Many shops and offices have sprung up on these two stretches. Vehicles are being parked in a haphazard manner. This has reduced the carriageway and is causing traffic congestion. Many citizens have sent us complaints and photographs, stating there was a lack of a proper parking system outside the societies, as vehicles were being parked at random,” Shrirame told TOI. He said they zeroed in on the P1/P2 plan following a survey by the Airport police. “The aim is to decongest traffic and increase the width of the carriageway. We issued notification on June 18 and have asked for objections and suggestions by July 1,” he added. The reaction to the notification from citizens, however, was mixed. Nilesh Sonagra, secretary of the Nagar Road Citizens Forum said P/P2 boards have been installed outside the housing societies long before the police notification. “We want police to regulate parking in the area, but first the civic body must expedite concreting of the dirt road in Konarknagar. The road is wide enough, and the flow of traffic is low; no vehicles are parked because of the ongoing construction work,” Sonagra said. Sonagra said many scrapped vehicles have been discarded in a cul-de-sac near Oakwood society. “We want PMC and traffic police to remove these vehicles as it will create more parking space,” he said. Local activist Kalpesh Yadav too opposed the plan. “The P1/P2 system is unnecessary during the pandemic as traffic movement has reduced. There has not been any congestion since last year’s lockdown, and increased fines and higher fuel prices have dissuaded people from taking their vehicles out,” Yadav claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/p1/p2-parking-system-on-two-roads-in-vimannagar/articleshow/83730419.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Tortured’ by cops, retired Army man sits on dharna against ‘shoddy police action’||BAREILLY: A 41-year-old retired Army man, Resham Singh, who was allegedly thrashed, taken to a police station in Pilibhit and tortured for hours on May 3, launched an indefinite dharna along with Army veterans at Damodar Park in Bareilly on Monday. Singh, who served in the Army for 18 years and retired as a Naik with an “exemplary” record, has alleged that Pilibhit police carried out a shoddy investigation in his case and did not take appropriate action against the accused policemen who allegedly tortured him and inserted an oil-stained baton in his rectum. Earlier, they thrashed his family members after stopping his car on the road. Singh told TOI, “Police did not add more sections despite the Army hospital’s medical report confirming the assault. We had informed the IG about our protest but he also didn’t take any action.” The FIR against the policemen concerned took five days to register after purported videos of the incident were circulated on social media. Eventually, eight cops — six constables and two SIs — were booked for voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful confinement, rioting and intentional insult. The two SIs were suspended by the SSP after initial investigation and a probe was ordered against circle officer Puranpur Lallan Singh, under whose jurisdiction this happened. A group of Army veterans led by Satish Chandra Mishra gave a memorandum to addressed to the chief minister to additional DGP, Bareilly zone, Avinash Chandra, demanding action against the policemen and dropping of the charges against Resham Singh. His counsel Sunita Gangwar told TOI, “The protest will continue until justice is served.” Additional DGP Chandra told TOI, “The representatives of Resham Singh met me and sought a magisterial enquiry in this case. I told them that the same can be ordered by the district magistrate or the commissioner and I can transfer their investigation to the police of any district of the zone. They also wanted to quash the FIR registered against Singh and five others but it is not possible until the investigation finds them innocent. I have assured them that the investigation in both cases will be transparent.” Chandra added, “We can include the medical report in the investigation after verifying the report from the hospital and recording the statement of the doctor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tortured-by-cops-retd-army-man-sits-on-dharna-against-shoddy-police-action/articleshow/83725434.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

At present, Jharkhand has 3,377 vaccination centres operational in 24 districts. Of them, 2,451 centres are for beneficiaries above 45 years and 926 for beneficiaries aged between 18-44 years. “With the Centre providing vaccines for all age groups, there is no need for separate vaccination centres. Hence, all the vaccination centres will be integrated so that all adult populations can be inoculated,” A Dodde, the nodal officer for vaccination procurement and logistics, said. On Monday, however, Ranchi had different centres for the separate age groups. Out of 96 vaccination centres in the district, 30 were reserved for beneficiaries aged below 45 years while 66 were for 45+ beneficiaries. Dodde said the ongoing mobile vaccination program in the state will be intensified to increase vaccine coverage. As of Sunday evening, 9.12 lakh people in the state were fully vaccinated while 48.7 lakh people had received their first doses. However, Jharkhand is trailing behind several states, which are inoculating over three lakh beneficiaries each day. “There was no difference in vaccination program compared to other days,” said a senior health official of Ranchi district. “We ran short of Covaxin doses in few of our session sites which hindered the administering of first doses,” he added. “We are due to get our share of vaccines for all age groups from the Center in July. Till then, we will be administering the doses from the stocks we have at present,” a senior official in the state health department said. The state is due to recieve 25 lakh doses for the drive next month. Notably, Jharkhand had paid Rs 21 crore to the vaccine manufacturers for procuring vaccines for beneficiaries aged between 18-44 years. When contacted to know the status of vaccine orders and the refunds if any, state health mission direction Ravishankar Shukla did not respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-separate-vax-session-sites-from-this-week-health-dept/articleshow/83731877.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Dr Mishra said, “I have ordered the chief medical officer (in-charge) of Poriyahat block to conduct the probe into the allegation levelled against an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) by the complainant.” The complainant, Bulbul Dutta, said after taking her first dose she was resting at the vaccination centre when an ANM called her again after 10 minutes and administered the second dose. She added that she informed the ANM that she had taken her first dose just a few minutes ago but she didn’t listen. “Despite repeatedly telling the ANM that I took the first dose just a few minutes ago, she paid no heed and administered the dose on my right hand,” she said while talking to reporters at the panchayat bhavan in Deodand village, the video of which went viral, triggering a backlash against health officials on social media. Dr Mishra, however, rejected the claim and said that such a lapse could not have occurred. He explained that as per the Covid vaccination protocol, the vaccine can only be administered on the left hand unless he/she has any problems on that hand. He said none of the 165 persons, who took the vaccine at that centre, supported the woman’s claims. He added that no other candidate was bearing the same name to turn up for the vaccine, which could suggest that the ANM may have called the name twice. “The woman should have refused the second dose if at all that incident took place at all. She should have raised an alarm. How is it be possible that no one saw this episode?” the civil surgeon said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/godda-woman-claims-getting-vax-twice-in-10-mins-probe-ordered/articleshow/83731772.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Imran said, “It was a photo-op which should be avoided by health workers as it doesn’t serve any purpose. We do not approve of this kind of adventurism. It is an instance of sheer misadventure and this woman health worker should have avoided it.” On Sunday, the photo of Manti Kumari with her toddler was carried by a few vernacular dailies, highlighting the plight of health workers. Imran said, “Burha river is a turbulent rain-fed river and one should be extra cautious while wading through it. In that photo, the woman was seen carrying a heavy bag, her baby, a vaccine carrier and her slippers. I have been told by health officials in that area that an alternative route to Tisiya was available. She could have taken that route.” He further said according to information provided by health officials, the woman health worker in question was not on any Covid duty at all. He said the woman also did not inform her seniors about hardships if any. “A picture has been made out to show the woman health worker was going through the rigour every day which is not true at all,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-worker-carrying-toddler-wading-through-river-a-photo-op/articleshow/83731310.cms||M F AHMED

Samples of 11 other big cats from the zoo have also tested negative. The reports of RT-PCR tests conducted on samples of the tiger, which was sent by the park management to the IVRI in Bareilly on June 4, have returned negative. Following the test reports, the Ranchi zoo management has upheld the Ranchi veterinary college’s autopsy report, which concluded that the tiger had died of liver and kidney ailments. Shiva’s samples were sent to IVRI as he had contracted a fever and lost his appetite before his death, prompting the park authorities to suspect a possible Covid-19 infection. The park management had also collected nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples of 11 more big cats, which included six tigers, three lions, one leopard and one black panther and sent them to IVRI for Covid-19 RT-PCR tests. All the big cats also tested negative for Covid-19. Talking to TOI, the park’s vet, Dr O P Sahu, said, “We are being vigilant. Cage keepers have been directed to go close to the animals only after wearing N95 masks and gloves. The enclosures are being sprayed with anti-viral drugs every day. The diet of all carnivores are being monitored and they are being served semi-boiled meat to avoid any chances of infection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-zoo-tiger-did-not-die-of-covid-says-test-report/articleshow/83728701.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: GA criticizes Centre for refusal to give ex-gratia relief to Covid-19 victims’ kin||RANCHI: A day after the Centre submitted an affidavit to Supreme Court expressing its inability to provide ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh to Covid-19 victims, the ruling parties in Jharkhand accused the Narendra Modi-led government of running away from its responsibility after failing to provide proper medical facilities because of its shoddy Covid management. JMM, the leading partner in the ruling coalition, has dubbed it as a vada-khilafi (running away from promise) by PM. JMM’s general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, “It has been the USP of the Modi government to first make a chest thumping promise and then run away from fulfilling it. If it can’t provide an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh to those who died, why did it promise so during the Bihar election?” He demanded the Union government to come clean on Covid funding and the PM CARES Fund. “The Centre now says it doesn’t have money for ex-gratia. So let it reveal how much money it received under the PM Cares Fund and other coffers and table details of the expenses incurred under its budgetary provision of Rs 35,000 crore allocated for Covid fight,” he said. He added, “Even with vaccination too, the Centre first made tall promises to gain mileage during the assembly polls in other states and later ran away from giving free vaccines. Only after states opposed it and exposed its wrongdoings, he was forced to do a u-turn. Even now, it has allocated 25% to private hospitals, which exposes that this government is only focused on minting money.” The new vaccination policy, which came into effect on Monday, does not require the states to scout for vaccines on their own. The Centre will provide free vaccines to all age groups, a move which came after severe criticism from different quarters, including JMM and its ally Congress. Both parties had dubbed the Union government’s earlier vaccination policy as a threat to the concept of federalism, citing arbitrary decisions allegedly taken by it without consulting elected governments in the states. The ruling regime is now also demanding reimbursement of the money it had incurred till date in procuring vaccines for the 18+ group. A few days ago state finance minister Rameshwar Oraon had said, “The Centre must reimburse the money we had spent on buying the vaccines.” Meanwhile, speaking on the issue of ex-gratia payment, Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey said, “When it comes to taking credit, PM and his team never miss any occasion even when they have no role to play in it but when it comes to taking onus and they will always be missing in action. It is unfortunate that the Centre is shying away from owning up to its responsibility during a crisis like this by not giving Rs 4 lakh to kin of the deceased. The surge in fatalities during the second wave was solely due to the poor mismanagement of the Centre.” Another party spokesperson, Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo, mocked the Modi regime for its ‘misplaced priorities’. “They don’t have the money to compensate kin of deceased but can splurge in building lavish buildings like the Central Vista amid the pandemic. It exposes Centre’s misplaced priorities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ga-criticizes-centre-for-refusal-to-give-ex-gratia-relief-to-covid-19-victims-kin/articleshow/83728543.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Delta variant emerges as predominant strain in five Jharkhand districts||RANCHI: The genome sequencing of samples of Covid-19 patients in Jharkhand has shown the prevalence of Delta variant of the virus in Jharkhand, the state department of health, medical education and family welfare said on Monday. “A total of 364 samples, collected from Covid patients from Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribag and Palamu, were sent to Bhubaneswar’s Institute of Life Sciences laboratories. Of them, Delta variants (B.1.617, B.1.617.2 & B.1.617.3) were found in 204 samples,” Siddharth Tripathy, nodal officer of the health department’s IEC wing, said. As many as 63 samples have shown prevalence of Kappa variant (B.1.617.1) while 29 samples have shown the prevalence of Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the Delta variant was first detected in India in October last year, along with the Kappa variant. The Alpha variant was detected first at Kent in the United Kingdom in September last year. WHO had classified Delta and Alpha variants as variants of concern. While Alpha variant spreads more rapidly, the delta variant transmits rapidly and is somewhat resistant, the WHO had claimed. While Tripathy did not mention when the samples were collected, the samples which were sent were of the infected people who had tested positive between January 1 and March 23 of this year. The department on Monday claimed that the week between April 29 and May 5 was the deadliest in the state with 951 people succumbing to the infection. “Between April 22 and April 28, the state had the highest infections in one week as over 44,133 people had tested positive in those seven days,” Tripathy claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/delta-variant-emerges-as-predominant-strain-in-five-jharkhand-dists/articleshow/83731937.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Chanchala, the daughter of a small-time farmer, Narendra Nath Pahan, in Ranchi’s Hotwar village, achieved the feat on Monday after trials in Delhi. Talking to TOI over the phone, an elated Chanchala said, “I will be the first from my family to go to any foreign country. I am happy to represent my country in the global arena.” She furthers said fighting to ward off Covid-19 and the lockdowns which stalled sporting activities, have been very tough for her. “Due to the lockdown last year, JSSPS was shut and all players were sent home. While at home, it was difficult to continue practice alone as there was no partner available. Moreover, I had no mat for practice and proper food was also an issue because of our poverty. But gradually, JSSPS officials and my coaches supported me and helped me get into form,” said Chanchala, who is the third among four siblings. Chanchala will represent the country in the 40kg sub-junior category. “She will be the lone athlete to represent the country in this category,” said coach Bablu Kumar, who is currently with her in Delhi. According to Kumar, Chanchala got a breakthrough in her career when the Sports Authority of India (SAI) Lucknow called her for the India camp in October last year to train with other cadets. “She got exposure there and learnt new and better skills. In January this year, she again returned to her native place due to the lockdown but JSSPS provided tablets to all its cadets through which we continued to provide online training,” he said. Jharkhand State Wrestling Association president Bholanath Singh said before her selection for the world championship, Chanchala has brought laurels for the state by winning medals in various national wrestling events. “She clinched silver in the SGFI national meet in 2017-18, successive golds in SGFI meets in 2018-19, 19-20 and bronze in the 2020-21 sub-junior national meet. It’s a proud moment for us today,” Singh said. The JSSPS is a joint venture between the Central Coalfields Limited and the Jharkhand government to train budding players across different disciplines at the mega sports complex in Hotwar. CCL director (personnel) Vinay Ranjan congratulated Chanchala on her achievement and said, “We are hopeful that she will win a medal at the international arena.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tribal-girl-from-state-qualifies-for-world-wrestling-cship/articleshow/83728474.cms||ASRP Mukesh

There are over 4,000 panchayats in the state. Alam said, “The panchayat polls are overdue as we couldn’t hold it in December last year because of the pandemic. In January this year, the state government gave a six-month extension to the panchayat bodies to keep them operational. But with the second wave of Covid-19, we cannot hold the election this time, too. As per the rules of the Panchayati Raj Act, there is no provision to provide another extension. Therefore, we are considering to provide another extension through a special ordinance.” The current six-months extension to the panchayat bodies will expire on July 15 before which the state government has to bring in the ordinance. Sources said the issue is likely to be taken up in the next cabinet meeting slated to be held in the next few days. Alam said if all goes well, the government is eyeing to hold the election by the year-end and the groundwork has been initiated. “Works like delimitation and preparation of the voter lists among others are already underway by the state election commission,” he said. Earlier this month, Alam held a meeting with his departmental officials to explore possibilities of holding the panchayat polls and directed the authorities concerned to prepare an alternative road map to keep panchayat bodies operational. “The government is putting in all efforts to keep the panchayat bodies operational so that ongoing development work at the grassroots is not hampered,” Alam added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-to-extend-tenure-of-panchayats-alam/articleshow/83728200.cms||---
---||Nagpur||MahaMetro’s Neo plan to save Rs 2,000 crore for Warangal||NAGPUR: After planning country’s first MetroNeo project for Nashik, the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd, known as MahaMetro, has added yet another feather in its cap by providing design based on the innovative concept to Warangal city in Telangana. Thanks to the cost-effective plan prepared by the MahaMetro, Kakatiya Urban Development Authority (KUDA), planning authority for contiguous cities of Warangal, Hanamkonda and Kazipet and adjoining areas, will save Rs2,000 crore. According to MahaMetro officials, KUDA had asked the agency to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) some months back and it was prepared by a team led by MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit in just five months. As per the DPR, length of Warangal MetroNeo will be 15km and it will be built at a cost of about Rs1,000 crore. The cost per km of this project is Rs60 crore, against Rs180 crore per km of traditional heavy Metros. Explaining how the agency managed to save Rs2,000 crore, the officials said, “MetroNeo technology uses electric trolley buses. Like traditional Metros, there are overhead electric (OHE) lines, but these buses run on cement roads instead of tracks. Apart from this, we have done cost optimization in Warangal Metro through various initiatives. The Metro will be at-grade wherever road width is sufficient. The at-grade section is 7km long, while elevated section is 8km.” Apart from this, automatic fare collection (AFC) system has been replaced by ticket vending machines and random ticket checking. “Only one-third of the platform will be covered by sheds, which will save construction and lighting cost. Solar panels will be mounted atop the stations to save electricity consumption and thus reduce operational expenditure. Also, Warangal Metro’s manpower requirement will be just 15 persons per km, instead of 35 per km of traditional Metros,” said officials. Currently, population of Warangal, Hanamkonda and Kazipet cities is 20 lakh. It is expected to increase to 36 lakh in 2041. The peak hour per direction traffic (PHPDT) in 2041 is expected to be 8,000. “Traditional Metro would not have been feasible here and hence we decided to go in for MetroNeo,” said Dixit. Warangal Metro will connect Kazipet railway station with Warangal station via Hanamkonda. The Warangal Metro buses will be 18-metre-long and will have carrying capacity of 200 passengers. The number of stations is 21 with station spacing at 600 to 700 metres. The road width used for Up and Down lines is 7.5 metres and 11.5 metres where stations will be built. KUDA has already submitted the DPR to the government of Telangana and the same is expected to be sent to government of India soon for approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahametros-neo-plan-to-save-rs2k-cr-for-warangal/articleshow/83731005.cms||Manka Behl
---||India||Covid: Govt allows import of used critical care gear||NEW DELHI: Scarcity of critical care medical equipment has forced India to allow entry of imported used life-saving equipment for re-use due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation even as it falls under the prohibited category as 'hazardous waste'. Considering possible use of such equipment during the pandemic, the environment ministry has given "one-time permission" to allow such used critical care equipment for re-use. The ministry in its order said, "In view of the prevailing Covid situation in the country and possible use of these equipment in the ongoing pandemic, the ministry has decided to allow one-time permission for import of used critical care medical equipment for re-use that have been already imported and are lying at different ports/airports as on June 8." "Such equipment is covered under Annex-9 of the Basel Convention due to the possibility of hazardous content and requires prior informed consent. So, it is critically important to monitor its usage and also track its end-of-life disposal," said Satish Sinha, associate director, Toxics Link. Issuing an office memorandum last week, the ministry also referred to pending requests before courts for relaxation of the provision of Schedule VI of the Hazardous and Other Wastes Rules 2016 which prohibits import of "used critical care medical equipment for re-use" under the Basel Convention. India is one of the signatories of the UN Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal which was adopted in March, 1989 in Basel, Switzerland. The Convention had entered into force in May, 1992.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-govt-allows-import-of-used-critical-care-gear/articleshow/83734473.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The driver and cleaner are in police custody. Acting on a tip off, the police teams laid a trap on Bori-Tuljapur Highway and intercepted the vehicle carrying the banned items being smuggled into the state from the neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Later, another team raided a godown and retail shop at Shastri Nagar in Arni tehsil and seized more materials. The police registered offence against the driver Arif Rauf Bailim (29), cleaner Aatish Kodape (23), and traders Sheikh Maheboob Sadique (34) and Sheikh Salim Sk Gafoor (38), all residents of Shastri Nagar, and arrested them.

---||India||Ex gratia for kin of Covid dead not off table: Centre||NEW DELHI: The Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that it has prioritised using its financial resources for investment in health infrastructure, giving succour to migrant workers and marginalised sections of society and providing stimulus to the economy over giving one time ex gratia to the families of Covid-19 victims. However, solicitor general Tushar Mehta also informed the SC that the option of ex gratia has not been taken off the table and the government is still debating the amount that could be paid uniformly to families of all Covid-19 victims. "Some scheme for ex gratia for all Covid victims is under consideration," he said. Mehta told a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah, "It is not the case of the Centre that it does not have funds to pay ex gratia to Covid victims, but it is felt that it would be better to utilise the money to ensure better health infrastructure, food, universal vaccination and stimulus for the economy. The Centre has prioritised mitigation of difficulties of the country at large and investing in reconstruction of economy and other activities rather than one-time monetary compensation." The Centre's affidavit had said the Centre and states, whose financial resources were overstretched in fighting the pandemic, could ill-afford payment of Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to families of Covid-19 victims. The Centre said, "Utilisation of scarce resources for giving ex gratia may have the unfortunate consequences of affecting the pandemic response and health expenditure and hence cause more damage than good. It is an unfortunate but important fact that the resources of governments have limits and any additional burden through ex gratia will reduce the funds available for other health and welfare schemes." The Centre further stre- ssed, "If the entire SDRF funds get consumed on ex gratia for Covid-19 victims, states may not have sufficient funds for organising Covid-19 response, for provision of various essential medical and other supplies, or to take care of other disasters like cyclones, floods etc." Before reserving the judgment on two petitions seeking payment of Rs 4 lakh compensation to disaster victims as per the 2015 notification, which was discontinued in 2020, Justices Bhushan and Shah asked the SG whether there could be a uniform policy for compensation to Covid-19 victims across states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ex-gratia-for-kin-of-covid-dead-not-off-table-centre/articleshow/83734526.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The fresh notice was sent on Monday. Ghaziabad cops warn Twitter MD against ‘obstruction of probe’The fresh notice was sent in response to Twitter India MD Maheshwari’s offer to join the probe through a video call, directs him to be present at the Loni border police station on Thursday (June 24). “We received a plea from the MD of Twitter India in response to the notice that we had issued to him last week under Section 166 of the CrPC. Maheshwari expressed his desire to join the probe via video conference, which has been rejected,” SP (rural) Iraj Raja told TOI. “In the second notice, he has been asked to be present at the Loni border police station on June 24 at 10.30am,” added Raja. The second notice has been issued Section 41A of the CrPC while the first, on June 17, was sent under Section 166. A notice under section 41A is issued in cases where the arrest of a person is not required and against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists of a cognisable offence. Monday’s notice says that despite Ghaziabad police putting out a tweet through its official handle apprising Twitter that the video in question in the assault case was “fake”, Twitter had failed to take action. It adds that in case the Twitter India MD fails to appear at Loni border police station at the specified time, it would be seen as “an attempt to obstruct the ongoing investigation”. An FIR was filed into the attack on Samad on June 7, but last week, police registered two more cases – one against Twitter, a news portal and six other individuals for sharing the video in which Samad claims he was the target of a hate crime and another against a local SP functionary Ummed Phelwan Idris for allegedly hosting a “provocative” Facebook live session with Samad by his side. Idris was arrested last Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/no-video-call-come-to-ps-ghaziabad-cops-to-twitter-md/articleshow/83734531.cms||Abhijay Jha

Hundreds, if not thousands, have reached out in different ways to lend a helping hand to those infected, be it setting-up of quarantine and testing centres, or providing transportation and food, not only to the sick, but also to their families. One such group, the ‘Cavelossim Covid Warriors’ (CCW), has recently initiated a ‘Life after Covid’ campaign which aims to help those who have recovered from the virus to get their lives back on track. The first seminar titled ‘Life after Covid’ was organised on June 12. Dr Ira Almeida instructed the patients on the importance of daily physical exercises, diet, sleep, emotional health care, spiritual care, social interaction and psychological balance. “The seminar is an excellent initiative to recognise and address post Covid issues, especially those related to the mental health of patients,” Almeida said. She also urged the public to get themselves vaccinated and to continue maintaining Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Lisma Barneto, the nurse in-charge of the casualty ward at the South Goa district hospital, urged the participants to follow only authentic sources for information and not fall victim to rumours while dealing with the uncertainty of the prevailing situation. She said that the suffering endured by patients and their families have left psychological and emotional scars on patients and their families and the CCW had identified this problem and decided to show them the way forward through lectures and seminars. CCW member Roosevelt Rodrigues thanks everyone for the fortunate outpouring of support, right from the villagers to businessmen who have contributed funds and food, to the owner of a star hotel that has so far provided 500 meals free of cost, “There was no dearth of volunteers as many villagers wanted to contribute in the own way,” he said. Another CCW member, Bosco Rodrigues, said that family members of patients have informed them that after the first lecture, patients have spoken about feeling better and even having good sleep. CCW was formed on May 5, during the peak of the second wave. “Our services range from ambulance service for ferrying suspected patients for testing or hospitalisation or other routine tests, organising Covid kits, supplying food packets to patients and routinely keeping in touch with patients to boost their morale,” said the group’s convenor, Dixon Vaz. The second seminar was held on June 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-cavelossim-unique-seminar-campaign-helps-covid-19-victims-get-life-back-on-track/articleshow/83729335.cms||Nisser Dias

Isaan Mishra (39) calls it a “cost-effective solution” to the ever-growing need of the fuel in commercial transport sectors as well as in local industries, hospitals, civic bodies, fisheries, mining and agriculture sectors to run heavy machineries and generators. Mishra has bought one BPCL petrol pump from Pune-based Repos Energy for the business run under the brand, Mobilfuels, headquartered at Park Street in Kolkata. Asked why his business, launched recently in Bengal, is restricted to diesel only, Mishra told TOI: “Petrol, being a highly inflammable petroleum product, is not permissible for doorstep delivery. We are set to come up with 15 mobile pumps across Bengal and also targeting to expand the business in neighbouring states through partnerships.” However, the owners of private cars cannot reap the benefits of such doorstep delivery business, the consumer base of which is from commercial sectors and housing complexes in urban areas. “The petroleum ministry and oil marketing companies have not yet allowed it. About 85% of the diesel requirement in India stems from the commercial sectors. We are also reaching out to housing complexes using generator sets,” said Mishra. To avail of the service, consumers will not have to pay any extra for the doorstep delivery other than the current price of diesel. They can book a slot for delivery of the fuel on the website of Mobilfuel or order over phone. “We have just launched the business but to out astonishment, we are having an overwhelming demand daily,” he signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/city-based-entrepreneur-unveils-doorstep-diesel-delivery/articleshow/83729305.cms||Sarthak.G

The petitioners told the court that the state government on June 6 permitted that RAT also be valid in addition to RT-PCR/TruNat tests for entering into the state. Advocate Akaash Rebello, representing one of the petitioners, argued that RAT could be used only in particular situations — for those who come in without a test or for those who travel in and out of the state on a daily basis — on the basis of some protocol, but not for everybody as the test has a much lower accuracy. At the peak it was understandable as labs were under tremendous strain, but now numbers have fallen, he stated. Advocate Nigel Costa Frias stated that for international travel all airlines always ask for RT-PCR. The bench stated that the expert committee constituted by the government, which has a fair representation of experts in the field, should decide and take a call. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that during the peak there was a spike in cases all over the country and RT-PCR was being asked for at that time. At this stage, when the situation is better, why should the state insist on it, he asked. The bench said that if the expert committee, in view of the impending third wave, decides that stricter measures be taken and RT-PCR be insisted upon, then the state government “should consider their views”. The state submitted to the high court that RAT reports are also approved by the ICMR in addition to RT-PCR and added that the requirements of RAT reports do not violate the HC order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expert-panel-must-decide-on-test-type-at-border-hc/articleshow/83729354.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Like Covaxin, the second dose will be given to the eligible servitors 28 days after their first one. The government has made it mandatory for all those. including police and government officers, who will conduct the Rath Yatra to furnish certificates of being fully vaccinated as well as RT-PCR negative reports as a prerequisite to taking part in the state's biggest 1 festival. With Rath Yatra fast approaching. not many servitors would have met the double dose yardstick because of the 84-day interval period. Recently, the Puri district collector Samarth Verma proposed to the state government to allow the second dose of Covishield vaccine for the servitors before the prescribed 84-day gap. The government relaxed the restriction and permitted the administration of second dose of Covishield to the servitors and other temple staff. "The time gap between the first and second dose has been reduced to 28 days. The second dose vaccination for the eligible servitors and temple staff started today (Monday)," SJTAs administrator (development) Ajay Kumar Jena told TOI. According to the government advice, the temple administration would secure written undertakings from the servitors and the staff. "We have given them forms in which they would give a written undertaking mentioning the necessity of getting the second dose before the schedule in view of the ensuing Rath Yatra,"Jena said. At present, the government administers the second dose of Covishield before the prescribed time gap (after 28 days. but before 84 days) only to those people, who intend to undertake international travel for specific purposes. Students, who are scheduled to pursue their studies in foreign countries, persons working abroad and athletes, sportspersons and the accompanying staff of the Indian contingent for the Tokyo Olympics are currently eligible for the second jabs before the prescribed time interval. More than 80% of the servitors' community have already taken their first dose of Covishield. Out of the 4,300 targeted beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group, at least 3,622 servitors (84.23%) have received the first dose so far. In the 45+ age group. 3,158 servitors of the targeted population of 3,900 have already received their first jabs, which comes to around 80.97%. Since the gap between the administration of the first and the second doses was at least 84 days, only 1,045 servitors from the target population of 3,900 in the 45+ category could be given the booster shots. Not a single servitor in the 18-44 age group could earlier become eligible for the second dose as their vaccination had started only on May 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/rath-yatra-days-away-second-dose-for-puri-jagannath-temple-servitors-begins-in-odisha/articleshow/83734506.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Advocate general Devidas Pangam added that there have been instances of late reporting of Covid-19 deaths by private hospitals where show cause notices, under the Public Health Act, have been issued. Advocate Nikhil Pai, representing the South Goa Advocate’s Association, told the court that other states like Bihar and Rajasthan are initiating death audits and that this could be done with the help of healthcare professionals and statisticians. This, he said, will provide valuable information and solutions to professionals and bureaucrats dealing with the impending third wave. Pangam said the situation in Goa cannot be compared to that of Bihar and added that records are maintained very well by the public health department everyday and put in the public domain. He added that there is no instance of under-reporting, but only late reporting by private hospitals. “We have the maximum number of reporting. We have not hidden anything,” Pangam stated, adding that even in cases where a person had all other problems and is an alcoholic and tested positive, it has been included as Covid deaths and none are missed out. Pai pressed for an independent inquiry into oxygen shortage-related deaths and compensation for them at GMC, but the bench stated that if the matter is decided, then relatives could say they were not adequately represented or that they had witnesses they could have produced and that these are individual decisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/negligible-scope-of-covid-deaths-being-unreported-state/articleshow/83729364.cms||---

Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the HC that assessment was made based on the experience during the peak of the second wave and the number of beds in each hospital, and it was found that this is sufficient if at all a third wave should hit. The state submitted that it has buffer oxygen of 40KL besides various LMO oxygen tanks set up and PSA plants installed, which will cater to demands during a third wave. Pangam said a buffer tank is available at Binani Industrieswith 40KL stock. He stated that allocation of oxygen is done by the central government. The production is done by certain private companies and transported from time to time. The petitioners offered calculations and stated that the buffer stock isn’t sufficient, but the HC observed that it is not for the court to make calculations and asked that the expert committee expound on this. The division bench asked the government whether it got the nod from the expert committee. “We are open, we are continually monitoring and in case requirement enhancement for more stock is required to be brought…we will place this before expert committee…and if they suggest more oxygen or more stock we will request central government for more supply,” Pangam told the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oxygen-tank-plants-buffer-stock-sufficient-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/83729366.cms||---

Recovery was at 96%, while case positivity rate was steady at 8%. With seven deaths, the toll inched closer to the 3,000-mark. Two of the deceased were below 50 years of age. A 43-year-old from Maharashtra, who had no comorbidities, and a 45-year-old from Parse, who had chronic kidney disease, died after over two weeks of treatment. A 59-year-old man from Jose de Areal, who had a recent history of severe Covid pneumonia, and had developed post Covid fibrosis, died at the South Goa district hospital.

---||Goa||Goa: ‘42% population has got at least one dose of vaccine’||PANAJI: A total of 42% of Goa’s population has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, the state government submitted to the high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that the response from the 18-44 age group has been overwhelming and that vaccination is taking place at a rapid pace. However, there is still a poor response from the older age group that is still reluctant to take the vaccine, he stated. The government said vaccination is being undertaken at 40 permanent centres across the state and 195 satellite centres, which have been identified by local representatives and elected members in coordination with health officers and collectors. “The response to the vaccination drive is good and on an average, over 17,000 persons have been vaccinated since the last three days of the Tika Utsav,” the state government told the high court. Regarding a request made by a petitioner to have door-to-door vaccinations, the state government submitted that vaccinations are being undertaken at old age homes where groups of seniors have been vaccinated. In addition to this, near home vaccinations, through multiple Tika Utsavs, is under way from June 13. “Door-to-door vaccination is presently not provided for in the SOPs of the ministry of health and family welfare, considering risk of AEFIs and vaccine wastage. However, the government is considering reaching out to this above-mentioned population by prior registration of beneficiaries,” the state government submitted to the high court. Pangam stated that door-to-door vaccination is prima facie difficult as one has to be monitored for half an hour after vaccination. He suggested that some transportation arrangements and time slots could be fixed or a special vaccination camp arranged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/42-population-has-got-at-least-one-dose-of-vaccine/articleshow/83729426.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||NIN to commence sero survey in Telangana from today||HYDERABAD: With the second wave of Covid-19 gradually on the wane and epidemiologists presuming a third wave in the near future, the city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) is embarking on the major task of collecting data in parts of Telangana to find out the spread of the novel coronavirus. The serosurveillance survey by the NIN in association with the government of Telangana will begin on June 22 covering three districts – Jangaon, Kamareddy and Nalgonda. The survey will go on for three to four days and will provide health planners with the crucial data on the number of people affected by Covid-19 in these districts. Since many cases do not have symptoms, they mostly go unreported. Serosurveillance is one of the methods to find out the quantum of the spread of the pandemic virus thus far in the countryside in Telangana. This is the fourth round of serosurveillance studies. Earlier, the NIN had conducted three such surveys in these parts of the state. NIN director Hemalatha R said: “The population-based sero-epidemiological studies will help us determine the burden of Covid-19 infection at the community level.” The present study is in continuation of the earlier three rounds conducted in these districts in May, August and December 2020. It will include all age groups like in the previous three phases — 10-17-year adolescents and above 18-year adults and healthcare workers. However, 6-9 year old children are also being included for the first time. Dr A Laxmaiah, head of NIN public health division, said as part of the survey about 400 people will be covered from 10 villages from each of the three districts. “About 100 healthcare workers from district hospitals, community health centres will also be covered,” Dr Laxmaiah said. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody-based sero-positivity indicates the extent of spread in general population. This will help monitor the trends of transmission of the novel coronavirus infection in the general population and frontline workers, thus forming the basis for strengthening control measures for the impending spike in numbers, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nin-to-commence-sero-survey-in-state-from-today/articleshow/83730175.cms||Syed Akbar

The tall building, modelled on Canada’s health care facilities, will be the centrepiece of a 200-acre integrated health centre to come up in Warangal, the second biggest city in the state. “Warangal should be developed as an education, industrial hub and the best medical centre, even people in Hyderabad should be jealous about it,” chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said after inaugurating the integrated collectorate complex at Hanamkonda on Monday. He also said the government has decided to rechristen Warangal Urban as Hanamkonda and Warangal Rural as Warangal. “I heard Canada has best health care facilities in the world. Our health department, roads and buildings (R&B) officials and R&B minister should immediately visit Canada and get videos and pictures of the medical facilities and replicate the same in Warangal hospital such as air ambulances, helipad on terrace and ICU facilities on upper floors, etc.,,” KCR said adding the government was ready to spend Rs 2,000-Rs 3,000 crore for the hub. He said there has been haphazard development in Hyderabad and it was crowded. “Why should people come to Hyderabad for every medical requirement. Warangal has a railway junction, bypass road, highways and Mamnoor airport (upcoming) and is being developed as an IT and investments hub. It should be developed as medical hub too,” the CM said. During his whirlwind tour of Warangal, the CM laid foundation for the 33-floor super-speciality hospital on the premises of old jail complex. He said the present MGM Hospital should be dismantled to make way for a new building, which would have mother and children care wings. KCR wanted the officials to develop a health complex by combining the premises of the proposed Rs 57 crore multi-super speciality hospital along with the Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences, Kakatiya Medical College, MGM Hospital and other health facilities spread over 200 acres in the heart of Warangal city, to offer all health services to the people and east Telangana. He also announced a dental hospital, dental college and veterinary hospital for Warangal. Taking potshots at people criticising shifting of Warangal jail and constructing a new super-speciality hospital, he said “What would I gain if the jail is bulldozed, it is being used for a public cause and nothing wrong in shifting jail five kms away from the city.” . Directing the officials to complete the proposed hospital within one-and-half years, KCR said he had read that a 10-floor building was constructed within 28 hours in China. “I don’t mind a Chinese national or firm to complete the hospital in the quickest possible time,” he said. KCR announced that Warangal Urban district has been renamed as Hanamkonda district and Warangal Rural as Warangal district. He said orders changing the names of the districts would be issued in two to three days. The CM instructed the officials to use the newly inaugurated integrated collectorate complex of Warangal Urban district, located in Hanamkonda, for the new district of Hanamkonda and construct a new collectorate complex for Warangal district in Azam Jahi Mills area in Warangal. The CM said the government was developing Warangal on eastern front, Siddipet on northern, Nalgonda on southern and Nizamabad on western front. KCR said the state government was going ahead with administrative reforms and constructing new collectorate complexes in the state. He hinted the government would change the name of ‘collector’, which was coined as they were collecting cess during the Nizam era. Saying Dharani web portal was a huge success, he said as many as six lakh agriculture properties were registered through Dharani portal till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/warangal-to-get-33-storied-hospital-to-tower-over-hyd/articleshow/83733350.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Rs 19.5 crore heroin haul at RGIA, Tanzanian held||HYDERABAD: Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Monday seized three kg of heroin worth Rs 19.5 crore from Hyderabad airport and said a kingpin sitting in India is controlling the contraband trade across the country involving foreign nationals. DRI sleuths arrested an African peddler from Johannesburg on Monday morning and said a similar seizure by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Kochi on June 19, where 2.9 kg heroin was seized from a Zimbabwean woman who came from Johannesburg, indicates a pattern. Acting on specific intelligence input, DRI team arrested John Williams of Tanzania, when he arrived at RGI Airport from Johannesburg via Doha and found the high-value contraband concealed in his trolley bag beneath the padding at the bottom. In early June, DRI team had seized 12 kg of heroin from two women peddlers who came from Uganda and Zambia. “The heroin seized on Monday was also in off-white colour like what we got from the two women peddlers who were arrested earlier this month. Williams was also supposed to hand over the heroin to his associate in the city and leave India after a few days,” said a DRI official. DRI registered a case against the peddler under NDPS Act 1985, and will be produced before court for judicial remand. “The contraband was handed over to the peddler at Johannesburg by a Nigerian living in South Africa. The destination was Delhi and via Doha, Kochi and Bangalore,” said an NCB official. They claim to have identified an unusual pattern of trafficking of heroin produced in South West Asian countries. Traditionally, heroin from the golden crescent (Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan border area) was pushed into Indian territory through land borders with Pakistan, especially through Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir. Due to increased vigil at the border and crackdown by NCB and Coast Guard on the high waters of Arabian sea, peddlers are moving heroin into India via Africa by air as it is not a traditional route for heroin trafficking which would be under the watch of enforcement agencies. “However, detecting this trend early, we have put early identification and interception mechanism in place,” NCB Chennai Zone director Amit Ghawate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-19-5cr-heroin-haul-at-rgia-tanzanian-held/articleshow/83733403.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Hyderabad||National Highways Authority of India eyes elephant reserve land for road||HYDERABAD: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has proposed to divert 60 hectares of reserve forest land in Rayala Elephant Reserve (RER) in the Eastern Ghats for construction of phase 2 of Bengaluru-Chennai expressway. It sent a proposal to the ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) in this regard. The proposed highway project involves a greenfield four-lane expressway at an estimated cost of Rs 4,121 crore to facilitate high-speed travel. The highway passes through Palamaner in AP’s Chittoor district. Wildlife activists say this will not only displace elephants but also lead to man-animal conflict. According to NHAI Tirupati project director Sujeet Kumar, only 6.8 km passes through Palamaner reserve forest, which is part of RER. Sujeet told TOI that this is a greenfield alignment expressway project. “We have proposed elephant underpasses as part of the project and are waiting for the MoEF’s observations. The project was planned back in 2009. We have applied for forest, environment and wildlife clearances,” he said. The project section of Bengaluru-Chennai expressway phase 2 passes from 86 km mark to 135 km point within the eco-sensitive zone of Kaundinya Wildlife Sanctuary. Sujeet said: “If the project passes outside of the forest, it is not viable. Currently, the expressway passes through the edge of the forest. So, we have minimum impact on the forest and minimum hindrance to the wildlife.” However, wildlife consultant and former member of AP State Biodiversity Board Rajeev Mathew differed with the NHAI. He said the project would cause a massive man-animal conflict in the region. “Elephants will be restricted to one side of the reserve. The elephant underpasses may or may not work. In Uttarakhand, they had tried something similar but the tuskers are coming on to the expressway,” he said. While the NHAI said the project is aimed at reducing travel time between Chennai and Bengaluru and also spur industrial growth, Mathew said farmers will be impacted badly because of the project. “There may be other animals in the forest which will also be affected,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nhai-eyes-elephant-reserve-land-for-road/articleshow/83733410.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Chandigarh||Rahul Gandhi to meet group of Punjab MLAs, ministers for direct feedback||CHANDIGARH: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will meet a group of Punjab Congress MLAs, including some ministers, even as chief minister Amarinder Singh will hold a second round of talks with the AICC-appointed three-member panel on Tuesday amid the internal turmoil in the state unit. Sources said Rahul will meet at least 13 Punjab leaders, including six ministers and seven MLAs, to take direct feedback from them about the party’s state of affairs in Punjab. Some of these MLAs had approached Rahul’s office, apprehensive that the issue highlighted by them before the panel, including justice for sacrilege incidents and representation for OBCs and Dalits, had not been suitably factored in and the focus remained on the tussle between the CM and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, added the sources. Cabinet ministers Charanjit Singh Channi, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Razia Sultana, will meet Rahul in Delhi, the sources said. No representation of OBCs in cabinet, says group of MLAsTript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, besides MLAs Pargat Singh, Sangat Singh Giljian, Kuljit Singh Nagra, Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, Tarsem DC and Inderbir Singh Bolaria will meet Rahul in Delhi, the sources said. A group of MLAs also wish to highlight that while there are three ministers from the SC community in Punjab, there is no representation to the OBCs. Also, in terms of region-wise representation, there are 11 ministers from Malwa, 5 from Majha and only one from the Doaba region. Punjab has 31% BCs and 32.2% Dalits in terms of population. There is a demand that in case of a Cabinet reshuffle, more faces from the OBC community and Doaba region should be inducted. “We got calls from Delhi to come over for the meeting with Rahul. Some left for Delhi on Monday itself while others will join in on Tuesday. It will be an opportunity to make sure that issues apart from Sidhu are put before the high command,” said an MLA. Before the three-member Kharge panel was constituted, most of the Punjab Congress MLAs had approached Rahul’s office for an appointment to raise the issue of sacrilege and overall negative perception against the Congress government in the state. Rahul had also called about a dozen MLAs a day before the panel began its feedback sessions with each MLA and MP from the state. Meanwhile, Amarinder’s meeting would come two days after cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu went vocal to say that he is not after any position in the party. It is believed that the panel had recommended in its report that Sidhu be ‘suitably accommodated.’ Former MP JP Aggarwal, who is a member of the panel, confirmed that the committee will meet Amarinder on Tuesday. The chief minister is in Delhi to meet the committee for the second time in two weeks amid fears in party circles that the public verbal spat between Amarinder and Sidhu could affect the party’s prospects in the next Assembly elections due in early 2022. The panel had earlier taken one-on-one feedback from nearly 150 leaders from the state, including all 80 MLAs. It is believed that changes in the Cabinet and the party organisation are likely to be made in the coming days in line with the ‘grouses’ conveyed by the Punjab leaders. Rahul took feedback for ’22 polls: AujlaAmritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, who met Rahul Gandhi on Monday, said after the meeting that “Rahulji took inputs on how to put Congress in the most favourable position ahead of the next Assembly elections in 2022 and how to strengthen the organisation.” Reacting to Sidhu’s outburst, Aujla said he condemned the language used by Sidhu against the chief minister. “When the high command is holding meetings and a panel has been formed, such things should be avoided,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rahul-gandhi-to-meet-group-of-punjab-mlas-ministers-for-direct-feedback/articleshow/83734578.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||India||Put up posters thanking PM for vax drive: UGC||MUMBAI: The University Grants Commission (UGC) issued a letter to all government-funded universities and colleges on Sunday, asking them to display promotional banners and hoardings on the free vaccination drive launched for those aged above 18. The letter shared approved designs of the hoardings, carrying a message thanking PM Narendra Modi, in Hindi and English. The poster, with the PM's photo, reads: "Vaccines for all, free for all, world's largest free vaccination campaign, thank you, PM Modi." It further mentions that free vaccines were so far available only for people above 45 years of age, but from June 21, will be available for free at government centres, for everyone in the 18+ category. A government official said similar requests have been made to other public offices too, including railway stations, banks, hospitals, and research institutions. A railway official confirmed receiving a message. Delhi University (DU) put up the hoarding at its North and South campuses on Monday morning with both vice-chancellor PC Joshi and registrar Vikas Gupta getting their pictures clicked in front of it put up at Gate number 1 of North campus. "The vaccination drive by the government of India begins today and hence the hoarding has been put up," Joshi told TOI. Gupta denied that the poster was put up after a directive from the UGC. "We have put up the hoarding on our own. We didn't get any letters," he said. Jamia Millia Islamia registrar Nazim Jafri said, "We have received the letter and sent the hoarding for printing. We will put it up on our campus by Tuesday." Several centrally funded technical institutions too received similar messages on Sunday. An official from one of the institutes said they were asked to put up hoardings/banners provided by the I&B ministry in their institutions from Monday. While the UGC letter is for both central universities and colleges, several university-affiliated colleges in Maharashtra and Delhi said they didn't get the letter. "Vaccination drive has started in our college. But we don't know anything about any hoarding. If they send a letter, we will," said Ramjas College principal Manoj Khanna. Registrar of Mumbai University, Baliram Gaikwad, too, said no such letter had been received on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/put-up-posters-thanking-pm-for-vax-drive-ugc/articleshow/83734584.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Guwahati||Assam says no to further unlocking, says overall situation still precarious||GUWAHATI: The Assam government on Monday kept on hold further unlocking, citing that though the number of Covid-19 patients and test positivity rates are dipping in some districts, the overall situation in the state was "still precarious" and extended the existing restrictions from 5 am of Tuesday for an indefinite period. After a seven-week partial lockdown, the state cautiously initiated the unlocking process from last Monday with reduction in curfew timing by one hour in Guwahati, by four hours in eight districts where the situation is comparatively better than the rest and from 1 pm to 5 am in the remaining 24 districts. All the restrictions will continue in the same way, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority ordered on Monday.. "Whereas, the situation of Covid-19 in the state has been reviewed and observed that though the number of Covid-19 patients and positivity rate is declining in some districts. the overall situation is still precarious for which adequate containment measures for both urban and rural areas are still necessary for containment of Covid-19 across the state," the order of the ASDMA stated. Accordingly, curfew in Guwahati will continue to be in force from 2 pm to 5 am and from 5pm to 5 am in South Salmara, Majuli, Bongaigaon, Chirang, Udalguri, West Karbi Anglong, Dima Hasao and Charaideo - the eight districts where the number of cases are consistently dipping. On the other hand, the number of cases are maintaining an upward trend in as many as eight districts - Cachar, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sonitpur, Nagaon, Biswanath, Jorhat, Golaghat. Health minister Keshab Mahanta hinted that if the situation in these districts do not improve by next week, the government would be compelled to bring the hotspot areas in each of these districts under a complete lockdown. "The timing of curfew and opening of government and private offices/establishments, shops and commercial establishments, restaurants, dhabas and other eateries, restaurants operating within a hotel or resort and sale counters, showrooms, cold storages and warehouses in the districts will also remain same as the earlier order dated June 16, 2021," the ASDMA said. Other ban on inter-district movement, use of odd-even formula for plying of vehicles in urban areas, declaration of containment zones and exemptions notified on June 4 will also continue to remain in force, the ASDMA added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-says-no-to-further-unlocking-says-overall-situation-still-precarious/articleshow/83734588.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Amritsar||AAP’s Punjab CM-pick to be a Sikh, says Arvind Kejriwal||AMRITSAR: Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday that the party’s chief ministerial candidate in Punjab will be from the Sikh community and “of whom Punjab would be proud”. However, he did not make it clear whether the party’s CM-pick would be a Dalit or not. He also assured that if voted to power, AAP would ensure justice delivery in the sacrilege cases and punishment to the masterminds. Kejriwal was in Amritsar to induct former IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who was part of the SIT probing the 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident in Punjab, into AAP at an event along with state unit president and MP Bhagwant Mann and other leaders. Kejriwal doesn’t rule out possibility of alliance in state Punjab affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh, co-incharge Raghav Chadha and Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Punjab Assembly were also present at the induction function. Both Kunwar and Kejriwal heaped praise upon each other, with the former eulogizing Kejriwal for his Delhi model of governance and the latter taking credit for inducting “aam aadmi ka policewala” (common man’s policemen) into the party fold. He pointed out that neither he nor Kunwar or the AAP’s Punjab president Bhagwant Singh Maan came from political dynasties. “I was an officer, so was Kunwar, we are not here for doing politics, but for the welfare of people, Punjab, and the country,” he added. Kejriwal claimed that justice had not been delivered in the sacrilege case in Punjab despite Kunwar identifying the masterminds and, instead the whole system went against him, forcing him to resign. “Upon coming to power, AAP will finish the unfinished work of Kunwar,” he said. Projecting the AAP as a viable alternative, the Delhi CM, without naming any party or political leader, said that there was one party whose leaders were fighting for plum posts when the people of Punjab were expecting their elected representatives to take care of them, another party was facing very serious allegations of corruption and sacrilege and the third party leaders’ were being shooed away by the people from their localities. Continuing in a similar vein, he said, “You have given several chances to Congress, Akalis and BJP, but the people of Punjab need a change as they have seen the good governance in Delhi and want it to replicated in Punjab.” When asked whether Navjot Singh Sidhu would join AAP, he shot back: “Sidhu is a Congress party’s leader…we shouldn’t indulge in any loose talk about any leader”. In reply to a question about AAP’s possible alliance with any other political party in Punjab, Kejriwal said “If the situation demands so, we will tell you first.” Kunwar said that he was going to make a new start and that the land of Punjab had given him everything. Welcoming the former IPS officer’s entry into AAP, Bhagwant Mann said the joining of such an officer, who marks honesty and hard work, is a sign of a change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/aaps-punjab-cm-pick-to-be-a-sikh-says-arvind-kejriwal/articleshow/83734610.cms||---
---||Chennai||Nobel winner Esther Duflo, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Tamil Nadu economics council||CHENNAI: The M K Stalin-led DMK government on Monday unveiled its plans to set right Tamil Nadu economy and promote infrastructure in the state. The government’s highest priority was to provide clean administration and streamline public services. Right to Services Act would be enacted and Lokayukta would be revitalised to facilitate this, governor Banwarilal Purohit told the assembly on Monday. The government would initiate steps to roll out the third masterplan for Chennai Metropolitan Area by 2026. An ambitious Singara Chennai 2.0 would be launched to create modern technology-based infrastructure in the state capital, he said. Later in the evening, the government set up a five-member economic advisory council to advise the CM and listed out the terms of reference. The council, comprising Nobel laureate prof Esther Duflo, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, former economic advisor to the Union government Arvind Subramanian, prof Jean Dreze of Delhi School of Economics and former Union finance secretary S Narayan, is expected to help the government chart out a rapid and inclusive growth plan as the state witnessed slowdown in the economy in recent years. To start with, the government would release a white paper on the state’s finances in July. The focus of the state is to diversify the industrial base, both geographically and sector-wise. An expert committee of industrialists, banking and financial experts and officials would be set up to formulate schemes for revival of MSMEs, said Purohit. The government would take all necessary steps to help more industries set up base and create jobs in Tamil Nadu. The initiatives would promote industrially-backward northern districts, Chennai-Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor and Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, he said. Uninterrupted power supply to all sectors is a major promise from the DMK government. “Tangedco and Tantransco are facing severe financial crises due to mismanagement in recent years. A detailed strategic study of the finances and governance structure of Tangedco and Tantransco will be carried out,” Purohit said. The government has also proposed to speed up long-pending power infrastructure projects and give a thrust to renewable energy sector. A master plan to fully realize the state’s tourism would be unveiled this year, and a state level advisory committee would be set up for major Hindu temples to enhance facilities, Purohit said. The government has promised to hold local body polls once the intensity of the Covid wave subsides. As regards NEET, the government would pass a legislation scrapping the medical entrance test once Justice A K Rajan committee’s recommendations are in place. It would also take efforts to get consent from the President of India for the legislation. Another major promise is priority to native Tamils, who have studied in Tamil medium and government schools, in government jobs. “The requisite changes to undo past orders, which are contrary to this intent, will be undertaken at the earliest,” the governor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/nobel-winner-esther-duflo-former-rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-on-tamil-nadu-economics-council/articleshow/83734614.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Youth with 'Peter Pan Syndrome' gets bail in minor's sex assault case||MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court on Monday granted bail to a 23-year-old youth arrested on charges of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl whom he later "married". In his bail application, the accused's lawyer, Sunil Pandey, told the court the youth suffers from "Peter Pan Syndrome" -an inability to grow up or a person who has the body of an adult but the mind of a child. The court observed, "Prima facie, it seems the accused and the minor knew each other and were romantically involved... The family members of the victim were aware of their relationship. The applicant and the victim got married and lived together as husband and wife... It is further submitted that the applicant is suffering from Peter Pan Syndrome." Minor girl joined accused on her own, says judgePandey argued that the girl’s family knew about the relationship. “The victim’s family didn’t like their relationship due to the boy’s illness and poor background,” the lawyer said. The accused was arrested in April after the girl’s parents lodged a kidnapping complaint. The court order said, “Initially, the offence under Section 363 IPC (kidnapping) was registered against the applicant. After recording the statement of the victim, charges under Section 376 IPC (rape) and under Section 4 (penetrative sexual assault), Section 5 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault), Section 8 (sexual assault) and Section 12 (sexual harassment) of Pocso Act came to be added.’’ The order said, “Her statement prima facie shows that the victim herself left her parents’ house and joined the company of the accused.’’ The bail order by Special Judge S C Jadhav, after hearing special public prosecutor Veena Shelar who opposed the plea, said the girl “had sufficient knowledge and capacity to know the full import of what she was doing and has only thereafter voluntarily joined the applicant’’. The court noted he has “no criminal antecedents’’ and “no purpose would be served’’ to keep him in custody, especially since nothing is to be recovered from him. The defence submitted he suffers from Peter Pan Syndrome. The prosecutor said, “The victim is a minor. There is no material on record regarding the illness of the accused.” The court granted him bail on a bond of Rs 25,000 with one or two sureties and put several conditions, including making any inducement or promises to any person acquainted with facts of the case or commit a similar offence. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-youth-with-peter-pan-syndrome-gets-bail-in-minors-sex-assault-case/articleshow/83734615.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Visakhapatnam||5 lakh mothers vaccinated in Sunday’s special drive in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM:Visakhapatnam: Of the 13.72 lakh Covid vaccines administered in Andhra Pradesh on June 20, about 5 lakh mothers having kids aged less than five years were given the jabs. Special focus was laid on vaccinating young mothers during the special drive. The Covid-19 paediatric task force committee, in its recent report, recommended preferential vaccination to mothers as they may have to accompany their Covid-positive children during hospitalisation in the projected third wave. The decision was taken based on the assumption that the third wave may disproportionately affect kids. The government identified 18.7 lakh mothers falling into this category for inoculations and covered 10.3 lakh mothers as of Sunday. Vaccines were also administered to about 11,150 foreign education/employment aspirants. The central government allowed mass inoculation for 18-plus age group from May 1 under its ‘liberalised’ vaccination drive. But AP took permission from the Union health ministry to defer vaccination for the youth as it first wanted to conclude the ongoing drive for existing priority groups. Mothers with kids below 5 added to priority vax groupBut the state health department has recently added mothers and foreign travellers to the priority group at the recommendations of the task force committee. There are about 1.33 crore eligible vaccine beneficiaries aged 45 and above in AP, of which 83.7 lakh people have already got their first dose, while 20 lakh people are fully vaccinated. This translates to 63% vaccination coverage among the 45-plus age group. Health & family welfare principal secretary Anil Kumar Singhal said mothers with children less than five years old were added to the priority group as part of the government’s preparations for the anticipated third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/5-lakh-mothers-vaccinated-in-sundays-special-drive-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/83734609.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Poor show at 3-year-old plantation sites too||NAGPUR: After the dismal performance of 10-year-old plantations taken up by the forest department in 2008 on 124 sites in the state, another evaluation report on three-year-old plantations done during 2016 rains shows unsatisfactory performance. As per the Evaluation Report (512) released in May 2021, out of the 166 sites evaluated in 2018-19, 50% (83 plantations) have below 40% survival. This reflects the poor implementation of the programme, the report states. Out of total 1,704 plantations covering over 35,886 hectares, 166 units in 3,674 hectares (10%) have been evaluated in 11 circles – Nagpur (16), Chandrapur (8), Gadchiroli (6), Yavatmal (16), Amravati (5), Aurangabad (25), Dhule (19), Nashik (32), Thane (12), Pune (14), and Kolhapur (13). As per the report, of the 166 plantations, only 61 (37%) may be termed as successful as of today while 87 (52%) are partially successful and 18 (11%) are failed ones. Only 15 (9%) sites have survival over 66%, but the growth of seedlings even in some of these sites are poor. These plantations do not survive while they reach the 10th year. “It is true that the report points out inherent deficiencies and infirmities in implementation. It calls for introspection and need to re-examine the implementation of the flagship programme of the forestry sector and initiate reforms to attain greater success,” said SP Wadaskar, conservator of forests (Evaluation). Of the 166 sites, treatment maps were prepared for 145 showing planting area, nullahs, fire lines, inspection path etc. Of them, only 15 were up to the mark. In Nagpur Circle, no treatment map was prepared in all 16 evaluated units. Besides, only 50 measurement books, which show expenses incurred and details of work, were updated. Only 104 plantations contained signatures of RFOs and the rest 58 had no signatures. This shows that RFOs had made payments without checking the number of works. “This is negligence and disobedience of instructions by RFOs and ACFs in this important planning exercise in the plantation programme. This is certainly one of the main reasons behind the poor state of plantations,” the report said. Such malpractices provide ample scope for corruption and circumvents verification of executed works, stated the report which blamed senior officers for not taking any effort to rectify this irregularity even as this lacuna was pointed out in earlier consolidated reports also. Another flaw pointed out is the difference in the area. The total area of 166 plantations as per the record of forest divisions stands at 3,673 hectares, whereas the evaluation data shows it as 5,616 hectares. “This means plantation area is not demarcated properly. Besides, at 24 sites seedlings were planted under the existing trees or very close to the tree trunks. Also, 56 sites showed that plantations were near pathways having access to cattle and traffic,” the report said. Another aspect is that 85 (51%) partially successful plantations are likely to become a failure if proper care is not taken, including some salvage operations. The report stated that despite spending a huge sum, the expected results are not forthcoming repeatedly. This is a serious situation, which needs to be addressed with adequate attention, it said. EXPENDITURE ON PLANTATIONS * 156 sites (39,72,692 seedlings) * Rs32.43 crore invested * Expenses of 10 sites (2,84,048 seedlings) in Amravati, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Nashik, Pune & Yavatmal not included * 56 successful sites | Rs11.78 crore * 81 partially successful sites | Rs17.18 crore * 19 failed sites | Rs3.48 crore * Average expenditure per site | Rs20.79 lakh * Average expenditure per plant | Rs82||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poor-show-at-3-year-old-plantation-sites-too/articleshow/83730089.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The HC bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninaka Jayasurya, were hearing a petition filed by Anandaiah seeking permission for distribution of his eye drops, which he claims can cure Covid-19 and boost oxygen saturation. The court earlier gave permission for distribution of four other medicines distributed by Anandaiah and had directed the government to submit the sterility test report of the eye drops at the earliest. Special government pleader C Suman told the court that the five clinical examinations were conducted to find out the efficacy of the eye drop All five gave negative results, certifying that it was not safe for patients. He requested the court to give more time to submit a detailed report on the effectiveness of the eye drops. Countering Suman, Anandaiah’s counsel Aswani Kumar argued that SV ayurvedic medical college has certified that the eye drops are safe. The bench directed the state government to file an affidavit along with details of the clinical test reports and posted the next hearing of the case to July 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/anandaiahs-eye-drops-unsafe-andhra-pradesh-tells-high-court/articleshow/83734658.cms||Venu Lanka

K Thilagavathi, 30, of K V Kuppam in Vellore district, and her sisters K Bakialakshmi, 29, and K Kavitha, 28, reached Kannamangalam on Sunday night with her son Sabari, whom they wanted to get ‘treated’ by a Muslim godman at Vandavasi in Tiruvannamalai district. They spent the night in front of the panchayat union complex when the boy developed epileptic fits around 2am. Police said the women believed that he was under the spell of evil spirits and attempted to ‘control’ him using force. Thilagavathi pulled his tongue while a sister stamped his throat and the other stood on his stomach. A few people who spent the night in front of the complex alerted the police. The women killed the boy before the police came. When they realized the boy had died, the three turned on each other. The Kannamanglam police detained them. “We suspect that the three women are mentally unstable. There are a few unexplained deaths in their family, including that of their mother three days ago. Thilagavathy's husband died a couple of years ago. There are frequent deaths in their family in the last two years. We have arrested the three women and commenced a detailed investigation," said Kannamangalam sub inspector C Vijayakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fearing-evil-spirits-mom-aunts-strangle-sick-boy-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/83734649.cms||Bosco Dominique
---||Kolkata||BJP MP Saumitra kicks up row with Jangalmahal statehood call||Kolkata: Bishnupur MP and BJP Yuva Morcha leader Saumitra Khan on Monday joined the statehood chorus, this time for Jangalmahal, but clarified that it was his “personal view” and not that of his party. Khan’s demand found no support from Bengal BJP president and Midnapore MP Dilip Ghosh who stressed that the party considered Bengal to be a state and would work for its “holistic development”. Khan’s demand — and later his detailed defence on why he made it — prompted barbs from the Trinamool Congress on whether dividing Bengal was a part of the BJP’s “agenda”. Krishnanagar MP Mahua Moitra tweeted: “Can @BJP & Hon’ble HM please unequivocally clarify whether their intent is to split Bengal into many states? 2 @BJP MPs in the past 2 days have publicly declared intent to split North Bengal & Junglemahal.” Ghosh was defensive. “We believe that West Bengal is one state. If anyone were to say anything contrary, the party has no link with it. The state is passing through a turmoil and because of it some people are perhaps venting their frustrations,” he said. Not just Ghosh, the BJP’s Bankura MP Subhas Sarkar too distanced himself from Khan’s comments. “I have nothing to say on this. Whatever is to be said will be said by the central leadership,” Sarkar said. Khan, however, continued to pitch his logic. “This (demand) isn’t new; it is a century old. Trinamool has termed the rest of India ‘outsiders’. Kolkata leaders, by the same logic, are outsiders in Jangalmahal. The 23 departments of the state are being run by people within a 15km radius of Kalighat. Before long people from Jangalmahal will be labelled ‘outsiders’. The outsider theory of chief minister Mamata Banerjee is scaring us; these areas are being deprived for decades. We want Bengal to progress as a whole, but the outsider theory is not helping,” Khan said. Trinamool youth president Saayoni Ghosh said the BJP was refusing to learn its lesson. “The more BJP MPs harp on splitting Bengal, the more nails they drive into the party’s coffin. Lesson learnt, but forgotten too soon. Bad students of politics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-mp-saumitra-kicks-up-row-with-jangalmahal-statehood-call/articleshow/83730041.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Alipurduar BJP president defects to Trinamool with 7 leaders||KOLKATA: BJP’s Alipurduar president Ganga Prasad Sharma on Monday defected to the Trinamool Congress with seven other district party leaders, prompting Mukul Roy to say this was “only a glimpse of what lies ahead” and the “beginning of the end (for BJP in Bengal)”. Sharma said Alipurduar MP John Barla’s statehood demand for north Bengal was an attempt to “fan sentiments” and advised him to “work of people” instead. Sharma said “for some time”, there were rumblings in BJP ranks as district leaders were kept in the dark while “people were being flown out” to Kolkata and Delhi for inductions. “However, I did not leave the party then and be dubbed a traitor. Instead, I worked hard to ensure that the party won all five assembly seats (in Alipurduar). Having ensured that, I chose to join Trinamool Congress,” he said. When asked about Barla’s comments, Sharma said: “He has not done any work. He could have done a lot for people instead. To deflect attention from his shortcomings, he is now trying to fan sentiments of people. He should work instead.” Sharma also questioned why Manoj Tigga from north Bengal was overlooked for Suvendu Adhikari as BJP’s leader of the opposition. State education minister Bratya Basu dubbed BJP’s ‘Paschimbanga Diwas’ celebrations on June 20 and demand for separate statehood for north Bengal as “laughable” and a “duplicity”. “Look at their intent, the debate for Partition was done in Bengal and Punjab. The Bengal assembly, in which there was no Hindu Mahasabha member, the resolution was discussed on June 20 and in Punjab on June 23. Will they do the same in Punjab, they have a presence there? Their ideology is against Bengal, its history and its people. How can one speak in two voices at the same time?” he asked. TMC Rajya Sabha chief whip Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, responding to questions whether the defections with bolster the party, said: “Yes, it will add strength to the party organisation in Alipurduar.” Responding to the statehood call, he added, “People of the state will distance themselves from the BJP even further due its demands of separatism. The poll results in Bengal have proved what the people want. It has also proved how alienated they (BJP) are from people. Else why would a party push for Central Vista and deny Covid victims’ compensation? They may say anything but it will be the people who will decide.” Mukul, when asked about Adhikari moving for his disqualification, said, “Let his father first explain to him his position.” On whether he will be the next Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairperson, he said, “How can I comment on conjectures and speculations?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/alipurduar-bjp-prez-defects-to-trinamool-with-7-leaders/articleshow/83730147.cms||---
---||Kolkata||CBI gets court nod for DNA test of Jnaneswari ‘victim’||Kolkata: Faced with confusion over the identity of Amritava Chowdhury — the man who allegedly faked a death certificate to avail of compensation for Jnaneswari train accident victims — CBI on Monday sought court’s permission to conduct his DNA test. The court agreed to its proposal. Chowdhury, meanwhile, continued to come up with self-contradictory statements before the central investigating agency. CBI moved the special CBI court with its DNA test plea. “There is confusion over the person’s identity. We need to corroborate his identity with that of the deceased person’s body,” an agency officer said. During investigation, Chowdhury claimed he was having partial memory loss and could not recollect how the death certificate was obtained. He, however, continued to claim to be Amritava Chowdhury. His father, Mihir Kumar Chowdhury, had told CBI that his son was missing since the accident took place on May 28, 2010 but had returned in 2017. Chowdhury’s statement did not clarify his father’s claim. Neither could he recollect that he had an engineering degree. Investigators are trying to ascertain if Chowdhury is faking partial memory loss to bypass specific questions. The family had earlier claimed Chowdhury was a “sleeper class” passenger. His “body” had been handed over to the family after “DNA profiling match”. Railway ministry sources pointed out that the identity of some of the deceased persons could not be verified. “The dead bodies were handed over after claimant families produced documents, including death certificate, of the deceased persons,” said a ministry official. Meanwhile, the family of Prasenjit Ata of Howrah reached the CBI’s Nizam Palace office on Monday and claimed that he was a Jnaneswari passenger and had gone missing after the accident. They further claimed that they were shown remnants of a body at the morgue. A hand, among the remnants, had four rings that the family had identified as Prasenjit’s. “We were told that someone had already claimed the body and it was not there any more. It could have been Prasenjit’s body,” said Keshav Payat, a relative. Residents of Ganga Narayan Datta Lane in Jorabagan area, where the Chowdhurys live, said the family had been living on rent there for decades. “They never socialized and kept to themselves. I saw Amritava walking with bags after shopping even a few days back. He would, however, not talk to anyone,” said a local electrical goods shop owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbi-gets-court-nod-for-dna-test-of-jnaneswari-victim/articleshow/83730256.cms||Rohit Khanna

He might have had activities on the dark web as well. We are not ruling out his involvement in other criminal activities,” Malda police superintendent Alok Rajoria said on Monday. Police are also probing if the huge quantity of arms recovered on Saturday was purchased through the dark web. Regarding Asif’s interest in cryptocurrency, Rajoria said: “Although we have not found any evidence of his bitcoin transactions, we are not discarding the possibility.” Asif had drugged and drowned his parents, sister and grandmother on February 28 in his house at 16 Mile village following a property dispute and buried their bodies in the basement. His elder brother Arif, who was also drugged, managed to escape. Arif went to the cops on Friday, leading to Asif’s arrest on Saturday. Police said ever since his arrest, 19-year-old Asif had been trying to mislead interrogators. “A boy of such age is unlikely to have such maturity,” said an officer. Only cracking his involvement in dark web may give some clues to the motive behind the murders, he added. Police will reconstruct the crime scene soon, said another officer. Apart from post-mortem of the heavily decomposed bodies, viscera tests will also be done. Cops are looking for the masons who had built a tunnel leading to the basement. The huge room used by Asif was equipped with electronic gadgets and at least 16 cameras were installed after the murders to monitor activities of outsiders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/malda-murders-lens-on-accuseds-use-of-deep-web/articleshow/83730442.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar repeats charges, TMC says he seeks publicity||BAGDOGRA: Trinamool Congress supporters waved black flags at the West Bengal governor when his cavalcade was passing by Kurseong on Monday on its way to Darjeeling. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar iterated the charges he had made against the state government in his letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee over continuing post-poll violence, before he had gone on a three day Delhi visit. “We have never seen such a harrowing spectacle of violence, vandalism and unrestrained attack on people since Independence. The only premise for such attacks is that some people had chosen to vote out of their own volition,” he said on Monday. Narrating his experience during his visits to violence-torn areas of Cooch Behar and Nandigram, Dhankhar complained that no state minister had bothered to reach out to victims in the last six weeks. He urged the state administration to come out of its “ostrich-like” approach and be open to “scrutiny”. The governor alleged that the state government had no “data” on the “wanton destruction of property” in post-poll violence. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Ray took a dig at Dhankhar and said: “He can’t sleep if his face doesn’t appear in the media.” The governor’s iterating the comments he had made before his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah twice last week shows there is no let-up in the “confrontation” between the Centre and the state on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-repeats-charges-tmc-says-he-seeks-publicity/articleshow/83730408.cms||---

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the CBI, told the HC that while the probe, initiated following a previous order of the HC, was a chance to "clean up the entire state administration," the Maharashtra government was refusing to cooperate with the agency. Mehta denied the accusations made by the state government that the CBI was going beyond the high court's order by including issues of the reinstatement of former assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, and Deshmukh's undue interference in the transfers and postings of police officers. He denied the allegation made by state's counsel, senior advocate Rafiq Dada, that the CBI was using the Deshmukh probe to gain backdoor entry into probe against IPS officer Rashmi Shukla in a case of illegal phone tapping and alleged leaking of sensitive documents related to police postings. The solicitor general made the submissions before a bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar that was hearing a plea filed by the Maharashtra government seeking to expunge two paragraphs from the FIR registered by the CBI against Deshmukh earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-not-helping-in-deshmukh-probe-cbi-to-bombay-hc/articleshow/83734705.cms||---

The four had attacked watchman Babu, 45, with the hammer and iron rod they were using to crack open the hundi when he spotted them and raised the alarm around 2 am on June 17. Babu, a resident of Nadukuppam near Ice House, had two months ago joined as night watchmen at temple, where the priests visited only for the morning and evening pujas. As some residents gathered hearing Babu’s cries, the juveniles scaled the main door and fled. A police patrol comprising Parthiban, Kumar, and Sankar arrived on the scene soon after and started a combing operation in the area at once. The policemen spotted a juvenile, who was recently picked up for a petty offence at the Royapettah police station, and frisked him and found a mobile phone, which later turned out to be Babu’s, some cash and a blood-stained hammer, which has been sent for forensic examination. Police said the juvenile broke down and confessed under sustained interrogation. The Ice House crime wing police inspector Kaleeshwari and her team nabbed the other three juveniles based on his confession. All four were remanded in the correctional facility for boys and girls at Kellys. The injured Babu was admitted to the Government Stanley Hospital (GSH), and later referred to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, where he died on Sunday. Police said the temple has installed 12 CCTV cameras, which were turned off during the lockdown. An investigation officer said the prompt action by the police patrol helped crack the case at once. City police commissioner Shankar Jiwal appreciated the police team which solved the case within hours of the incident. The Sri Theertha Paleeshwarar temple is the second of the saptha sthana temples for Lord Shiva in the city. The other six are Sri Karaneeshwarar temple, Sri Velleeshwarar temple, Sri Virupaksheeswarar temple, Sri Valleshwarar temple, Sri Malleeshwarar temple, and Sri Kapaleeshwarar temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/four-boys-kill-temple-guard-for-stopping-burglary-bid-in-chennai/articleshow/83734719.cms||A Selvaraj

---||Chennai||Full vaccination for tribals, tea estate employees by June-end, says Tamil Nadu health minister Ma Subramanian||CHENNAI: After vaccinating 3.9 lakh people on Monday— the highest since January — Tamil Nadu announced it will ensure 100% vaccination of select groups such as tribals, employees of tea estates and residents of tourist destinations over the next few weeks ahead of the anticipated third wave. It will also put some cities such as Chennai and Coimbatore – the erstwhile hotspots — on “hyper vaccination mode”. With the Monday tally, the state beats its record of vaccinating 3.6 lakh people on June 16. On Monday, health minister Ma Subramanian said he has ordered health administrators of the Nilgiris district to complete vaccination for tribal population and employees of tea estates by June-end. “We are also planning to cover all residents in tourists’ spots such as Vellankanni and Nagore in Nagapattinam district. This will protect them and boost confidence among foreign tourists,” he said. Unlike a few months ago, more the vaccine, people in the state he said. are willing to take The immunisation wing was also working out strategies to ensure near 100% coverage in Ariyalur, Cheyyar, Ranipet and Nilgiris that have fewer than 6 lakh eligible people. These districts will require 9.8lakh doses to 11.3lakh doses to fully vaccinate their adult population. So far, they have covered 7.2% to 24% of those eligible. Focus will also be given to densely populated cities such as Chennai and Coimbatore, which were most affected. While Chennai has 20% covered, Coimbatore has covered 13%. Despite huge differences between districts, the state has steadily recorded an increase in the number of people getting the vaccine. In March, the state vaccinated an average of 83,000 people a day. In April and May between 94,000 and 99,000 people were vaccinated every day. In the last 20 days, at least 1.5 lakh people have received the vaccine every day. “The Centre is happy with the increase in the daily tally. They have now added another 4 lakh doses to the June tally. Initially, we were allotted just 42 lakh doses in June. Our performance will have a cascading effect in July too. The Centre has promised 71 lakh doses in July,” Subramanian said. Since January, Tamil Nadu has been allotted 1.29 crore doses of the vaccine —both Covisheild and Covaxin. On Monday, when the state started the vaccination, it had 5.94 lakh doses left. By Monday 3.9 lakh people were vaccinated. “The number of vaccinations is now directly proportional to doses available. This is why we can’t say how much vaccine we would give to districts or priority groups every day. We allot vaccines based on the stock we receive,” said immunisation director Dr K Vinay Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/full-vaccination-for-tribals-tea-estate-employees-by-june-end-says-tamil-nadu-health-minister-ma-subramanian/articleshow/83734776.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||Chennai||Over a dozen districts in Tamil Nadu log less than 100 cases||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu continued to report a steady drop in fresh cases and a marginal increase in deaths, with the total number of active cases falling rapidly, particularly in districts such as Chennai. On Monday, the state reported 7,427 new cases and 189 deaths compared to 7, 817 cases and 182 deaths on Sunday. With 891 new cases, Coimbatore reported the maximum number of cases followed by 795 in Erode and 511 in Salem. While Tiruppur reported 458 cases, Chennai reported 439. While samples were drawn from 1.65 lakh people, at least a dozen districts reported less than 100 cases on Monday. With a steady fall in new cases, the active cases in all districts across Tamil Nadu fell below the 10,000 mark. In the last 10 days, Tamil Nadu added at least 90,000 new cases including 5,565 new cases in Chennai. This means, the state should have at least 90,000 people on the active cases registry, but the media bulletin showed 61,329 people under treatment in TN and 1,343 in Chennai. Officials in the public health department quote two reasons for the mismatch. “First, many hospitals discharge patients on the second or third day if they don’t require oxygen or have any other complaints that require intense monitoring. Although many of these patients are sent for home isolation, their names inadvertently get added into the discharged list,” he said. Second, the state protocol permits discharge of patients ten days after symptoms. “Many people go for testing only on the third or fourth day of symptoms and by the time results arrive many of them are healthy. Such people enter the registry late and exit early,” he said. Among the 189 deaths, 25 were reported in Chennai, 25 in Coimbatore and 23 were in Vellore. Five districts – Kallakurichi, Dindigul, Sivaganga, Tenkasi and Tirunelveli – reported zero deaths. Case fatality rate is the highest in Vellore (2.1), which reported 16 deaths on Monday, followed by Tirupathur (1.9%) and Dindigul (1.8%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/over-a-dozen-districts-in-tamil-nadu-log-less-than-100-cases/articleshow/83734804.cms||---

"It was easy for countries to forget Yoga Day during the pandemic as it is not intrinsic to their culture but, instead, enthusiasm for yoga has increased globally. Yoga helped people to muster confidence and strength to fight with the pandemic world over," the PM said in his address on the occasion of the 7th International Yoga Day celebrated under the theme of 'Yoga for Wellness'. He wished for the health of every country, society and individual, saying, "Let's hope that we will be united and will strengthen each other." The PM also announced that India and WHO took an important step as the world is getting an M-Yoga app which will provide many videos of yoga training based on common yoga protocol in several languages. "This is a great example of fusion of modern technology and ancient science," the PM said and added that the M-Yoga app will help in spreading yoga the world over and will contribute to the efforts of 'One World One Health'. The PM recalled frontline corona warriors making yoga their shield and how people, doctors and nurses took to yoga to deal with the effects of the virus. He said experts are stressing the importance of breathing exercises like pranayama and anulom-vilom. Quoting the great Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar, the PM said, "Yoga goes to the root cause of disease and is instrumental in healing. It is a matter of great satisfaction that globally, research is being conducted in the healing properties of Yoga."

The PM said "The shift from silos to union is Yoga. A proven way to experience a realisation of oneness is Yoga." Quoting Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, PM said, "The meaning of our self is not to be found in its separateness from God and others, but in the ceaseless realisation of yoga, of union." The PM said that the mantra of 'Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam' which India has followed since ages, is now finding global acceptance. "We need to continue moving on the collective journey of yoga as it has solutions for everyone.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Tribal districts steal the show, achieve 100% vaccine target||BHOPAL: From mingling with tribals to convincing their chieftains efforts like this, bore fruit as even the districts where there were a lot of hesitancy about getting vaccines, also outperformed in vaccination drive. In Mandla district where in past local tribals had even attacked vaccination teams, 100% of the target was achieved. “But it was definitely not easy”, says district collector Mandla Harshita Singh. “Two-three weeks ago we could hardly administer under 500 vaccine doses in a day. And we were also not aware that mega vaccination drive is coming during that time. There were lot of rumours among the tribal population”, she said. “Each department was roped in. We made a list of local influencers and formed teams to convince them. They worked at the forefront in convincing others. If there was a death in any village, we convinced the family members to get vaccinated. Once they got vaccinated, it had positive impact. We also instructed to mingle with tribals. In several Baiga-dominated villages, teams were instructed to visit the villages and not talk about vaccination but instead ask them about the problems they were facing and address those problems. All these initiatives cumulatively created an impact. But still there is a long way to go, even today there was resistance in Ghughri block, but we managed to vaccinate around 500 people there,” she said.

A senior AAP leader told TOI on condition of anonymity that negotiations with SAD (S) were at a “very advanced” stage but certain issues were yet to be resolved. “We expected both sides to sink differences and agree on a mutually acceptable agenda but that didn’t happen today, else Kejriwal would have announced the alliance,” said sources. When asked about probable alliances ahead of assembly elections, Kejriwal didn’t reply. Sources said while neither AAP nor SAD (S) stood much to gain from an alliance, they would upset prospects of other major political parties. General secretary, SAD (S) Karnail Singh Peermohammad refused to comment on the issue of an alliance with AAP. However, he indicated that discussions were being held to explore possibilities. On Dhindsa’s Amritsar visit, he said the party president was there to announce the launch of the Jan Sampark Muhim. He said both Dhindsa and Brahampura held a meeting at the latter’s residence to discuss the election strategy. “We want all dissidents in SAD (B) to come out in the open and join us for a united fight against the SAD (B), Congress and BJP,” he said. Sources said that a meeting between a few leaders of SAD (S) and AAP was scheduled in the near future.

The country recorded 42,667 fresh cases on Monday, the lowest daily case count in 91 days. A lower tally than this was last reported on March 22, when 40,652 cases were recorded. The death toll from the virus on Monday was 908, not counting 258 old deaths reported by Maharashtra. The daily toll had gone past 1,000 after April 12, when 882 deaths were recorded, and had remained in four figures till Sunday (June 20). The toll had touched a peak of 4,205 on May 11. The seven-day rolling average of daily cases fell below 60,000 on Monday to 58,475. The average now stands at less than 15% of the peak of 3,91,263 recorded on May 8. The seven-day average of daily cases has fallen every single day after May 8, indicating a sharp decline of the second wave. However, as many experts have pointed out, the second wave is not over yet as positivity rates remain high in several pockets of the country. The seven-day average of daily deaths stood at 1,178, nearly a fourth of the peak. The average had peaked at 4,040 on May 16. The sharp drop in cases was in keeping with the dip in numbers every Monday due to lower testing and staff shortage over the weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/daily-covid-cases-below-50000-after-91-days/articleshow/83734890.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The party cautioned the people of Punjab to not to get swayed by their promises. “It is condemnable that a former tainted cop, who had misused his position to conduct a biased and politically-motivated probe into the Kotkapura firing incident and had proved to be a blot on the police force, was rewarded for his services against the ‘guru naam leva sangat’ by AAP,” alleged SAD’s Bikramjit Singh Majithia talking to mediapersons here on Monday. He alleged: “Today’s developments have conclusively proved that Kunwar Vijay Pratap was a co-conspirator and it was necessary to register a case against him and subject him to narco tests to get to the bottom of the case. Custodial interrogation of the former police officer is also needed to expose the AAP-Congress conspiracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-demands-narco-test-of-former-ig/articleshow/83733438.cms||---

In a real-life Dangal story, a farm labourer trained his three athlete daughters in his agricultural fields and on tracks — railway tracks — in Bina district as sports facilities in the state are shut in lockdown. Vinod Rajak, 40, runs 15-20km a day with his daughters Kajal (15), Astha (17) and Pooja (19), and pushes himself through the same grueling routine that he put them into. Sprinting through farms and on dirt tracks and train tracks, the foursome is a familiar sight every morning in Karonda village, a village of 2,000 about 30km from Bina town and 174km from Bhopal. All three girls have been national school athletes and have bigger dreams. While Kajal and Pooja are cross-country runners, Astha has competed in the 800m and 3,000m categories. The elder sisters are in college. Vinod, who couldn’t study beyond class 10, owns an acre of land but it’s not enough to sustain his family, so he works on others’ farms to ensure his three daughters’ education isn’t hampered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-leap-from-training-in-fields-to-athletic-academy-talent-hunt/articleshow/83734876.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Chandigarh||Govt docs to go on strike on June 25 in Punjab||Chandigarh: Government doctors, including veterinary, medical, dental and rural medical officers and medical teachers, on Monday formed a joint front and announced to go on strike on June 25. The government doctors are protesting against pay commission’s recommendation on decrease and de-linking of non-practising allowance from basic pay. The doctors are arguing that the recommendation of sixth pay commission will reduce their salaries drastically. Earlier, the doctors were planning to go on a strike on June 23, but after assurance of resolving the issue was given by health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, they postponed the strike to June 25. Before launching their state-wide agitation, government doctors associations, including Punjab Civil Medical Services Association, Punjab State Veterinary Officers Association, PCMS Dental Association, Medical Teachers Association, Rural Medical Doctors Association, announced to form a common platform ‘Joint Government Doctors Coordination Committee, Punjab’. Senior vice-president of the PCMS Association Dr Gagandeep Shergill said that the pay commissions were always constituted to make a realistic increase in the salaries of the employees. “It is perhaps for the first time when the pockets of doctors are being picked. This is the reward the government has given for the sacrifices made by the doctors during Covid wave,” he said. Association of Rural Medical Officers president Dr Jagjeet Bajwa said the government should roll back the decision. He rued that instead of rewarding the doctors for exemplary service during the most troubled Covid times, the government has punished them by reducing their salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-docs-to-go-on-strike-on-june-25-in-punjab/articleshow/83733440.cms||---

Manikandan was booked after an actor accused him of cheating on the promise of marriage and raping him. One of the two special teams rushed to Bengaluru based on a tip and secured Manikandan from a hideout in Wilson Garden. He was brought to Chennai and produced before the 17th metropolitan magistrate court in Saidapet and remanded him in judicial custody till July 2. The actress alleged that she met Manikandan in 2017 when he was minister and got close to him after the latter promised to do business together in Malaysia. She had reportedly tagged along with him to several places during his official tours. She alleged that she was tortured and also forced by him to abort. Police are also likely to book the man who gave asylum to the former minister, despite knowing that he is an absconding accused. He was staying in a safe location for nearly eight days before his arrest. Moreover, after seizing a few CCTV camera footage and videos from the actor, police will seek his custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-police-seek-custody-of-ex-minister-m-manikandan-for-five-days/articleshow/83734916.cms||---

---||Chennai||Madras high court says it will examine clean chit to minister S P Velumani||CHENNAI: Madras high court has said it might not accept a clean chit given to former local administration minister S P Velumani by the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption, if the court finds out that ‘day has been turned into night’. “If there are stark allegations crying out for action to be taken, we will interfere. If there are only small little things, then that does not interest the court. If the government has accepted, the court will not interfere. But if day has been turned into night, then the court will not accept the same,” the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said on Monday. The court made the observation while responding to a submission of senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi representing the former minister that once the state government has accepted the report of the DVAC, nothing else remains. He said the preliminary inquiry was indeed conducted by a superintendent of police officer appointed by the high court. To this, the bench replied: “It is the government which has accepted the report. The court might not have accepted it…” The issue pertains to a PIL moved by anti-corruption NGO Arappor Iyakkam to register an FIR and order a probe by a special investigating team (SIT) against Velumani for corruption in allotting tenders of Chennai and Coimbatore corporations. Earlier, representing the petitioner-NGO, advocate V Suresh submitted that Arappor had filed a series of counter against the DVAC report. Since he wanted to make his submission in a physical hearing, the court adjourned the plea after four weeks. On March 26, the court dismissed a plea moved by Velumani seeking contempt of court action against the NGO as an utterly frivolous petition. Velumani has alleged that reports accusing him of corruption in awarding contracts of Chennai and Coimbatore corporations were being published continuously by the NGO in social media in violation of a court order. According to the former minister, on October 18, 2019 a division bench of the court appointed superintendent of police Ponni attached to DVAC to conduct a preliminary inquiry. Accordingly, the officer completed the inquiry and forwarded the report to the state government for further action, the petitioner said. After due examination, on January 22, 2020 the state decided to drop further action in the matter based on the preliminary inquiry report and requested the division bench of the court to close the petition, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/madras-high-court-says-it-will-examine-clean-chit-to-minister-s-p-velumani/articleshow/83734942.cms||Suresh Kumar
