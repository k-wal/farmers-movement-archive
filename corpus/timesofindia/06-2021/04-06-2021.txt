---||Bengaluru||World Environment Day: Nature enthusiasts plan a Green Covid drive for the needy||As World Environment Day approaches amid a global public health crisis, Bengaluru's environmentalists are planning a unique drive in tune with the current times. Called Green Covid, this unique donation drive would see them mobilise funds for those who are the worst-hit by the pandemic. Brainchild of Bengaluru's tree doctor and environmentalist Vijay Nishanth, the celebration is to mark the day, keeping the Covid sensibility in mind. "We are trying to create an oxygen chamber for the future and also help those in dire need of money. A lot of underprivileged people cannot meet sudden medical expenses or buying rations, hence the idea was to collect money through a sapling donation drive and then donating the money collected to the needy." Vijay plans to distribute the amount collected to the needy on June 5. However, to increase the reach of the drive without having to leave one's locality amid the lockdown, he has reached out to like-minded individuals to carry out the drive in their locality. He has reached out to some eight people located in Vasanth Nagar, Hebbal, Sarjapur, Whitefield, Banashankari, Vijay Nagar and Jayanagar. Jayanagar-based environmentalist Srikanta TR and his son Triambak TS who have teamed up with Vijay for this initiative, have stocked 70 saplings to facilitate the sapling donation drive. "My son has already prepared a list of friends and family members who have agreed to buy the saplings to help the underprivileged. He has also prepared a list of people in dire need of money in our area. And on World Environment Day, we are going to donate the amount collected," says Srikanta. Nature enthusiast Anu Kulkarni has also joined the cause and purchased close to 70 saplings. He has started donating saplings for the cause. "The idea is to combine the environment and Covid crisis to make June 5 memorable. And, I have already reached out to people in my apartment." Anu has plans to continue this drive for the entire month. Green enthusiast Rajkumar Dugar, who is also the convenor of Citizens For Citizens forum, adds, "I think it is a good idea in tune with the present times and works best in trying to achieve two goals, one is tree planting and the other is motivation for people to think they have done something to help someone in these unprecedented times. While people are focussed on the pandemic, this is an opportunity for them to help the needy as well as improve the environment." His team would be distributing saplings for free and ask people to just donate for the cause, to distribute among the needy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/world-environment-day-nature-enthusiasts-plan-a-green-covid-drive-for-the-needy/articleshow/83201485.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

The HRAWI has requested that stand-alone restaurants and bars, as well as restaurants and bars in hotels for outside guests be allowed to re-open immediately. It has also requested the Chahal to extend the timings of restaurants to 11pm. The HRAWI said that the first and second lockdowns combined have impacted over 20 lakh jobs and for each month that hotels and restaurants remain closed, the industry suffers a loss of over Rs 2000 crore. With the latest order, the industry is expected to remain closed for another 15 days which will cost it another approximately Rs 1000 crore in revenue, the letter later released to media read. There are around 2,10,000 restaurants and 10,500 hotels in the state and the industry employs around 30 lakh workers directly and indirectly. “The industry revenue in the beginning of 2021 was below 20% of the pre-pandemic levels and since April 2021, it hasn’t even touched 5% of the same. Each lockdown extension is costing the industry massive losses and the debt is only piling up. At present, the Covid-19 positivity rate in Mumbai is less than 10%. Under these circumstances, we request the municipal commissioner to grant us the concessions,” said Sherry Bhatia, president of HRAWI. The HRAWI has also pleaded to the government for waiver of statutory charges, including property tax and minimum water charges, electricity bills along with full relief in excise fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-hotel-association-urges-mumbai-civic-body-to-give-concessions-to-hospitality-industry/articleshow/83212923.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Last year the total procurement of wheat during the Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) was 390 lakh tonnes. Till Wednesday the procurement stood at 411 lakh tonnes. According to the food ministry, Bihar has procured 1.9 lakh tonnes of wheat so far compared to last year’s figure of 4,198 tonnes and has revised the estimate to procure six lakh tonnes, a six-fold increase from the earlier estimate. The procurement in Uttar Pradesh is 41.9 lakh tonnes against 24.8 lakh tonnes last year. Even in Jammu and Kashmir, the procurement so far has touched 17,929 tonnes compared to barely 11 tonnes last year. In Delhi, the procurement has jumped to 5,955 tonnes from barely 28 tonnes. Punjab and Haryana, the two largest wheat producing states have surpassed this year’s target. The procurement in Madhya Pradesh is also set to surpass the last year’s procurement figure in the next couple of days, sources said. Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told reporters that the government has made adequate arrangements for safe storage of the food grains. He said barring barely 3.5% of its total procured grain, the rest is kept in scientific storage. The remaining, which are now only in Punjab and Haryana, will be transferred to scientific storage places by July. Pandey said about 44.43 lakh farmers have benefited from the ongoing RMS procurement operations with an MSP value of Rs 81,196 crore, out of which an amount of Rs 76,056 crore has been transferred to farmers across the country. About Rs 26,104 crore in Punjab and about Rs 16,706 crore in Haryana has been transferred directly into farmers’ accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-revises-wheat-procurement-target-as-most-producing-states-create-record-buying/articleshow/83215522.cms||Dipak K Dash

The agency outlined its intention to propose listing Tiehm's buckwheat as a threatened or endangered species as part of its belated, 12-month review of a listing petition conservationists filed in 2019. A federal judge said last month the finding was six months overdue and ordered the agency to render a decision within weeks.  The conclusion announced on Thursday that federal protection is warranted could jeopardize Ioneer Ltd.'s plans to build the mine halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.  It also ups the ante in an early test of the Biden administration's ability to make good on promises to protect public lands and their native species while at the same time pursuing an ambitious clean energy agenda that includes bolstering production of lithium needed for electric car batteries.  Environmentalists say the delicate, 6-inch (15-centimeter) tall wildflower with yellow blooms is on the brink of extinction with fewer than 30,000 individual plants remaining.  Ioneer acknowledges Tiehm's buckwheat hasn't been documented anywhere else in the world but insists it can co-exist with the mine.  Nevertheless, the looming listing presents the biggest regulatory hurdle to date for what would be only the second large-scale lithium mine operating in the United States.  Under the court order, the service now has until Sept. 30 to submit a formal rule proposing protection of the plant as a threatened or endangered species. A 60-day public comment period will follow.  The Center for Biological Diversity first petitioned for federal listing in October 2019 and weeks later filed suit against the US Bureau of Land Management to block construction of the mine at Rhyolite Ridge west of Tonopah in the Silver Peak Range about 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of the California line and 200 miles (322 km) southeast of Reno - where Tesla Motors' largest lithium battery factory is located.  "Tiehm's buckwheat shouldn't be wiped off the face of the earth by an open-pit mine," Patrick Donnelly, the center's Nevada director, said Thursday. "The service stepping in to save the plant from extinction is the right call."  Ioneer Managing Director Bernard Rowe said Thursday they expected the warranted finding and share the Fish and Wildlife Service's "commitment to protect and preserve Tiehm's buckwheat in its habitat."  "This process will provide greater certainty around our schedule and diminishes the prospect of future litigation," he said. "We remain confident that the science strongly supports the coexistence of our vital lithium operation and Tiehm's buckwheat."  The tiny population of Tiehm's buckwheat is found on 21 acres (8 hectares) spread across 3 square miles (7.8 square kilometers) at the mine site.  Scientists say the plant plays an integral role in the desert ecosystem by stabilizing soils, dispersing seeds and creating a sort of oasis that provides rare food and moisture for bees and other pollinators.  The service said a 2019 survey estimated the plant's global population totaled 43,921 - all at the mine site. But it said in Thursday's finding that an unprecedented rodent attack during severe drought last summer damaged or destroyed more than half the plants.  It said that herbivory combined with the potential impact from the mining project would reduce the flower's population by an estimated 70% to 88% - "or from 43,921 individuals to roughly 5,289-8,696 individuals."  Ioneer is proposing to salvage most of the remaining plants by transplanting them to another location, the service said.  "However, we are uncertain whether the salvage operation will succeed because current research indicates that Tiehm's buckwheat is a soil specialist, that adjacent unoccupied sites are not suitable for all early life-history stages, and there has been no testing and multiyear monitoring on the feasibility of successfully transplanting the species," the agency said.  Other threats to the plant include road-building, off-road travel, livestock grazing and climate change, the service said.  Ioneer says the mine would create 400 to 500 construction jobs and 300 to 400 operational jobs, and is expected to produce 22,000 tons (19,958 metric tons) of lithium - enough to power hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles annually.  Demand for lithium worldwide is expected to double by 2025. Much of the world's lithium supply currently comes from Australia and South America, where Chinese firms are heavily invested.  Boosting domestic production could potentially lower the price tag on a key component of President Joe Biden's $2 trillion climate plan: offering rebates to consumers to trade in gas-powered for electric cars.  The only large-scale lithium mine currently operating in the US is also in Nevada, only about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from where Ioneer proposes its mine. The North Carolina-based Albemarle's Silver Peak Mine has been in operation since the 1960s.  A third lithium mine proposed in north-central Nevada near the Oregon line at the largest known lithium deposit in the US also is facing legal challenges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/federal-agency-nevada-flower-near-mine-should-be-protected/articleshow/83215684.cms||---

The US is the worst-affected country with 595,833 deaths, followed by Brazil with 467,706, India with 337,989, Mexico with 228,146, Peru with 184,942 and Britain with 127,794. Here are the latest Covid-related developments across the world:US to send 25 million Covid vaccines around the worldThe White House on Thursday unveiled its plan for the first of 80 million Covid vaccine doses being distributed globally, with 75 percent disbursed via the Covax programme. It prioritises countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa. The long-awaited vaccine sharing plan comes as demand for shots in the US has dropped significantly as more than 63 per cent of adults have received at least one dose, and as global inequities in supply have become more glaring. US Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and three other world leaders and informed them that the US will start sharing the first 25 million doses of Covid vaccines to their respective countries. Delta variant now dominant in UK as cases rise by 5,472 in a week The Delta variant of Covid-19, or the B1.617.2 highly transmissible variant of concern (VOC) first identified in India, has now become the dominant VOC in the UK as infections rose by 5,472 in a week to hit a total of 12,431, health officials in Britain said on Thursday. Public Health England (PHE), which monitors all Covid variants in the country, said that experts now believe that Delta has now overtaken Alpha – the VOC first detected in the Kent region of England. PHE also said that early evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of hospitalisation with Delta compared to Alpha, although more data is needed to have a more definitive view on that. 'Vietnam's suspicious coronavirus variant not hybrid strain'The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said that a suspicious coronavirus variant detected in Vietnam is part of the existing Delta strain and not a new hybrid mutation. The Vietnamese health minister said this week that a Covid-19 variant that combined traits of the Indian and UK strains was detected in the Southeast Asian country for the first time. A WHO official said that there is no new hybrid variant in Vietnam at this moment based on WHO definition The variant found in Vietnam was the Delta strain with additional mutations and needed more observation, he added. The Delta strain is highly contagious and has spread to other countries. Britain hosts G7 health summit amid pressure to broaden Covid vaccine accessBritain on Thursday hosted health ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) rich countries in Oxford for a two-day summit, as pressure intensifies to do more to broaden access to Covid-19 vaccines across the world. British foreign minister Dominic Raab has said that equitable access to coronavirus vaccines will be at the top of the agenda when G7 leaders meet next week. As health ministers gathered at the University of Oxford, Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), said there was a moral duty for G7 countries to start donating Covid-19 vaccines now. 'Exponential' rise in virus cases in DR Congo capital: WHOThe WHO on Thursday said it had detected a surge late last month in coronavirus cases in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The WHO in a weekly report said that an exponential rise in the spread of SARS-Cov-2 virus has been recorded in Kinshasa. The rise mirrored a "clear deterioration" in the wider province of Kinshasa, it said. A DRC health ministry official confirmed "the third wave of Covid-19 is already there -- it's the Indian (Delta) and South African (Beta) variants." Italy offers Covid vaccines to everyone over 12Italy on Thursday opened Covid vaccinations for everybody over the age of 12. Each region can adapt the national rules but technically anyone registered with health authorities can sign up -- including teenagers, after the European Medicines Agency approved the Pfizer/BioNTech jab for 12 to 15-year-olds last week. A student is administered her first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, at a vaccination hub in a shopping mall in the outskirts of Rome. AP PhotoAfter a slow start at the beginning of the year, both due to organisational issues and lack of supply, Italy's vaccination programme has been rapidly gaining pace. More than 35 million doses have been administered, with 12.4 million people -- almost 23 percent of the population -- now fully vaccinated, according to health ministry figures. Italy is one of the European nations hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. UAE suspends entry of travellers from Vietnam starting June 5The United Arab Emirates will suspend the entry of travellers coming from Vietnam starting June 5, as part of measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Tokyo 2020 chief says Games '100 percent' onThe Tokyo Olympics are "100 percent" certain to go ahead, the chief organiser on Thursday said.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the state's annual contest on Thursday: It will run from July 9 to 18 and include prizes for both pros and novices. In both categories, there will be a $2,500 prize for catching the most pythons and $1,500 for the longest.  The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet (6.10 meters) and 200 pounds (90 kilograms), are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. The big serpents are overrunning the Everglades and have been devouring native mammal and bird populations.  Each adult female lays between 60 and 100 eggs per year. Once the snakes reach adulthood in about five years they have no Florida predators besides armed humans and the occasional sawgrass death match with an adult alligator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/hunt-is-on-for-burmese-pythons-florida-natives-arch-enemy/articleshow/83215912.cms||---
---||India||Onus on Pakistan to keep peace along LOC: Army chief General M M Naravane||SRINAGAR: Army chief General M M Naravane on Thursday said the longevity of the current ceasefire along the Line of Control (LOC) depends on Pakistan’s actions and also cautioned his commanders and troops not to let their guard down and be prepared to effectively meet every security challenge along the border. Naravane, at the end of his two-day visit to Kashmir, told reporters, “The ceasefire along the LoC is holding as of now. The onus of making sure that the ceasefire holds is squarely on Pakistan. We are willing to observe the ceasefire as long as they do so.” The army chief pointed out that other activities like setting up terror infrastructure, including terrorist camps, and presence of terrorists on the other side of the LoC were continuing in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. “Therefore, there can be no slackening of our level of preparedness,” he added. Asked if Islamabad can be trusted as the ceasefire has been holding for 100 days now, Naravane said, “There have been decades of mistrust between India and Pakistan. So, the situation on that score cannot change overnight.” He visited units and formations in the border areas. Naravane said if Pakistan observes ceasefire in letter and spirit, the small steps can lead to incremental gains. “If Pakistan continues to desist from fomenting trouble in India, then the small steps can lead to that level of trust that you are talking about,” he added. On the possibility of troops reduction in Kashmir, he said the deployment of the troops was a dynamic process and is reviewed from time to time depending on threat perception. The army chief was also briefed by local commanders on the measures being taken to identify and target networks of over ground workers (OGWs) involved in radicalization and recruitment of youth into militancy, the defence spokesman said in a statement. He added that efforts to prevent local recruitment and facilitate surrender of local militants were also discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/onus-on-pakistan-to-keep-peace-along-loc-army-chief-general-m-m-naravane/articleshow/83216604.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Delhi||Female COVID volunteers, women seeking aid subjected to lewd texts, obscene calls||Can you find a bed for both of us?’, ‘Can you share your picture?’, ‘Tere ghar aake bataunga kya chahiye’ – these are just a sampler of the inappropriate texts and calls female volunteers in NCR are subjected to, as they spend their days helping strangers find COVID aid. Some changed their profile pics, others turned their WhatsApp accounts into business accounts or adopted the ‘block, report, repeat’ approach. But all of them agree that having to deal with such an overwhelming amount of harassment on a daily basis, amidst a pandemic no less, is taking its toll. ‘For once, amid the pandemic, I didn’t want Delhi men to behave like Delhi men’Srishti, who has been volunteering during the crisis with students from her college, says, “Some people call and say things like, ‘Can you find a bed for both of us?’. Then there’s a category of callers who are actually seeking help, but will address us as ‘baby’ or ‘sweetie’. When we say it makes us uncomfortable, some apologise, while others argue, ‘Darling bulaya toh galti kya hai?’” She adds, “Once, a guy called me and asked, ‘where are you located?’ I told him I was in Delhi, before asking him what he needed and what the patient’s SpO2 levels were. He replied, ‘Main nahi bata raha, main tere ghar aake bataunga...’ I threatened to take him to the police before disconnecting his call and blocking him.” She says, “I was born and brought up in Delhi, so I’m used to this behaviour of Delhi men. But for once, during the pandemic at least, I didn’t want Delhi men to behave like Delhi men. This pandemic and the last few weeks have shown me another dark side of them.” The number of harassers we block keeps rising every day, say female COVID volunteersMahima, a former civil servant who also writes the newsletter Womaning In India, says, “When my brother and I were searching for an oxygen bed for a family member, the first thing I did was to change my profile pic to a random one that did not show my face because I knew I’ll be contacting many people and didn’t want to take any risk. I spoke to many female volunteers who told me that they also had to do the same due to safety reasons. Male volunteers don’t have to deal with all these concerns.” “Valid query? Help. Harassment call? Block – I’ve mentally prepared myself to deal with each call this way,” says Madhvi, who works in an IT company, adding, “Honestly, in a normal situation, if any guy would have stalked or harassed me on social media, I would have abused him and dragged him to the police station. But right now, I have to arrange an ambulance for a critical patient, wood for a cremation, and a funeral service for another stranger. I don’t have any energy left to deal with these men. And so I just block them. Every day the number of people I block on my phone isincreasing.” <p>Female COVID volunteers are subjected to lewd texts, obscene calls<br></p>Satyam, a female bouncer, says,"I joined a volunteers’ group on Telegram and my number was visible to many ( she posted her number with some leads). I used to get texts at 2-3am asking about my location. I know volunteers who’ve received texts & calls with a one-word query: ‘sex’." The number of harassers we block keeps rising every day, say female COVID volunteersWomen who ask for help are being harassed, too:Even women seeking help for themselves and other COVID patients on social media have not been spared the harassment. Those who took to Twitter to ask for assistance, and shared their numbers or those of their contacts, were inundated with lewd texts and unnecessary calls from men. Former Chief Minister of J&K Omar Abdullah also tweeted, “Unfortunately even in this crisis some men can’t stop themselves from behaving like bas***ds. They find phone numbers of ladies included with the requests for help and make lewd calls. I’ll try my best not to circulate numbers of ladies but it may impact how people can help.” Recently, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) urged women to report any instances of sexual harassment on the pretext of providing medicines or oxygen cylinders during the pandemic. In a statement, the DCW said, “The whole nation and Delhi have fought a tough battle with coronavirus. However, some unscrupulous people are taking advantage of this situation and sending obscene messages to women who ask for help in getting medicines or oxygen cylinders on Twitter. If you or anyone known to you has faced this situation, you can email us on livingpositive@gmail.com. Such men will not be spared.” One can also report such instances to cybervolunteer.mha.gov.in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/female-covid-volunteers-women-seeking-aid-subjected-to-lewd-texts-obscene-calls/articleshow/83206541.cms||Niharika Lal
---||World||Netanyahu foes push for quick vote to end his 12-year rule||TEL AVIV: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opponents pushed Thursday for a quick parliament vote to formally end his lengthy rule, hoping to head off any last-minute attempts to derail their newly announced coalition government. The latest political maneuvering began just hours after opposition leader Yair Lapid and his main coalition partner, Naftali Bennett, declared they had reached a deal to form a new government and muster a majority in the 120-member Knesset, or parliament. The coalition consists of eight parties from across the political spectrum with little in common except the shared goal of toppling Netanyahu after his record-setting 12 years in power. The alliance includes hard-liners previously allied with Netanyahu, as well as center-left parties and even an Arab faction a first in Israeli politics. Netanyahu lashed out at his foes on Thursday, signaling that he will continue to exert pressure on former allies who joined the coalition. ``All members of Knesset who were elected with right-wing votes need to oppose this dangerous leftist government,`` he wrote on Twitter. Bennett, who is slated to become prime minister, has come under heavy pressure from Israeli hard-liners who accuse him of betrayal. He heads Yamina, a small right-wing party that appeals to religious, nationalist voters. But he has also said that all members of the emerging coalition will have to be flexible and pragmatic. In a televised interview, Bennett said he would never agree to freeze construction in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, which is seen by the Palestinians and much of the international community as a major obstacle to peace. ``There will be no freezes,'' he said, acknowledging the international community will push for one. ``Look, there will be pressures. We will have to manage,'' he told Channel 12 TV. ``My attitude on this topic is to minimize the conflict. We will not solve it,'' he said, adding that it was more realistic to improve business ties and the quality of life for Palestinians. Israel's political drama has riveted Israelis at a time when tumult has not been in short supply: four inconclusive elections in two years followed by an 11-day war in the Gaza Strip last month that was accompanied by mob violence between Jews and Arabs in cities across the country. The country also is emerging from the coronavirus crisis that caused deep economic damage and exposed tensions between the secular majority and the ultra-Orthodox minority. Yet the political debate has focused squarely on Netanyahu, who is facing corruption charges and whether he should stay or go. ``We never had a coalition like this,`` said Hillel Bar Sadeh at a coffee shop in Jerusalem. ``We like to have a new spirit, we like to have some unity.'' The owner of the coffee shop, Yosi Zarifi, said he trusts that Netanyahu will return to power and distrusts the coalition. ``Everybody is clear that this trick will not last, there won't be any glue (to keep it together) here,'' he said. The anti-Netanyahu bloc announced the coalition deal just before a deadline at midnight Wednesday. The agreement triggered a complex process that is likely to stretch over the next week. The coalition has a razor-thin majority of 61 votes in parliament. On Thursday, it attempted to replace parliament speaker Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu ally, in order to speed up the vote on the new government. But the effort failed after Nir Orbach, a lawmaker from Yamina, refused to sign on, underscoring the fragility of the alliance. Levin can now use his position to delay the vote and give Netanyahu more time to sabotage the coalition. As the coalition was coming together in recent days, Netanyahu and his supporters ramped up a pressure campaign against former hawkish allies, including Bennett and his No. 2 in the Yamina party, Ayelet Shaked. Netanyahu accused them of betraying their values. His supporters launched vicious social media campaigns and staged noisy protests outside Shaked's home. The prime minister's Likud party also called for a demonstration Thursday night outside the home of Orbach, urging him to quit the coalition. That's a taste of the pressure to be expected for lawmakers on the right. ``There will be a lot of pressure, especially on right-wingers, especially for religious right-wingers,'' said Gideon Rahat, a political science professor at Hebrew University. ``They will go to the synagogue and people will pressure them. It will be a nightmare for some of them.'' Under the coalition agreement, Lapid and Bennett will split the job of prime minister in a rotation. Bennett, a former ally of Netanyahu, is to serve the first two years, while Lapid is to serve the final two years _ though it is far from certain their fragile coalition will last that long. The historic deal also includes a small Islamist party, the United Arab List, which would make it the first Arab party ever to be part of a governing coalition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/netanyahu-foes-push-for-quick-vote-to-end-his-12-year-rule/articleshow/83217234.cms||---

Public Health England (PHE), which monitors all Covid variants in the country, said that experts now believe that Delta has now overtaken Alpha – the VOC first detected in the Kent region of England. PHE also said that early evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of hospitalisation with Delta compared to Alpha, although more data is needed to have a more definitive view on that. “With this variant now dominant across the UK, it remains vital that we all continue to exercise as much caution as possible,” said Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive, UK Health Security Agency. “The way to tackle variants is to tackle the transmission of Covid-19 as a whole. Work from home where you can, and practice ‘hands, face, space, fresh air' at all times. If you are eligible and have not already done so, please come forward to be vaccinated and make sure you get your second jab. It will save lives,” she said. According to the breakdown of official figures, this week 278 people with the Delta variant attended hospital in an emergency. Last week, 201 people attended hospital. “Once again, the majority of these had not been vaccinated,” PHE said. The areas most affected by the Delta variant remain in the north west of England with Bolton, where cases have risen by 795 to 2149, and Blackburn with Darwen which has seen 368 new cases, bringing it to 724 in total. PHE said there are “encouraging signs” that the transmission rate in Bolton has begun to fall and that the actions taken by residents and local authority teams have been successful in reducing spread. Experts continue to urge people to “remain cautious” as the country approaches the next stage of the roadmap, with June 21 scheduled as a date for an end of all lockdown restrictions. “Variant cases are on the increase in several areas and it is absolutely crucial that everyone plays their part in preventing their spread,” PHE said. In Bolton, local teams have gone door to door in targeted areas on consecutive weekends to distribute test kits, share vital safety messages and encourage people to get the vaccine at a local drop-in centre. Take up of both testing and the vaccine was described as "positive". Blackburn with Darwen has also seen local teams making door-to-door visits, and over 10,000 additional PCR tests have been given out. Mobile testing units have been deployed to the area and wastewater sampling continues, in order to track the spread of the variant. PHE said its health protection teams continue to work with local authorities and schools to carry out surveillance of Covid-19 cases in schools to understand and reduce transmission in these settings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/covid-19-delta-variant-now-dominant-in-uk-as-cases-rise-by-5472-in-a-week/articleshow/83217328.cms||---

In Georgia, meanwhile, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a bill allowing it to appoint a board that can replace election officials. Trump loyalists who falsely insist he won the 2020 election are running for top election offices in several swing states. And after a pro-Trump mob staged a violent insurrection at the US Capitol to halt the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's election victory, Republicans banded together to block an independent investigation of the riot, shielding Trump from additional scrutiny of one of the darkest days of his administration.  To democracy advocates, Democrats and others, the persistence of the GOP's election denial shows how the Republican Party is increasingly open to bucking democratic norms, particularly the bipartisan respect traditionally afforded to election results even after a bitter campaign. That's raising the prospect that if the GOP gains power in next year's midterms, the party may take the extraordinary step of refusing to certify future elections.  "We have to face the facts that Republicans - obviously with exceptions - have become an authoritarian party," said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard political scientist and co-author of the book "How Democracies Die." "It's impossible to sustain a democracy in a two-party system when one of the parties is not willing to play by the rules of the game."  Republicans have already offered a preview of how they might operate. On Jan. 6, the day of the Capitol riot, a majority of House Republicans voted to overturn Biden's victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Biden still would have won an Electoral College victory without those states, but the move signaled how the traditionally ceremonial congressional certification process could be weaponized.  For his part, Trump continues to push Republicans to embrace his election lies. He's criticized his former vice president, Mike Pence, for fulfilling his constitutional duty to preside over the congressional certification of Biden's victory. And Trump has gone a step further recently by giving credence to a bizarre conspiracy theory that he could somehow be reinstated into the presidency in August, according to a longtime Trump ally who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.  There's no constitutional or legal mechanism for Trump to return to the presidency absent winning another election in 2024. Trump's argument that the last election was tainted has been roundly rejected by federal and state officials, including his own attorney general and Republican election leaders. Judges, including those appointed by Trump, also dismissed his claims.  But Levitsky and others warn there are several weak points in the U.S. system where a political party could simply refuse to allow its opponent to formally win a presidential election.  "I'm more concerned about this now than I was on Jan. 7," said Edward Foley, a law professor at The Ohio State University who studies election disputes. "It seems that, over the months, the lesson has not been 'never again,' but how to be more effective next time."  Still, even critics of the former president and the election paranoia he spread in his party say it's important not to blow risks out of proportion.  "This strikes me as being overblown," said Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and a Republican who has been sharply critical of Trump's election fraud claims.  Grayson said a comparable worry is that voting procedures have become a partisan issue like taxes and abortion, fomenting suspicion of election results. "Both sides are really amping up their rhetoric to amp up their bases," Grayson said, acknowledging that "there's clearly a lot more bad stuff going on on my side now."  Nonetheless, democratically elected officials were able to withstand that "bad stuff" in 2020, despite Trump's pressures. "When it came time for Republicans to do something in the 2020 election, most of those in power did the right thing," said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California-Irvine.  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp acknowledged Biden's win and resisted Trump's entreaties to overturn it. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey did the same in Arizona. And Mitch McConnell, who controlled the Senate on Jan. 6, gave a scorching speech condemning Trump's efforts to overturn the election. Only a handful of Republican senators voted to reverse Biden's victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania.  Still, Hasen said he doesn't want to sugarcoat things. "There are a lot of warning signs," he said. "It is a very dangerous moment for democracy."  Trump has sought revenge against Republicans who didn't back his attempt to overturn the election. He's backed GOP primary challengers to Kemp and Raffensperger - the latter is being challenged by Rep. Jody Hice, whom Trump recruited into the race and who voted to overturn the election in the House of Representatives.  Georgia's new elections bill strips Raffensperger of some of his election duties and gives the GOP-controlled state legislature the ability to replace local election officials. Arizona's Republican-controlled legislature stripped Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs of her role overseeing elections, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, who was at the Jan. 6 rally outside the Capitol and is a central proponent of the Arizona audit, is running for her position.  Levitsky said the United States' complex electoral system stands out among international democracies by vesting oversight of elections in local, partisan officials. "We rely a lot on local officials, and if one party decides not to behave, we are in for a world of trouble," he said.  Still, that system has worked for more than 200 years. "There are a lot of safeguards," Grayson said. "Now, we can blow through those safeguards and, if it comes down to one state like in 2000, you don't have all 50 safeguards."  Grayson also noted that voters make the final decision. The secretary of state candidates who argue Trump actually won in 2020 will have to win a Republican primary, then a general election to gain power. Congressional candidates may have to answer questions about whether they would seat a president of the opposite party.  "We are going to have these elections, and the voters are going to have to weigh in," Grayson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/donald-trumps-grip-on-gop-sparks-fears-about-democratic-process/articleshow/83217626.cms||---

Four people were rescued from the debris.  The irregular construction consisted of four small homes built atop one another, a spokesperson for the Fire Department said. City officials confirmed to The Associated Press in an email that the structure had no license.  Irregular constructions have long plagued Brazil, which is Latin America's largest nation.  The accident that occurred around 3 a.m. in Rio das Pedras, a working-class neighborhood, underscored the difficulties authorities run into trying to tamp down on illegal constructions in areas run by paramilitary gangs.  Paramilitary groups, commonly referred to as "militias" in Brazil, made up of former firefighters, police and soldiers, often take control of public land and build illegal housing to rent informally. Many people choose to live in such residences because they are cheaper.  "With me, militias are not going to build any more crap in this city," Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes said Thursday.  According to Rio's Department of Conservation, since January more than 180 irregular buildings have been demolished in the West Zone alone, and more than 150 notifications were also issued. A notification is the first step toward demolition, the department said.  City officials said they had blocked access to seven buildings close to the fallen structure, and all 20 of its residents were relocated.  Maria Augusto da Silva, who lives in the building opposite the one that collapsed, said she started screaming when she heard a terrifying noise in the middle of the night.  "I was desperate, I thought this was the end of the world," she said. "I asked God that it saved me and my family. But the noise kept going and going."  Once the street got quieter, she grabbed her two young grandsons and fled the house, making her way through the debris outside her doorstep.  The disaster echoed another deadly collapse in the city. In 2019, two condemned buildings that had been built without permits in an area run by illegal militia groups collapsed in Rio, killing two dozen people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/toddler-and-man-die-as-building-collapses-in-rio-de-janeiro/articleshow/83217996.cms||---
---||World||Biden expands blacklist of Chinese firms off-limits to US investors||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday expanded a blacklist of Chinese firms that are off-limits to American investors over their links to Beijing's "military-industrial complex," in a sign of Washington's continued pressure campaign against China. Former President Donald Trump had prohibited Americans from buying stakes in 31 Chinese companies that were deemed to be supplying or supporting China's military and security apparatus, and Biden's move expands the blacklist to 59. The latest batch of sanctions target companies involved in Chinese surveillance technology used to "facilitate repression or serious human rights abuses," which "undermine the security or democratic values of the United States and our allies," according to a White House statement. The initial list published under Trump included major telecoms, construction and technology firms such as China Mobile, China Telecom, video surveillance firm Hikvision, and China Railway Construction Corp. It was among a series of measures by the White House aimed at the Asian giant, which have left ties between the two countries severely strained. Before the US order was released, Beijing repeated its outrage at the Trump-era blacklist Thursday and vowed to protect Chinese companies' rights, claiming the blacklist was "politically motivated" and "ignores the facts and actual situation" of the firms involved. The ban "severely undermines normal market rules and order" and "damages... the interests of global investors, including US investors," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a routine briefing. Previously, the sanctions and choice of targets were tied to a congressionally mandated Defense Department report. While the Biden administration has pledged to take a more diplomatic line with China following the upheaval of his predecessor, he has said he will keep to a strict line on several issues including defense and technology. A tough line on China has rare cross-party support in Congress, with lawmakers determined to keep a lid on its growing global clout. Republican senators Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, alongside Democrats Gary Peters and Mark Kelly, published a bi-partisan letter earlier this week urging the administration to publish a new list. "The US government must continue to act boldly in blocking the Chinese Communist Party's economic predation against our industrial base," they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-expands-blacklist-of-chinese-firms-off-limits-to-us-investors/articleshow/83218144.cms||---
---||India||Covid: 25% doses allotted to private hospitals, but they account for only 7.5% of total jabs||NEW DELHI: The government's vaccination policy has reserved a 25% quota for the private sector, but analysis of actual inoculations till May 30 shows that private centres account for barely 7.5% of total doses administered. The proportion exceeds 10% in only 7 states/UTs and 80-odd of the 750 districts listed on CoWin. Even the little the private sector has done is concentrated in a few urban pockets, with just 25 districts in some of the country's largest metropolises accounting for 54% of all private vaccination. Live updates: CoronavirusIn almost 80% of districts, the public sector has provided over 95% of all vaccine doses so far. The private sector’s share is less than even 1% in half the districts, especially in predominantly rural areas and in the Northeast. The highest shares of private hospitals in vaccination are, not surprisingly, in urban mega sprawls like Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai with the Bengaluru municipal corporation (BBMP) area recording the highest share of the private sector, 44%. TOI downloaded data from the CoWin portal for over 1.6 lakh vaccination centres as of 7am on Sunday. The centres were then categorised into public and private and the data analysed to arrive at these numbers. The data is for all doses of vaccines administered from the start of the drive on January 16, about 20.8 crore doses, of which the private sector administered about 1.6 crore. Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage Of these 1.6 lakh centres, we were unable to clearly categorise a little over 17,000. But these accounted for barely 0.4%, or 9 lakh, doses administered and so would not change the picture significantly. Times ViewThe analysis raises questions about whether a 25% quota for the private sector is justified by actual on-ground delivery. It discriminates against rural and semi-rural populations — that’s over two-thirds of India — since the private sector is almost entirely limited to urban settings and within those, to the larger cities, one of the concerns flagged by the Supreme Court. In many ways, vaccines, which are said to reduce hospitalisation and guard against death, are even more necessary for a rural populace that has little or no access to health infrastructure. Also, how does it serve the larger objective of spurring vaccination and achieving ‘herd immunity’? If the pandemic should have taught the world one lesson, it is that no woman or man, nation or region is an island – and for urban Indians to believe that what happens in our villages will stay in our villages would be a fatal fallacy.The analysis raises questions about whether a 25% quota for the private sector is justified by actual performance. It also underlines that such a quota seems to be discriminating against semi-rural and rural populations since the private sector is almost entirely limited to urban settings and within them to the larger cities, one of the concerns flagged by the Supreme Court. Among states and UTs, the highest private sector share in vaccination (21%) was in Delhi, followed by Chandigarh (15%), Telangana(14%), Maharashtra(13%), Tamil Nadu (12%) and Karnataka (12%). However, even in Delhi, there were districts like northeast where 99.85% of vaccinations have been done in government centres. Similarly, even in the most urbanised state of Tamil Nadu, there are districts like Kallaikurichi, with a population of about 14 lakh, where the private sector hardly exists in the vaccination landscape. With rural India being home to over 65% of the country’s population, and hence being almost entirely dependent on the government for Covid vaccination, this raises the question of how giving the private sector such a big role is supposed to spur vaccination as argued by the Centre. In many ways, vaccines, which are said to reduce hospitalisation and severe disease, are even more necessary for the rural populace which has little or no access to health infrastructure and what there is of it is poor.

The president and Jill Biden - with a few Secret Service agents in tow - cycled the paved Cape Henlopen State Park trail near their Delaware beach home.  Well-wishers hooted and greeted the first lady with cheers and birthday greetings as the couple arrived at the trailhead near Gordons Pond beach. A smaller group sang "Happy Birthday" to her as she and the president finished up their ride on the 5.2-mile (8.4-kilometer) trail.  Jill Biden smiled and shouted, "Thanks!" as she and the president pedaled on toward their nearby house.  The president joined his wife at their beach house Wednesday evening to mark what a spokesperson for the first lady, Michael LaRosa, said would be a "quiet" birthday at their beach home. No family or friends were expected to join them.  The trip was a rare midweek getaway from the White House by a president. It also was Biden's first visit to the couple's vacation home since he took office in January.  The president is expected back at the White House on Friday.  Jill Biden, a longtime community college English professor, recently finished virtually teaching a course at Northern Virginia Community College. She won't be teaching over the summer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bidens-mark-first-ladys-birthday-with-leisurely-bike-ride/articleshow/83218346.cms||---

Data with the civic body shows that the south and east zones, known for industrial and housing clusters, which were problematic with surge in cases, have managed to reduce transmission drastically but the west zone — with the city’s posh localities and commercial hubs — is seeing an uptick in cases. The other zones, which reported a higher number of cases due to presence of industries, especially jewellery and trading houses, and dense housing, have been bringing cases under control. The east and north zones, which were both reporting 400-500 cases each a day in May last week, had brought them down to 178 and 231 cases respectively on Tuesday. “The drop in cases in those zones can be attributed to the decision to ban operations of all industries except those in essential services,” said city health officer Dr S Raja. “This cut the transmission of infection from one affected employee to another,” said a health department official. The corporation insisted that the positivity rate is below 30%. The civic body has been taking several control measures such as conducting 120 fever camps a day, trying to cover streets with new positive cases, widening containment in streets with more than three cases each and door-to-door surveillance of houses near new positive cases. “This is to identify those with early-stage symptoms such as fever and sore throat,” said Raja. The health department hopes the efforts will bear fruits in rural areas too, where the spike in cases is due to industrial clusters. Meanwhile, the commercially focused west zone has been reporting the maximum number of cases in Coimbatore district for the past six days. The health department, however, said the figures were not worrying. “We have to analyze whether the high numbers are because of an increase in sample collection in the zone or due to high positivity rate,” said Raja. “There has been no new cluster in the zone,” he said. During the first wave and beginning of the second wave in April, Coimbatore district saw many cases in R S Puram’s densely-populated residential areas, the crowded Poo Market and parts of Saibaba Colony. “Poo Market, Anna Market, Saibaba Colony Market, MGR Market and TK Market — all thickly populated areas — are in the west zone. The markets remained closed for the past three weeks which led to a drop in cases. This sudden increase in cases again could be an isolated incident and not necessarily a pattern,” said a corporation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cases-dip-in-industrial-hubs-but-coimbatore-has-other-red-zones/articleshow/83218469.cms||Pratiksha Ramkumar
---||World||Rate of HIV infections in US fell by 73% from 1981 to 2019: Study||WASHINGTON: New annual infections with HIV fell by 73 percent between 1981 and 2019, according to a new analysis by US health authorities released Thursday. But the proportion of infected minority Black and Latino people has risen, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which published its first report on the then-new and mysterious virus almost 40 years ago, on June 5. "Reductions are due to the decades-long work of and collaboration with scientists, patients, patient-advocates and communities," said CDC director Rochelle Walensky in a statement. She reflected on her experience as a young physician in Baltimore at the height of the epidemic when "all I had to give my patients was my outstretched hand and my presence at their bedside," before the mid-1990s when the first highly effective treatments were approved. There are an estimated 1.2 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus in the United States, about 13 percent of whom aren't aware they have the virus. According to the new report, annual HIV incidence increased from 20,000 infections in 1981 to a peak of 130,400 in 1984 and 1985. The rate stabilized between 1991 to 2007, with approximately 50,000-58,000 infections annually, and then decreased in recent years to 34,800 infections in 2019. But over time, disparities have widened. The proportion of HIV infections among Black people increased from 29 percent in 1981 to 41 percent in 2019, and among Hispanic people from 16 percent to 29 percent in the same period. Male-to-male sexual contact continues to account for the majority of infections: 63 percent in 1981 and 66 percent in 2019. Though there is no cure or vaccine, HIV medicine called antiretroviral therapy (ART) now exists that manages the virus and prevents it from causing AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Drugs called Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) are also available to prevent HIV transmission either before or after risky exposure, respectively. But while PrEP is 99 percent effective, only 23 percent of people who could benefit from it were using it in 2019. This included 63 percent of white people, but only eight percent of Black people and 14 percent of Hispanics. Routine screening and rapid tests have also helped drive the overall fall. "Prevention tools are increasingly effective, but they need to reach the populations most affected," the report said. Over half of new HIV infections are in the South, where attitudes are less open towards sexual health. New infections also remain high among transgender women and people who inject drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rate-of-hiv-infections-in-us-fell-by-73-from-1981-to-2019-study/articleshow/83218317.cms||---

The US also launched a vaccine sharing initiative where it would share 25 million doses with dozens of countries around the world, including India. The White House told journalists it would be lifting restrictions on export of components for AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, which will help SII to substantially increase vaccine production. "Spoke to @VP Kamala Harris a short while ago. I deeply appreciate the assurance of vaccine supplies to India as part of the US Strategy for Global Vaccine Sharing. I also thanked her for the all the support and solidarity from the US government, businesses and Indian diaspora,” PM Modi tweeted. Spoke to @VP Kamala Harris a short while ago. I deeply appreciate the assurance of vaccine supplies to India as par… https://t.co/r3kiqDseTG— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1622736055000An official readout of the Modi-Harris conversation said Harris briefed Modi about “US plans to make vaccines against Covid-19 available to other countries, including India, under its ‘Strategy for Global Vaccine Sharing’. The leaders discussed ongoing efforts to strengthen the health supply chain between the US and India, including in the area of vaccine manufacturing. They highlighted the potential of the India-US partnership as well as the Quad vaccine initiative in addressing the long-term health impact of the pandemic”. At a briefing, Jake Sullivan, the US NSA, said, “President made a commitment to ensure that India received doses and giving them an allocation not just under the regional portion of this through COVAX but an additional allocation from our discretionary portion...was something he wanted to do.” He said the US would share 80 million doses by the end of June, but that this is only the beginning of the US sharing vaccines with other countries without any pre-conditions.” According to a fact-sheet issued by the US, approximately 7 million doses would be sent to India and several other Asian countries. So while India will get only a relatively small number of doses, of greater importance is the opening up of the supply chains for Indian manufacturers. The White House announcement on Thursday came after US President Joe Biden announced his administration’s decision to distribute the first 25 million of 80 million AstraZeneca vaccines to a host of different countries around the world. The US has used a 1950 Defence Production Act to priorities vaccine supplies for American manufacturers. Today’s decision will lift that restriction. “We’re moving the DPA priority ratings for AstraZeneca, Novavax and Sanofi vaccines. This action will allow US-based companies to supply these to vaccine manufactures to make their own decisions,” said the White House Covid response team. The US decision will allow SII, which manufactures both the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, to swiftly increase production. India’s vaccine demand has become acute after a second surge of a mutant strain of the coronavirus took a heavy toll in the past seven weeks. Swift vaccination is seen to be the only way out of the pandemic. Serum currently produces about 65 million vaccines a month, but with a liberalised supply chain, will aim to produce over 100 million a month. The US decision will help India vaccinate its own population at a faster rate in the next few months when its own production is still accelerating. Many experts have said India would have to vaccinate close to 8 million a day to hope to get to a place where the majority of Indians are vaccinated, in order to put the virus in retreat. Equally important is the fact that India, as the world’s largest vaccine manufacturers, will have to go back to exporting vaccines — that would be one of the key goals for the Biden Administration as well. Top US officials had indicated to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during his recent visit to the US that they would help with the supplies, but that India had to resume its role as the vaccine manufacturer.

The bronze likeness of Edward Colston was pulled from its pedestal and dumped in Bristol harbor a year ago, sparking a nationwide debate about which historical figures deserve commemoration and about Britain's slave-trading history. City workers hauled the statue out of the water and have kept it in storage ever since.  The battered, paint-splattered statue is going on public display Friday at Bristol's M Shed museum alongside placards from the June 7, 2020 protest. It will be on show until Sept. 5, and visitors will be asked to complete a survey about "what happened that day and what you think should happen next," the museum said.  Responses will go to the We Are Bristol History Commission, which was set up after the protest. Options include removing the statue from public view, creating a museum or exhibition about the trans-Atlantic slave trade and restoring the statue to its plinth in the center of the city.  Some Bristolians have criticized toppling the statue as an act of historical vandalism, while others welcomed the removal of a stain on their community.  "We're using this opportunity to find out what local people think because we have to live in this city together," commission member Shawn Sobers, an associate professor at the University of the West of England, said.  "This display isn't trying to be from an idealistic position or from an ideological position and celebrating or commiserating. It's trying to be balanced," Sobers added.  The statue's felling was part of a worldwide reckoning with racism and slavery sparked by the death of a Black American man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in Minneapolis in May 2020.  Colston was a 17th-century trader who made a fortune transporting enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas on Bristol-based ships. His money funded schools and charities in Bristol, and his name adorned streets, schools and major buildings in the city 120 miles (195 kilometers) southwest of London. Many have been either renamed or made the subject of ongoing debate.  Bristol went on to become Britain's biggest port for slave ships during the early 18th century. Ships based in the city transported at least half a million Africans into slavery before Britain outlawed the slave trade in 1807.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/felled-uk-slave-trader-statue-displayed-city-mulls-its-fate/articleshow/83219161.cms||---

Though the HC issued summons to Ramdev on a plea by the Delhi Medical Association, it remained sceptical on the “maintainability” of the suit and at one stage said DMA “should be spending time on finding cure for the pandemic instead of wasting the court’s time.” The DMA has accused Ramdev of making statements against allopathic medicines and sought to restrain him from making such statements. But justice C Hari Shankar wondered if a suit can be filed under such circumstances since it was more in the nature of a PIL. “Tomorrow I may feel homeopathy is fake. Do you mean they will file a suit against me? Ramdev may be right or wrong. But I don’t think your allopathic profession is so fragile,” he pointed out, saying the yoga guru is entitled to freedom of speech protected under Art 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The HC, however, asked Ramdev’s counsel to tell him not to make any provocative statements and sought his reply on the suit in three weeks’ time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-restrain-ramdevs-free-speech-hc-in-allopathy-case/articleshow/83219156.cms||Abhinav Garg

It tops the list of districts across the country, vaccinating 29.4 lakh people with at least one dose. While the targeted population for vaccination in the tech capital is 99 lakh, a total of 36.3 lakh doses have been administered do far. Of this, 29.4 lakh have got the first dose and 6.9 lakh the second dose. Bengaluru district is followed by Mumbai, which has administered the first dose to 27.6 lakh persons out of its targeted population of 1.3 crore. These two cities are followed by Pune and Ahmedabad, which have jabbed around 20 lakh people with at least one dose. A review of the district-wise data from the Co-Win app, as on Thursday evening, points out that only 13 of the 726 districts across the country have vaccinated more than 10 lakh people with at least one dose. Delhi, with 11 districts in its fold, has administered the first dose to 42.9 lakh people and the second dose to 12.6 lakh persons. In the south, Chennai is the only city other than Bengaluru that finds a mention in the above 10-lakh list: It has vaccinated 15.5 lakh people with at least one dose out of its targeted population of 46 lakh. However, what has to be appreciated is the way in which Bengaluru managed to keep itself ahead on the vaccination front despite the healthcare infrastructure almost crumbling following a surge in the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ravaged-by-2nd-wave-but-bluru-tops-vaccination-list/articleshow/83219459.cms||Rakesh Prakash

The platform has “unleashed its digital prowess to unsuspecting existing users and would like to force them to accept the updated 2021 privacy policy by flashing such notifications at a regular intervals”, the affidavit said, adding the “game plan is very clear” that is the company wants to “transfer the entire existing user base committed to the updated 2021 privacy policy before the Personal Data Protection Bill becomes the law”. Backing a clutch of petitions challenging the platform’s revised privacy policy, the government has urged the HC to demand from it a record of the number of times such notifications have been sent out till date on daily basis to users and what was the conversion rate — that is how many have accepted the updated 2021 privacy policy vis-a-vis the number of notifications. It said WhatsApp is “currently having access to personal, sensitive and business data of hundreds of millions of Indian users and has also acquired the role of an ‘essential digital service’ during the pandemic” which is why its privacy policy and terms of service “should be examined on the touchstone of privacy principles as laid down in K S Puttaswamy judgment of the Supreme Court”. The affidavit also informs HC that the Competition Commission of India, in a recent “prima facie opinion”, said WhatsApp contravened legal provisions “through its exploitative and exclusionary conduct, in the garb of policy update”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whatsapp-trying-to-obtain-trick-consent-centre/articleshow/83219536.cms||Abhinav Garg

Bandyopadhyay, now CM Mamata Banerjee’s chief adviser, said he attended the meeting and then left on Mamata's instructions — to whom he used to "report" as the state chief secretary — to conduct and coordinate post-cyclone review meetings in East Midnapore. New chief secretary H K Dwivedi wrote a separate letter to the central department of personnel and training, stating that Bandyopadhyay retired from service on Monday — before the central government's second letter instructing him to report to Delhi’s North Block arrived. He had chosen not to accept the three-month extension given to him on May 24 before getting the second letter, Dwivedi’s letter mentioned. "Both replies have been sent," a senior state government officer confirmed. The Union home ministry had issued the notice to Bandyopadhyay on Monday, asking him to explain why action should not be taken against him under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, for not attending the PM’s review meeting on May 28. The state government has insisted that both the CM and the former state chief secretary had a brief interaction with the PM and left after seeking his permission, a point denied by the Centre. Mamata, too, wrote a five-page letter to PM Modi on Monday, saying it would be unfortunate if the Centre’s "vindictive and illegal" moves against Bandyopadhyay were part of its "anti-Bengal political vendetta after being rejected by Bengal’s voters in the assembly polls". Banerjee iterated on Wednesday that Bandyopadhyay enjoyed the Bengal government’s "full support... on whatever was going on with him". The Centre’s notice to Bandyopadhyay on Monday said the "PM and other members of his entourage" waited 15 minutes for state officers to arrive. The CM and her former chief secretary arrived when called and left "immediately". By abstaining from a meeting convened by the Modi, also the National Disaster Management Authority chairperson, Bandyopadhyay "refused to comply with the lawful direction of the central government" and violated sections of the law, the notice said. Senior officers in Bengal, however, countered this, saying Yaas had not been declared a "disaster" at the time and — even according to the Centre’s notice — Bandyopadhyay did not skip the PM’s review meeting. Besides, several people who were not part of the NDMA were invited to the meeting, too, they argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/former-bengal-chief-secretary-alapan-bandyopadhyay-didnt-abstain-from-pms-meeting/articleshow/83219929.cms||---
---||India||Lady who 'invited' Mehul Choksi rented home near us in 2020 in Antigua: Wife||NEW DELHI: As a top Caribbean court has ordered fugitive diamond trader Mehul Choksi to face charges of illegally entering Dominica from Antigua, his wife Priti on Thursday made a sensational claim that a “woman” Barbara who could be a “trap to bring him back to India” entered their life in August 2020 after she rented accommodation opposite their house, and led to Choksi’s “exit from Antigua”. Choksi, who is wanted in Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case, has been staying in Antigua since 2018. Priti also claimed that her husband told her that members of the boat’s crew included two Punjabi men, one of whom worked in Punjabi music videos. “On Sunday, May 23, my husband Mehul left home in a car to have dinner with a woman. She goes by three names, Barabara Joseph, Barabara Jesseick and Barbara C, and she would stay in the apartment intermittently. She had first met us last year between August 2-7 when she rented an apartment opposite us. My husband would meet her during his walks. She came back in April and wanted to go for walks with him. My husband was doing ‘Ayambil’ (Jain) fasting at the time and would get tired so couldn’t join her. She again came back in May and said that she is in house renovation business and her boss wanted to buy a property in Antigua so she invited Mehul for a meal. She even told him that she had studied at the London School of Economics,” Priti said. She further claimed the lady was staying at one “Curtain Bluff” hotel when she met them in April this year. “She asked Mehul to pick her up from her residence on May 23. Mehul’s car was running as he went inside the home. Front door of the home was open, so was the back door. He felt comfortable that he was not going into closed premises. Minutes later, 8-10 men in blue uniform, entered and said they want to take him for interrogation and put him into a boat. Another bigger boat was waiting at Jolly Harbour in Antigua which took him to Dominica,” she added. She claimed that by May 25, the boat going to Dominica had three crew and two passengers, apart from Choksi. “My husband told me that there were two men of Indian origin on the boat. We don’t who they worked for. Their names were Gurjit and Gurmit. One of them said he makes Punjabi videos and sang Punjabi songs. The other one lives in Birmingham. They were talking in front of my husband,” she said. While this boat was anchored for 24 hours, another man called Vivek would bring food supplies, Priti added. Priti claimed that the large boat -- named Calliope of Aine — with ownership of St Lucia, another Carribean country and is run by one Cobra Tours.-- could have ferried Choksi to Dominica. A second boat, Lady Anne, run by 'Hackshaw Boat Chartered Limited', could also be part of the journey. But she didnt clarify who ordered the boats. ?When asked if she or Mehul had any plans to return to India or why her husband was not cooperating with the Indian agencies including the CBI or the enforcement directorate, Priti refused to give a categorical answer. India has said it will continue to make all efforts to bring back Choksi at any cost. An eight-member multi-agency team, including officials from CBI and ED, from India had flown from Dominica to bring Choksi back.??Also, when asked about reports in the Carribean media that allege Choksi’s brother, Chetan Chinu Bhai, promised election funding to Dominica’s leader of opposition in exchange for pushing Choksi’s abduction theory, she did not give any categorical replies. Choksi’s Delhi-based lawyer Vijay Aggarwal however denied Chetan’s involvement, and said he only went to check “Choksi’s medical condition.” “Cant a brother travel to check the medical condition and offer support to his family member?” Aggarwal asked. Priti also skirted queries on whether Choksi or she had taken up any jobs in Antigua to earn their livelihood since they moved there in February 2018. She refused to divilge how they were they able to finance their life abroad. “Mehul only goes to a neighbouring temple and comes back by 7 pm. At most for fetching groceries. Our family in India supports us,” she sai||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/woman-who-mehul-choksi-met-in-20-laid-trap-says-wife/articleshow/83220237.cms||Rohan Dua
---||India||Christian Michel was ‘kidnapped’ like Mehul Choksi is being abducted now, says Agusta accused’s Delhi lawyer||LONDON/NEW DELHI: AgustaWestland helicopter scam accused Christian Michel's Delhi lawyer, Aljo Joseph, claimed on Thursday that Michel had been "kidnapped" and brought to India from Dubai in the same way that Mehul Choksi "was being kidnapped from Dominica". "Princess Latifa was handed over to the Dubai government as a quid pro pro for Michel and it was a kidnapping. That was upheld by the UN — the question is whether democratic countries working like this in quid pro pro and kidnapping can be permitted. Today what is happening in Dominica, again another kidnapping incident by the Indian government regarding Mehul Choksi," Joseph claimed at a Zoom press conference alongside Michel’s sons on Thursday. In New Delhi, senior ED officials debunked the charges levelled by Michel’s family, saying this was not the first time such claims had been made. Courts in India have repeatedly rejected Michel’s bail applications where he had made these claims, including that he was "abducted", was not safe in Indian jails due to the Covid-19 outbreak, and about not getting a fair trial, sources said. According to the ED chargesheet, AgustaWestland International Ltd, the UK subsidiary of Finmeccanica, paid euro 58 million (around Rs 423 crore) as kickbacks through Gordian Services Sarl, Tunisia and IDS Sarl, Tunisia. The money was further layered through multiple transactions in companies registered in different tax havens, including Tunisia, Mauritius, Dubai and Switzerland, and finally moved to beneficiaries in New Delhi, officials said. During its investigation, the ED had claimed Michel had routed more than Rs 6 crore to India, in Media Exim Pvt Ltd, a shell company, through his Dubai-based entity, Global Services FZE. The proceeds were then used to buy properties in Gurugram and Delhi, it had claimed. The ED has attached all these assets. Joseph accused the Indian government of "moving from a democratic set-up to totalitarianism". "In India all international extradition cases are prosecuted because of political reasons other than the legal reasons," he alleged. On November 27, 2020, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had issued an opinion ruling that Michel, who is in Tihar jail, was being arbitrarily detained by India and that "there was no legal basis for his arrest and detention" in Dubai and forced transfer to India. The UN called on India to release him by May 27, 2021. India at the time had said the opinion ruling was not legally binding. Michel has not been released. Michel’s French lawyer, François Zimeray, former French ambassador and MEP, speaking at the same event, called for the EU-India trade deal to be suspended since India had ignored the UN’s calls for Michel’s immediate release. "He was a European citizen when first detained arbitrarily so I will inform the EU and this could lead to a suspension of trade agreements between the EU and India. All our trade agreements are based on the assumption that fundamental rights are shared and respected and this is not the case. As a former diplomat I know how important political intervention can be in such cases. Michel has been jailed for political reasons. The (UN) opinion is not binding in itself but the opinion has highlighted violations of laws and treaties which are binding for India because they are part of the constitutional body of the Indian Republic," Zimeray said. "We are forgetting the real victims — apart from my father who is rotting in jail right now, those victims are my mother, brother, and sister aged 17," said Michel’s eldest son Alaric (26), who lives in the UK. Michel has not had phone contact with his family or lawyers for several weeks as the phone line in his prison has been disconnected as the phone bills have not been paid. "We don’t understand why they are doing this to him. I’m extremely concerned about his well-being and we have all seen the rising Covid cases in India, and he is locked up in isolation with real criminals and I have heard he is being undernourished and access to water is tough," Alaric said. "We can’t even go and see him as we are all scared of what could happen if we do. I am imploring the UK government (to) protect one of its own citizens from being unlawfully treated," Alaric said. "This isn’t any old man who just went to India. He spent 40 years of his life in India and basically sees it as his home country." His brother Alois Michel (24), who lives in France with his sister and mother, said: "Since the age of 24 my father has lived almost half of his life in India. He loves India. It is really sad to see how he is now." Michel was arrested in Dubai by the UAE authorities and extradited to India on December 4, 2018 in what his family and lawyers say was an exchange as part of quid pro pro for India returning Princess Latifa to Dubai in March 2018 after she had tried to escape her family. Indian authorities accuse Michel of paying bribes to Indian officials in connection with the conclusion of an €556.2 million contract between AgustaWestland and the defence ministry for 12 helicopters in 2010.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/christian-michel-was-kidnapped-like-mehul-choksi-is-being-abducted-now-says-agusta-accuseds-delhi-lawyer/articleshow/83220347.cms||---

IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said the slain terrorist, Muhammad Amin Malik, was being questioned at the Special Operations Group's base in Tral, around 45km from Srinagar, on Wednesday afternoon when he lunged at constable Amjad Khan, snatched his Kalashnikov rifle and opened fire indiscriminately. While Amjad was critically injured in the attack, a colleague who took a bullet in his chest was saved by his bulletproof vest. As Amin locked himself up in the room, every attempt to get him to surrender was greeted with a hail of bullets until he apparently ran out of ammunition. He refused to give himself up even at the pleading of his mother, the IGP said. "Sensing grave danger to the lives of the police personnel and to Amin himself, his mother and an executive magistrate were brought on the site in a bid to persuade him to throw away the weapon and surrender," the police said in an official statement. "After failing to ensure his surrender, the terror operative was engaged in a gunfight, following the rules and SOP of such engagement, and was neutralised." Amin had been arrested on May 30 with arms, ammunition, explosives, nine phones and other items used to make improvised explosive devices. Known to be an old Hizbul hand, he had been previously arrested once in 2003. His brother Shabir Malik, a member of the terror outfit Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind, was killed in an encounter with security forces in 2019. J&K police have instituted an inquiry into possible procedural lapses and dereliction of duty during Wednesday's interrogation of Amin, leading to the stand-off that culminated in his killing the next morning. "An inquiry panel headed by a senior officer has been tasked to find out how Amin managed to snatch a weapon and open fire at police personnel. The main responsible person (constable Amjad) has sustained injuries and is being treated at a Srinagar hospital," a spokesperson said. "The injured policeman will be questioned when he recovers." The inquiry will be completed in a fortnight. A case has already been registered at Tral police station and the slain terrorist's body sent to the police hospital in Srinagar for medico-legal formalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/arrested-terrorist-snatches-cops-ak-47-at-jk-police-base-shot-dead-after-12-hrs/articleshow/83220378.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In an email interview to TOI’sManash Gohain, he said the ministry has undertaken several initiatives to maintain continuity in education. Excerpts from the interview: Why were CBSE Class 12 Board exams cancelled?We had two major concerns while deciding on CBSE Class XII Board exams – safety and security of our students and their career. CBSE will now prepare Class XII results through well-defined objective criteria based on internal assessment. The safety and security of students can only be ensured by keeping them at home. The PM took a student-centric decision. How is the ministry preparing if there is another wave later in 2021 or 2022?We have been committed to ensuring quality education for our children and taking several initiatives to maintain continuity in education even during these odd circumstances. I have held meetings with the state education secretaries and directors of IITs, NITs, IIITs and IISERs. I emphasised reaching out to the most vulnerable and marginalised children to ensure that they face no impediment while pursuing education. What kind of assistance is the Centre giving to states to mitigate academic losses?As far as the financial assistance is concerned, the ministry has approved Rs 667 crore for Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Rs 26 crore for DIKSHA and Rs 267.91 crore for training of teachers in online mode for all states/UTs during 2020-21 under Samagra Shiksha. While an ad hoc grant to the tune of Rs 5,228 crore had already been released to states under Samagra Shiksha, it was decided to release an additional Rs 2,500 crore to ensure that students continue to receive online education. With one more academic year likely to be affected by the pandemic, what is the government doing to bridge the digital divide?In the wake of unprecedented challenges amid the Covid pandemic, we have undertaken several initiatives. PM E-Vidya was launched to provide multi-modal access to education. DIKSHA (one nation-one digital platform) has been made available for grades 1-12. Through ‘one class-one TV channel’ of SWAYAM Prabha, one dedicated channel for each of the classes from 1 to 12 provides access to quality education. Online courses have also been uploaded on the SWAYAM portal. Radio broadcasting has been used in remote areas. CBSE also prepared its podcast platform entitled ‘CBSE-Shiksha Vani’ to disseminate information on the Board’s activities. We undertook measures to expand e-learning in higher education by liberalising open, distance and online education regulatory framework. UGC integrated the Online and Distance Learning Regulations under which the top 100 universities in the National Institutional Ranking Framework or those with 3.26 or above National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) grades were permitted to provide online courses without prior permission. This provided enhanced opportunities to nearly seven crore students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-took-student-centric-step-in-cancelling-class-12-exams/articleshow/83220426.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

The CM expressed satisfaction over the presentation of the proposed alignment for connecting the two museums. He instructed the officials concerned to take special care of the ambitious project. Nitish said the connectivity of both the museums would help in understanding the enriching and glorious history of Bihar in a better manner. The total length of the subway connection will be 1.4km (approximetely 1.395km) and the tunnel itself will be a sort of art gallery, which will be decorated with different forms of artworks on wall, including murals and Madhubani painting. The CM also reviewed the presentation of Meethapur pond project and solid and wet waste management project under ‘Saat Nischay Part-II’ of the state government. Nitish also appreciated the Mithapur pond project and directed the officials concerned to plant more and more saplings around the pond. “Solid and wet waste management plan is also good and it should be implemented soon,” he said. Giving emphasis on cleanliness, the CM said the waste management project would further improve the sanitation of all the cities of the state. Earlier, UDHD principal secretary Anand Kishor gave a detailed information about all three projects through a presentation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/interlinking-of-museums-to-help-know-states-rich-past/articleshow/83212861.cms||Faryal Rumi

While the total internet user base of India grew 20% in 2018 and 24% in 2019, in 2020 there was just 8% growth, according to an IAMAI-Kantar ICUBE study released on Thursday. This was primarily due to a dip in new mobile connections because of lockdown restrictions last year and the mass movement of migrants. Telecom regulator Trai’s estimates show that the number of mobile connections fell 0.7%, 0.5% and 0.3% respectively in April, May and June 2020. The active internet user base (those who have accessed the internet in the last one month) stood at 622 million individuals as of 2020, and this pool grew faster in rural India at the rate of 13% to reach 299 million compared to a 4% growth rate in urban India, which had 323 million users. However, as of 2020, nine out of 10 active internet users accessed the web every day, and on average spent around 107 minutes actively on it — a growth of almost 21% from the previous year. This is also one of the highest single-year growths compared to preceding year. While the number of users did not grow at the same pace as previous years, the frequency of usage and the number of activities engaged in on the internet went up in 2020, Kantar executive VP (insights division) Biswapriya Bhattacharjee said. “Hence, the digital divide widened a bit more in the year,” he added. As many as 96% of active users used the internet for entertainment-related activities during the year, followed by online communication (text, voice & video chats, emailing, etc.) and social media at 90% and 82% respectively, the study showed. The rise of online gaming and digital payments were more pronounced in 2020, it added. “We observed significant changes in sources of entertainment for users with more people getting on to OTT platforms compared to video streaming platforms earlier. The frequency of use of communication apps also increased,” Bhattacharjee said. Mobile phones remain the most used device for accessing the internet on the back of cheaper data plans and growing prevalence of Indic language content on the world wide web. Out of the 622 million active internet users in India, 58% are male and remaining female. “The internet user market is still a male preserve in India, underlining digital gender gap. However, the gender digital divide is now closing,” the study noted. It estimated that by 2025, there will be over 900 million active internet users in India with the 3Cs — communication, commerce and content — driving growth. Rural India and new connections among school-age children for online learning will fuel growth of about 45% in the next five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fewer-new-net-users-but-surfing-up-in-2020/articleshow/83214904.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The CM, who reviewed the activities of social welfare department, asked the officials concerned to implement all the schemes with commitment and complete dedication. He also stressed on the schemes being implemented for women’s uplift and pointed to the recent measure taken to provide 33% reservation to girl students in medical and engineering colleges of the state. The CM recalled the steps taken by his government for the empowerment of women. He also asked the Women Development Corporation (WDC) to make sustained efforts to raise popular awareness and propagate the need for the eradication of child marriage and dowry. He said discussions on the theme should be organised in every village, town and muhalla by involving Jeevika members, locals and civil society groups. He asked the building construction department to complete the construction of old-age shelter homes in 12 districts. Earlier, while additional chief secretary of the social welfare department Atul Prasad made a detailed presentation on the achievements of the department, WDC managing director Harjot Kaur presented the update and status of the schemes meant for the uplift of women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/welfare-of-women-govts-priority-cm/articleshow/83212883.cms||Abhay Singh

The girl’s father, belonging to Scheduled Caste community, had lodged an FIR against a youth Pappu Khan (23), with Chandradeep police station on Wednesday alleging that he had kidnapped his minor daughter and married her after forcibly converting her religion. The father also alleged that when they went to Pappu’s house to bring her back, they hurled abuses, opened fire, chased them and looted some jewellery and cash from his house. Chandradeep police station SHO Ashish Kumar, quoting the FIR said, “The girl went missing on the night of May 23 and the family came to know about her marriage with Khan on May 30. The girl’s statement was recorded by police on Thursday. She will be produced before a judicial magistrate to record her statement separately on Friday, following which necessary action would be taken.” Pappu is, however, evading arrest, the SHO added. Jamui Sadar SDPO Rakesh Kumar said that though the minor’s parents have mentioned her age as 15 years, she seems to be of around 19. The SDPO said a medical board will be formed to ascertain her age. “It seems to be a matter of love affair. The girl was married to a person at Dhankaur in Sheikhpura by her parents on May 19. However, her husband denied to keep her after coming to know about her affair with Pappu. She returned home and married Pappu in the village,” the SDPO said. The SDPO said the girl has told police that she had willingly married Pappu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kidnapped-girl-rescued/articleshow/83212926.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The index is just about 300 points away from its all-time peak of 52,526, touched in intraday trade on February 16 this year. The Nifty is already at a new all-time high at near the 15,700 points level as sliding new daily Covid infection numbers and also dipping positivity rate lifted investor sentiment on Dalal Street. The current rally is a broad-based one as is evident from its spread: Along with the sensex, even BSE’s Midcap and Smallcap indices hit record intraday peaks on Thursday at 22,395 points and 24,138 levels, respectively. As a result investors’ wealth, measured by BSE’s market capitalisation too settled at a record peak at nearly Rs 229 lakh crore. The sensex, since scaling its all-time high level in mid-February, had touched an interim low at about 47,700 mark in the third week of April, but has since been on an northward journey, despite net selling by foreign funds and muted global cues in recent days. According to Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, in recent days global cues were mixed as investors weighed inflation concerns ahead of key US economic data while oil prices rose to near one-and-a-half year highs. “On the domestic side, Nifty, after two days of flat closing, scaled to new highs as consistent falls in daily Covid-19 cases, and a stronger rupee, kept market mood upbeat.” The sentiments were buoyant despite Services PMI contracting in May for the first time in eight months, Khemka wrote in a post-market note.  Dalal Street would be looking at the outcome of RBI’s policy meeting on Friday. The central bank’s main policy making body is expected to keep rates unchanged but may come out with some new measures to support the economy battered again by the Covid second wave in India. Investors, however, would be keenly watching what the RBI has to say about the inflation in the economy which has, in recent times, been sticky at an elevated level. For the next few weeks investors will be closely watching how states lift Covid-related restrictions which are in place now, how the vaccination drive of the government picks up pace and then how the economy tries to make a comeback. Technically, the Nifty is on course to scale the 16,000 level. “For the Nifty, 15,550/15,600 are the support levels. However, the resistance is close to 15,750/15,800. The 15,770/15,780 levels could be a big hurdle,” said Shrikant Chouhan, executive VP (equity technical research) at Kotak Securities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-closes-at-record-peak-of-52232-as-covid-cases-drop/articleshow/83216684.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Colleges wait for CBSE XII formula before deciding on entrance cut-offs||Kolkata: Vice-chancellors, principals and students are all keenly waiting for CBSE to come up with the formula, based on which Class-XII candidates’ marks will be calculated. With the CBSE board exams being cancelled, the central board formula and the scores are likely to impact the entire college admission process. For the past few years, higher marks being awarded by CBSE has been pushing up admission marks cut-offs in top and universities colleges in Kolkata as well as Delhi, where several students from the city apply for undergraduate courses. Scores secured by CBSE Class XII boards candidates in 2020 had been unprecedented, with a record number of students passing the exams and more than double the number scoring 95% and above. The number of students securing 90% and above, but less that 95%, was also very high. Marks were awarded based on their scores in the best performing subjects as some papers had to be cancelled owing to the nationwide lockdown last year. “These are extraordinary times and we must respect the decision by the two boards. A lot will depend on how the two boards will assess the students because it will impact the cut-offs for admissions,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. Many colleges have already held discussions with their senior teachers and experts to devise a formula for a level playing field for every applicant. Last year, colleges struggled to fill seats because many students, who had scored high marks because of the “lockdown formulae” by different boards and councils, had applied for subjects they did not really want to study. Even when their names started figuring on the merit lists of those subjects, the candidates did not take admission, forcing colleges to re-invite applications from only interested candidates. Principals pointed out that the past couple of years, the state board had also been awarding marks generously so that its students could compete with their counterparts from other boards and councils. “It is true CBSE has been awarding very high marks over the past few years, which is pushing up the cut-offs in good colleges. This created problems for others. But for the past couple of years, even HS has started marking generously.” said Tapan Kumar Poddar, president of the Calcutta University chapter of All Bengal Principals’ Council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-wait-for-cbse-xii-formula-before-deciding-on-entrance-cut-offs/articleshow/83216960.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The Kalyani Medical Teachers’ Association has, in several letters to the Bengal government, said that the 200-odd staffers, including faculties and medics, who are treating Covid patients continue to do so even after being denied the help extended to other state doctors. According to sources, the state health secretary and other top officials have assured them of resolving the issue. “The issue is known to the Bengal government. The hospital is under the administrative control of WBUHS and the matter is being looked into,” a senior official said. According to a section of the faculty, the teachers and medics have been stressing that they be brought under the West Bengal Health Scheme like other state doctors. WBHS allows reimbursement of indoor treatment cost at empanelled hospitals within the state and at nine hospitals outside Bengal. It allows for Rs 1 lakh cash-less facility for indoor treatment. “Several doctors who suffered from Covid while treating others had to pay for their own treatment. A couple of months ago, a nurse died and her kin got no Covid help, which the state gives to all,” a faculty member said. “Also, while the pay scale of all state employees has been revised from January 2020, we continue to get the 2009 scale. Even our retirement age is60 unlike the state retirement age of 65. Due to the latter issue, two very senior medics who have worked throughout the pandemic are set to retire in a couple of months,” another faculty member said.“The WBUHS has been reticent in taking up these issues, so representations have been made to the CM and top state officials seeking intervention,” a faculty member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-promise-after-kalyani-hosp-staff-demand-cov-cover/articleshow/83217032.cms||---

While rejecting the petition, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia granted two weeks to these hospitals to make proper arrangements for their patients and shift them to other facilities. It asked the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation not to initiate action against these hospitals and clinics before June 17. This was after AMA’s request that patients were taking treatment in these hospitals, some of which were designated Covid hospitals, and taking action against them would be harsh in this pandemic. AMA sought time to accommodate patients being treated in these hospitals. In this case, AMA with 44 of its members had approached the HC after AMC issued notices that the hospitals would be sealed as it did not have valid BU permissions. In this case, AMA with 44 of its members had approached the HC after AMC issued notices that the hospitals would be sealed as it did not have valid BU permission. These 44 hospitals, including 11 children hospitals and eight maternity homes, had BU permission for residential purposes and not for commercial use. AMC began issuing notices after HC ordered for action against hospitals that do not have fire NOC and building use permission. This happened after petitioneradvocate Amit Panchal filed a PIL after a fire tragedy killed eight Covid-19 patients in Shrey Hospital in August 2020. A couple of hospitals – Jagmohan Hospital Pvt Ltd in Navrangpura and Pushpam Hospital in Sabarmati – were even partially sealed by AMC. The hospitals and AMA requested Gujarat high court to ask the muncipal corporation to grant relaxation by delaying its action or granting more time to obtain BU permission for commercial use. However, AMC stuck to its stand that a public notice was issued on February 22 and then individual notices were given to these hospitals. It said there was no point in granting relaxation because the cause falls in ‘individual interest’ and not in public interest. After hearing the case, the high court said that AMA is not a registered organisation and since it is not affected by AMC decision, it cannot invoke extraordinary jurisdiction of the HC. The court noticed that the municipal commissioner has powers under section 268 of the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporations (GPMC) Act to vacate any building after giving notice, if such building or a portion of it is unlawfully occupied in contravention of Section 263. Also, none of these hospitals have valid building use permission. The high court also cited a Supreme Court observation that if a law is enacted but is not being voluntarily obeyed, then it has to be enforced, otherwise infringement of law, which is actively or passively condoned for personal gain will be encouraged which will in turn lead to a lawless society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-clears-way-to-seal-44-hospitals-sans-valid-bu-permission/articleshow/83215643.cms||---

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das will announce the decision of the monetary policy committee on Friday at a time when many believe that the central bank has run out of ammunition. “It is going to be a hold policy on pretty much every parameter,” said Axis bank chief economist Saugata Bhattacharya. According to Bhattacharya, the RBI is expected to hold the repo rate, retain its accommodative stance and also continue with its government bond purchase programme for around Rs 1 lakh crore. “What we are looking for is a change in the growth and inflation forecast,” said Bhattacharya. The RBI has already acknowledged the downside risks to its forecast of 10.5% due to the second wave of the pandemic. Yes Bank chief economist Indranil Pan said, “We do see a realistic chance for the RBI to reduce its earlier growth forecast of 10.5% and highlight increasing risks to the downside. Further, the RBI will continue to pursue its broad intent of plugging weak spots in the economy and ensure adequate liquidity flows to various segments.” According to Pan, the room available for traditional monetary policy is increasingly becoming constricted. “In the absence of any further opportunity to cut rates, we expect the RBI to continue to use its balance sheet to keep financial market conditions easy.” Most growth forecasts for the Indian economy are now in single digits. Most recently, rating agency Moody’s pegged India’s GDP growth in FY22 at 9.3%. Markets are also waiting to see what advice the governor gives the government. The Union Budget proposed to stimulate demand by allocating a large amount to infrastructure. Given that demand is likely to get hit because of loss of livelihood and additional medical expenditure in urban and rural areas, there is a feeling that the government should divert some funds for relief. With the pandemic hurting economic activity in the first quarter, there are fears of more loans going bad. This could call for some relief measures. “The RBI in its Financial Stability Report had projected NPAs (non-performing assets) to increase to 13.5% by September 2021 (baseline scenario). There have been reports that collections in the NBFC (non-banking finance companies) space have been low amidst regional lockdowns. Despite this issue, the silver lining is that due to fund-raising activities, the banks are well capitalised and the provision coverage is adequate,” said Care Ratings in a monetary policy report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-may-hold-rates-tweak-its-forecast-for-growth/articleshow/83216360.cms||---

The CM also flagged off four vans for Covid tests. The vans later left for different locations in the state from Sardar Patel Bhawan here. The CM congratulated the health department for introducing movable and on the spot vaccination facility in the urban areas. He said vaccination through 118 vans was already being done in villages. “People can now avail the vaccination facility sitting at home. Their details will be recorded and they will also be alerted about the second dose of vaccine. Our aim is to vaccinate maximum number of people and work in this regard is being done at all levels. The Centre has also assured us of providing sufficient vaccine doses. The vaccination drive is being carried out in the state in cooperation with the Centre,” the CM, who flagged the vans virtually from his 1, Anne Marg residence, said. The CM also praised the initiative of the health department to conduct Covid tests through movable vehicles. Nitish advised the people to remain caution despite drop in Covid cases. “All possible steps to protect people from the deadly virus are being taken. Apart from the health department, officials of other departments are also on their toes to fight the virus. Steps are being taken on the basis of feedback received from ministers in charge of different districts,” Nitish said. Principal secretaries to CM Deepak Kumar and Chanchal Kumar and secretary Anupam Kumar were also present on the occasion. Deputy CMs Trakishore Prasad and Renu Devi, health minister Mangal Pandey and department’s additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit joined the programme through videoconference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-flags-off-121-vans-for-inoculation-of-45-people/articleshow/83213585.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The nodal officer for Covid-19 management at Bhagalpur-based Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital, Dr Hem Shanker Sharma, urges the government to intensify the ongoing vaccination drive among the adults. “Although vaccine trials are underway for both children and pregnant women, their inoculation drive is yet to be launched. Therefore, we need to vaccinate 60% of the adults before the third wave of the pandemic hits the state,” Dr Sharma says. Echoing similar views, Dr Sandip Lal, president of the Bhagalpur chapter of the Indian Medical Association, points out that all adults should receive Covid vaccine shots as soon as possible. “If a huge population is vaccinated, attaining herd immunity is possible. It will also lower the chances of spreading the infection among children,” he adds. Herd immunity is when a large part of the population is immune to a contagious disease. With a view to attracting more people to the vaccination centres, Dr Lal and other doctors are raising awareness about the importance of inoculation through posters, banners and messages on medical prescriptions. The district immunization officer, Dr Manoj Choudhary, claims, “We have intensified the vaccination drive in the urban as well as the rural areas of Bhagalpur. Our target is to inoculate nearly 14 lakh adults as soon as possible.” Only 3.5 lakh adults above the age of 18 years have been vaccinated in the district since January 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccinate-60-of-adults-before-third-covid-wave-hits-bihar/articleshow/83213659.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: CAT leap for farmer’s son from penury to IIM-Ranchi||AHMEDABAD: Nisarg Chaudhary, 24, son of a marginal farmer from Ravalpura village of Mehsana district, has secured admission in Indian Institute of Management – Ranchi after he cracked the Common Admission Test (CAT) exams earlier this year. His first priority after completing his education will be to redeem the family land by clearing the debt, he says . The family owns two-acre agricultural land in the village which is under mortgage for education loan.  Chaudhary remembers the time after the personal interview (PI), the final stage before getting admission for the flagship PGP programme at IIM-A. “I was eagerly waiting for results. I had gone through various websites, done research about colleges and joined several social media groups. My name was in the wait list when the results were declared. I did not lose hope,” he said. Then one afternoon, he received an admission letter from IIM-Ranchi via e-mail. “The priceless smile and the tears of my parents are something which I will forever cherish. It was the best moment for my parents after my birth,” he said. This was Chaudhary’s second attempt for CAT. Last year, he cleared the exam and also received interview calls from some reputable B-schools but not from any of the IIMs. So, he attempted again this year and found success. Chaudhary, who did his B Com from H L College of Commerce and schooling from Sahajanand College in Ahmedabad, said taking CAT exams amid Covid-19 was not easy. He has been at his village for over a year now due to Covid-19 situation. “In between my study breaks I had to feed cattle or help my parents at the farm. I even cooked at times. Two months before the test, the exam pattern changed,” he said adding that life is about dealing with uncertainties. “Nisarg’s determination to get into one of the IIMs was very strong. It has helped him in a big way,” according to his mentor, Anand Deolase. Although his comman over spoken English may need some sharpening, it was his attitude that seemed to have mattered for the interview. In the future, Chaudhary wants to work towards breaking the myths about MBA in rural areas. Deolase said there is a lack of awareness in rural areas and there will be more like Chaudhary who can find success if shown the right path.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cat-leap-for-farmers-son-from-penury-to-iim-ranchi/articleshow/83215493.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Patna||BJP issues notice to its MLC for criticising CM||PATNA: The BJP on Thursday served a show-cause notice on its MLC from Siwan district Tunna Ji Pandey for his critical remarks against CM Nitish Kumar and reprimanded him for indulging in “anti-party activities”. State BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel said Pandey has been asked to explain why his statements issued periodically, including against CM Nitish Kumar, and his stand on former RJD MP from Siwan late Mohammad Shahabuddin be not deemed as anti-party activities. “He has been asked to submit the reply in 10 days,” Patel said, adding the party will take “proper action” against Pandey only after receiving his reply. Pandey, on his part, said, “Whatever I have said is the truth. I will explain to the party the basis of my criticism of the CM. I have made such statements at least on 20-25 occasions in the past.” It is being felt that the state BJP leadership may suspend Pandey’s party membership and also expel him from the party. This, however, is unlikely to make any tangible impact on Pandey, as his six-year term as MLC expires next month. His younger brother Bachcha Pandey is an RJD MLA from Barharia in Siwan district. The JD(U) leadership has taken umbrage at Pandey’s criticism of Nitish, since he, in the past, called him ‘paristhiti ka mukhyamantri (CM born out of certain circumstances),’ alluding to the observation made by Shahabuddin, who died recently in the Tihar jail due to coronavirus infection. On Wednesday, Pandey had tweeted, “During the 2020 assembly elections, people of the state gave mandate to Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, but Nitish Kumar has continued to hold CM’s post by misusing the government machinery.” Earlier, JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha had assailed state BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal for his “persistent silence” on Pandey’s statements. “This statement of Pandey must also have reached you…Had a JD(U) leader made the same kind of statement against the BJP or its leadership, what would have been your reaction?” Kushwaha tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-issues-notice-to-its-mlc-for-criticising-cm/articleshow/83212942.cms||Abhay Singh

The third edition of SDG index, which evaluates progress of states and Union territories on social, economic and environmental parameters, was released on Thursday. As per the SDG India Index, which has been developed in collaboration with the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI), United Nations in India and Global Green Growth Institute, Bihar scored 52 out of 100 marks on different parameters. Bihar was in “performer” category (with scores in the range of 50-64) along with Jharkhand (56), Assam (57), Arunachal Pradesh (60), Meghalaya (60), Rajasthan (60), Uttar Pradesh (60), Chhattisgarh (61), Nagaland (61) and Odisha (61). The 16 SDG index include SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger) SDG3 (good health and wellbeing), SDG4 (quality education), SGD5 (gender equality), SGD6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), SGG8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG10 (reduce inequalities), SGD11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), SDG15 (life on land) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). As per the SDG dashboard, Bihar’s performance has improved in hunger, health and wellbeing, education, gender equality, water and sanitation, cities and communities and justice and institutions. The state’s performance deteriorated in poverty, work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure and reduction of inequalities. The categories in which state’s performance have been the lowest include poverty, hunger, gender equality, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduction of inequalities and climate action. Asked for a comment on Bihar’s performance, deputy CM Renu Devi said improvement of two points despite the Covid pandemic over the last one year shows a positive sign of efforts being made by the state government. “Bihar is a highly populous state faced with limited resources. Besides, we faced two back-to-back waves of Covid pandemic and the resultant lockdowns. It created pressure on state’s fiscal health. We are, however, managing to overcome the stress on all fronts. We are sure that Bihar will improve its SDG ranking in the coming years under the dynamic leadership of CM Nitish Kumar in the state and PM Narendra Modi at the Centre,” she told this newspaper. Sudhanshu Kumar, an economist at Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI)m, said, “One constraint that the states at the bottom face is the per capita availability of resources that the government can spend on development priorities. In the absence of a significant private sector in Bihar, the sole responsibility to carry out expenditures on the activities that can improve the performance on these indices is with the government.” Kumar added, “Nevertheless, with its limited resources, the state can tweak and reorient its policy priorities to perform better in the coming years. The state government has emphasised a series of interventions related to sanitation, safe drinking water and environment and these massive schemes can improve the ranking in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-worst-performer-in-sdg-india-index/articleshow/83212885.cms||Piyush Tripathi

A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar gave time to the hospital to file a reply in this connection by fixing June 9 as the next date of hearing. The bench was hearing a batch of three PILs filed by Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh on the grim pandemic situation when a status report about the hospital was submitted. The high court was apprised about a 217-bed Covid-dedicated facility running at ESIC hospital with the support of the state government which is ensuring supply of oxygen and medicines to the hospital besides ensuring proper hygiene, sanitation and disposal of biomedical waste there with the help of a private firm. However, the high court was keen to know if the three-tier system of state, army and ESIC which was started at the hospital still requires there. The bench also directed the state government to upgrade the system that details about deaths caused by Covid and other reasons in urban and rural areas and place RT-PCR test reports on one platform instead of showing them on separate government portals. The court also directed the state government to update the figures daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-to-esic-hospital-do-you-still-need-govt-support/articleshow/83213934.cms||Debashish Karmakar

At least two such incidents have been recorded in the state in the last 10 days. A woman constable of Bihar Special Armed Police (erstwhile Bihar Military Police), Rita Kumari (31), allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself with the help of a rope at her house at Soyra village under the Dalsinghsarai police station area in Samastipur district on Wednesday. Rita’s two sons – 3-month-old Sudhanshu and three-year-old Priyanshu – have now become orphans. SHO (incharge) of Dalsinghsarai police station Jainendra Sharma said Rita’s husband Manjeet Kumar (35) had died of Covid at home on May 11. Manjeet was mukhiya of Nagargama panchayat. On May 25, a 24-year-old engineering graduate, Palima Singh, had allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan at her home in Mainpura under the Patliputra police station area in Patna. Palima’s mother had died of Covid on April 24. Dr Harimohan Kumar, who is on Covid-19 duty at Patna Medical College and Hospital, said attendants need to be counselled too. “There is a need to mentally prepare them to face any eventuality. These incidents are the fallout of extreme emotional attachment or dependence on someone. Such people feel that nothing more is left for them after the death of their loved ones,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-cop-kills-self-as-hubby-dies-of-covid/articleshow/83212987.cms||Debashish Karmakar

District magistrate Abhishek Singh, who conducted inspection of the hospital on Wednesday, issued instructions to keep all equipment in functional mode for the next three months. During inspection of ICU and NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) of paediatric ward, he asked to ensure cleanliness and uninterrupted power supply, availability of oxygen and medicines for AES/JE patients. The DM said, “During the next three months, cases of AES/JE are likely to be reported. Even during the next 15 days, the heat wave condition is also likely to aggravate. So, identify separate ward for treatment of heat wave patients.” In view of the approaching monsoon, the DM suggested for construction of three feet high retaining wall along the road to curb waterlogging problem near mother-child hospital (MCH) unit and the ear-nose-throat (ENT) ward. MCH has been made separate ward for Covid patients, while ENT ward was identified to admit mucormycosis patients. Heavy rains on May 27 due to the effect of Yaas cyclone had resulted in waterlogging near MCH unit and water entered in the ENT ward causing problems for patients and their attendants. The DM suggested for construction of concrete drain with chamber at many places as a long-term solution to the waterlogging problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/anmmch-gears-up-for-je-aes-patients/articleshow/83213257.cms||---

Towards this end, it will focus on offering loans for green products like electric vehicles at lower rates and incorporate ESG (environment, social & corporate governance) scores into its credit decisions. To fund these environment-friendly segments, the bank would look at floating Green Bonds which attract socially conscious investors who want their money to be deployed in only green projects. Officials said that it was too early to say whether this would have any impact on lending to the fossil fuel industry in future. For now, the bank would focus on reducing its emissions, energy, and water consumption. It will continue to incorporate and scale up the use of renewable energy into its operations. Last year, Deutsche Bank had said that it would end global business in coal mining by 2025. This is part of its new fossil fuels policy that provides its divisions with a strict framework for their business activities involving coal, oil and gas. This covers not only credit but also fund-raising through capital markets. HSBC Bank has announced that it would phase out financing of coal-fired power and thermal coal mining by 2030 in the European Union and OECD markets. Last month, DBS Bank committed to zero thermal coal exposure by 2039.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-targets-to-be-carbon-neutral-by-2032/articleshow/83216097.cms||Mayur Shetty

The company’s shares have seen a strong rally over the past one year, suggesting investor confidence in its strategies under new CEO Thierry Delaporte. Shares of the Azim Premji-owned company opened at Rs 546 on the BSE on Thursday, before touching an intra-day high of Rs 550, which took its market cap to a shade over Rs 3 lakh crore. The stock, however, pared the gains to close at Rs 539, down less than 1% from Wednesday’s close. “We believe Wipro’s strong full services capabilities across applications, infra, BPS (business process services) and engineering will help in winning integrated deals, and help win large deals as seen in recent quarters. Hence, we expect the company to register 21% YoY dollar revenue growth in FY22E (of which 13% is organic and rest through acquisition) and 13% YoY in FY23E,” ICICI said in a note to investors. Wipro touched the Rs 1 lakh crore mark in December 2009 and then it took almost 11 years to breach the Rs 2 lakh crore mark, which was achieved in October last year. The next benchmark came in just 9 months. The performance under the previous two CEOs, Abidali Neemuchwala and T K Kurien, were far from remarkable, unlike those of some of Wipro’s peers. Growth was sluggish with bets on sectors like energy and healthcare going awry due to macroeconomic conditions and change in policies in the US. Delaporte redefined the service lines for better focus and trimmed some senior management. Under him, the company won its largest deal ever, from German retailer Metro, and has built a healthy pipeline of digital deals. Wipro’s shares have risen 140% since he came on board. Delaporte recently said, “Complexity was driving slowness and lack of decision-making in the organisation. We had 27 P&Ls and now we have 4. Simplicity is a must. We are reinforcing the power of the account executive and restructuring the organisation around them so that he has more powers to take decisions for Wipro and reducing the number of layers between the executive and the most senior person in the company.” India had 10 listed companies with more than Rs 3 lakh crore in mcap as of Thursday. Wipro became the 11th to touch the milestone, though by the end of the day it was slightly below that. Reliance Industries, TCS and HDFC remain the most valuable companies. The company recently also moved past Cognizant to become the fourth most valuable IT services company globally, after Accenture and its larger Indian rivals. “The new CEO’s strategy refresh could revive growth on improving win rates and underlying uptick in digital demand and drive higher profitability,” Elara Capital said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wipro-3rd-it-co-to-hit-rs-3l-cr-mcap/articleshow/83216489.cms||Avik Das

The last time the city had seen a three-figure new case count was on April 10 when there were 997 fresh cases. Over the past month, the number of active cases in the city, though, has spiralled steadily from 1.9 lakh on May 1 to 2.9 lakh on Thursday. While experts cheered the drop in fresh cases, they felt the volume of active cases will take some time to dip. “In the second wave, we have seen a bigger number of complicated cases and ICU admissions. The recovery time has increased, particularly over the past month. New infections, however, have dropped after the imposition of restrictions from May 16,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar. The drop in fresh cases pointed towards an eventual slide in total cases in a few weeks, said a microbiologist. “Just as the number of positives has dropped sharply since the imposition of curbs on May 16, cases, too, will drop. The key is to check transmission, which has been happening effectively over the past fortnight. With the restrictions extended till June 15, both fresh cases and total number will fall,” he said. Some, however, felt the partial withdrawal of restrictions announced on Thursday was too early. “Even though for a few hours, opening of shops, restaurants and malls — possibly after June 15 — could be a step backwards,” said an internal medicine consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fresh-kol-cases-dip-below-1k-mark/articleshow/83216833.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Three points behind Kerala, Goa has a score of 72 points, as against 65 points in 2019 and 64 points in 2018. Goa shares the third spot with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttarakhand. The index has become a policy tool and helps gauge progress of the states on 16 goals, including health, education, gender, economic growth, institutions, climate change and environment. The tiny state topped the charts in terms of clean water and sanitation and is the only state to have met the target of 100% access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene for all by 2030. Goa also did well for providing affordable and clean energy. In terms of efforts towards eradicating poverty, Goa is a frontrunner standing second after Tamil Nadu with a score of 83 as against the national average of 60. According to the Niti Aayog’s report, 5.09% of Goa’s population lives below the poverty line and less than 1% of the state’s population lives in “kutcha” homes. Goa is also second when it comes to eradicating hunger and malnutrition with a score of 78. The SDG India Index and Dashboard 2020–21 report shows that 99.94% of the state is covered by the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. At 99.9% Goa is on the verge to achieving the target of 100% schools with access to basic infrastructure, electricity and drinking water. However, the Niti Aayog’s rankings show that when it comes to promoting resource efficiency, green economies and sustainable infrastructure, Goa is the worst among states and Union territories with the lowest score of 47 in the country, way behind the national average of 74. The data showed that Goa has the highest fossil fuel consumption in the country at 547 kg per person. The state also generated 21 tonnes of plastic every year for every 1,000 people, the highest in the country while Sikkim, Mizoram and Tripura generated the least. Among the Union territories, Delhi generated the highest amount of 11.49 tonne of plastic per annum per 1,000 population. Goa also slips below the national average when it comes to efforts to integrate climate change measures, disaster risk measures and sustainable natural resource management into national development strategies. At 1.1% share, Goa has the least share of renewable energy out of the total electricity consumed. Worryingly, Goa also falls slight short of the national average in terms of ensuring good healthcare and well being of its residents with a score of 72 as against the national score of 74. Goa has 33 physicians, nurses and midwives for every 10,000 persons in the state. The national average is 37 healthcare staff for every 10,000 persons and the target set for states is 45 for every 10,000 persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-moves-up-to-third-position-in-niti-aayog-index/articleshow/83218216.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Another Covid crematorium and a new burial ground to take pressure off existing facilities||KOLKATA: The KMC health department is setting up a large crematorium and a burial ground as part of its preparations to deal with a third Covid wave. Deaths have increased manifold in the second wave and the third wave is feared to be deadlier. The new crematorium with six furnaces is nearing completion in Jinjirabazar, next to the Bhatchala Hindu Burial Ground, while the civic body is scouting for plots to the east of Bypass for the new burial ground. According to a civic official, the under-construction crematorium at Jinjirabazar has been designed to take the load off the Covid crematorium at Dhapa. The KMC also wants the new burial ground to start functioning within three months as there is little space left at the Bagmari burial ground. “We need to make the new crematorium and burial ground functional in three months for a predicted third Covid wave as the existing crematoriums and burial grounds are under extreme pressure,” the official said. From just two furnaces at one crematorium for much of the first wave, KMC has increased the number of Covid crematoriums to five with 16 furnaces in use in the second wave. With the new facility, it will take the Covid furnace count to 22. Also, three burial grounds are currently designated for Covid victims, but they are running out of space. A KMC official who looks after Covid cremations conceded that the severity of the second wave had caught the civic body off guard. “We couldn’t anticipate that the second wave would have such a catastrophic impact on our cremation infrastructure. Put to test in May, the crematoriums were vulnerable to snags,” he said. The frequent malfunctioning of furnaces at Dhapa, Nimtolla and Birjunala (Garden Reach) in the past three months had compelled the civic brass to rope in crematoriums at Garia and Siriti for Covid cremation. “The pressure on Dhapa and Nimtolla was so intense that we could not even arrange for mandatory maintenance of the furnaces. Furnaces at both started malfunctioning, leading to a huge backlog of bodies. We conducted urgent repairs and the situation now shows some improvement,” an official said. Similarly, the second wave took its toll on Bagmari and Soloana (Kidderpore) burial grounds, which have taken the maximum load. “We are in urgent need of a new burial ground to deal with such crises in future,” the official said. The preparations for an anticipated third wave also include strengthening existing crematoriums and burial grounds and preparing them to share the non-Covid load.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/another-covid-crematorium-and-a-new-burial-ground-to-take-pressure-off-existing-facilities/articleshow/83216996.cms||Saikat Ray

During a meeting held for effective management of the ongoing immunisation drive against Covid-19, the DM asked the DEO and the ADM (general) to chalk out a plan for vaccinating the teachers and their family members in urban areas on a priority basis. The BEOs, on the other hand, were directed to come up with a plan to inoculate the teachers in rural areas, the members of educational committees and the midday meal cooks. “The DEO will coordinate with the BEOs for launching the immunisation drive for teachers and their families from Saturday. This will include the people in both categories — 18 to 44 years and 45 years and above,” said the DM. He added, “All the SDOs will hold meetings with the stakeholders in their areas and get them and the panchayat representatives involved in the vaccination drive. Task forces will also be constituted for expediting the process.” The DM also urged the authorities of private schools to get the teachers inoculated on their respective campuses or at the vaccination sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/teachers-kin-to-get-vaccine-shots-from-saturday-patna-dm/articleshow/83213876.cms||VK Tripathi

As per the ADR report, the BJP spent Rs 71.72 crore winning 74 of the 243 assembly seats, while the Congress spent Rs 30.38 crore and won 19 seats and the JD(U) spent Rs 22.65 crore winning 43 seats. The parties posted the expenses made by them on the website of the Election Commission with respect to five major subheads – lump sum amount paid to candidates, travel expenses, expenditure made on publicity, miscellaneous expenses and publication of criminal antecedents of their candidates in the fray. The expenses covered the period from the announcement of the polls by the EC to the completion of the election process. Incidentally, among the three major parties, the Congress took the lead in making the highest lump sum amount paid to its candidates at Rs 17.92 crore, followed by the BJP at Rs 16.56 crore and the JD(U) at Rs 11.75 crore. Overall, the BJP topped the list with Rs 24.17 crore spent on publicity, Rs 26.07 crore on travel and Rs 16.56 crore paid to its candidates. The amount spent by the two other parties on the publicity and travel was in single digits. In 2020 assembly elections in the state, eight national parties and 11 regional parties in were in picture, but the CPI, LJP, RJD, RLSP, JD(S), JMM and National People’s Party did not file the details of the funds raised/collected and the expenditures incurred by them on various subheads identified by the EC on its website. Accordingly, the ADR prepared its analysis of the funds collected and the expenses made by the central and state units of only nine political parties – BJP, JD(U), Congress, CPM, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), AIMIM, All India Forward Bloc, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena. Of them, the NCP and AIFB did not have to spend money during the polls. Curiously, the BJP, by pooling in Rs 51.66 crore, had topped in fund collection during the 2015 assembly polls, but it ended up at fourth position in 2020, when the JD(U) took the lead in mustering Rs 55.60 crore, followed by the BSP at Rs 44.58 crore and the Congress at Rs 44.53 crore. Overall, the total funds collected by the nine parties which filed the returns was to the tune of Rs 185.14 crore, and the expenditure incurred by them was Rs 81.86 crore. The “most preferred mode of collection” was by cheques and DDs worth Rs 161.44 crore, and the amount collected in cash was worth Rs 23.55 crore. The state unit of JD(U) made the highest fund collection at Rs 55.60 crore among all the parties, while the central unit of the BSP pooled in Rs 44.57 crore, followed by the central and state units of the Congress at Rs 44.57 crore and the two units of the BJP mustered Rs 35.83 crore. Overall, the parties spent Rs 130 crore, including Rs 46.59 crore paid to candidates as lump sum amount, Rs 37.32 crore spent on travel, Rs 36.73 crore incurred on publicity, Rs 5.50 crore on other heads and Rs 3.89 crore on publication of criminal antecedents of the candidates.

---||Delhi||Delhi BJP seeks fresh survey to find out number of Covid orphans||NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor on Thursday requested lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to direct Delhi government to immediately resurvey and ascertain the number of children orphaned or those who have lost earning parent. In a letter to the LG, Kapoor stated that “the need to gather the correct data is important in the wake of Delhi government on May 28 informing the Supreme Court that only two children aged up to 17 years have been orphaned and just three others have lost their one earning parent.” “We all have seen in society and come to know that thousands of youth have died due to Covid-19 during the second wave and obviously when thousands of young men and women have died many children must be very small in age,” Kapoor wrote. He stated that SC had given one last opportunity to rectify the figures by June 5. “I hope you will agree that by giving wrong data, we will be denying bona fide compensation claims of many children,” Kapoor added in the letter. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said Delhi government on May 16 informed the Supreme Court that it had distributed 1,69,007 Remdesivir injections, a Covid-19 drug, and still had a stock of 23,890 injections. “But five days later, in an RTI reply, Delhi government stated that till date, it has bought 48,093 Remdesivir injections while Centre has given it free another 9,036 injections,” Khurana stated, asking how did the government then distribute 1,69,007 injections. He lodged a complaint with Delhi Police on the matter and sought an inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-bjp-seeks-fresh-survey-to-find-out-no-of-covid-orphans/articleshow/83214702.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna doctors reopen clinics, but make Covid safety norms mandatory||PATNA: City doctors, who had switched to the online mode of consultation amid a sudden rise in Covid-19 cases, have started reopening their clinics. A number of them believe that treating people on a one-to-one basis plays a pivotal role. They are, therefore, adopting all precautionary measures to ensure the safety of their patients and staff. Dr Ajay Kumar, acting president of the Indian Medical Association-Bihar, told this newspaper on Thursday that some clinics were functioning during the Covid-induced lockdown while others would reopen soon. He added, “It is the moral responsibility of doctors to make sure that patients do not suffer.” Senior physician, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, whom patients had been consulting online for the last few weeks, reopened his clinic on June 1. However, wearing face shields and masks on the premises is mandatory. Emphasizing on the importance of one-to-one interaction with patients, he said, “During an online consultation, there are chances of missing out on something. Therefore, it is advisable to meet patients and treat them.” Dr Siddharth Kumar, an ophthalmologist, also opened his clinic on June 1, but the footfalls are still low. He claimed, “Patients visiting my clinic are more cautious and following Covid safety protocols now.” He advised the Covid-recovered patients to get their eyes checked in view of a sudden rise in cases of mucormycosis or black fungus. Dental surgeon, Dr Emmanuel Page, who was tackling emergency cases in his clinic during the lockdown, has been witnessing an increase in the number of patients since June 1. “All visitors, therefore, undergo thermal screening and use sanitizer before entering the clinic,” he said. Although Dr Rahul Thakur, a neurodevelopmental paediatrician, is planning to reopen his clinic soon, he will continue treating his old patients over the phone. He pointed out, “Making everyone follow the Covid safety norms is a challenge. A lot of people openly flout the rules.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-reopen-clinics-but-make-covid-safety-norms-mandatory/articleshow/83212966.cms||---

Kushwaha’s statement came a day after CM Nitish Kumar’s announcement that 33.3% seats will be reserved for girls in all medical and engineering colleges of the state. The CM’s announcement is considered to be his another bold initiative to graner support of women voters in the state. Kushwaha, who upped his ante against the union government after switching sides to JD(U), twitted in Hindi on Thursday, “Kendra sarkar ko bhi aisi pahal karni chahiye (Central government should also take an initiative in this regard).” Lauding the commitment of Nitish Kumar to give due representation to women in democratic set up under social justice plank, the former union minister said that such initiatives would provide opportunities to women to pursue technical and higher education. Kushwaha further stated that women were not lagging behind in any field given due opportunities. “The state government’s new initiative will open the doors for more girls in technical institutions,” he added. A BJP leader, however, said that Kushwaha was a junior HRD minister in the Narendra Modi government at the Centre but little did he do for the welfare of “aadhi aabadi”. “Now, he is giving suggestions for 33% reservation for women in government medical and engineering colleges,” the BJP leader said requesting anonymity. Kushwaha’s comments came at a time when some leaders of both the BJP and the JD( U) are engaged in a verbal duel on various issues. On Wednesday, BJP MLC Tunna Ji Pandey described Nitish Kumar as 'parishthition ke CM', inviting counter attack from the JD(U).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kushwaha-to-centre-give-33-quota-to-girls-in-engg-med-colleges/articleshow/83212920.cms||Ramashankar

Rajesh Kumar, who owns Shiv Shakti Petroleum, says fuel is required on an everyday basis for the smooth functioning of heavy machinery in local industries, generators in hospitals, and tractors in villages. He has, therefore, taken this initiative to make the fuel purchase process a convenient option for bulk consumers. Recently, Rajesh acquired a double-dispenser mobile petrol pump from Repos Energy to meet the diesel demands of the agricultural sector and several hospitals near his delivery area. “Earlier, the bulk consumers had to procure diesel from retail outlets in barrels which led to a lot of spillage. Doorstep diesel delivery, however, will solve this problem and hugely benefit the agricultural and industrial sectors, hospitals, housing societies, and mobile towers,” the outlet owner said. Doorstep diesel delivery has been approved by the government and is a new-age concept of effective distribution of the fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mobile-diesel-delivery-for-bulk-consumers-in-siwan/articleshow/83212949.cms||---

However, they are apprehensive about the marks they will be allotted. Welcoming the Centre’s decision, Aashutosh Sharan, a Class XII student of Litera Valley School, suggested that pupils should be given promotion certificates, instead of marks based on internal assessment. He told this reporter, “Schools, which did not conduct the pre-board exams amid the pandemic, are not sure how they will allot marks to their students. Therefore, they should simply give them promotion certificates.” Although she is happy with the government’s decision, Shubhangi Sinha, a Loyola High School student, pointed out, “Had the Centre announced cancellation of the Class XII exams a few weeks ago, the students would not have to deal with so much pressure.” Saurav Kumar of St Karen’s Secondary School, who is preparing for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), said, “Although our future is uncertain amid the present circumstances, we should not forget that life is far more precious than exams.” Heaving a sigh of relief, Utkarsh Singh of DAV Public School said he could now focus on JEE preparations. “With no Class XII exams being held, most institutes are likely to select students on the basis of entrance tests and interviews,” he added. City schools have also welcomed the government’s decision to scrap the Class XII exams. St Michael’s High School teacher, Roselyn Anthony, claimed, “Considering the fact that teenagers have not yet been vaccinated, I think the government has taken the right decision. Life is valuable. As long as one is alive, one can achieve anything.” Echoing similar views, the principal of Don Bosco Academy, Mary Alphonsa, said, “A student’s life is more important than an exam.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pupils-heave-sigh-of-relief-hail-cancellation-of-exams/articleshow/83212995.cms||Faryal Rumi

The thematic fund, which invests in B2B, B2C/D2C sectors and D2C enablers amongst others, is a Category I alternative investment fund that will invest in startups across seed, pre-series A, and series-A stages. Over 50 limited partners (LPs) participated in the fund, with more than 50% of the investments coming from family offices and 20 listed companies participating directly or through promoter entities. NRIs, HNIs, super angels, and SIDBI invested the remaining capital. Led by entrepreneur and investor Anirudh A Damani, who was instrumental in setting up the Damani family office, AVF has allocated over 65% of its corpus for follow-on rounds and plans to make 10-12 investments per year. “Besides exceeding our targeted raise two months ahead of schedule, almost 50% of our first cohort of LPs doubled down on their earlier investments. Many referred us to people in their network,” Anirudh A Damani, managing partner, Artha Venture Fund said. The fund will typically invest in ticket sizes of Rs 1-Rs 3 crore in initial rounds and double it in follow-on rounds, Damani said, anticipating that AVF will have invested in around 24 startups by 2022. AVF is also tapping a pipeline of investment opportunities by engaging with various accelerators across the country for the Artha Scout program, and plans to support roughly 40 accelerator stage investments through small cheques as part of this initiative. AVF, which previously announced the second close of Rs 100 crores in June 2019, has invested in startups such as Agnikul, LenDenClub, Kabbadi Adda, HobSpace, PiggyRide, Daalchini, and more. Despite the pandemic, AVF claims its portfolio-wide revenues tripled in 12 months without raising additional capital. AVF is part of Artha Group which, through its family office Artha India Ventures, has investments in over 85 startups across India, the US, and Israel like OYO Rooms, Purplle, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vc-firm-artha-venture-closes-rs-220-cr-fund/articleshow/83214882.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Kolkata||Covid curbs in Kolkata: Markets, vicinity report maximum norms violations||KOLKATA: Cops have had to crack down on rule-breakers at markets which have started to get crowded after certain relaxations were allowed for retail shops from June 1.  There were even minor traffic snarls in central Kolkata despite almost no public transport on the roads, said Lalbazar officers. They also said they had to let several vehicles go unchecked at nakas as the queue got longer at places like Park Street crossing and Howrah bridge. Market areas have been witnessing maximum violations. After 10am, a section of citizens are refusing to return home saying they will need to travel to the bigger wholesale markets to replenish their stocks after noon. “None of these people are small traders. They are just trying to take this opportunity to be out on the streets,” said a joint commissioner at Lalbazar. A few shop owners, too, are keeping shutters up past the closing time. Sources said the Gariahat police and Bowbazar police have drawn up FIRs against these people over the past three days. The cops said over 2,403 people have either been arrested or prosecuted in the past three days, the highest since the enhanced restrictions began. On Monday, 790 people were prosecuted — 659 by noon. Till Tuesday noon, 559 people were prosecuted out of the total 666 prosecutions on that day. On Wednesday, 947 people were prosecuted by noon. According to Lalbazar, this clearly shows that violations are happening in the morning during the market operating and closing hours. “Given that we usually begin prosecutions around 9am, the huge numbers show that the maximum prosecutions took place post 10am, by which time the markets should be shutting down,” said an officer. The south, southeast and central Kolkata divisions that account for the biggest markets in the city have contributed to around 40% of all challans issued in the past two days. The slums of Kolkata are other areas where a lot of violations have been reported in the past 48 hours, said cops. The trend is almost similar with mask violations. “In the past two days, there have been 220-235 cases by noon instead of the average 150-170,” said an officer. The cops said they are now carrying out intense market patrolling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/markets-vicinity-report-maximum-violations/articleshow/83216792.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||HC: Collect details of all children orphaned||New Delhi: How many children were orphaned during the Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi? While Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has identified 1,436 such children, the child welfare committees (CWC) have been able to identify only 15 till now.Taking note of the anomaly in figures, Delhi High Court directed the AAP government on Thursday to ask every hospital in the capital to furnish information on patients who died rendering children orphans.“Goes without saying that loss of even one parent in such a situation not only damages children but also puts them in a vulnerable situation, which could be manipulated to their disadvantage,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed, asking the principal secretary (health) of Delhi government to issue directions to all hospitals in Delhi and share the same with women and child development department “without any delay.”The court said that “just like registration of deaths and births is compulsory, it is necessary for the State to gather this information, which has to be kept confidential.” It asked the government’s various departments to collect information on minors orphaned due to the pandemic from all residents’ welfare associations, police stations, schools, anganwadi workers and hospitals so that welfare and foster care interventions can be made by the state agencies.The directions came after advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, representing NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, submitted that there was a complete lack of information on the number of children orphaned during the pandemic and their identities.The court was informed by senior Delhi government officer Rashmi Singh that there were several family members who were not ready to give details of their children. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, for Delhi government, said they were in the process of formulating a policy to provide ex gratia to children who have lost their parents.On the issue of making facilities available for Covid-positive children with special needs, Kaur said IHBAS could play an important role in this regard. The court was informed by IHBAS director Dr Nimesh G Desai that they are in the process of expansion of mobile mental health unit, which will be available in every district and necessary approvals have been granted by the government.The unit contains a patient transport ambulance, counsellor, medical officer, staff nurse, nursing orderly and a driver and this will help in providing help to children in need at the doorstep, Desai said.The court said that it expected that the facility would be made operational in the next 15 days and asked the authorities to file a status report.The court also clarified that at this stage, it was not getting into the aspect of failure of Delhi government to implement the statutory schemes under the JJ Act as it wished to give an opportunity to the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-collect-details-of-all-children-orphaned/articleshow/83214689.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Kolkata||Cops plan traffic diversion for Posta flyover razing||Kolkata: Hours after the date for razing Posta flyover was finalized, Lalbazar floated a traffic diversion plan to be effective for the first phase of the work. The demolition is likely to disrupt traffic on a major portion of the Burrabazar area. Besides smaller vehicles heading towards Girish Park and Posta having to take detours, truck movement to Posta is also likely to be affected. Cops said they will hold a meeting with traders and transporters of the Burrabazar area on Friday where their inputs will be taken for smooth traffic movement during the course of work. The meeting will focus on movement of goods vehicles in the area. Work on the first phase is likely to begin on June 15 and a total of 75 days have been allotted for it. “We plan to block the Strand Road portion on the night of June 12. The machinery will arrive from Mumbai and we have to facilitate its entry to the area,” said an officer. According to Howrah bridge traffic guard, which will work with Jorabagan guard, Posta- and Girish Park-bound vehicles will be asked to take Maharshi Debendra Road and Kali Krishna Tagore Street to move north while buses and minibuses will be asked to take MG Road. “If we allow all vehicles on MG Road, the traffic system in central Kolkata will crash, We plan to reserve a portion of MG Road for north-to-south movement rather than the other way that it goes now,” said an officer. Truck movement to Posta from Strand Road will also be suspended. Instead, they have to enter via CR Avenue-Beadon Street-Nimtala Ghat Road and Strand Bank Road. “This will mean travelling extra through some busy stretches. While movement at night might not be an issue, trucks moving from Port after noon might face challenges,” the officer said. There will be changes in parking too. “We will be withdrawing parking permission on Strand Road so the agency can begin work. We initially decided work would progress only at night. But KMDA told us that might be an issue as work needs to be completed in a time-bound manner,” said an officer. “On days with heavy traffic, we might adopt quick-fixes. The agency hinted it will need three weeks to a month to dismantle the portion near Old Mint, which does not have hindrances like the Aloopatti area. We might ask for the first phase to be divided into two and for work to begin from the Old mint area,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-plan-traffic-diversion-for-posta-flyover-razing/articleshow/83216865.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Exam cancellation ends mark sheet dilemma for foreign univ applicants||Kolkata: The cancellation of ISC and CBSE Class XII exams has brought relief to students who had secured admission in UG courses in universities abroad. They will now get to furnish the transcripts of their mark sheets in time to complete the admission process. When the two board exams had been pushed back, most students had to write to the respective foreign universities by June 1 saying they would be able to send in the mark sheets by August 1. “It is not easy to secure admissions in these foreign universities and the institutions were aware of the situation in India and had relaxed rules saying they would accept mark sheets till August or September. But they wanted applicants to write in by June 1 to confirm that they would furnish the transcripts,” said Seema Sapru, principal of Heritage School. Aishani Chatterjee, a student of La Martiniere for Girls, got a confirmation on May 1 that she has secured admission in University of Michigan and was tense because she was not sure whether she would be able to give any confirmation by June 1. “Now I have apprised them of the situation and said there would be no delay in furnishing the mark sheet,” she said. Darsh Chopra of Birla High School had received confirmation of admission to University of Purdue on April 20. “If CBSE XII would have been held between July 15 and August 26, I would have missed my chance because I have to be physically present on the US campus on August 23,” he said. Most foreign universities have cancelled their online classes from the new academic year and have told students to be on campus at least seven days before the programmes start. They have been told that a delay in furnishing details or not reaching the campus might push them back by two semesters or even get their admission cancelled.

All railway hospitals located in Danapur, Sonepur, Samastipur, Mughalsarai and Dhanbad have begun refurbishing their paediatric wards and introducing better medical facilities for proper treatment of children. According to the medical director (MD) of the railway superspecialty hospital in Karbigahiya, Dr R K Verma, 10 separate beds have been added to the paediatric ward. A six-bed intensive care unit with specially-designed ventilators has also been set up. “The process of installation of seven oxygen plants at all the railway hospitals under the jurisdiction of the ECR has also begun. While Danapur and Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya divisions will have two oxygen plants each, Sonepur, Samastipur and Dhanbad divisions will get one each. These plants will be made functional by the end of June or mid-July,” Dr Verma told this reporter on Thursday. He added, “All doctors strictly follow the medical advisories issued by the Ministry of Railways to keep the virus at bay.” The senior divisional commercial manager of Danapur, Adhar Raj, pointed out that 41 oxygen concentrators had also been procured for Covid patients. According to sources, the MDs and the chief medical superintendents of all railway hospitals are holding meetings and rolling up their sleeves to tackle the third wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railway-hospitals-gear-up-to-tackle-possible-3rd-wave-of-covid/articleshow/83213739.cms||Kumod Verma

He survived a critical Covid-19 attack only to fall prey to mucormycosis. With severe scarcity of liposomal Amphotericin B, the drug of choice for treating black fungus, the tractor dealer was given lyophilised Amphotericin B, which is very cheap but highly nephrotoxic. As expected, his kidneys were badly impaired as a side-effect of his medicine. His mocormycosis treatment had to be suspended and was put on dialysis to salvage his kidneys and life. “After five dialysis his kidneys recovered and Niyaz was put on oral Posaconazole, the second drug of choice to halt the spread of black fungus. Doctors say kidney complications have prolonged his recovery," said Niyaz's brother-inlaw Mehboob. "He has survived 80% lung involvement and eye removal. Lack of availability of recommended injections has hurt his recovery. We pray he gets well soon," he added. If mucormycosis as an aftermath of Covid-19 infection was not bad enough, many black fungus patients are reporting acute kidney injury (AKI) as a side-effect of treatment of the dreaded fungus. Several city-based hospitals say AKI is reported in 20 to 30% of patients under treatment. Dr Vineet Mishra, director of IKDRC or Kidney Hospital, said that Amphotericin B is known to be nephrotoxic. “The drug, when taken in lyophilized form, has more impact on kidney functions. While it arrests the growth of fungi, it also damages the kidney tissues. Thus, whenever the medicine is used – as it surely saves lives – it must be done with supervision of a nephrologist,” he said. We have so far treated 41 patients of mucormycosis at IKDRC-ITS. Out of total patients, 20 or 50% have reported higher creatinine levels – indicating kidney malfunction or AKI,” said Dr Vivek Kute, professor of nephrology at IKDRC-ITS. The patients included 15 transplant patients. Dr Atul Patel, infectious disease specialist and one of 30 authors of the global recommendations for mucormycosis treatment, said liposomal Amphotericin B safer choice and globally recommended. “Lyophilized form is highly nephro-toxic. Government should ensure availability of liposomal Amphotericin B to protect Covid induced mucormycosis patients fighting for life from further suffering.” Experts said that even today, liposomal injections are scarcely made available by the government which controls MM drugs. Dr Rajesh Vishwakarma, director of the department of head & neck surgery at Apollo Hospital, said they are seeing AKI in about 20-30% of the mucormycosis patients. “We also saw some renal transplant patients who had Covid and mucormycosis. In such cases, the complications are high. The pre and post procedure for amphotericin must be followed to reduce kidney damage,” he said. Dr Umesh Godhani, a city-based nephrologist and transplant physician, said that they have witnessed AKI in about 20% of mucormycosis patients. “Liposomal injections are both scarce and costly. Thus, mostly the patients are administered lyophilized drugs. Thus, when the not-so-healthy patient is administered the drug, we must observe them continuously. In one case a patient needed one dialysis, whereas in a few cases, we discontinued amphotericin for a few days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-mucormycosis-now-drug-induced-kidney-injury/articleshow/83215537.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Surat||Half kg tumour removed from brain in Surat||SURAT: For the past one-and-a-half years, 50-year-old Mukta Dhanani has popped number of painkillers for nagging headaches. Living in a small village of Dhari taluka in Amreli district, Dhanani never expected, all this while, that a tumour was developing in her brain, which could have become fatal for her. The tumour, which was weighing nearly half a kilo, was developing so aggressively that a part of her skull bone had dissolved into it. On Wednesday morning, Dhanani got a new lease of life at a private hospital in Surat when the tumour was removed successfully. Doctors, who operated on her, were also surprised as they had never seen a case like hers at least in south Gujarat. “There are a few recorded tumours heavier than hers in Mumbai and Jaipur. This was a highly aggressive tumour as a part of the skull bone had dissolved into it,” said Dr Hitesh Chitroda, a city-based neurosurgeon. Dhanani’s tumour was 10.7 cm in length, 9.2 cm in width and 5.7 cm in height and weighed 425 grams. A part of skull bone of similar size had dissolved into the tumour, said Chitroda, who along with other neurosurgeons Dr Maulik Patel and Dr Milan Sojitra and anaesthetist Dr Pritesh Vyas conducted the surgery. Dhanani gained consciousness and is currently recuperating in an intensive care unit. “My mother used to have the headache often, so she used to take the pills and we also did not take it seriously,” said Dhanani’s son Atul. When her scalp developed swelling around three months ago, the family took her to the civil hospital in Amreli. CT scan reports there revealed that she had a tumour and the doctors advised them to take her to a bigger hospital. Dhanani was taken to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, but the doctors there refused to conduct her surgery immediately as the pandemic was at its peak then. “Doctors prescribed medicines and asked us to consult again after a month. But when we left, the tumour’s size had increased and doctors there told us that the surgery will have to be conducted immediately,” Atul said. However, the family was not entirely satisfied with the findings and they got in touch with Dr Chitroda and took her to Surat. “When people suffer from consistent severe headache, giddiness, scalp swelling, difficulty in walking, or notice any behavioural changes or seizures they should consult a doctor as these are common symptoms of a tumour,” said Dr Chitroda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/half-kg-tumour-removed-from-brain/articleshow/83213392.cms||Jay Pachchigar

We removed 137 such hospitals from the list of Covid hospitals a week ago and issued notices to them. Many of them have begun applying for NOC,” said Parth Brahmbhatt, chief fire officer. Dwarkesh Hospital in Manjalpur, Chirag Clinic in Makarpura, Sai Hospital, Chiranjeevi Hospital and Respicare Hospital have been sealed by the fire brigade. “We sealed hospitals violating the norms and have asked them not to take in any new patients. They can treat existing patients,” Brahmbhatt told TOI. These hospitals won’t be allowed to admit any new patient till they meet all the safety measures and get the NOC from the fire brigade. The city witnessed fire incidents in both private and government hospitals over last few months. Fire brigade officials and the police department swung into action and began checking the safety norms in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/five-hospitals-without-fire-noc-sealed-in-vadodara/articleshow/83212764.cms||---
---||Delhi||Gautam Gambhir’s foundation guilty of hoarding Covid drugs, HC told||NEW DELHI: The Gautam Gambhir Foundation, run by the member of Parliament from east Delhi, committed an offence through the unauthorised procurement, stocking and distribution of viral medicine Fabiflu, the drug controller for the city informed Delhi High Court on Thursday. Days after the high court pulled up the drug controller for giving Gautam Gambhir a clean chit, the volte face came before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, which accepted that the BJP MP did a lot of charity work but caused a shortage of drug and inconvenience to society. The court said action must be taken under the relevant provisions of law against all such persons and the chemists/dealers who sold them Fabiflu in such large quantities. The bench reiterated that the manner in which a huge quantity of the drug was procured left genuine patients who needed the medicine at that particular time in the lurch. It took a dim view of the conduct of the foundation, noting, “This is not the way to do charity. When you do charity, you have to do it only with charity as an angle. No other angle, else it is not charity,” the court said. “It should not be that I will do it for one class or for my constituency people. It should not be to gain popularity.” The bench wanted the drug controller to curb this practice in the future. The drug controller assured the high court that action would be taken without delay against the foundation, dealers, AAP MLA Praveen Kumar and other people for similar acts. It said show-cause notices had been issued to licensees under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the responses are awaited. During the hearing, the court also drew a distinction between medical oxygen bought for personal use and bulk purchases like in the Gambhir case. “The endeavour of the drug controller should be on such violators whose actions resulted in choking of the system, including medical oxygen, for bona fide use in the treatment of Covid-19,” the bench noted. The drug controller said it was under the impression that Garg Hospital was the agency through which Fabiflu was procured and distributed at the Gautam Gambhir Foundation’s medical camps. But the hospital clarified it was not directly involved and its role was limited to verification that the correct drug was being given to patients. The court had taken strong exception to the drug controller’s report concluding that the dealers had ample stocks of Fabiflu for patients and said everyone knew that the medicine was in short supply. The court has sought a status report on the progress in the matter and listed the case for July 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gambhirs-foundation-guilty-of-hoarding-covid-drugs-hc-told/articleshow/83214738.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Mumbai||Grand Tour: A century ago, these Parsis circumpedalled the world||In the 1920s, long before the dawn of fake news, one Chinese man was told that Rabindranath Tagore had composed the Gujarati national anthem of the Parsi community that went: "We are old Zoroastrians". The culprit was Adi Hakim, one of the "Super Six" khaki-clad Parsi cyclists who had endured brass band music as they set off from Lamington Road's Gilder Tank ground on October 15, 1923 to fulfil a lofty dream: putting India on the global sports map by pedalling through the war-torn streets, snow-capped peaks, bone-melting deserts and dacoit-infested mountains across the world. While three of these muscular Indian globetrotters from the Bombay Weightlifting Club--Keki Pochkhanawala, Nariman Kapadia and Gustad Hathiram--abandoned their saddles midway, the other three--Chira Bazaar's athletic Rustom Bhumgara, six-foot-tall foodie Jal Bapasola and Dadar Parsi Colony's gregarious Hakim--would return to Gilder Tank ground from their five-years-and-71000-km-long adventure, sunburnt and jubilant. Here, hordes of motorists, cyclists and gaily-clad Parsi women in omnibuses would watch Bhumgara recall his time working as a waiter in America and chuckle as Hakim would remember a man in China who sang the Chinese national anthem and then insisted that Hakim reciprocate by singing "the national anthem of the Parsis". Under duress, Hakim had invoked a Gujarati hymn and, when asked who had composed it, uttered the name of the Bengali legend who wrote India's national anthem. Only the well-to-do in Bombay could afford cycles in those fraught, pre-Independence decades between 1920 and 1942 when 12 Parsi cyclists from the city had set off on five separate journeys that made them the first Indian eyewitnesses to the ravages of war in Europe, a strife-torn East Asia and the Great Depression in America. Of these cyclists--who pedalled alone and in groups across the deserts of Sahara, rainforests of Amazon and mountains of the Alps--eight were successful. Some had knelt before Pope Pius XI, some had rubbed shoulders with the likes of Benito Mussolini and Franklin Roosevelt. For lack of protective eyewear, one of these globe-trotters lost his sight and died a blind man. But the wealth of memories, photographs and meticulous notes they left behind are anthropological eye-openers if you ask Anoop Babani, a Goa-based cyclist who had tracked down the families of these early adventurers for photo exhibitions in 2019 that resulted in a book titled 'The Bicycle Diaries'. According to Babani--30-year-old sports journalist Framroz J Davar's 1923 cycling expedition---pedalling 9000 kms alone from Bombay to Vienna and then covering 52 countries along with Austrian cyclist Gustav Sztavjanik over seven years--was the most perilous of the lot. While Davar, who started his journey three months after Super Six, had drawn inspiration from his fellow Parsi, Scout-uniform-clad predecessors, what had apparently imbued them with unprecedented daredevilry was a public lecture in the city by a foreigner who had been walking around the world. Their audacious dream--sculpted in between bodybuilding sessions at Grant Road's Bombay Weightlifting Club--had to be protected from their families for fear of opposition. So with savings of Rs 2000 each, a few clothes, medicine boxes, cycle gear, a second hand compass and crude copies of the world map, the Super Six had left quietly atop sturdy British Royal Benson cycles fitted with Dunlop tyres. It seems Britain's Raleigh Cycle Company in Bombay had refused to sponsor cycles for their tour but when they rode into London, Raleigh was pleading with them to use their brand. Why the change of heart? "Frankly, we didn't believe you boys would make it," said officials at Raleigh. While the shy and imposing Bapasola served as the team's human GPS with his map-reading proficiency, the rugged, quick-witted auto mechanic Bhumgara--who repaired his mates' cycles through the expedition--drew easy attention from women abroad. By the time Bhumgara's parents found out where their son was, the Super Six had drunk water from mud pools in Bikaner populated by half-submerged buffaloes, hauled their bikes up marauder-infested mountains of Baluchistan and reached Persia, the land of their ancestors. Here, the robust trio would earn princely sums by performing antics such as splintering a stone on their chest with big hammers and dragging a car full of passengers with a rope held between their teeth. In Tehran, they would even be offered military jobs by then War Minister and would-be Prime Minister Reza Shah Pahlavi. Their wordless flirtation with veiled Persian beauties in Iran was followed by another silent transaction: in Baghdad, where they would bribe Bedouins with cigarettes hidden in their cycle grips. Later, after crossing the starvation-inducing Syrian-Mesopotamian desert, they found themselves being mistaken for German spies in a remote Italian village and spent a night in jail before being let off the next morning with apologies. "Tumbled down homesteads, torn-up earth, heaps of empty shells, steel helmets, destroyed cannons and their carriages, deserted fields and solitary remains of some human skeletons half peering through its earthly covering..," they wrote about the remnants of war they saw in prostitution-ridden Europe. Their happiest days and smoothest roads would arrive in England, from where they took a steamer to New York--a city that made Hathiram announce to the others that he didn't plan to return home. "Think that I drowned in the Atlantic, my friends, for the Gustad you knew is now no more," said the letter his mates found under the hotel door. Without Hathiram, Kapadia--who had returned home from Tehran "for personal reasons"--and Pochkhanawala--who reverted from London to look after his ailing father--the group was now half its size. And at many points, they were tempted to take a boat home. If America's insulting immigration authorities repulsed them, so did the behaviour of French officials towards Indians in then Indo-China (present-day Vietnam) where the trio was put behind bars on charges of 'bringing into hatred and the contempt of (French) government of Indo-China.' In politically volatile China, they encountered floods, heat waves, bandits and soldiers who pointed guns to their forehead. All these hardships were temporarily offset by Miss Peggy, a French blonde they met in Rangoon whose cheerful company they pined for on the journey back into an alien-seeming Bombay. The city had sprouted trains, motorized buses and rising waves of migrants who lived in rented accommodations. Merely days before the trio's rousing homecoming, in fact, a group of boarders had issued 'Hints to Bombay Boarding House Landladies', requesting some conveniences which included: "Any new dishes (food items) should first be tried on the dog. Boarders do not hold themselves responsible for the burial expenses of the dog."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/grand-tour-a-century-ago-these-parsis-circumpedalled-the-world/articleshow/83217118.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

However, when Chandan Nimje needed a hospital bed after testing Covid positive in the beginning of May, no one helped him get a bed in a government hospital. Finally, his family found one in a private hospital at great cost, but could not save the kind soul, who died on May 26, after fighting the disease for a month. Nimje had been working with a group of volunteers, risking their lives when no one, including close family members, was ready to accompany the bodies, over the last 1.5 years. Then, Nimje, who had retired as a secretary level official of the central government, contracted Covid-19 disease. He and his family faced a lot of trouble in getting a bed, and then the Tocilizumab injection, which ultimately led to his demise. With all their savings exhausted in Nimje’s treatment, his family members are staring at penury. Both his young sons too have lost their jobs due to the pandemic. “We approached everyone, not only for financial help, but also for a bed and medicines, but none responded. We approached Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) commissioner, collector and other top officials, but no one helped the person who went out of the way to provide dignity in death to over 1,300 citizens,” said Arvind Rataudi, who worked closely with Nimje. After retirement, Nimje had joined Rataudi’s King Cobra Youth Force (KCYF), an NGO that has been helping Covid affected citizens since March last year. The senior citizen, fondly called ‘Dada’, is believed to have contracted the deadly virus when he went for his first dose of vaccine with his wife. He had a mild fever the next day and then his entire family, including his sister, two sons, and wife, also started showing symptoms. All five tested positive, but Nimje’s health started deteriorating in the last week of April. Rataudi and his volunteers started searching for a hospital bed. “At one hospital, we were asked to deposit cash Rs 1 lakh. They refused to use our debit card. Then, on Dada’s request, we took him back home. On May 5, we admitted him to a hospital at Ramdaspeth, which agreed to accept digital payment,” Rataudi said. Chandan Nimje passed away on May 26This hospital then asked his family to arrange Tocilizumab, which cost Rs 45,000. KCYF activists in the city along with Nimje’s family members tried hard, but it was available only in the black market for Rs 1.45 lakh. “I personally called the collector, NMC chief and political leaders to arrange an injection. But no one picked up calls. One of our volunteers in Delhi, named Arjun, who knew Dada, then sent four vials of Tocilizumab by Indigo flight, without asking for any money,” Rataudi says. However, Nimje’s condition deteriorated and he passed away on May 26. KCYF volunteers and his family members performed his last rites. “I am soon going to file a case in Nagpur bench of Bombay high court against the chief minister, collector and NMC commissioner, for negligence leading to his untimely death. If we, with our thousands of activists, failed to get timely help for the old man, imagine the plight of common citizens due to such attitude of authorities,” the KCYF founder said. To top it all, in the middle of Nimje’s funeral, an NMC official called up his son, offering to deliver some medicines the family had asked for. A zone level official also called his son on Thursday, eight days after his death, to ask whether they had found the medicine they wanted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/67-year-old-who-cremated-1300-covid-victims-dies-for-want-of-medicines/articleshow/83217121.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Within hours, they started dying. By Thursday night, four of them were confirmed to have died because of the hooch and the deaths of two others were attributed to Covid-19 and Hepatitis B. Twenty-four others are critical. “Six people have died so far, three of whom were brought dead,” said Prof Haris Manzoor Khan, medical superintendent of the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC), where the 30 labourers were admitted.

One died of Covid-19 and another had Hepatitis B,” he said. A police officer said the labourers worked at a brick kiln. “One of them, Raju, spotted a huge haul of boxes near a canal about a kilometre from Rohera village, where he lived,” said Aligarh SSP Kalanidhi Naithani. When he looked inside, he found 45 bottles of 200ml liquor each, branded ‘Good Evening’. “He carried what he could and shared the liquor with his fellow workers and their families.” Hours later, one of them, a woman, died. Police were informed around 9.30pm. As others also started getting sick, they were quickly moved to JNMC. When police investigated, some of the labourers pointed them to the spot where they had found the liquor. “It was the hooch that had earlier killed people in villages of Aligarh,” a police officer said. “There were 20 cartons by the canal and five were found near the shanties where the labourers live,” SDM Yadav said. Police believed more cartons may have flowed down the canal. “The nearest liquor store is 2km away. It seems those who had stored the hooch chose this spot to dump it because it is isolated and then escaped,” SSP Naithani said. So far, police have registered 14 FIRs in the Aligarh hooch case and arrested 38 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/labourers-find-dumped-liquor-4-die-24-critical-as-up-hooch-toll-rises/articleshow/83212884.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Torn between anger and grief, the family members have said they will stage a protest and burn an effigy of the government if their demand is not fulfilled. They have also submitted a memorandum, through the local administration, to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding compensation of Rs 50 lakh each to families of the deceased. Vijay Tomar from Karsua village, whose twin brother, Ajay, succumbed to alcohol poisoning after consuming the hooch, said, “He had bought the liquor from the government authorized vend and they sold him poison.” Ten people have died at his village after consuming the spurious liquor. Tomar termed their deaths as mass murder. Most of the victims were taken ill and began to die on May 27 and till date no official from the administration has visited the families, he added. Another local resident from Karsua village, Sumit, who lost his elder brother to the deadly brew, said all shops should be shut across the district till compensation is paid to victims’ families. Meanwhile, Aligarh administration has demolished some properties of one of the accused in the hooch tragedy, Vipin Yadav. He had reportedly constructed a house without getting necessary approvals from the Aligarh Development Authority. Unlike in many other hooch tragedies, this time the deadly concoction was being sold at government-sanctioned liquor vends. Mafia in the district was selling the illicit liquor by labeling the bottles ‘Good Evening’. Earlier, excise officials told TOI that ‘Good Evening’ is supplied by Wave Distilleries and Breweries to Aligarh and adjoining districts, including Hathras, Kasganj and Etah. The administration has cancelled the registration of 16 liquor shops, said sub-divisional magistrate (Koil) Ranjeet Singh.

---||Aurangabad||Late reporting issue among mucor patients||Aurangabad: Stating that many patients of mucormycosis approach the doctors only when symptoms aggravate, dean of Government Dental College and Hospital in Aurangabad Dr. S P Dange said that early medical intervention can avoid irrevocable damage and deaths among such patients. “The black fungus infection originates from the nose itself and needs a group of specialists to cure if it goes unnoticed at the early stage. Around 50% patients treated at our facility said they approached hospital late out of fear of the disease or diagnostics, a mind-set which was also observed during early stages of Covid-19,” he said. The Government Dental College and Hospital has successfully treated 44 cases of mucormycosis, authorities said. Dr. Shrikant Sahasrabudhe, a pulmonologist and intensivist at Medicover Hospital in Aurangabad, said that Covid-19 patients should watch out for early signs of black fungus infection. “Headache on one or both sides or forehead, stuffy nose, nasal discharge and localized pain within or outside the nose, redness of eyes, tenderness of parts of the face, cold and sneezing can be wide spectrum of early symptoms of mucormycosis,” he said. Dr Ramesh Rohiwal, an ENT specialist, said that public awareness needs to be spread about mucormycosis on the line of Covid-19 infection. “The multi-pronged approach adopted by the government and society at large in management of Covid-19 needs to be replicated to deal with mucormycosis cases. The basic awareness includes early reporting to doctor, which even needs reduced use of Amphotercin B injections, whose smooth supply is still an issue at many places,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/late-reporting-issue-among-mucor-patients/articleshow/83210550.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Genome mapping, analytics to help ward off third wave||MUMBAI: The BMC will use science — from genome mapping to machine learning analytics — to try and stymie the third Covid-19 wave, if and when it arrives. “We will have our genomic laboratory ready later this month and we are in the process of tying up with management institutes to analyse past Covid trends in the city to arrive at answers,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Four wards — B (Bhendi Bazar), C (Girgaum), L (Kurla) and M (Mankhurd, Govandi East) — have been shortlisted for the analysis mainly because they had a Covid incidence of less than 3,000 per lakh population throughout the pandemic. “All other wards had a higher incidence. Mapping out reasons that clicked in these four wards will help use plan better,” said Kakani. Also, the BMC’s first whole genome sequencing laboratory will come up at Kasturba Hospital near Saat Raasta. The idea is to find variants of concern in Covid-positive samples at the earliest and implement public health measures, he added. As part of the ward analysis, the L ward office has already received a set of questionnaires from the head office and has begun collecting data. “The ward has several large slum pockets such as Qureshi Nagar, Zari mari, Sangarsh Nagar that have a high population density,’’ said ward medical health officer Dr Jitendra Jadhav. Teams have started calling up Covid-recovered patients as well as those who didn’t get infected to collect personal data on eating and travelling habits, sanitation facilities available to them and their socio-economic condition. C ward corporator Atul Shah said the study would underline the fact that lower middle-class people who reside in areas such as Kumbharwada and Bhendi Bazar followed the “mask discipline seriously”. Public health exercises such as keeping tabs on patients via the telephone and ensuring quarantine rules paid off in the ward, said health officer Dr Pramod Patil. MLA Amin Patel said herd immunity may have kicked in in some of these wards under study. “In wards B and C, the majority lives in small homes with common toilets. Social distancing is a challenge in these wards, resulting in herd immunity in these 14 months,” he said. C ward has large markets such as Mangaldas market, Zaveri Bazar, Lohar Chawl, metal and stainless steel markets that remained shut throughout the lockdown. “This automatically reduced the floating population in the area,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-genome-mapping-analytics-to-help-ward-off-third-wave/articleshow/83217135.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Pune||Pune: Credit co-op director held in fraud case||PUNE: The economic offences wing (EOW) of the city police has arrested Sunita Rajendra Naik (53), a director of the Adarsha Urban Cooperative Credit Society in Dhankawdi, in connection with a Rs47 crore cheating and misappropriation case. The case was registered last year with the Sahakarnagar police, following a special audit of the society’s accounts from 1991 to 2018. “The fraud amount includes more than Rs7 crore collected from 170 depositors against the promise of giving them attractive returns and failing to deliver on the promise,” deputy commissioner of police (EOW) Bhagyashri Navatake, who led the team that arrested Naik, told TOI. The suspect was produced before a magisterial court, which passed an order on Wednesday, remanding Naik in police custody till June 6. Police said Adarsha Urban Cooperative Credit Society has more than 800 depositors. It has no branches other than the one in Dhankawdi. The state government had ordered an audit of the cooperative credit society in 2018-19. The audit revealed embezzlement to the tune of Rs47 crore. The Sahakarnagar have registered a case of cheating, forgery, conspiracy, and criminal breach of trust under the Indian Penal Code. The police have also invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act. “During the course of the investigation, the police received complaints from 170 individuals, who stated that the society’s office-bearers had urged them to invest their money in the society by promising returns. The complainants claimed that the society did not give them any returns so far. They also claimed their initial investment was never refunded,” a police officer close to the investigation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/credit-co-op-director-held-in-fraud-case/articleshow/83214977.cms||---

The demand by other backward classes (OBC) to restore reservations in promotions in government jobs should be accepted, Rane said. “Even though the Supreme Court has raised questions on the manner in which the commission has given its report, it has allowed the state to give reservation to the deprived class. The state government should use this power,” Rane said. NCP chief Sharad Pawar should take the lead in building a consensus for Maratha reservation. He has been calling for reservation to economically background, instead he should promote the reservation for Marathas, Rane said. He said Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje should make concrete efforts for ensuring reservations. According to Rane, global tenders for vaccines had not yielded a response because “they demanded a 12% commission from the pharma firms manufacturing these medicines”. “The state government does not wish to curb Covid and its leaders are using it as an opportunity to make money,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maratha-obc-quota-must-be-priority-says-ex-cm-rane/articleshow/83215015.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Ever-changing modus operandi of fake currency racket baffles police||PRAYAGRAJ: Over the years, racketeers involved in circulation of fake currency in UP have managed to dodge police by using code words which are constantly changing, and hence, difficult to comprehend. Their current vocabulary, for example, includes words like ‘maal’ for fake currency, ‘chhota’ for Rs 500 fake note and ‘bada’ for Rs 2000 fake note. This was decoded by the Special Task Force (STF) which busted an interstate module in the city. The STF arrsted a key racketeer identified as Rupesh Kumar, resident of Nawabganj, on Tuesday in Kydganj area. Fake currency worth Rs one lakh was seized from his possession. His arrest has helped UP police bust the fake currency rakhet operating in the state. Interestingly, there was no pumping of fake currency from Indo-Bangladesh border to UP towns during the West Bengal Assembly elections and the lockdown period. Investigations also revealed that demand for fake notes of Rs 500 was much higher than the fake notes of Rs 2,000 as racketeers prefer to operate in rural markets to circulate fake currency. Deputy SP (STF) Navendu Kumar told TOI, “Apart from frequently altering the modus operandi, racketeers currently use words like maal for fake currency and Bada and Chota for Rs 2000 and Rs 500 fake notes respectively.” “The seized fake currency is so finely printed that it’s not an easy task to differentiate between fake and genuine notes in one look,” he added. The DSP further said that Vaishav Nagar, Jayainpur, Kalika Chak and Chauriyantpur in Malda districts of West Bengal are hotspots for smuggling fake currency across the country, and all racketeers collect fake currency notes from Indo-Bangladesh border for circulation in state. “A racketeer pays Rs 40,000 in cash (genuine notes) to the supplier in order to get Rs one lakh fake currency in denominations of Rs 2000,“ said the official, adding “The racketeer has to pay Rs 45,000 genuine currency to the supplier if he wants fake currency worth Rs one lakh in denominations of Rs 500.” The DSP said that racketeers often rope in needy college students or unemployed youths to smuggle in fake currency consignments from Malda to East and West UP districts on the basis of commission. Smugglers prefer train routes for transportation of fake currency consignments as they find rail the safest mode of transport for their nefarious designs. The racketeers do not keep the fake currency at their homes and hand it over to the agents at the earliest. STF is currently looking for one Ramu Sahu, resident of Atrampur (Nawabganj) in trans-Ganga area, who was recruiting youths and agents to bring fake currency consignments from Malda and Farakka in West Bengal. STF said that Ramu is the key racketeer who has been circulating fake currency in East UP districts including Prayagraj. Intelligence agencies have also come to know about one Deepak Mandal, resident of Jaiyanpur village (Malda), his brother Shyam Mandal and cousin Kanchan Mandal, who were key operators in pumping fake currency to different states of the country. The special cell of Delhi police had arrested Deepak and seized fake currency worth Rs 5.50 lakh from his possession on December 12, 2017. Deepak was described by the police as one of the key players in the fake currency racket who was active on the Indo-Bangladesh border. He was later bailed out. The racketeers involved in fake currency circulation frequently visited Kaliachakarea and Malda in West Bengal. On July 19, 2019, a team of STF (Prayagraj unit) had arrested a man identified as Achchelal Chaurasia alias Bachche Lal Chaurasia, resident of Pratapgarh, along with his four accomplices, and seized fake currency worth Rs 2.42 lakh from their possession, thus proving that the menace of fake currency rackets prevails since a long time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ever-changing-modus-operandi-of-fake-currency-racket-baffles-police/articleshow/83217001.cms||---

Responding to issues on the condition of lakes raised by citizens on Twitter, the municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao had directed the mayor and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials to find permanent solutions to the problems. Attaching photos and tagging the minister, Atluri Kumar had tweeted, “ktr sir this is the situation around Singadikunta or Taj banjara lake at road no 1 Banjara hills, this lake and nalla requires cleaning sir.There are blockages preventing free flow.of water.Require your attention sir.” (sic) “Request Mayor @GadwalvijayaTRS and @ZC_Khairatabad to visit and find a permanent solution,” tweeted the Minister in response.

---||Mumbai||BMC gets 93,000 doses, Mumbai vax drive to restart today after one-day break||MUMBAI: Vaccination will resume at public centres on Friday after a day’s hiatus due to stockout. The BMC on Thursday received over 87,000 doses of Covishield and 6,000 doses of Covaxin, which they said should sustain the drive for 2-3 days. Vaccination on Friday will be solely through online appointments. On Thursday, when public vaccinations had to completely shut due to shortage of doses, more than 35,000 are believed to have taken doses at private centres. Of late, private hospitals in Mumbai have received more doses than public ones. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the city received 87,120 doses of Covishield and 6,360 of Covaxin on Thursday. In order to minimise the digital divide, the city has been vaccinating through walk-ins on the first three days of the week and online registrations for the next three since May. Preliminary numbers show the response has been marginally better on ‘online’ vaccination days than walk-in, but civic officials said it is premature to say what was working better. An average of 38,000 people have got vaccinated daily on five ‘online’ days so far. By comparison, there have been nine walk-in days so far where an equal number have taken the vaccine. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they have got varied responses on mixed vaccination strategy. “One outcome has been that overcrowding has come under control in bigger centres as the drive has been decentralised,” he said. Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer at JJ Hospital, said the ‘online’ days are working well as staffers know how much crowd is to be expected. The BMC tweeted those aged 18-44 awaiting second Covaxin dose can walk in on Monday-Wednesday or book for Thursday-Saturday next week. In Maharashtra, 2,16,302 people got vaccinated on Wednesday, taking the total to 2.3 crore. They include 12.8 lakh in the 18-44 age group who have taken the first dose and 1,663 the second.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-gets-93k-doses-city-vax-drive-to-restart-today-after-one-day-break/articleshow/83217143.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Banaras Hindu University professor a part of online training camp for Toycathon||VARANASI: An assistant professor of the faculty of Visual Arts, Banaras Hindu University, Dr Manish Arora is one of the trainers of the ‘Toycathon-2021’, for which an online nationwide training camp will be organised on Friday. Arora, who is also the convener of Institute’s Innovation Cell-BHU, said that the participants from across the country will be introduced to Indian culture and associated toys and games in various sessions. Training will be given by design professionals on topics like introduction of Indian culture in toy and games; play factor in toy and games; elements and design for a toy; developing and manufacturing; marketing and intellectual property etc. In this training camp, faculties from the leading institutions of the country including Austin Davis of National Institute of Design, Bikram Pal of Shrishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design and Technology will train the participants. Apart from the faculties, participants will also be trained by industry experts and independent artists, said Arora. Arora said that today India’s toy market is estimated to be of around US$ 1.5 billion, however, a large part of it is dominated by imported toys. Despite being the origin of the world-renowned games like Chess, Ludo, Snakes and Ladders, India is not one of the leading manufacturers of toys. Most of the toys sold nationally, and globally, do not represent the Indian heritage, civilization and value systems. Keeping this in mind, ‘Toycathon-2021’ has been conceived under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Toycathon-2021 is an inter-ministerial initiative organised by the Innovation Cell of the Ministry of Education in collaboration with All India Council for Technical Education, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of MSME, Ministry of Textiles and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Its main objective is to develop the concept of games and toys based on Indian civilization, history, culture, mythology and ethos, to challenge the innovative minds of the young citizens of India for innovation in the production of games and toys. He said that in order to make India self-reliant in the field of toys, Toycathon-2021 is providing an opportunity for students, teachers, start-ups and toy experts/professionals of India to present their innovative toys and game concepts. A provisional prize money estimated up to Rs 50 lakh has also been designated for this scheme to attract the attention of a large number of people. Arora said that it was a matter of great pleasure that the Innovation Cell of the Ministry of Education has planned to accelerate the manufacture and production of sports toys in the country, in which the faculty of Visual Arts of Banaras Hindu University would be involved in training the participants from all over the country. Students and alumni associated with the faculty are also getting an opportunity to play a leading role in their training. He claimed that BHU has always played a leading role in the upliftment of all sectors of the society. “We sincerely hope that through Toycathon-2021, we will be able to make India Aatma Nirbhar in the manufacturing and production of games and toys,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bhu-prof-a-part-of-online-training-camp-for-toycathon/articleshow/83216876.cms||---

Kerala retained the top spot in the index while Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu jointly held the second position. In the 2020-21 index, Uttarakhand received 72 points – registering an increase of eight points compared to last year. According to the index, Uttarakhand made significant gains on the parameters of under-five mortality rate, institutional deliveries, reduced hunger and achieved 100% door-to-door collection of garbage in urban areas. Additionally, the state’s forest and tree cover also increased while the use of nitrogenous fertilisers and production of hazardous waste decreased in the Himalayan state. Notably, the SDG Index evaluates the performance of states and union territories on 16 goals ranging from social, economic and environmental parameters. However, despite recording overall growth, the state performed dismally when it came to gender equality. The index showed that the sex ratio at birth has gone down from 841 to 840 in Uttarakhand, making it the worst-performing state in terms of sex ratio at birth as Haryana climbed up the ladder from 833 to 843 in just one year. In adjoining Himachal Pradesh, the figure rose from 918 to 930 in the last year. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh and Kerala recorded healthy sex ratios of 958 and 957 respectively. Meanwhile, crime against women also increased in Uttarakhand as it went up from 36.8 crimes per one lakh female population to 46.50. The average salary received by women compared to men also went down in Uttarakhand. While a woman earned 78 paise against a rupee earned by a man in 2019 in Uttarakhand, the figure reduced to just 71 paise for a woman in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-bags-3rd-spot-in-sustainable-development-goals-index-but-records-worst-child-sex-ratio-in-the-country/articleshow/83212941.cms||Prashant Jha

No one came with food on Thursday night, again. Until the pandemic struck, the elder one used to work at a shoe factory as a temporary labourer. But the lockdown took away his job. Their parents long dead, the children have been waiting for some government help for the last six years. The hut in which the four children stay has no electric connection. There is one cot on which three sisters sleep. The elder brother sleeps on the floor. The hut is covered with cloth, tarpaulin pieces and discarded banners. Children have nowhere to hide when it rains. The elder brother tried, but could not land a ration card. The children, who live in the hut near the railway line in Rajnagar area, are now surviving on food offered by their neighbours and a child rights activist. In March 2016, state commission for protection of child rights member Jyoti Singh had visited them and directed officials to extend help. There has been no word from the officials ever since. According to neighbours, the father of the children died in a road accident in 2012. And due to lack of proper treatment, their mother succumbed to tuberculosis in 2015. Talking to TOI, Sonu said, “I have been working since my mother died. I worked at a tea stall, at a biryani shop and later found work as a labourer in shoe factories. After Covid-19 lockdown, I have no work. I feel helpless as I am not able to take care of my sisters. Sometimes we have to sleep on an empty stomach at night. We get help from neighbours but they are also poor and have limitations.” “Earlier, my two younger sisters were going to school. They used to get mid-day meal there. After Covid-19 outbreak last year, the schools also got shut. People who had been helping us also stopped coming. Since then, the situation has been very difficult for all of us. Since 2016, no official has come to meet us. I request the government to give us some relief. I cannot see my sisters suffering,” he said. Child right activist Naresh Paras who had been frequently visiting the children and enrolled two of them in government school said, “Over the last six years, I have written a dozen letters to the local and state authorities. But no help has been provided to them. I try to support them to the best of my capability and locals are also helping them. Pandemic has been difficult for all of us. I was not able to visit them for over a month due to lockdown. They have been suffering for too long, authorities need to help them under government schemes for children. Social organizations and people should also come forward to help them.” Paras said anti-social elements roam in the area at night. “The hut in which they live doesn’t even have a door,” he said. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said. “I am not aware of the unfortunate state in which the four children are living. We will ensure that they get benefit under the government schemes in a time-bound manner. Tomorrow, I will send a team to meet them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/parents-dead-4-kids-waiting-for-government-help-for-last-6-years/articleshow/83212935.cms||---

According to the prosecution story, complainant Mohd Faisal’s sister was alone in her house on January 21. Shanu jumped in his house and physically exploited the girl with a pistol-point. He also threatened the girl that he would kill her brothers if she would tell anyone about the incident to anyone. He later ran away from the house before the survivor’s mother could reach there. The girl later narrated the story to her mother and brother. According to additional district government counsel (ADGC) Sushil Kumar Verma, the defence counsel pleaded before the court that the complainant had taken a sum of Rs 50,000 as loan from the accused on different dates. Since the complainant did not want to return his money, he had fabricated this story and implicated him. He was innocent and has no criminal history, therefore, bail should be granted to him. The ADGC strongly opposed the deliberations and said the accused had physically exploited a minor girl on pistol-point. He had also threatened to kill her brothers if she would tell the incident to anyone. The charges levelled against him were of serious nature, therefore, his bail should be rejected. The presiding officer in his order observed that the charges levelled against the alleged accused were of serious nature and there was no sufficient ground for bail. Therefore, the bail application of Shanu alias Shahnawaz was being rejected. Parole rejected : The presiding judge also rejected the parole application of accused Golu Singh, who had sought parole on the ground of high court directives for jails in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. He has been accused of physically exploiting a minor girl. The accused in his application had submitted that he was a heart patient and was in the jail since May 1, 2020.There were strong apprehensions that he could be infected from Covid-9 in over-crowded jails. His regular bail application was pending at Allahabad high court, but due to corona pandemic hearing could not take place. The high court had passed an order to release the jail birds on parole. In view of that, he should be released on parole and he assures the court that he would not misuse the parole and comply with the court’s directives, it was pleaded. Moreover, he would surrender before the court when his parole period is over. Therefore, he should be granted five-month-long parole. The presiding judge in his order observed that the accused himself had stated that his bail application was pending in high court. The offence (of physically exploiting a minor girl) committed by him was of serious nature. His case did not come under the ambit of the high court’s order regarding parole. Hence, his parole application was being rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bail-plea-of-minor-girls-rape-accused-rejected/articleshow/83217133.cms||---

The Union government has already said that the states are free to make changes as land is a state subject. Meanwhile, Shantilal Kataria, Credai vice-national president, said that the act would boost the rental segment in the state. “It is a long-awaited model act and this being a state subject, the government would be expected to adopt it and form rules and appoint competent authority at the earliest,” he said. He further stated that the act would protect the interest of both tenants and owners and ensure speedy adjudication mechanism for resolution of disputes. Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Property Consultants, said the act could fuel the rental housing supply pipeline by attracting more investors, and more rental housing stock would help students, migrant population to find accommodation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-set-to-implement-tenancy-act-awhad/articleshow/83215031.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Allahabad||Fresh applications invited for ex-gratia compensation||PRAYAGRAJ: Following fresh guidelines issued by the state government with regard to compensation to the next of kin of those government servants who contracted Covid-19 while performing Panchayat poll duties and ended up losing their lives, the district administration has now asked the kin of such individuals to apply afresh for the compensation in accordance with the new norms. This time, the head of the department (where the deceased was employed) will need to endorse the duty slip and the same will have to be countersigned by the chief medical officer (CMO), endorsing the fact that the said employee has died because of Covid. This document will need to be deposited to the district administration. The ADM (city) has been made the nodal officer for this process, informed officials. During the election duty performed by the employees of the state government in April and May, the two months when the pandemic was at its peak, there were several employees who got infected with Covid, and some of them even succumbed to it. Later, when the state government asked the family members of the deceased employees to submit the claims for getting compensation, families of 74 employees of the district had applied. Out of these, documents of 42 employees were complete in every aspect. However, during the scrutiny by the district administration officials, none of the claims were approved. This is because according to the old rules, ex-gratia payment could be given only if the employee died either on duty or during travel to and from the place of duty. However, the new guidelines issued by the state government stated that the kin of staff who contracted Covid on UP panchayat election duty and died after reaching home, will also be eligible for ex-gratia compensation, even if the death occurred 30 days after the day of duty. The government has also announced its decision to give compensation of Rs 30 lakh each to the kin of such an individual. But now all old applications stand invalid. The relatives will need to submit new applications. The family members of the deceased have been asked to deposit documents including certificate of election duty, report of Covid infection and death certificate. All the forms have to be submitted by the next of kin of the employees to the head of the department where they were posted. Once the head of the department forwards the claim, it will be signed by the CMO. After this, the documents will be deposited to ADM (city). “People should submit the documents as soon as possible,” said ADM (city) Ashok Kumar Kanaujia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/fresh-applications-invited-for-ex-gratia-compensation/articleshow/83217126.cms||---

Launched on June 1, the officials of the health department saw a low turnout on the first day (Tuesday) as only 232 recipients were administered Covid vaccine dose against the set target of 500 at five sites — GIC, Mary Wana Maker Inter College, Roadways workshop, Bamrauli airport and Prayagraj news reporters workplace. However, on the second day (June 2), a total 472 recipients were administered jab at the five centres against the set target of 600 offering a little respite to the officials of the health department. Nodal officer (immunization) and additional chief medical officer, Dr Teerath Lal on Thursday told TOI: “We are making sincere efforts to increase the turnout at Abhibhavak special vaccination centres as 704 beneficiaries were administered the jab at five sites against a set target of 1,100. Health teams are promoting vaccination among the parents of children below 12 years of age after seeing lukewarm response in the past two days.” He, however, said that apart from Abhibhavak special vaccination sites in city areas, other 64 vaccination sites in rural and urban areas have recorded progressive pace in vaccination and the daily number of inoculations crossed the 12,000 mark for the first time last week. Analysis of the health department claimed that over 70% recipients were from the age group between 18-44 years at all 69 sites of vaccination centres. Dr Lal said, “There has been an increasingly good response from urban people who believe that vaccination is the only key to beat the virus. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of recipients at urban vaccination centres.” Similarly, officials of the health department argued that they are also making efforts to erase the myths regarding vaccination among rural people, particularly middle-aged and aged people who refuse to get a vaccine administered when contacted by primary health workers or anganwadi workers. As many as 5,91,272 Covid vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, including those above 45 years and between 18-44 years, in the district till June 2. While 4,80,123 beneficiaries had taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,11,548 recipients had also received the second dose of the vaccine. Figures of the health department revealed that on an average, over 10,000 vaccine doses were administered to beneficiaries daily of all age groups, including 45 plus and recipients between the age group of 18-44 years in the district.

---||India||Covid: Centre may review its role in vaccine programme in August||NEW DELHI: With public and political debate again veering around whether it should be the Centre’s prerogative and role to procure vaccines for Covid control, the primacy of the central government in immunisation programmes is once again being seen as a likely model. Though the Centre has only recently altered its policy responding to public and poitical pressure to allow procurement by states and private hospitals, there might be review around August when the Centre plans a very rapid ramp up of coverage. States, particularly the smaller ones, face bottlenecks in procurement, storage and administration of vaccines in such a large scale, it is felt. While vaccine manufacturers have been resisting supplying to individual states, issues like price negotiations, drafting global tenders, logistics and human resource management are seen as concerns in expanding the coverage of vaccines at a later stage. The Centre has already announced its intent to vaccinate all adults above 18 years of age by December this year, which is would translate to around 94 crore people. Public health experts say procurement and distribution of vaccines on such a large scale coverage has to be centrally driven. In fact, many argue that even opening up of vaccination for the adult population was primarily a political decision taken by the Centre amid a lot of pressure from states, whereas prioritisation should also be its call based on availability of the jabs. “Procurement of vaccines, and even distribution to states, have to be a central function. States should not be left in a difficult position to compete with each other, or with private hospitals.The Centre has to take charge of that because ultimately just we say no country is safe till every country is safe. No part of India is going to be safe till every part is safe. That is the philosophy that we have to follow,” says Prof K Srinath Reddy, President, Public Health Foundation of India. Mass immunisation programmes are usually run by the Centre in favour of vaccine equity. Senior officials at the Centre maintain the current policy will be reviewed by July end once supplies improve and there is room to ramp up the drive on a “Mission mode”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-centre-may-review-its-role-in-vaccine-programme-in-august/articleshow/83220583.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Thane||Thane’s first private doorstep drive||THANE: The first ever private immunization camp for housing societies in Thane was flagged off, Thursday, at the Hiranandani Estate with nearly 100 beneficiaries participating. The Thane corporation has given permission to nearly 102 private hospitals and clinics, Thursday, to conduct vaccination drives in collaboration with commercial units and housing societies. As part of the same, a private hospital from Navi Mumbai has tied up with a housing society in Thane to start the initiative starting Thursday. “The idea is to hasten the pace of immunization in the upscale locales. We have delivered over 3 lakh doses till date and want to increase the volume with private participation and be prepared for any projected wave,” said V Deogikar, medical officer of health, TMC. The first ever drive registered nearly 100 participants across age groups lined up for the vaccination, Thursday and the numbers are likely to swell in the coming days, said BJP corporator Manohar Dumbre who coordinated the same in the township located within his ward. “There was very little participation from the high end localities to the municipal vaccination drives, probably fearing infection by stepping outside or long waiting hours. The delay in registration was also a deterrent. Accordingly, we decided to bring the vaccines closer home and after a positive response from residents, flagged off the initiative, Thursday,” justified Dumbre. Meanwhile, residents said they were happy that they may not have to travel around for vaccination and get it near the convenience of their homes. “We are happy that elders and the ailing lot will get the doses right near their homes without spending time travelling to government facilities,” said a vaccine aspirant at the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/thanes-1st-pvt-doorstep-drive/articleshow/83217162.cms||Manoj Badgeri

They were both staying in Lalitpur with an acquaintance after running away from their homes. The couple was rushed to the community health centre (CHC) Talbeth, from where they were referred to Jhansi Medical College where their condition is said to be stable. As per reports, the youth, identified as Santosh, had eloped with a minor girl from Charkhari area of Mahoba district a few days ago. Both of them were staying in Bucha village falling under police station Jakhora in Lalitpur district with a known person and were planning to marry each other. The parents of the girl had lodged a report of abduction, after which the Mahoba police started a hunt for the girl. They put the mobile of the girl on surveillance and found its location in Lalitpur district. As a result, a team of Mahoba police went to the village on Wednesday and apprehended both of them. While returning, as the police vehicle carrying them reached Talbeth, the couple somehow managed to consume the poison they were carrying with them. As they started losing consciousness, police got alerted and straight away took them to the nearby CHC, from where they were referred to Jhansi Medical College. Confirming the incident, SP Lalitpur Pramod Kumar said they did not know the presence of Mahoba police as they took the couple without informing them. On the other hand, as per chief medical superintendent (CMS) of Jhansi Medical College, Dr Harishchandra Arya, both of them had consumed rat poison. Their condition is stable and both of them are out of danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/runaway-couple-consume-poison-in-lalitpur-condition-said-to-be-stable/articleshow/83217155.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Allahabad University to offer free education to students losing both parents to Covid-19||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when a number of families have lost their near and dear ones in the present Covid-19 pandemic and several educational institutions, organisations as well as the government have come forward to help them, Allahabad University too has decided to lend a helping hand to the students who have lost their parents to the novel coronavirus by offering free education. This includes those who are already enrolled in the varsity. “The prevailing corona crisis in the country for the past two years has had a deep impact on the lives of the people and caused deep emotional, psychological, financial and social turmoil. Approximately, 9,000 children have lost both parents due to Covid 19. It is the responsibility of each one of us and also the government to ensure sustenance of their education, means of livelihood and security, especially in case of the girl child,” AU public relations officer (PRO) Jaya Kapoor told TOI on Thursday. The university has a responsibility as a part of its commitment to social welfare to reach out to such children, who have lost both their parents and thereby face the challenge of being able to continue their education, she added. “In view of this fact, AU vice -chancellor Prof Sangita Srivastava has sent a proposal to the district administration wherein she has informed that AU will offer supernumerary seats for students who have lost both parents due to Covid-19. There will also be a complete waiver of the fees along with any other charges related to academics for these children who have lost both mother and father.” In addition, the varsity is also sensitive to the already enrolled students of AU. “The same benefits would be provided to already enrolled students. The only criteria would be that the student concerned would have to present proof of death of both mother and father,” said Prof Srivastava. To cater to the rest of the needs of the child, fostering (where a child who needs home is taken into your home and taken care of without adoption of the child), and ‘Earn while you learn’ schemes will fall in place to prepare them for a better future, the VC has decided. ‘Earn while you learn’ is a novel scheme being followed by some universities of the country wherein enrolled students help their departments or central facilities like libraries performing small duties (arranging books or files) against which they are paid some remuneration. Talking of the criteria, to claim the admission at AU under supernumerary quota, the PRO informed TOI that only those students would be eligible to avail the facility at AU who have passed the intermediate examination and produce death certificate of both parents due to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-to-offer-free-edu-to-studentslosing-both-parents-to-covid-19/articleshow/83217119.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

During the meeting of the working group, the UP government was represented by the director, ground water department, UP, VK Upadhyay and DM Jhansi Andra Vamsi, while on behalf of Israel, it was attended by their team leader Den Aloof along with his team members. Den Aloof said that basic planning for irrigation through river Pahuj in Babina block has already been drawn and now it is time for executing it. For this, they have finalised one out of three companies for executing the work. On the other hand, DM Jhansi assured full cooperation for executing this ambitious and important project. He also invited the Israel team to visit the site. “The project is very important for the long-term water sustainability of this region. Therefore, we are putting our best efforts to execute it successfully,” the DM told TOI on Thursday. An MoU was signed between the two sides on August 20, 2019, for creating an India-Israel Bundelkhand Water Project and successively a ‘plan of cooperation’ was launched to create a long-term sustainable water management project for the region. This was done keeping in mind that the geographical condition of Bundelkhand region is similar to that of Israel with the latter having much less rainfall and still being a water sufficient region because of their unique conservation techniques. Meanwhile, Jhansi-based Central Agroforestry Research Institute (CAFRI) has been able to develop a number of agroforestry-based interventions for water conservation technologies in different parts of Bundelkhand region. As per director CAFRI Dr A Arunachalam, these scientific projects developed in the past one decade have helped in raising the water tables at a number of places across the region giving suitable results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/up-govt-israel-giving-final-shape-to-water-project-for-bundelkhand/articleshow/83217175.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Varanasi||Surveillance of children in Varanasi division begins||VARANASI: Officials in the Varanasi division consisting of Varanasi, Jaunpur, Ghazipur and Chandauli districts have started surveillance of children in view of the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 pandemic. In a special surveillance drive launched in the division, among the first 828 samples of minors of 0 to 18 year age group collected on June 1, as many as two — one below 5 year and one in 13-18 age group — tested positive for Covid-19. The officials, who plan to monitor daily reports of this special surveillance drive, will be able to ascertain the trend and formulate a strategy to nip the problem in the bud. Providing details of the special surveillance drive regarding minors in 0-18 years of age group, commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “After completing basic preparations in the paediatric section in the mid of May to meet any challenge arising out of the anticipated third wave of Covid, we finalised a strategy for special surveillance by discussing ways with paediatricians of government and private hospitals. It was then decided to ensure that half of the total samples being collected in Varanasi, Jaunpur, Ghazipur and Chandauli districts of the division daily are of children of 0-18 age group.” “The 0-18 age group has also been divided in 0-5 year, 6-12 year and 13-18 year age group categories. The surveillance drive started from June 1,” said Agrawal. “I have been given details of the initial day outcome of Varanasi district only, according to which a total of 828 samples had been collected in all the three above mentioned categories. When lab test reports of the samples were received on Thursday morning, one child in the 0-5 year and one in the 13-18 year age group was found positive,” the commissioner told TOI on Thursday. “The samples are sent to the BHU lab with special marking in order to receive the results for monitoring and analysing on a day to day basis for knowing the trend. All children reaching paediatricians, including private practitioners, in government hospitals, primary and community health centres with any ailment are being tested,” he said. “Even private practitioners have been given viral transport medium (VTM) kits used for collection of samples for RT-PCR test in this regard, said Agrawal adding if the daily report of this surveillance will show a trend of growth, the drive to tackle the problem before the situation worsens would be intensified,” he further told TOI. Taking lessons from the beginning of second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, which had wreaked havoc and led to fatalities due to lack of sufficient oxygen, oxygenated beds and ventilators for surprisingly increased Covid infected persons, the Varanasi administration and health department had not only developed a model to bring the situation under control, but also started preparations for the third wave. Since May 18, the facility augmentation exercises at the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the paediatric and chest departments of Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) Hospital of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) were intensified. Both Agrawal and district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma also sought information about the available facilities, medical equipment and also requirement of articles necessary for combating the Covid menace in case it affects children as per predictions by experts. The list of companies, which can supply necessary medical equipment for paediatric uses, had also been sought by officials. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had also taken stock of all these preparations during his May 25 visit to Varanasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/surveillance-of-children-invaranasi-division-begins/articleshow/83216925.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The woman identified as Munni Devi, a resident of Chandanpur village could be seen hiding herself behind a grain storage container in the video that went viral on social media on Thursday. Health department sources informed TOI that on Tuesday, Sadar MLA Sarita Bhadauria and a team of health workers visited Chandanpur to vaccinate local residents against the coronavirus. “When the MLA and health workers reached Munni’s house, initially she tried to hide herself behind the door, but later tried to dodge the health team and ran inside and sat behind a grain storage container in one of the rooms of her house.” The viral video shows that later a man started conversing with her saying: “Amma, Amma kahan ho? Itthe aao, Amma, dekho Vidhayak ji aayi hain. (Amma, Amma where are you? Come out, see MLA has come).”Soon, a female health staff tried to convince the elderly woman. She asked her not to be scared and assured that she would not be given the vaccine. “Rural -folks are a little apprehensive about Covid vaccine. We along with health department officials are convincing them to not hesitate and get vaccinated. This elderly woman was initially standing near the door, later she ran and hid behind a container on coming across health department staff,” said Sarita Bhadauria, BLP MLA from Etawah Sadar while talking to reporters. Recently, locals of a village in Barabanki in order to skip vaccination jumped into the Saryu river after seeing health workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/old-woman-hides-on-seeing-covid-vaccination-team/articleshow/83217144.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress minister announces end to lockdown, govt says still mulling plan||MUMBAI: A sudden announcement on Thursday by a Maharashtra minister declaring an immediate end to the lockdown in the country’s most Covid-affected state and phase-wise resumption of all activities threw the administration into turmoil and prompted the government to issue a carefully worded denial that said the move was still under consideration. Congress leader and relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, not unaccustomed to premature declarations, stirred a controversy by saying that a decision was taken by the state disaster management authority (SDMA) to unlock based on the steady decline in Covid infections. Districts/municipal corporations would be graded at five levels for opening up, he said, based on positivity rate and occupancy of oxygenated beds. Wadettiwar said 43 districts and municipal corporations each with over 10 lakh population had been graded ( see graphic ). Those with less than 5% positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy below 25%—including Thane, Nagpur and Aurangabad—would be totally opened up, he added. Areas with a positivity rate of 5% or more and bed occupancy of 25-40%—including Mumbai—are at Level 2. Wadettiwar indicated that places at Level 1 would benefit from a complete opening-up. Minister’s decision to ‘end’ lockdown brings forth denial from info departmentRelief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar’s announcement that the lockdown would be lifted starting this weekend in a graded manner came without the knowledge or sanction of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. His announcement drew positive responses from sectors reeling under the financial impact of the lockdown, but there was consternation in government circles. Soon after the news reached the official residence of the CM, a denial came from the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations, saying no such decision had been taken and that the proposal of the relief and rehabilitation department was still under consideration by the CMO. According to sources, Thackeray was unhappy over the manner in which Wadettiwar unveiled the plan without consulting the CMO or the chief secretary. “We have drafted a plan for lifting the lockdown in a graded manner, we have prepared five levels for the purpose. There is a scientific basis to the plan and it is apolitical. In our view, Wadettiwar exceeded his brief. Before making the announcement, he should have consulted the CM. If we lift the lockdown completely, there will be chaos across the state and the day will not be far off, when there will be a massive surge in cases,” a senior bureaucrat said. Senior bureaucrats said senior ministers of the MVA were vying with each other to reach out to the media even before a final decision was taken on sensitive matters. They said the trend was causing some embarrassment to the government. Wadettiwar who earlier in the day had said the implementation of the relaxations would begin from Friday, later deferred to protocol and clarified that the proposal had been approved in-principle. A final order will have to be issued by the CM for the implementation of the plan in a phase-wise manner, he said. Not surprisingly, Wadettiwar blamed the media for beaming his statements.  “The media showed it in such a way that (it seemed) the entire state will be unlocked, which led to confusion. In areas where cases are going down we will need to give them relaxations," the minister said. According to the plan shared by the minister, a weekly review will be undertaken and depending on the positivity rate and bed occupancy, districts will be raised or lowered in ranking and sectors opened or shut accordingly. The requirement of Rt-PCR negative reports for travel within the state may also be waived, except for an e-pass which may be needed in districts with high positivity. And people entering from other states will still require a negative report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ministers-decision-to-end-lockdown-brings-forth-denial-from-govt/articleshow/83217200.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Chandigarh||For 1.32cr in 18-44 yrs age group, Punjab manages 5.43 lakh doses||Chandigarh: Home to about 1.32 crore population in the age group of 18-44 years, the Punjab government has so far managed to get only 5.43 lakh doses of vaccines for Phase-III of the ongoing Covid immunisation drive. The state needs around 2.64 crore doses of vaccine to fully vaccinate the entire population of this age group as per the prescribed protocol. Punjab is among the states which were late to start the process of immunising beneficiaries of this age group due to non-availability of the vaccines. After much delay, the state government on May 14 kick-started the much-awaited drive by vaccinating families of healthcare workers in both government and private sectors, as well as those suffering from co-morbidities. Of 4.29 lakh doses of Covishield procured by the state government as per the allocation done by the central government, 4.25 lakh have been used and only 3,560 are left as of June 2. Similarly, out of 1.14 lakh doses of Covaxin, only 68,640 are left. So far, 4,72,869 beneficiaries of the age group have received their first dose. With 1,17,280 getting their first dose, Ludhiana leads the tally of immunisation in the age group followed by Patiala, the home district of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, where 61,328 have been inoculated, 40,103 in Jalandhar, 39,953 in Hoshiarpur and 29,327 in Gurdaspur. The shortage of vaccine has taken a toll on the daily immunisation target. According to data of the health department, against the average daily target of 2,28,571, Punjab managed to vaccinate 57,496 (25%) people on average per day from April 20 to May 31. To overcome the shortage of vaccine, the state government even made attempt to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers. Pfizer and Modern refused to sell vaccines directly to the state government as they only deal with the Government of India. The situation is not likely to improve in the coming weeks as the state is likely to continue getting low allocation. Punjab’s nodal officer for vaccination Vikas Garg said the state government had been asking for immediate allocation of the required number of vaccine dose for the 18-44 age group. “As per the communication received, we are expected to get about 18,000 doses on June 8 and 1.17 lakh on June 11,” he said. In all, 51,44,133 doses have been administered in different groups till June 2. Of the total, 10,36,251 doses have been given to frontline workers, 3,09,758 to healthcare workers and 33,25,255 in the age group of 45 and above. Out of every 100, 2.6 have been fully vaccinated and 14.5 have received first their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/for-1-32cr-in-18-44-yrs-age-group-punjab-manages-5-43-lakh-doses/articleshow/83217179.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Goa||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant nixes plan for pre-marriage advice||PANAJI: Barely three days after law minister Nilesh Cabral announced that pre-marriage counselling would be made compulsory for couples seeking to get married — in light of the rising number of divorce cases in the state — chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday said the government would not consider the proposal as it has been receiving mixed views from different sections of society. “The government is not keen on introducing something new of this kind right now. At present, my decision is not to consider it,” Sawant told TOI. BJP’s state unit on Thursday morning had strongly opposed the move for pre-marriage counselling, with state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade saying that the unit had already conveyed to the chief minister to not proceed with the proposal. He told TOI that the party had not been taken into consideration regarding the decision of pre-marriage counselling even as he pointed out that there are at least 11,000 marriages registered in the state each year. “Considering these records, the state will have to conduct pre-marriage counselling for at least 22,000 people. Can the government counsel so many persons? Does the state government have such resources?” Tanavade said. Also, who will guarantee that even after counselling there will not be any divorces?” he said. Tanavade said parents themselves were mature enough to counsel their children prior to marriage. State BJP vice-president Dattaprashad Kholkar also agreed with Tanavade’s views. In a social media post, he demanded to know how many couples file for divorce within six months of marriage. “Are the 25-30 year olds of Goa immature and uneducated that they don’t understand the aspects of marriage? Aren’t the parents and family elders capable of counselling their wards?” Taking a potshot at Cabral, Kholkar said, “Irresponsible talk to grab headlines and publicity. Please don’t tarnish the image of Goan youth with false propaganda. Don’t sow the seeds of separation and divorce amongst the would-be brides and grooms of Goa. You don’t have the right to disturb the social fabric and interfere in the sacred marriage process of Goans, except the registration formalities.” The law minister had said that counselling, which would be conducted by the state itself, would “explain the concept of marriage” to couples before they’re allowed to enter wedlock. Cabral had told reporters that the counselling would be done immediately after the first signature and would be conducted through the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development (GIPARD). “The certificate of completion of counselling (from GIPARD) would be compulsory for the second signature,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-nixes-plan-for-pre-marriage-advice/articleshow/83218182.cms||Murari Shetye

Salt Lake BE block Nagarik Sangha conducted such a camp on Thursday as did CB block. In the latter, Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation board of administrators member Rajesh Chirimar organised the vaccination for 800 residents. Several other block committees are slated to organize vaccination camps over the next few days. Around 800 residents were vaccinated at the camp in CB block community hall. “We intend doing one vaccination camp every week to cover more Salt Lake residents,” Chirimar said. CD block citizens council is going to hold the vaccination camp at their community centre hall on Saturday and Sunday with 700 block residents registered to take the vaccine. AA block committee is also going to hold its vaccination camp on Saturday. FD block committee, HA block residents forum and few others are going to organize vaccination camps for their block residents and are enrolling names. Though the first preference is block residents, relatives of residents can also get registered for the shots. BD block helpline, a group comprising of youth residents of BD block, is going to hold a vaccination camp via a tie-up with a private hospital in the second week of June with preference for inoculation being given first to block residents and others later on. In New Town, local NGO New Town Forum and News (NTFN) conducted a vaccination camp at the business club for 18+ age group residents. Several hundreds of residents, including a few 80+ aged senior citizens, took the jab. Many gated communities in New Town are already organising such camps through tie-ups with private hospitals. The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) and New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) have been continuing with vaccinating the frontline workers, hawkers and street vendors in Salt Lake and New Town and both the civic bodies are hoping to launch the drive to vaccinate 18+ age group residents from next week onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/block-level-vax-camps-for-18-start-in-salt-lake/articleshow/83214880.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur labs in quality control mode as positivity is in decimals||NAGPUR: The unprecedented decline in test positivity rate at five public labs here has left officials baffled. As a large number of samples tested negative in the last two days, some of them started placing a known positive sample in the testing plate to ascertain if the PCR machines were working properly. On Wednesday, none of the AIIMS, GMCH, IGGMCH, Neeri and RTMNU Covid testing labs reported more than five positive cases. On Thursday, the highest number of samples processed were 1,198 by AIIMS. Of these, there were just 10 positive cases at the rate of 0.83%. Neeri had none positive from 93 samples, RTMNU had 8 from 323, IGGMCH 16 from 1057 and GMCH 36 from 1182 samples. Lab officials said no positive case was detected from the samples processed till Thursday afternoon. These would be reported on Friday.  The first three labs processed over 1000-1200 samples and found 1, 2, 3, respectively, positive cases on Wednesday. All the labs told TOI that the positive case numbers were incomplete yet they were under 15 from the same sample size. Civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar didn’t respond to TOI’s queries regarding the data. As cases began to spike, these labs were recording test positivity rate between 12% and 19% in mid-February. The percentage touched 52% during second wave peak and gradually started declining. However, in the last few days, the percentage plummeted below zero leaving lab officials perplexed. An official from IGGMCH said such steep decline wasn’t reported before. “We had to cross check the result by inserting a known positive sample among the 94 samples in the plate. The known sample is from earlier testing and preserved for study. Our doubts were allayed only after the same sample tested positive while the rest were negative," the official said. Dr Meena Mishra, professor and head of department of microbiology at AIIMS, said there is nothing to worry if large number of samples are testing negative. “At AIIMS, as part of quality control, we put one positive control, one negative control, and one positive sample of a day before. If labs are following this mechanism, I think there is nothing to worry,” she said. Dr Mishra added the concentrated efforts for contact tracing, maximum number of samples processed by government and private labs have contributed in early detection, and timely intervention that has helped in the decline in positivity to a large extent. “Movement relaxation in restricted phase is a good idea. The unlocking is happening after a good achievement. I don’t think we need to apprehend any resurgence if we continue to follow safety norms. Experts have also opined that the third wave may not be as severe as this one,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/labs-in-quality-control-mode-as-positivity-is-in-decimals/articleshow/83217186.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The company will directly sell and invoice its customers, with dealers still responsible for sales and deliveries. The company said the model — under trials — dubbed “retail for the future” will be rolled out in India in the fourth quarter of this year. The company said the model would be a “win-win” for its customers and dealers, with uniform prices on inventory, and reduced risk and liabilities for dealers. “The stock will be held by Mercedes-Benz India, with decentralized storage at franchise-partner locations. Our franchise partners will not have to undertake inventory cost. The franchise partner will take the order, and the company (would) fulfil it. The model will also provide uniform prices on our cars to customers,” Martin Schwenk, MD and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India, said. “We are glad to have the collaboration of our franchise partners in this transition, further empowering them to have significantly lower risks, resulting in a profitable and sustainable business model,” Schwenk added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/merc-to-roll-out-direct-company-sales-in-2021/articleshow/83214871.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Delhi||HC slams Sainik Farm RWAs for levy on vehicles||New Delhi: When everyone is doing charity during the Covid time, you are making money out of it, Delhi High Court on Friday said to two Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) of Sainik Farms, which were charging entry fees from vehicles entering the colony. “You (RWAs) have to step up during these Covid times. How can you charge entry fees during these times? Everyone is doing charity, but you are using Covid-19 to extract money.  “People are not even earning. You are making money out of this. Very nice,” Justice Rekha Palli said to the two RWAs and directed them not to charge entry fees from anyone coming to the colony during these times. The high court also directed that taxi and autorickshaws, being used by residents and vegetable and fruit sellers, will also not be charged entry fees. The RWAs also gave a statement before the court that they would not be charging emergency service vehicles, those carrying essential items or medicines and even e-commerce delivery vehicles carrying groceries and other amenities. Meanwhile, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and Delhi Police told the court that the two RWAs put up the gates and were charging fees without their permission. The RWAs contended that the road was a private one constructed of their private land, and since SDMC has “washed off” its hands from repairing their roads, they were charging the entry fees for maintaining their roads. The court said, while the RWAs might have a point when the situation was normal, but not during the pandemic. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-slams-sainik-farm-rwas-for-levy-on-vehicles/articleshow/83247067.cms||---

The MMRDA chief’s position can only be filled by an official from the IAS cadre, according to the IAS Cadre Rules, 1954.

---||Dehradun||DMC: Race against time to clean drains and rivers before monsoon||DEHRADUN: The task of cleaning drains is a huge challenge for Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) to avoid waterlogging during incessant rainfall. The new wards, in particular, face difficulties during the monsoon as water enters homes, causing inconvenience to people. After reminders by the district magistrate, the irrigation department has now written to DMC for cleaning the drains soon. The issue of waterlogging is one of the major problems for the residents living in wards and areas such as Kishan Nagar, Khudbuda mohalla, Govind Garh, Indira colony and Chukkuwala. Last year, too, the residents had suffered losses during heavy showers. Sanjay Thakur, a resident of Khudbuda mohalla, said, “Our locality is in a total mess when there is heavy rainfall. If the authorities take appropriate steps, the problem can be addressed to a large extent.” Irrigation department officials had recently written to the DMC highlighting the significance of cleaning drains and rivers like Choti Bindal before the arrival of monsoon in the state. The letter from the irrigation department had also signalled that "slow pace of work is due to fund crunch during the pandemic". DMC officials, however, claimed the work of cleaning drains and rivers is in full swing. Chief municipal health officer, Kailash Joshi, told TOI, “We have started the task of cleaning drains. Rivers are being cleaned in mission mode as well. We aim to complete the task by June 15." "In addition, we will set up a control centre for assistance to people during the monsoon season,” Joshi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dmc-race-against-time-to-clean-drains-and-rivers-before-monsoon/articleshow/83213059.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Dehradun||Imposing curfew not our hobby, will ease curbs when situation is under control: Subodh Uniyal||DEHRADUN: In a sharp reaction to the protest by traders, who seek nod to open shops, agriculture minister and state government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “Imposing curfew is not our hobby but the need of the hour. If traders have faced losses, so has the state government but we cannot put the lives of people at stake by opening the markets. After June 8, we may consider extending some relaxation but the decision will be based on the pandemic situation at that time.” To recall, the Covid curfew started in Uttarakhand on March 11 and has been thrice extended but the pandemic situation has improved in the state during the period. Last month, the single-day Covid-19 infections shot up to nearly 10,000 in Uttarakhand. Over the last few days, the cases have come down to 1,000 per day. The test positivity rate, which had risen above 25% per day, is now below 10%. “The numbers have gone down but we cannot sit back and relax. The state government has suffered a major loss in revenue. Uttarakhand's economy is based on tourism and Covid-induced restrictions have claimed a big toll on the revenue of the state government. Easing out things too early can once again increase the number of Covid cases,” the minister said. He, however, pointed out that if the situation improves in the next few days, the state government could consider giving some relaxation from June 8. “Further relaxations would depend on the situation. I would like to request all traders to understand the situation. It is a tough phase for them as it is for us,” said Uniyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/imposing-curfew-not-our-hobby-will-ease-curbs-when-situation-is-under-control-subodh-uniyal/articleshow/83213039.cms||Kautilya Singh

The court directed a judicial inquiry against the accused, his relatives, the lawyer, hospital staff and police officials. It underlined that, all the parties who come to the court, needed to come with clean hands, especially during the pandemic, as the courts were being empathetic and compassionate towards those infected. “Encashing on the court’s empathy by placing forged reports is ‘not condonable, at all’,” said Justice Prathiba M Singh. The court noted the conclusions of a vigilance report on the issue and observed that administration of criminal justice “would be severely jeopardised if such illegalities are condoned, or if apologies given are accepted, when such brazen conduct is revealed.” The court directed the registrar general to refer the matter to the concerned judicial magistrate to conduct an inquiry and proceed in accordance with law against accused Narender Kasana, his four nephews, the nursing assistant at the District MMG Hospital in Ghaziabad and the advocate Anand Kataria. The role of police would also be inquired by the magistrate, it ordered.

---||Nagpur||Tigress mauls vet in Chandrapur, crushes all toes with jaws, paw||CHANDRAPUR: Wildlife veterinary officer of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve Dr Ravikant Khobragade was seriously injured in a tiger attack in the Doni forest in the buffer zone on Thursday morning. The tigress crushed the toes on both his feet with its jaws and paws. A tigress had suffered some injury in Doni area of Mul (buffer) range, and was moving sluggishly since some days. The local staff of range was keeping close watch over the tigress since last couple of days. The rapid response unit (RRU) of TATR headed by Dr Khobragade went to Doni forest in the morning to have a look at the tigress, which was apparently very weak. The local staff had tracked the tigress to a nullah and were keeping tabs on it. Sources said a team of Mul (buffer) range led by RFO GR Naighamkar approached the tigress from one side, while five-member RRT team of Dr Khobragade approached from the other side of the nullah. There were no plans to take up rescue operation. “We had just gone to have a look at the tigress, which was laying down since last few days, and its injury. However, the tigress was startled by the large gathering around it and charged,” said an eyewitness forester. He claimed that the tigress first charged towards the team led by RFO Naighamkar. However, as there were over a dozen people, it took a U-turn and darted towards Dr Khobragade’s team, which had just five people. Dr Khobragade had little chance to respond to the sudden charge as the nullah bed was rocky and full of pebbles. He tried to flee but fell down and the tigress was upon him in an instant. The beast caught one of his feet in its jaw and chewed down on his toes through the shoe. As the doctor kicked the tigress with the other foot, the tigress batted it away with its paw, injuring that foot too. His team members then struck the tigress with sticks and stones to drive it away, the eyewitness said. Dr Khobragade, both feet mangled at the toes, was rushed to a private hospital in Chandrapur in the RRU vehicle. Doctors found that a toe on both the feet has a fracture. The thumb on right feet was fractured and had a bite mark, while third toe on the left leg had severe fracture and was dangling only from the skin, sources in the hospital claimed. CCF and filed director Jitendra Ramgaokar confirmed the incident and claimed Dr Khobragade has gone through surgery in the morning and is now out of danger. ‘It was a tug-of-war between me and tigress. I freed the doctor’Ajay MaratheIt was a brush with death for wildlife veterinarian Dr Ravikant Khobragade on Thursday morning when our six-member Rapid Rescue Team (RRT) consisting of Atul Mohurle, Bhojraj Dandekar, Anil Chaudhari, Pawan Kulmethe and Amol Korpe had been to Doni, a village in Mul buffer range on the outskirts of Zari tourism gate of of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). Adjoining Kolsa range of TATR, Doni is a beautiful forest with resident tigers. On Wednesday, we got a message from deputy conservator G Guruprasad that a young tigress was immobile for the last 17-18 hours due to some injury and we need to cross-check whether the animal needs to be rescued or not to treat the injury or if it will be healed naturally. As Dr Khobragade was on leave on Wednesday, we reached Doni around 7.30am on Thursday. A team led by MuL RFO GR Naigamkar was already monitoring the tigress that lay motionless near a nullah. As rescue needs requisite permission from the chief wildlife warden, we were there to just observe the state of injury and had no equipment. As the spot was hostile and the vehicle couldn’t reach there, we walked near the tigress to check the injury so that a decision could be taken by the top officials. We were around 5-6 feet from the tigress, which looked almost lifeless. Seeing us the big cat suddenly stood up and galloped ahead but seeing the two teams consisting of 25 foresters raising alarm, it retreated towards the six-member rescue team and attacked Dr Khobragade as he was on the forefront. Terrified by her aggressive poster, rescue team members scrambled for cover. But as the patch was rocky, Dr Khobragade fell down and in the melee, the tigress caught his feet. Even as our team members shouted and tried to shoo away the tigress with sticks, it held Dr Khobragade’s feet tightly. I rushed to his help and pulled his hands tightly to free him from the grip of the tigress. It was virtually a tug-of-war in which the tigress ended up getting the shoes of Dr Khobragade. As he was bleeding and unable to walk, I put him on my shoulders and shifted him to the vehicle before leaving the spot. The tigress was later licking the shoes. As a sharpshooter, I have always been with Dr Khobragade during all rescue operations and since 2013, we have rescued 23 tigers, 30 leopards, and 18 sloth bears engaged in conflict, but never such an incident occurred. The only message we got was “Don’t take tiger lightly”. (Ajay Marathe is a constable with Chandrapur police and is on deputation with TATR.

---||Chandigarh||Despite delays, cotton sowing area grows||Bathinda: Despite sowing of cotton stretching beyond the ideal sowing time in Punjab, it is close to reaching the target for 2021-22. The state agriculture department had the target of sowing cotton on 3.25 lakh hectares and till Wednesday, the crop had been sown over 3.01 lakh hectares, said data compiled by the agriculture department. Bathinda and Muktsar districts are close to the target while six other cotton sowing districts are not. Sowing of cotton is ideally done till May 15 as the crop sown after that date is considered prone to pest attack. The late start of sowing has been attributed to delayed harvest of wheat crop and unavailability of canal water for many days in the initial stages of sowing. Under crop diversification, cotton is seen as a viable alternative to the water-guzzling paddy. According to state agriculture department data, out of the 1.05 lakh hectares targeted, Bathinda district got sowing done on 1.04 lakh hectares till June 2. In Muktsar, sowing has been done on 39,676 hectares against the target of 40,000 hectares. The district fell short of 324 hectares while Bathinda district fell short of 1,000 hectares. Director, Punjab agriculture department Sukhdev Singh said, “sowing was disturbed in some areas, especially in Fazilka and Mansa districts, due to rain for a few days. The target is expected to be achieved before June 10.” In 2020-21, there was a major mismatch in cotton sowing data in Punjab as initially, the state government claimed that that the crop had been sown on nearly 5 lakh hectares but during girdawari at the end of the season, it was found that the crop had been sown on 2.51 lakh hectares, the state agriculture department said. This season, sowing was conducted on a passive note as by May 10, it had been sown on less than 20% of the targeted area at 63,220 hectares. According to cotton marketing watcher, cotton growers are expected to get good returns in the ongoing cotton season. Going by the low production, starting cotton prices are expected to open close to Rs 6,000 per quintal. In the previous season, they opened close to Rs 5,000 per quintal and gradually reached Rs 6,000 in February, 2021 when the cotton marketing season was in the last leg. MSP in the outgoing season was Rs 5,725 per quintal for 27.5-28.5 MM long staple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-delays-cotton-sowing-area-grows/articleshow/83217271.cms||Neel Kamal

Chief judicial magistrate at the Mirzapur rural court campus, V A Dhadhal, punished Bavanidas Bavaji from Bhayavadar, Rajkot district, and refused to grant him benefit of probation. Bavaji had thrown both his sandals at Justice K S Jhaveri on April 11, 2012, but he failed in his aim. When the judge questioned him about the reason behind his gesture, Bavaji said that his case was not being heard and he had thrown his sandals out of frustration. The Sola police booked him under sections 353 and 186 of the IPC for assault on government servant to deter him from discharge of his duty and for obstructing a public servant from discharging his duty. Bavaji filed a purshis in trial court, admitting his guilt and said that he was a tea vendor and his tea stall was removed by the municipality. He dragged the issue to court but got a long-drawn legal battle. He remained unemployed for long. Four years later in 2016, he withdrew his purshis. But the court considered the purshis as his admission and held him guilty under section 353 of IPC. The court said that Bavaji’s intention was not to stop Justice Jhaveri from performing his duty, but since his matter was not heard, he had a grievance and committed the offence. The court opined that section 186 of IPC would not apply in this case. Besides, the bar of section 195 of CrPC restrains court from taking cognizance. Bavaji sought leniency in punishment and requested for benefit of probation, but the court refused. It said, “It is true that many cases are pending in courts and they are not disposed within time limit, but for this, throwing shoes to a person having prestigious position like a high court judge is deplorable. If benefit of probation is granted in this case, it will set a precedence that if your case is not heard, you can use criminal force on judge and still get away with benefit of probation.” On April 11, 2012, a few hours before Bavaji committed the offence, another litigant from Kalol, Ramaji Thakor, had thrown his slipper at the judge, but it fell a few feet away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-jailed-for-hurling-sandals-at-hc-judge/articleshow/83214998.cms||---

---||Patna||HC lifts stay on hiring of 1.25 lakh schoolteachers in Bihar||PATNA: Decks have been cleared for the recruitment of 1.25 lakh teachers at primary and secondary levels in government schools across the state with the Patna high court on Thursday vacating the stay on preparation of final merit list for their appointment. The stay was vacated after the state government told the high court that it has rectified all errors and allowed 4% reservation to persons with disabilities, including blind people, in the recruitment process besides giving 15-day time to such candidates to submit fresh application subject to the condition that they had not applied earlier. The recruitment process had come to a halt as the high court had stayed preparation of merit list on July 24 last year on the ground that persons with disabilities were not given reservation as per law. While vacating the stay on the recruitment process, a Patna high court division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar also disposed of the writ petition filed by the National Federation of the Blind. The federation had moved the high court in February last year challenging the recruitment process on the ground that the state government had not given 4% reservation to the persons with disabilities in the recruitment process as per Section 34 of The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The federation had urged the high court that the state government be directed to follow the reservation rules for the disabled persons, including the blind, who are eligible for 1% reservation from the 4% reserved seats out of the entire vacant posts. Advocate general Lalit Kishore, who appeared for the state government along with additional advocate general P K Verma and counsel Shilpa Singh, submitted that the government has rectified the procedure to give 4% “horizontal reservation” to the persons with disabilities as per law. Supreme Court senior counsel S K Rungata, who had appeared for the federation along with lawyer Sugandha Prasad, had earlier disputed the way the state government had reserved seats for disabled candidates as sub-category under a category. On Thursday, the AG apprised the high court that the state government has agreed on giving 15-day time to such candidates for submitting application subject to the condition that they had not applied earlier. He also apprised the court that such candidates have to fulfil the eligibility criteria defined earlier when the last date of submitting applications was November 23, 2019. The AG said the state government would allow such candidates to submit fresh applications, but only against the seats reserved for them. The court also accepted the AG’s request that any further litigation arising from the recruitment process be taken up only by the division bench headed by Chief Justice. On Thursday, the high court also disposed of another writ petition of the federation in which it had urged the court to direct the state government to notify the seats for people with disabilities and make their appointment against the recruitments which had been already completed in the past. Kishore and Verma assured the bench that the state government is working on the matter issue and it needs at least four-month time to calculate all seats for the persons with disabilities and notify them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stay-lifted-on-recruitment-of-1-25l-schoolteachers-in-bihar/articleshow/83213095.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Enforcement Directorate arrests RJD MP in fertiliser scam||PATNA: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday arrested RJD’s Rajya Sabha MP Amrendra Dhari Singh from his upscale Defence Colony residence in New Delhi in connection with alleged irregularities in import of fertilisers by Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO). Singh has been booked under relevant sections of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The scam pertains to the period when Singh was the managing director of Jyoti Trading Corporation. The case lodged by the CBI last month pertains to an alleged fertiliser scam linked to IFFCO and India Potash Limited. Sources said that crores of rupees were siphoned off as commission on subsidy given to the farmers on fertilisers between 2007 and 2014. The CBI had begun investigation into the case based on complaints lodged by BJP’s Godda MP Nishikant Dubey and one Satish Tripathi of Bareilly with the Union ministry of fertiliser and chemicals recently. The accused in the case have been charged with receiving illegal commission worth over Rs 685 crore reportedly outside India. The probe agency suspects involvement of Augusta Westland case accused and chartered accountant Rajiv Saxena, Jyoti Trading Corporation and Rare Earth Group owner Pankaj Jain, his brother Sanjay Jain and RJD MP A D Singh in the scam. The RJD has described Singh’s arrest as a political conspiracy hatched by the BJP and JD(U). “He comes from a businessman’s family and notices are served on the members of trading community by IT and other agencies. Nothing is unusual in it,” former RJD MLA and party’s spokesperson Shaktisingh Yadav said. The RJD spokesperson said the way Singh has been framed in a PMLA case posed a serious threat to the democratic set up in the country. “Everything was fine till he was not part of the RJD, but things suddenly changed after he joined the party,” Yadav said. JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar said the RJD MP’s arrest has added a new chapter in the party’s “politics of corruption”. He said a probe should be conducted to find out whether money changed hands in the nomination of Singh to Rajya Sabha. He urged the probe agency to expand its jurisdiction of investigation and find out whether money earned from the fertilizer scam was used in his Rajya Sabha nomination as RJD has a history of giving Upper House berths to people who have accumulated property through disproportionate sources of income. According to affidavit filed by Singh, he has movable property worth Rs 188.57 crore and immovable assets worth over Rs 49.6 crore. He owns land, flats and offices in Delhi, Haryana, Rajsthan and Maharashtra. His IT return for 2019-20 fiscal was over Rs 24 crore. A native of Ekma village under Dulhinbazar block in Patna district, Singh was nominated to the Upper House last year to the utter surprise of senior leaders of RJD. Apart from his fertiliser and chemical businesses, Singh has also made huge investments in real estate sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ed-arrests-rjd-mp-in-fertiliser-scam/articleshow/83213045.cms||Ramashankar

The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), on Thursday, released guidelines for the preparation of Class10 results for regular students. It stated that Class10 results will be prepared out of 100 marks for each subject. This includes 40% weightage of academic performance in last year’s Class 9 exams, and 40% marks from Class 10 exams this year. The remaining 20% weightage will be as per internal evaluation by schools for Class 10 performance. None of the students will be failed. As per the guidelines, if a student fails to achieve passing marks, s/he will still be promoted to the next class. The Class 10 marksheets are likely to be handed out to students in the month of July, said sources. “The guidelines recommend evaluation of Class 10 students in two parts. The first part consists of internal evaluation of 20 marks (out of 100) for every subject,” said sources in GSHSEB. In the second part, the marks scored by students in Class 10 and Class 9 exams will be taken into account, he added. The performance of students in the first and second unit tests for Class 9 last year will have 20% weightage each. Schools had conducted internal exams in an offline and online format from March 19 to March 27. The marks scored by the students in this exam will have a maximum weightage of 30% in each subject. Another 10% weightage will be from the unit tests. The mark sheets are to be prepared for Class 10 regular students as per these guidelines, the state education board announced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-10-marksheets-likely-to-be-out-in-july/articleshow/83215030.cms||---

The court of additional sessions judge P S Kala also fined the convict Ranjit alias Anshukumar Gurjar Rs 8,000 and ordered a compensation of Rs 7 lakh for the 17-year-old rape survivor. “There were several evidences against the convict which were upheld by the court and the girl too identified him during the trial. The court also took into consideration that the convict has a criminal behaviour,” said additional public prosecutor Kishore Revalia. He added that in the past too Gurjar was booked for petty crimes. According to the details of the case, Gurjar had abducted the girl under the pretext of taking her back to her uncle’s house. Gurjar told the girl that her sister-in-law was calling her and he was asked to bring the girl back. But instead of taking her back to her uncle’s home, Gurjar took the girl to Amroli-Sayan Road where he raped her. After Gurjar dropped her back at her maternal uncle’s home, the girl did not say anything as she had been threatened with dire consequences by the convict. However, a couple of days later when she became ill, she told her maternal uncle about the crime. The girl’s parents, who hail from Uttar Pradesh, lodged a complaint of rape, abduction and violation of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at Amroli police station following which Gurjar was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/22-yr-old-convicted-for-minors-rape/articleshow/83213448.cms||---

They are demanding online exams instead. Seven law students approached the HC demanding cancellation of a notification issued by GU on May 28, by which it is to conduct penpaper exams from June 10 for Semesters 2 and 10, and from June 24 for Semesters 4, 6 and 8. They have claimed that GU has fixed the exams without complying with directions from the Bar Council of India (BCI). The petitioners contended that holding physical exams is like putting students at risk during this Covid-19 pandemic, particularly when a surge in cases was witnessed recently and there are many Covid cases being reported at present as well. The students urged the HC to quash GU’s examination notification declaring it arbitrary, impractical and unreasonable, and to direct GU to take the exams virtually or to promote and evaluate students on the basis of their previous-year performances or internal submissions as prescribed by the BCI in May last year following the lockdown. They have also sought a delay in exams until all students are vaccinated. The HC sought a reply on this issue on Monday. Meanwhile, a university senate member and advocate, Dipen Dave, requested the GU vice-chancellor to postpone the exams and reconsider the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-challenge-to-gus-in-person-law-exams/articleshow/83215052.cms||---

The police said victim Gopal Kishan Bansal was posted as a doctor at a government hospital in Patran, Patiala.  “He lived with his family at the Sector 16 house. He had recovered from Covid-19 about a month ago. He was sitting on a bed near the window of his room when he fell on the ground around 11.30am.

On receiving the information, Sector 17 police and a CFSL team reached the spot and inspected it. Police said the doctor fell on garden soil and not cemented floor. “If someone wants to commit suicide, he will jump on cemented floor. The exact cause of death will be known after receiving the autopsy report. No suicide note was recovered from the spot,” the cop added.

---||Chandigarh||To challan or not? Training for UT cops to dispel doubts||Chandigarh: There are some traffic violations that leave even cops confused whether to issue a challan or not. For instance, what to do if a driver is wearing earphones or Bluetooth ear device. Or, what if he is just holding a phone in his hand while driving? What if a motorist is using a mobile phone at a red light while waiting for a green signal? Traffic cops are often seen arguing with vehicle owners over such “violations” as there is little or no clarity about rules. Now, the traffic police department has started a training programme for their field staff to update them about the rules and new amendments in the MV Act. The police conduct two-hour classes twice a week in small batches. Two such programmes have already been conducted at traffic lines in Sector 29.While talking to the TOI, Palak Goel, UT DSP (administration), traffic, said to clear the challaning rules, the department has started a training programme for the field staff as the cops were facing problems in dealing with certain violations.“People also complained of being challaned for no offence. Now, all the field cops will be imparted training to dispel all doubts,” the DSP added.Last year, traffic cops caught a car driver using a mobile phone in Sector 19 market on Diwali. Cops were adamant on issuing a challan, but the car driver said he was just holding the device in his hand. Traffic police team called more cops to the spot and issued him a challan slip. In another incident in November 2019, a car driver dragged a traffic cop over his vehicle’s bonnet from Industrial Area Phase-1 light-point till the slip road of Transport Chowk light-point and then fled. The cop had noticed him talking on the phone at a red light and the driver kept saying his car was not moving when he was talking. Another example of cops’ confusion happened in February 2019, when they issued a challan slip to an e-biker in Sector 7 under various offences and later it was cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/to-challan-or-not-training-for-ut-cops-to-dispel-doubts/articleshow/83215044.cms||Pawan Tiwari

---||Hyderabad||Lockdown cheer: Telangana in ‘high spirits’ in May||HYDERABAD: Milk and mutton sales might have taken a hit, but whiskey bottles continued to fly off the shelves of Telangana’s liquor stores all through May this year, the 20-day lockdown notwithstanding. A quick look at the month’s sales figures show that despite limited access — stores were open only during the odd 6 am to 10 am period — guzzlers remained in high spirits, with the sector ringing in revenues worth Rs 2,129 crore during this period. This is only 6% lower than Telangana’s May 2020 sales of Rs 2,270 crore, when liquor shops reopened after 44 days of lockdown. Interestingly, May 2021’s sale volume was even higher than the last Dasara season — usually a peak period for alcohol business — when stocks worth Rs 2,115 crore was lifted from depots across Telangana. But while May proved to be heady for hard liquor, beer sales plummeted significantly. From 33.23 lakh beer cases sold during May 2020, last month’s sales slipped to 20.19 lakh. In comparison, liquor sales shot to 27.12 lakh cases in May 2021 from 26.69 lakh cases in May 2020. In fact, for a week post the lockdown on May 12, even the daily sales numbers was at least 44% higher than most days of May 2020, official records show. “Sales improved during partial lockdown because people were worried about Telangana imposing either a complete lockdown or weekend lockdown, like in some other states. So, there was some amount of hoarding,” said excise minister,V Srinivas Goud. And while some officials attributed the drop in beer sales to price rise — there was a flat Rs 30 hike introduced last year — and shop timings, the minister said that it was also because of pubs and restaurants being shut. “Maximum consumption of beer is recorded from these places. Once they reopen, beer sales will pick up again,” he added. The encouraging sale of liquor, meanwhile, has failed to lift the spirits of retailers. “This is only temporary and is unlikely to help our business,” said a dealer adding, “The cost of liquor has shot up from 5% to 20% on many brands. In May, people bought only to replenish stocks. It isn’t a consistent trend.” Another dealer claimed that most of May’s business in Telangana was registered during the first 11 days, when there wasn’t any restriction on store timings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-cheer-t-in-high-spirits-in-may/articleshow/83218907.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Delhi||More hurdles for group in Delhi on their way to promised land||NEW DELHI: Days after 40 Bnei Menashe Jews from Manipur — all headed to Israel — tested positive for Covid-19 and were admitted to Guru Tegh Bahadur Covid Care Centre in Delhi, 40 more members from the same group of around 125 individuals also tested positive and were admitted to the same facility on Thursday. The centre is run by Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC). This took the total number of cases from the same group of travellers to 80, with officials at the Covid centre stating that the remaining members of the group, who were staying at a hotel in Karol Bagh, have also been ordered to get tested. Bhupinder Singh Bhullar, in-charge of the Covid care centre and part of DSGMC, said 40 more members arrived on Thursday evening, after Delhi government informed them that they too had tested positive. Two members, who tested negative, also came with the group, but were refused admission to the centre. “The group has around 125 members and now 80 of them have come to us. On orders of the SDM, the remaining members staying at a hotel in Karol Bagh will also be tested,” said Bhullar, adding the new group also consisted of infants and children. “We turned away two women who tested negative, but their children are positive. Since we cannot risk them turning positive, they were asked to go back and isolate themselves,” Bhullar said. He said the delay in the second group testing positive was largely due to them getting tested much later than the first group, since they had different flight timings. “There were 20-22 families and while some were to fly on May 30, others had a later flight and got their results later. They were all staying in a single hotel in Karol Bagh,” he added. Over the last 15 years, members from the Bnei Menashe Jewish community – said to be descendants of the Menashi tribe in Israel — have slowly been emigrating to Israel. There are said to be nearly 10,000 members of the Jewish community in India’s northeast states. Officials said the group was travelling to Israel in order to settle down there and acquire citizenship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-hurdles-for-group-on-their-way-to-promised-land/articleshow/83215120.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Ahmedabad||Silver imports surged 618% in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Fuelled by industrial demand riding on slight reduction in prices, silver demand surged by 618% in May this year. Silver imports in Gujarat stood at 4.74 metric tonnes (MT) according to data provided by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, which even though much lower than earlier years, was at an 11-month high. Against this, silver imports in April stood at 0.66 MT. Analysts said that as silver prices reduced slightly to Rs 70,800 per kg when markets resumed operations in the end of May after a three-week shutdown imposed to curb Covid-19 spread, stockists bought silver to meet routine requirements. Analysts predict that prices are bound to go up in the days to come. “Due to low prices and pent-up demand over past 11 months, silver imports surged significantly. But the volume of imports is very low. On an average, the annual consumption used to be around 100-150MT. Currently, a few refineries have imported silver for routine demand,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). Silver imports were nil in May last year, the data further suggests. Precious metal imports saw a steep decline in the pandemic year. According to data by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, silver demand plunged 66.2% in 2020-21 at 30.35MT against 90.39MT in 2019-20. According to estimates by bullion traders and analysts, at least 25% of the total imports of silver accounts for industrial usage whereas the rest is diverted towards retail demand in the form of jewellery, artefacts, coins and bars. “Currently, the demand for jewellery and artefacts has taken a big hit. As prices stabilized slightly, somel investors purchased silver anticipating good returns in the days to come. Moreover, a lot of pent-up demand has surfaced from jewellers and stockists as well. Both these factors are likely to propel growth of silver imports,” said Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/silver-imports-surged-618/articleshow/83217309.cms||Niyati Parikh

While deaths continued to be added in two instalments -- daily (307) and those that are a week old (336) -- state officials said the toll still seems to be dropping in comparison to a fortnight back. In Mumbai, test positivity rate dropped to 3.9% on Thursday with 985 cases (less than 1,000 for four consecutive days) and 27 deaths. Total caseload of the state rose to 57.9 lakh and fatalities touched 97,394 on Thursday. Mumbai’s largest slum cluster, Dharavi, on Thursday reported only one case, the lowest since the second wave began in February 2021. Dharavi has a total of 6,829 cases of which 19 are active cases and 6,451 have been discharged. Dharavi reported its first case on April 1, 2020. The area had reported zero positive cases for the first time ever since the pandemic on December 25, 2020. While the second wave is declining in Mumbai and Maharashtra, the drop is not as swift as in Delhi which has less than 500 cases now from over 25,000 until a month back. At the state level, districts like Satara and Kolhapur continue to add more cases than Mumbai. Kolhapur has more active cases than Mumbai. Second waves of pandemics traditionally rise and decline fast, but Maharashtra and Mumbai seem to be an exception. “Both Mumbai and Maharashtra have a ‘thick tail' that was seen in the first wave and now as well,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the task force on Covid. It is possibly a function of overcrowding and daily influx, he added. Another task force member, Dr Rahul Pandit, said he is worried about complacency. “The daily cases are low. Positivity rate is low. The demand for hospital bed is low. This is a perfect recipe for people to get complacent and stop following Covid-appropriate behavior,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lt-1k-cases-4th-day-in-row-maharashtra-steady-below-16k/articleshow/83217294.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Delhi||1,044 black fungus cases in Delhi, 89 deaths so far||NEW DELHI: Delhi has recorded 1,044 cases of mucormycosis or black fungus till date. Of them, 92 people have recovered fully and 89 others lost their lives, health minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday. Nearly 860 patients who are suffering from the deadly infection are undergoing treatment at various public and private hospitals in the capital, the health minister added. Mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection, which affects immunocompromised patients primarily. While earlier, cases of such infection were rare, they increased sharply over the last few days and affected mostly those admitted to hospitals for Covid-19 treatment. Multiple hypotheses have been suggested for the sudden rise of the infection, from excessive use of steroids to the use of industrial oxygen and supplements like zinc but there is no conclusive answer on the possible cause yet. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and public health expert told TOI that mucormycosis causes blackish discolouration on the base of the nose and also on the palate. When it is grown on the culture media in between the fungal growth there are black dots, Dr Lahariya added. “It is wrong to refer to the fungal infection as black fungus. It can be of any colour,” he said. Mucormycosis presents mostly as a sinus infection that is accompanied by nasal congestion, nasal discharge and sinus pain. A fever and headache can also occur. According to National Organisation of Rare Disorders (NORD), sometimes, there is discoloration of the skin near the sinuses or the eye socket due to lack of oxygen. “If unrecognised and untreated, significant tissue death (necrosis) can occur and the infection can significantly damage facial structures. It can also affect the brain,” says NORD. The only available treatment for mucormycosis is antifungal medication and symptom management. Despite that, doctors say, 50% people suffering from the infection succumb to it. “Early clinical suspicion on symptoms such as nose obstruction, swelling in the eye or cheeks, and black dry crusts in the nose should immediately prompt the conduct of a biopsy in the OPD and start of the antifungal therapy as early as possible,” doctors say. “Also, we must ensure better supply of anti-fungal medicines. Currently, there is a shortage of injections such as Liposomal Amphotericin B,” one of the doctors added. Lok Nayak Hospital has more than 80 patients undergoing treatment for mucormycosis. Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital has around 100 such patients. On Tuesday, the Delhi government had issued an order for distribution of 1,230 Amphotericin B injections among the hospitals treating mucormycosis patients in the capital.

It is pertinent to note that this is the highest inflation expectations print ever recorded in the BIES history, breaching the 5.0 % mark,’ mentioned the survey results. The survey results showed 27% of the respondents each mentioning the current cost per unit ‘up significantly’ and ‘up very significantly’ indicating 6% to over 10% increase. On the other hand, more than half the respondents (55%) indicated much less than normal sales and much less than normal profit margins. The normal signifies average of three years’ score.

This just goes against the BMC’s motive to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is maintained. At least a BMC encroachment van should be parked to avoid such instances,” said Viren Shah, president of FRTWA. “The last two days, non-essential shops have hardly see any customers come before 2pm,” said Shah.

---||Goa||Court grants Rs 25L compensation to wife in divorce case||Panajj: In a 17-year-old case, a local court at Mapusa has directed a husband to pay his spouse Rs 25 lakh as permanent maintenance within three months and dissolved their marriage. The marriage had lasted around five months when the wife was asked to leave the matrimonial house. “The conduct of the petitioner (husband) of discarding the respondent (wife) at the very initial stage and not providing her any medical help for curing the cyst indicates high-handed, indifferent and irresponsible behaviour of the petitioner. In the opinion of this court, the respondent has to be provided permanent maintenance,” the court held. The evidence revealed that the husband “has not acted as a prudent man”, stated Judge Narayan S Amonkar, senior civil judge, Mapusa. The court noted that Article 20(3) of Law of Marriages says that a marriage can be annulled only if there exists irremediable and previous physical defect, and added that the petitioner husband in this case failed to prove that the cyst of the respondent was incurable. “He has not understood the respondent’s feelings and has not cared for her well-being. He has not reposed any trust in respondent and made no efforts to provide medical treatment to her for curing of cyst and facilitating her to conceive. The petitioner took the extreme view that the respondent will not conceive,” the court held. It added that the husband caused “immense mental agony” to his wife which affected her “physically, emotionally, financially and socially”. The court added that he has “tarnished her image in society”. “Her prospect of remarriage is bleak and her life is ruined. She is contesting this litigation for the last over 17 years. The petitioner has not behaved rationally,” the court held. The husband had contended that she didn’t disclose to him at the time of marriage that she had a cyst and stated that he wouldn’t have consented to the marriage. “There is no report of the medical expert produced on record stating that on account of the cyst respondent would have not conceived. The medical report produced before this court does not indicate that the cyst was of such a magnitude that it could have not been cured and that respondent could have not conceived at all,” the court held, adding that the husband didn’t produce any of his medical reports to indicate that he was perfect and had no defect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/court-grants-rs-25l-compensation-to-wife-in-divorce-case/articleshow/83215189.cms||---

On Thursday, justice J Nisha Banu without going into the merits of the case had directed the authorities to pass appropriate orders in accordance with law by considering the representation submitted by the petitioner. The court passed the order while hearing the petition filed by Berlin Jose. In his petition, Jose stated that the NGO was running a home for HIV-affected children, schools, farms, hospice and outreach clinics. He claimed that he and his employee were booked under Pocso Act in a false case on charges of sexually harassing a girl child at the home in 2019. He stated that he was arrested and was also detained under the Goondas Act. Following his arrest, the district administration had sealed two buildings - boys and girls home run by him without following proper procedure.

The accused were arrested in January this year and booked under attempt to murder charge. Vijay Dulgaj (28), Ravindra Dulgaj (26) and Rahul Bidlan (23) submitted bail pleas after their earlier plea was rejected. Rejecting their pleas, the court said, “The specific role has been played by them for the commission of the offence. There is sufficient evidence against them and coaccused. Therefore, mere filing of chargesheet is not a justifiable ground to release them on the bail...” The accused denied the allegations and claimed they were being falsely implicated in the case. The victims alleged that on January 6, at about 8am, the accused attacked them with a horse whip, and even when they pleaded saying they did not steal the phone, the accused continued to attack them. The accusedthen stripped and paraded them before letting them go home in only their underwear. The victims told cops that the accused threatened to kill them if they disclosed about the alleged incident to anyone and left them in the same condition. While returning home, an unknown person gave them some clothes. One of the victims said his father suggested they complain to the police after which they filed an FIR at Kandivli police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-who-tied-stripped-and-tonsured-2-for-theft-denied-bail/articleshow/83218945.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Madurai||NGOs concerned over National Human Rights Commission appointments||MADURAI: The All India Network of NGOs and Individuals working with the national and state human rights organisations has expressed shock and grave concern on the procedures and methods adopted for the recent appointments in the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). In a statement, national working secretary of the organisation, Henry Tiphagne said that AiNNI strongly believes that the NHRC appointment committee has completely disregarded the recommendations of the sub-committee on accreditation (SCA) of the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), NHRC’s own submissions before the SCA in 2017, amendments to the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA) in 2019 and the appeals made by civil society. AiNNI in collaboration with several organisations had written to the President of India on May 11, urging that the appointments to the NHRC are made in a transparent manner at the earliest. However, government preferences seem to have dominated all other suggestions and recommendations. Justice Arun Mishra’s admiration for the current government is self-proclaimed and his conduct and judgements as a Supreme Court judge in question, being selected over a galaxy of eligible candidates, cast doubts whether the selection criteria, if any, met the required human rights standards, Tiphagne said. The appointment of the former director of the intelligence bureau as a NHRC member, comes as a shock. It is unprecedented that a former head of the IB will be a commissioner of the apex human rights institution. If human rights experience, record and contribution of the candidates were the criteria, these appointments require serious re-thinking, the statement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ngos-concerned-over-nhrc-appointments/articleshow/83215186.cms||---

The appellant Thirumurugan who had cleared the written exam was called for participating in a physical efficiency test on October 14, 2020. Though he had cleared the rope climbing, he ended up making a foul in all three attempts of long jump as he sustained injuries in his right leg two days before the physical efficiency test. Due to this, a disqualification slip was handed over to him. The appellant had filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench seeking to re-conduct the physical efficiency test for him. However, the single judge had dismissed the petition. Challenging the order, the appellant had filed this present appeal before the HC Madurai bench. The counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the appellant who is a BE graduate had the aspiration to get into uniformed service. He submitted that the appellant had cleared all the tests except for the long jump due to the injuries. The appellant also informed the authorities about his injury during the test and had also produced the medical certificates along with his representation. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi sought the response from the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/order-against-reconduct-of-physical-efficiency-test-challenged/articleshow/83215114.cms||---

There were 30 participants — men and women wearing bright helmets and crested cycling gear, of all ages right from their 20s through 60s — gathered at the venue in early morning to commemorate the day. The group identified themselves as the ‘Road Soldiers’ with most of them being members of Rajpath Club. They had donned their custom jerseys — red and white in colour. The event was organized by Jasjeet Singh Bhatia, a 59-yearold industrialist, who had come up with the idea of forming a bicycle club for enthusiasts. He said, “Today, we have met to spread health awareness on the benefits of cycling. I like to cycle regularly to keep myself fit and healthy. It has helped us to form a unique bond and bring people together”. Rajeev Shah, a 55-year old chartered accountant said, “Cycling has made us forget our age. We feel refreshed and young by doing this activity”. The group goes on trips of 30km on alternate weekdays and 60km on Saturdays. When the winter season begins, they increase their cycling stretches to 200km and 1,200km. Dr Manish Raval, an eye specialist said, “For us, cycling is not a sport, it’s a lifestyle. In these testing times, cycling has helped us boost our immunity and proved to be an essential activity”. Cyclists described their experience as liberating as they could go outside to meet their friends and go on trips together. They said that this day brings them positivity and reminds and helps them to forget the depression caused by constantly staying inside their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/these-cycling-enthusiasts-pedal-their-way-to-fitness/articleshow/83215269.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Fake Covid medicine sites in Hyderabad: Conmen dupe dozens||HYDERABAD: If you want a few vials of Amphotericin B injection or oxygen concentrator for your near ones, think twice before buying them from unverified e-commerce sites, Hyderabad police warned on Thursday after uncovering a nationwide racket of fraudsters duping unsuspecting buyers. In the past month, people looking for Covid-19-related medicines and medical equipment lost over Rs 50 lakh to fraudsters operating from Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and other north Indian cities. So far 21 cases have been registered in the city and investigations are underway to unravel the racket. In one case, fraudsters took Rs 13 lakh as an advance payment for supplying oxygen concentrators to businessman Rambabu of Dilsukhnagar in May. Rachakonda ACP S Harinath said the victim searched for oxygen concentrators on an e-commerce website with an intention to cash in on the demand for oxygen concentrators. “The fraudster asked for Rs 13 lakh as an advance to supply 25 to 30 oxygen concentrators. To convince the victim that the machines are ready to be shipped, the accused sent various bills and delivery receipts through WhatsApp and after the money was transferred, he stopped responding to the victim,” the ACP said. Cheats have also duped people who were desperately looking for medicine to treat black fungus. On May 25, a victim from Gachibowli lodged a complaint with Cyberabad police saying he wanted to buy injections to treat black fungus from a popular medical store, but landed up in a fraudster’s hands. “A person assured me that the medicine will be delivered through courier upon receiving the advance payment. The fraudster demanded Rs 8.32 lakh for 60 vials of the injection and once the payment was made, there was no response from the accused,” the victim told Cyberabad police. Another businessman, who runs a well-known garments store in Jubilee hills was duped of Rs 1.1 lakh by fraudsters posing as some medical facility operators, providing paid vaccination at business establishments. “They offered vaccination for all workers for Rs 1.1 lakh. The victim agreed and transferred Rs 1.1 lakh to the bank account of the accused. As the fraudsters stopped responding to the calls after the money transfer, he lodged a complaint with us,” Hyderabad cybercrime ACP KVM Prasad said. Police identified that the fraudster operated from Chennai. Another gang operating from Bangalore duped private employee Nikhil Reddy of SR Nagar and businessman Awasti R of Secunderabad of Rs 4.5 lakh and Rs 1.29 lakh respectively by promising to supply Amphotericin B and Posaconazole medicines to treat black fungus. “A gang operating from North India, siphoned off Rs 2.96 lakh from the bank account of businessman Vasant Rao Patil of Ghansi bazaar by offering to conduct RT-PCR tests for all the family members at home. The fraudsters sent UPI link asking the victim to click on it for payment of a small amount and siphoned off his money through multiple transactions,” the ACP said. Fraudsters also duped five businessmen in the city of Rs 26 lakh with a fake promise to supply oxygen concentrators, cheated relatives of two patients taking Rs 1 lakh each from them promising to deliver Tocilizumab injection and conned two businessmen by promising to deliver surgical gloves and masks for Rs 4 lakh and Rs 1.1 lakh each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fake-covid-med-sites-conmen-dupe-dozens/articleshow/83218972.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Pynumootil was speaking at the 2 Signals Training Centre (2STC), Bambolim after reviewing the passing out parade of 123 recruits. 2STC is the largest training centre of the Corps of Signals in the country. The Indian Army started the 2 Signal Centre at Panaji on December 9, 1962, after Goa’s Liberation and to fill the void created by the transfer of the signal training centre at Bengaluru to Pakistan during Partition. “The role played by signals and communication is vital for all operations undertaken by any of the three defence services,” said Pynumootil. The parade marked the culmination of a 19-week basic military training given to the recruits, who will now proceed for technical training. This is the first time a naval officer has reviewed the passing out parade in the sixty-year history of the training establishment in Goa. “Even after 37 yrs of training, though the colour of our uniforms differ, the outlook...Though the colour of our uniforms differ, the outlook, courage and allegiance to the country remain the same,” said Pynumootil, as he stressed on the joint ethos of the Armed Forces. FOGA was making a reference to Commandant of 2STC Brigadier Sanjay Rawal, who was his course mate 37 years ago at the National Defence Academy’s Hunter Squadron.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Special prosecutor to handle Aisha suicide case||AHMEDABAD: Taking the Aisha suicide case seriously, the state government has appointed a special prosecutor to prosecute her husband Arif Khan Gafurji who is facing charges of abetment to suicide and domestic violence. The state legal department on Tuesday appointed advocate Varshakiran Rao as special prosecutor in this case. She will be prosecuting Gafurji in the city sessions court. In February, 23-year-old Aisha Makrani jumped into the Sabarmati after making a small video addressing her husband and making an emotional statement about why she was choosing to end her life. The incident had countrywide ramifications with the Muslim community leaders appealing to shun the practice of dowry and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board introducing a prohibitory clause in its Nikahnama format. Before this, the sessions court has twice rejected Gafurji’s bail applications by rejecting his claims of being innocent. The court had mentioned that the transcript of Aisha and her husband’s telephonic conversation revealed that his accusations about the paternity of the foetus that the woman was carrying led her to leave her matrimonial home. The court termed it a very serious issue. After Aisha’s suicide, her husband was arrested from Pali town in Rajasthan on March 1. He is from Jhalore and was on the run after hearing about his wife’s suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/special-prosecutor-to-handle-aisha-suicide-case/articleshow/83217330.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Now, society to run 35 newly opened govt colleges||JAIPUR: The state government has found out a way to operate 35 newly opened colleges in the state which were announced in the last budget session. According to the recommendations made by the state finance department, these colleges will be run by a society. These colleges have been criticised for not getting any budget for new recruitments. To get away with this, the finance department has decided to form a society that will be solely responsible in running these colleges, including conducting recruitments and managing the finances. RAJ-MES is another society which is already functioning for eight medical colleges in the state. College education commissioner Sandesh Nayak while talking to TOI explained, “Just like RAJ-MES, the finance department has asked us to form a society for the newly opened colleges that will fasten up the process of recruitment as well. This society will help focus on these colleges and problem of transfer to different parts of the state will be solved as candidates selected by the society will stay within it. Its process will start soon.” The order of the finance department mentions that until the process of formation of society completes, the vacancy for teachers will be filled by the guest faculty under the program ‘Vidhya Sambal Model’. Reacting to the formation of society, Rajasthan University and College Teachers Association (R), general secretary Sushil Kumar Bissu claimed it to be another flop scheme of the government. Bissu explained, “Colleges under RAJ-MES, charges Rs 7.5 lakh per year to per student which turns into crore of rupees every year. Hence, the society is able to run itself without any outside help which is the motive of forming it. But in government colleges, fees are barely Rs 1,000 which is not affordable to the poor students. How will the society function?” He said that if the government increases the fees of the colleges, the purpose of providing education to every student in the remote corners of Rajasthan will be lost. There are many students who are provided with scholarship to deposit Rs 1,000 for their fees now. If the fees are increased, they will find it even more difficult. The result of this society will be seen in the future, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-society-to-run-35-newly-opened-govt-colleges/articleshow/83217313.cms||---

The drive was held at Anuvrat Bhawan on Deen Dayal Upadhaya Marg, in coordination with an NGO and Aaakash Healthcare Hospital and was inaugurated by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. At the launch ceremony, Sisodia told people to avoid self-medication for Covid-19. “We have seen many unverified opinions about treating Covid on social media platforms. Self-medication can prove fatal in case you have a critical illness,” he said, stating one should be in touch with a medical expert under whose prescription and care critical medicines like steroids should be taken. CA Avinash Gupta, chairman NIRC-ICAI, emphasised on the importance of vaccination and said one should ensure both doses are of the same vaccine and taken within the stipulated time-gap. “It is important here to understand that vaccination will take a minimum of two weeks after the second dose to offer proper immunity and till then, one has to adhere to all the precautionary protocols announced by the government,” Gupta said.NIRC-ICAI said that over 2,000 CAs, their family members and CA students had been vaccinated so farwith the organisation actively assisting during the pandemic to provide hospital beds, oxygen and medicines to their members.

Around 332 hoopers as well as thousands of workers didn’t turn up for work. Times ViewThe city's sanitation issues have been many and chronic. But the strike by sanitation company, a largely avoidable one, could not have come at a worst time, when the country and the state are battling a pandemic. For hapless citizens, struggling with myriad problems created by the lockdown and the disease, the strike is posing another health hazard as garbage piles up on street corners. As it is, door-to-door garbage collection has not been regular in most of the residential areas. The Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Greater has to address the issues raised by workers and firms that employ them immediately, and ensure sanitation work goes on in a professional manner.Residents across the city have been complaining regarding the irregularity in the arrival of garbage collecting vehicles for a long time. But with a possibility that strike will continue residents were worried. Pinky Taneja, a resident of Raja Park, said that vehicles didn’t arrive on Thursday. So, she kept the garbage at home, but hoped the strike will be called off soon. Similarly, residents of Vidhyadhar Nagar zone said that vehicles usually come till main road and leave. “The sanitation condition of the city has taken a toll. Vehicles come every alternate day in our area and with this strike situation will become more serious. Amidst pandemic, sanitation should be a priority of the government,” said Vikas Purohit, resident of Krishna Colony of Vidhyadhar Nagar zone. The tussle has been going on between the corporation and company for many years. JMC-Greater has alleged that the bills submitted are not proper and despite giving various notices for lethargic sanitation work, vehicles are not reaching everywhere. Sandeep Chaudhary, member of BVG, said, “We have not received any payment since January. How are we supposed to run our households? None of the corporation officials called us up to end the strike. Around Rs 290 crore is due on the corporation since last one and a half year. We want our account to be cleared or else this strike will go on.” Replying to strike issue, JMC-Greater mayor Somya Gurjar, who has threatened the company in the past for not properly working, said, “Even after giving 500 notices in recent times by the corporation, the company without work verification presented the bills for interim payment. Due to this process being against the law and not in the interest of the corporation, it has been directed to complete the final bill without delay.” Officials in the corporation however said that they are trying to cajole the workers to break the strike but unless workers agree, residents of the city have to face problems amid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/strike-by-firm-hits-doorstep-collection-of-garbage-in-city/articleshow/83217325.cms||---

For them, finding bulbs and other electric items will have to wait till the state starts unlocking. R Saranya, mother of a two-year-old, had a sleepless night on Tuesday after a squirrel got into the transformer near her house and the coil of the fan in her room burned out. ``There was a loud crack and the fan stopped working. I called my regular electrician who said he would not be able to do much as he did not have the coil needed to make the fan run again,’’ she said. Many households faced similar problems as the city has been experiencing rain with thunder and lightning in the last two days. It is usually electrical equipment that gets affected during such weather. ``When the power goes out for all houses, we need not worry because we know that Tangedco would restore supply when the rain stops, but when bulbs or fuses go off, it is a big problem,’’ said S Valarmathy of K K Nagar. There had been a power surge in the electric line during Tuesday night’s rain. When the power came back, Shanmugam of Anna Nagar realised that there was a short circuit in his meter box and a fuse had fizzled off. Electrician K Janarthanan says he has been receiving many desperate calls from customers who want fuses, bulbs, fans and even air conditioners repaired. ``I am helpless at this time because all electric shops are closed due to the lockdown and I cannot get spare parts,’’ he said. Abdul Razak, another electrician from Bibikulam, has been trying to do his best to repair electrical gadgets, but when wires and fuses are not available, it is difficult to do the job, he said. The government should permit electricians also to work during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/electrical-shops-shut-rain-adds-to-woes-of-residents/articleshow/83215236.cms||---

The deceased, K Srija, was daughter of B Krishnakumar and Indumathi of Palace Road, Kamarajar Salai junction. The incident was a fallout of the raging dispute between Krishnakumar, 38, and his younger brother B Ramkumar, 36, over sharing their house. Police said Krishnakumar runs a mobile phone service centre at his house. While he was staying on the ground floor, Ramkumar, a bachelor, was living on the first floor. The latter was working in a textile store in Chennai and had returned to Madurai due to the lockdown. According to police, the brothers had been sparring over sharing the house for the last few years. Ever since Ramkumar returned, he had been picking a quarrel with his elder brother over trivial issues. On Wednesday, a similar quarrel ensued with Ramkumar confronting Krishnakumar over the improper water supply to his portion. The matter turned murkier as they entered into a fist fight. Ramkumar had brought a knife along and tried to attack Krishnakumar in a fit of rage. As the latter moved away, he found the little girl in between and stabbed her. He left the place after attacking the child while Krishnakumar and Indumathi rushed her to government Rajaji hospital, where she died without responding to treatment. On being alerted, a police team from Vilakkuthoon police station reached the post and conducted an inquiry. Ramkumar was arrested subsequently. Police said the accused confessed to the crime. There was no prior case pending against him. He stated that he committed the murder in a sudden burst of anger. Based on a complaint from Indumathi, a case was registered under IPC section 302 (punishment for murder). The accused was produced before a judicial magistrate and lodged in prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-man-stabs-niece-2-to-death/articleshow/83215223.cms||---

Though the normal onset for Goa is June 5, this year, the monsoon onset date in Goa, however, may not be the same as its normal date. This year, the state may not receive monsoon showers on June 5, according to IMD experts, which means Goa is likely to miss the normal date of June 5 for monsoon arrival. “With present observations, it is less likely that south west monsoon will arrive over Goa before it’s normal date of June 5,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said. After onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala on June 3, monsoon is likely to advance up to some parts of coastal and south interior Karnataka, Rayalaseema and some more parts of south and central Bay of Bengal during next two days. After onset over Kerala, the wind patterns for monsoon may take around four days to set over the latitudes of Goa. The rainfall activity also needs to pick up. In case the rain or wind conditions aren’t meeting with criteria, then date of arrival over Goa may further prolong for 2-3 more days. The IMD, however, warned of the likelihood of rainfall and thundershower activity to continue over Goa, conditions of which are being monitored. “In case of the possibility of advance of monsoon currents to the latitudes of Goa, it will be informed in advance,” Rahul said. Meteorologist and retired scientist of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), M R Ramesh Kumar said that the onset can be expected sometime in the coming week. “The monsoon does not move linearly. The normal onset of South-west monsoon over Goa is June 5, while that of Kerala is June 1. If we use that analogy, then we can say that it should reach Goa, by next Monday, that is June 7.” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-to-miss-usual-monsoon-date-onset-to-be-after-june-5/articleshow/83215252.cms||---

A detailed presentation on the development plan will be made before the high-power committee led by Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte at Mumbai on Friday. Notably, the state government seems to be going ahead with the development of Pathri even as the tag of birthplace of Sai Baba to the town had turned into a huge controversy in the past. Parbhani district collector Deepak Mugaliakar said the development plan includes improvement of basic infrastructure and different amenities for Pathri. “The development plan has been charted out by consulting different stakeholders. It will take care of present and future needs of the city as a major pilgrim town,” said Mugaliakar, who will be making the presentation before the panel. While the Pathri temple trust had submitted a formal plan for the development of the existing temple around three years ago, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had in January 2020 announced a financial aid of Rs 100 crore for necessary development. The announcement had then stirred a controversy as stakeholders from Shirdi opposed Thackeray referring to Pathri as the birthplace of Sai Baba. Sanjay Bhusari, trustee of Sai Baba temple at Pathri, said the work on development of the birthplace of Sai Baba should be expedited at the earliest. “Scores of people not only from Maharashtra but also from other parts of the country, especially southern parts of the country, visit Pathri every year. The existing infrastructure and amenities prove inadequate to devotees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/meet-on-rs-203cr-sai-birthplace-development-plan-today/articleshow/83211503.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nepean Sea Road residents fund vax drive for 3,000 slumdwellers||MUMBAI: In a neighbourly gesture, the Nepean Sea Road Citizens Forum (NRCF) has decided to hold a free Covid vaccination drive for close to 3,000 locals from two slums in their locality —JP Nagar and Simla House. Well-heeled locals from the upscale South Mumbai area have come forward to contribute funds for the camp, which is likely to take place in the third week of June. The forum is in talks with a private hospital to get 8,000 vaccine doses, of which 3,000 will be reserved for the slum dwellers. Nepean Sea Road, which comes under D ward, felt the impact of the second Covid wave, reporting nearly 350-400 Covid cases daily on some days as compared to 100-150 in the first wave. “We know how difficult it is for locals from the slums in case they get infected. Therefore, to ensure their safety, we are trying to get them vaccinated as soon as possible. Many people in the locality have volunteered to fund the vaccination,” said NRCF secretary, Mukul Mehra. Many of those living in these slum pockets work as house helps in the residential buildings on Nepean Sea Road. The forum feels employers should pay from their pockets to vaccinate their support staff. The drive is meant to cover the other residents. Sunil Dhabale from Simla Nagar slum pocket said there are 700 rooms in the area and over 3,000 persons. “We are going door-to-door to register people on the CoWin app via Aarogya Setu. Many people in these slums work as taxi drivers, security guards, domestic helps or do odd jobs in offices. So far, we have registered around 800 people, and more will be enrolled in the days to come,” he said. JP Nagar is estimated to have a population of around 1,500. D ward assistant municipal commissioner Prashant Gaikwad said the NRCF had informed him about their plan. “While the BMC plans to vaccinate everyone, currently vaccination for the 18-44 years age group is not happening. Many residents of these slums fall in this age group. A drive like the one planned by the forum will speed up the process for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nepean-sea-road-residents-fund-vax-drive-for-3000-slumdwellers/articleshow/83217360.cms||Richa Pinto

In a statement on Thursday, Udhayakumar said that the spread of the fungal disease which was rising rapidly was a cause of concern. After the central government declared mucormycosis a notified disease on May 20, leader of the opposition, Edappadi K Palaniswami, had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and had expressed concern on the spread of black fungus in the state. As the cases of Covid-19 were coming down in Madurai, it was a matter of concern that the people who had recovered from the disease were reporting black fungal infections. The district administration and government should take steps to prevent the spread of this disease and also provide early medication, to reduce the severity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/be-transparent-on-black-fungus-udhayakumar/articleshow/83215273.cms||---

As per the data compiled by the UT administration, the demand for oxygen cylinders through e-permit was between nine and 15 daily from May 15 to May 23. But May 24 onwards, the daily demand gradually decreased and in the past three days, only one oxygen cylinder was delivered. As per data (May 15 to June 2), the UT administration, through private vendors, has given 129 oxygen cylinders. Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supplies in Chandigarh, said as the demand for oxygen has dipped, they have also removed the quota system for private hospitals. In the recent oxygen audit of government and private hospitals, which was started by the UT administration in May, it was observed that the consumption of the gas decreased by 20-25%. The committee constituted by the UT administration had submitted its report to UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta, highlighting that the 20-25% medical oxygen consumption had fallen following sensitisation drive by the panel members, including doctors in government and private hospitals. Garg said the Union government has fixed the daily quota of 20 MT of medical oxygen for UT from M/s INOX Barotiwala. This medical oxygen was being utilized for GMCH-32, GMSH-16 and the Covid Hospital in Sector 48. The private healthcare institutions were also catered to from this quota. Additionally, three oxygen generation plants were commissioned recently in these hospitals. He said efforts put in by the UT administration had resulted in smooth supply of oxygen in the city. At present, UT has sufficient oxygen cylinders, so it was decided to lift the quota fixed for private hospitals, he added. Only 9 patients in Sec 48 hospital The UT administration had recently decided to close down the Sector 48 Covid hospital and keep it on a standby. On Thursday, there were only nine patients there. The UT had decided that no new Covid patient would be sent to the Sector 48 hospital unless all beds in Covid wards and ICUs were full in GMCH-32, which will keep a buffer of 10 beds to take care of emergencies, said Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for Covid management at GMCH-32.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/with-cases-falls-demand-for-o2-cylinders-at-home/articleshow/83215270.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Hyderabad||Telangana minister Eatala Rajender, once close aide of KCR, to quit TRS||HYDERABAD: A month after his removal from the K Chandrasekhar Rao cabinet, former Telangana minister Eatala Rajender is all set to quit TRS and join BJP. He met BJP national president JP Nadda in Delhi a couple of days ago. The once close aide of KCR is likely to resign as MLA on Friday. Soon after his resignation, Rajender is likely to address a press conference to explain the reasons for his exit from the pink party and detail his future plans. Sources close to Rajender said though the date of joining the saffron party has not yet been finalised, it’s tentatively scheduled on June 8. Along with him, former Yellareddy MLA Enugu Ravinder Reddy, former Karimnagar ZP chairperson Tula Uma and Sammi Reddy, a local leader from Huzurabad constituency, would be joining the saffron party. Ravinder Reddy, a four-time MLA, had lost in the 2018 assembly elections to Congress candidate Jajula Surender. After the elections, Surender quit Congress and joined TRS. Since then, Ravinder Reddy has been reportedly unhappy with the TRS leadership. He has been moving closely with Rajender after the latter’s removal from the cabinet. Tula Uma is cut up with the TRS leadership after she was denied a ticket to contest from the Vemulawada assembly constituency and she did even get a chance to serve as ZP chairperson for the second term. Sources said the BJP leadership and Rajender were hopeful many people would quit the pink party and join the saffron party. “Some leaders wanted to support Rajender and, due to pressures from the ruling party, they sought more time. We are hopeful that they will also be joining us soon,” a close aide of Rajender said. Immediately after Rajender was dropped from the cabinet, the TRS leadership had roped in ministers Gangula Kamalakar, T Harish Rao and leaders like former MP B Vinod Kumar, Karimnagar mayor Y Sunil Rao, MLC Naradasu Laxman Rao and others to ensure other leaders do not quit the party and sail with Eatala. The ministers held separate meetings with MPTCs, ZPTCs, councillors, municipal chairpersons and advised them not to join the former minister. The party succeeded in stopping many leaders from supporting him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-once-close-aide-of-kcr-to-quit-trs/articleshow/83219014.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation able to reclaim 24% of Pirana dump||AHMEDABAD: The solid waste department has been able to reclaim 24% of the Pirana dumpyard land by freeing it from garbage. The department has been able to process 33 lakh metric tonnes of garbage and estimates that the Pirana mound would be entirely removed in next three years. Officials in the department said that so far, the AMC has been able to clear about 19 acres of the land from the 80 acres covered by garbage. The officials said the lockdown last year and the rains have come as a major setback for the reclaiming project. “Even during the monsoon this year, if there are heavy rains then the work at the site will receive a setback,” said an officer at the Pirana site. The Pirana dump is spread over 80 acres, with three 55-metre mounds sitting on 40 acres of land. The officials said that a recent estimate has revealed that the Pirana mound had 1.25 crore metric tonnes of garbage as against an estimated 80 lakh MT in 2012. At present, 39 trommel machine are processing about 15,000 MT of garbage daily. If the current pace can be kept up, the mound would be completely eliminated in the next three years, say officials. “In 2019, the bio-mining project was implemented by the AMC and 25 trommel machines were deployed at Pirana to segregate waste,” an officer said. However, a review showed that in nearly 20 months the AMC was able to process and remove 33 lakh MT of garbage. Last year, due to political uncertainty, the project was delayed as the awarding of the tenders of trommel machine was not cleared by the standing committee for over a month. It was in September that the tenders were invited afresh and more than 30 agencies applied for the biomining project. The officials said that construction debris and large stones, which form about 30% of the garbage, is sent to AMC plant for construction of paver blocks, 50% of the garbage is mud and another 20% is plastic or small clothes with plastic being almost 15%. An AMC official said that the segregated plastic is kept on a side and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board is yet to inform the AMC where to divert this plastic. The plastic may be diverted to cement or any other industry including construction of roads. A pilot project was taken up in the city near Nagari Hospital where plastic waste was used for road construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-able-to-reclaim-24-of-pirana-dump/articleshow/83215312.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Other ministers had to intervene to cool down tempers after heated arguments and exchange of threats between education minister and PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra and urban improvement and housing minister Shanti Dhariwal. Dhariwal told TOI, “The AICC campaign included only the PCC and DCC petition the respective governor and collectors. I was objecting ministers going to collectors with the petition.” He claimed that Dotasra included the ministers in the campaign. Besides, my suggestion was that the petition should be send to the President of India directly.” Dotasra threatened his senior cabinet colleague of complaining to the party president Sonia Gandhi on his conduct. As the meeting was held to decide the status of board exams for class X and XII with Gehlot being virtually connected, Dotasra raised the vaccination issue at the end of the meeting and informed about the Congress social media campaign held on Wednesday demanding universal free vaccination. He said a memorandum should be submitted to the collectors to be sent to President Ramnath Kovind from every district on June 4 with the district incharge ministers leading the programme by holding a press conferences. At this point, Dhariwal intervened questioning the futility of presenting a memorandum to the collector by ministers. He said it is not the collector, but the protest should directed against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Dotasra objected to this interference leaving Dhariwal more agitated. The matter escalated when both of them indulged in war of words and state ministers had to intervene to calm them down. Dotasra complained to the CM that action should be taken against such behaviour of the minister who did not allow the party president to speak. He was about to leave the meeting but Gehlot pacified him and asked him to complete his comments. The chief minister asked both of them to remain calm, but the dispute started again when Dhariwal told Dotasra that he had seen many party presidents and he could do whatever he wanted. Dhariwal then told Dotasra that he was not bound to obey his orders while Dotasara said he would have to obey orders so long as he was the party president. Even after the cabinet meeting was over, Dhariwal and Dotasra exchanged harsh words and again fellow ministers had to intervene and got them separated. Dotasra also accused the senior minister of not being serious about his job as district incharge. “You have not even held a single meeting till date in the last two-and-a-half years. This attitude of yours is not good for the party, I will report it to Sonia Gandhi.” Dotasra later clarified that he was only informing the decision of the party high command to organise such an event and it was not his decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ministers-clash-in-cm-gehlots-presence-leave-govt-red-faced/articleshow/83217347.cms||---

Sharma had sought the quashing of the FIR registered against him in Delhi. The court also issued notice to Rajasthan and Delhi police to file a status report within two weeks on Sharma's plea. Notice was also issued to Shekhawat. The next hearing is on August 6. During the hearing, Sharma's lawyer Siddharth Aggarwal questioned filing an FIR in Delhi when the investigation of this case was going on in Rajasthan. He argued that the Delhi Police could not investigate in this matter. Agarwal said Sharma was not the original source of the clip of the alleged conversation between the minister and the middleman in the MLA bribery case, but only passed on the clip to the media. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for Rajasthan government, said a complaint was filed by a BJP leader in Rajasthan regarding the matter on which investigation was still on. Lawyer Rajesh Mahajan appearing on behalf of Delhi Police said a case could be registered in Delhi and the investigation of this matter was going on in Delhi. The court asked when the clip was received by Sharma, he was in Rajasthan. He then forwarded it from there. Does it mean that jurisdiction is of Rajasthan? Shekhawat's lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani said jurisdiction could be in Delhi also. The court then asked Jethmalani why not transfer the FIR to Rajasthan on which Jethmalani objected saying that the investigation was on in the case by Delhi Police. The court said if everything was going on in Rajasthan, why should only an FIR be investigated in Delhi? Jethmalani argued that this matter should not be investigated in Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phone-tapping-relief-for-officer-on-spl-duty-to-cm/articleshow/83217374.cms||---

Recently, the UT had sought three-month extension for home secretary Arun Gupta and MC commissioner KK Yadav. The three-year tenure of both the officers had ended in May. The UT’s proposal to the Central government for three-month extension to Gupta, a Haryana cadre IAS officer of 1992 batch, was approved by the appointment committee of the cabinet. In a letter sent by Vineet Kumar, special secretary, personnel, Punjab, to the UT secretary, personnel, it was stated that the Punjab government has already sent a panel of officers for appointment as Chandigarh MC commissioner on inter-cadre deputation. “Therefore, it is requested that the new incumbent out of the panel may be appointed on the post of commissioner, municipal corporation, and Kamal Kishor Yadav, IAS, be relieved to join back his parent cadre,” read the letter. The Punjab government had sent a panel of three IAS officers — Anindita Mitra, Amit Kumar and Rajiv Prashar —to succeed Yadav. In March, the UT had recommended to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) the name of Anindita, a 2007 batch IAS officer, for MC commissioner post. At present, Yadav also holds the charge of secretary, rural development & panchayats, secretary, sports, nodal officer (Smart City) and chief executive officer, Chandigarh Smart City Limited.  To tackle the second Covid wave, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had urged the ministry of home affairs to grant extension in services to Gupta and Yadav, a Punjab cadre IAS officer of 2003 batch. The Haryana government had earlier sent a panel of three IAS officers to succeed Gupta. The panel included Nitin Kumar Yadav (2000 batch), Ravi Pankaj Agarwal (2000 batch) and Vinay Singh (2003 batch). The UT had recommended Nitin Kumar Yadav for UT home secretary post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/relieve-mc-chief-yadav-punjab-writes-to-ut-admn/articleshow/83215292.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The girl belonging to a farmer’s family hailing from Belura village of Majalgaon went missing last month, following which her family reached the police station for lodging a complaint and seeking help for tracking the missing girl.Though an offence was registered, no progress was made in the case.

Eight days later, there was still no development in the case and the middleman asked for more money following which another Rs 10, 000 were arranged and paid.Despite paying Rs 25,000, the suspect middleman continued to demand the remaining amount for bringing back the missing girl. Unable to arrange the money, the missing girl’s father lodged a complaint with the SP and also submitted the call recording with the middleman.“Based on the prima facie evidence, we have suspended API Anil Gavhankar and have ordered a detailed probe into the incident. Based on the findings Gavhankar will face appropriate action,” Raja said.“Though the missing complaint is a month old, I got to know about the unprofessional and alleged corrupt act only after the girl’s family reached out to me earlier this week,” he added.As per directives of the apex court, for every minor going missing, a case of kidnapping has to be registered and probed on similar lines until it comes to fore that it was a missing case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cop-suspended-for-demanding-money/articleshow/83211571.cms||Mohammed Akhef

In case of default, their contract can also be cancelled. The MC has given a week to the contractors to pay the amount.“We have served notices on the parking contractors and they have also given representations, raising some issues, which are also under consideration,” an MC official said.Sources in the civic body said as per records, the contractors didn’t pay for April and the payment for May is due next week. The move has come at a time when the paid parking contractors have been seeking exemption from the licence fee due to the ongoing lockdown. In their request to the authority, they said that due to the lockdown, no customers were coming to the markets, so their business has been hit severely. Moreover, the contractors are also asking to reduce the fee as the area of some of the lots has decreased due to multiple reasons. There are two paid parking contractors and 89 lots are divided between them. The parking lots of southern and eastern sectors of the city, including sectors 34, 26, 20, among others, have been kept under Zone-1 and Zone-II has northern areas, including sectors 17, 22, 7, 8, 9, among others. Zone-II is the busiest and many new paid parking lots have been added to it. Revenue resourceThe municipal corporation had auctioned both the paid parking zones to eligible contractors for over Rs 10 crore annually. Paid parking is one of the key resources of revenue for the civic body. Sources in the MC said that the plea of the contractors looks genuine, but the general house would take the final call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/paid-parking-contractors-fail-to-pay-fee-mc-serves-notice/articleshow/83215340.cms||Deepak Yadav

As many as 748 doctors died in the first wave of the pandemic, IMA added. Delhi saw the maximum number of deaths, followed by Bihar at 96, UP with 79, Rajasthan 43, Jharkhand 39 and Andhra Pradesh 34, Telangana 32, Gujarat 31 and West Bengal 30, the data till June 2 stated. “The actual number of fatalities involving the doctors could be higher,” Dr Vinay Agarwal, member of IMA, said. He added that the government must acknowledge the sacrifice of the doctors and provide financial support to the bereaved families. “Doctors and nurses and other healthcare workers have been at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic. However, there is no mechanism in place to prioritise their treatment, especially the ones involved in private practice. During the peak in cases, some of the doctors working with the top private hospitals found it difficult to find a bed at their own institution,” said another doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-109-delhi-lost-max-docs-to-2nd-wave-ima/articleshow/83217419.cms||---

P Pappuraj, 46, a native of Veeravanallur, is a photographer by profession. Ever since the second wave of the pandemic broke out, he wanted to do his bit towards containing the infection. He decided to contribute some money to the CM’s relief fund but was left with only a few thousand rupees. An advertisement of a reusable mask, which claimed to have medicinal properties, caught his attention. With whatever money he had, he purchased a consignment of the mask for Rs 25 apiece after bargaining on its MRP of Rs 49 each. He sold each one of them for Rs 40. “I went door to door selling the mask. I wore a banner printed with details of the cause behind the sales when I went out. After selling the initial consignment, I invested again and bought more masks using the money. In two weeks, I got Rs 14,000 including the principal amount I had invested,” he said. He handed over a cheque for Rs 14,000 to Tirunelveli district collector V Vishnu at his chamber and received an acknowledgement for it. Pappuraj had mobilized money in a similar way to help 25 families involved in leather puppetry in Tirunelveli during last year’s lockdown. He bought them vegetables and essential items including rice for a month. Pappuraj has also taken up activities like cleaning vehicles at petrol bunks and footwear at public places to collect relief money for various natural disasters such as Gaja cylone, tsunami and the Gujarat earthquake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/activist-sells-masks-to-donate-to-cms-relief-fund/articleshow/83215323.cms||---
---||Goa||Erosion forces fishermen to build wall on Morjim beach||PANAJI: Around two kilometres away from the turtle nesting site on Morjim beach stretch in Pernem taluka, local fishermen of Vithaldas wada have taken up construction of a concrete wall on the beach. While the construction may have environmentalists aghast, the incident has brought to light the plight of local communities dependent on fishing for livelihood. The increase in extreme weather events like Cyclone Tauktae and the sand erosion, both caused by climate change, are having a devastating impact on the lives of fishermen communities. Frustrated after their canoes and fishing nets were damaged due to impact of Cyclone Tauktae, the fishermen said they decided to take matters in their own hands and began construction of the concrete wall. “A proposal has been pending with the water resources department since 2017 and the matter was being personally pursued by then chief minister Manohar Parrikar. Over the years, no anti-erosion measures have been taken up based on the proposal. For many years now, fishermen have been asking government to provide for shelters for their canoes and to store their fishing equipment, but nothing is being done, leaving fishing communities to face loses each time water level rises,” said panch member of Vithaldas wada Vilas Morje, adding that the wall being constructed is in no way harming the turtle nesting site, which is at some distance. The fishermen said in the absence of a Coastal Zone Management Plan for Goa, the demarcation of 100 mts land area from the high tide line is yet to be taken up, reserving this area exclusively for fishing activities. “In the absence of the coastal plan, the hotels have encroached in this area which is within 100mts from the high tide line. So there is no way for us to pull our canoes in the road’s direction to safety. On the beach side, sand erosion is reducing the width of the stretch and exposing our equipment to the impact of the waves. To break this impact, we are constructing the 190ms long wall,” said a fisherman. A concrete wall constructed by WRD, covering around two kilometres of the coastal stretch in Morjim, already exists, to break the impact of the waves. Officials, however, did not confirm on Thursday if a proposal has been pending for construction of an anti-erosion structure for the Vithaldas wada stretch. But it is not only the case with Morjim. Fishermen on Polem beach stretch in Canacona are also facing a similar threat to their livelihood, with no measures coming forth from the state. Fishermen Ankush Pagi said the government should assist them with a shelter to house their fishing boats and fishing nets, in absence of which they have to leave the equipment on the beach. Over the years, Polem beach stretch in Canacona has suffered significant sand erosion and the situation has worsened now by the impact of Cyclone Tauktae with several casuarina trees uprooted. “A simple look at the state of the beach at present is telling of how, if some protective measures are not taken on a priority, there will be tough days ahead not only for the fishermen but those residing near the beach too,” said Pagi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/erosion-forces-fishermen-to-build-wall-on-morjim-beach/articleshow/83215347.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Awardee denied foodgrain gets job||The state government provided a temporary job to a tribal woman Hali Baraf, recipient of a national bravery award, after she had announced to return honour because her family and 400 tribal people were not provided foodgrains at Public Distribution System (PDS) shops. They did not get grains as their names were not included in online PDS. Baraf had received the 'Veer Bapuji Gandhani Rashtriya Balveer award' by the hands of the President of India in 2013 for saving her sister from the clutches of a leopard. Baraf who was earlier working at Ashram school had lost her job last year in lockdown and since then she and her family were facing a lot of problems to run their livelihood. She told TOI, “Since my family members names and other details have not been entered in the online PDS, ration shop in my area for four months have refused to give us food grains which made my life more difficult”. Baraf who is also a member of Shramjeevi Sanghtana said, “When I learned that over 400 tribals families in our Shahapur taluka facing the same problem, I decided to return my award on June 9 to protest this official apathy”. Learning about the same, Dr Mohan Naladkar sub-divisional officer of Bhiwandi Taluka in Thane district has given a temporary job for three months for the post of peon in Shahapur tehsil. Dr Naladkar told TOI, “As per government norms, we cannot give her a permanent job as she did not have the required qualification but looking at her problem, we have given her a temporary job for three months and looking at her performance it can get extended also”. Learning about Baraf’s financial problem, Bhiwandi Loksabha MP Kapil Patil donated Rs 21,000 and also had given groceries for a month. However, Prakash Khodka, secretary of Shramajhivi Sanghatna in Shahapur taluka said, “We are happy that state government provided a temporary job to Hali but we want that they should also resolve other over 400 tribal issues related on foodgrains from PDS shops or else will hold protest”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-awardee-denied-foodgrain-gets-job/articleshow/83219033.cms||---

Accused in the fraud and cheating case involving absconding businessman Vijay Mallya, Raghunathan said that the bank lockers contain personal effects and ancestral jewellery of his wife and daughter. He said that they were unable to use the jewellery for Ugadi, or the Telugu New Year, family weddings and other auspicious occasions. Raghunathan was arrested in the case in January 2017 and released on bail in March that year. Seeking permission for the keys to the four lockers, Raghunathan said no loss and prejudice will be caused to the CBI. Responding to the plea, the CBI said that the court may pass such an order as deemed appropriate in the circumstances. It also requested that if the plea is allowed, the court may direct him to furnish an undertaking to the effect that he would produce the articles in the lockers or equivalent amount representing their value, if and when directed by the relevant authority.

The state needs to be sensitive to shortage of medicine in the region to treat ‘black fungus’ said the HC and sought a chart on supply of key drug, Amphotericin-B, from June 2-9, date-wise. The HC bench of Justices R V Ghuge and B U Debadwar passed the order while hearing a suo motu criminal PIL on Covid-19 measures. The HC directed the state to apprise the Union government about the situation as the region has 669 active cases and 124 deaths due to the fungal infection so far. Chief public prosecutor D R Kale said Marathwada reported 1,178 mucormycosis cases. While 669 patients are under treatment, 385 have been cured and 124 died. As against a requirement of 50,178 vials of Amphotericin B, Marathwada received only 13,428, the HC noted. For the Centre, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, said that between May 11-31, the state was allocated 68,660 of 2.7 lakh vials of Amphotericin B available with Centre, as patients in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat are more. Advocate S S Bora, amicus curiae, submitted that given the medicine shortage, “patients in Marathwada are being under-treated”. The matter was adjourned to June 10. —Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-calls-for-black-fungus-details-in-marathwada/articleshow/83217467.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Vax cash burden may prevent fin aid to needy, fiscal relief to industry||JAIPUR: With free Covid vaccination likely to cause a huge financial burden on the state and tax revenues expected to remain depressed due to the lockdown, fiscal relief to industries or financial assistance to vulnerable segments of population looks remote. A pension scheme for the artist community has already been approved at the highest level of the administration, but so far no money has been sanctioned, said a senior official of the art and culture department. Though Rs 15 crore has been allocated for the welfare of artists in the state in 2021-22 budget, no money has been released by the government, which could have been used to help the artists in difficult times. So far, there is no word from the government on helping out street vendors who have been out of business. Similarly, an exercise to offer industry status for the tourism sector initiated a few months ago has been put on the back burner, as per an official in the finance department. In many forums and their meetings with the government officials, the tourism industry bodies have demanded extension of industry status to the segment which would lead to reduced power rates. It seems the industry is aware of the limited fiscal space of the government. Instead of pushing for fiscal incentives, it wants the government to clear the dues of the MSMEs against the goods and services provided. “The industry is in a tight spot. The units need working capital to restart again. If the dues are paid to the MSMEs as soon as possible, they would be in a position to restart again,” said Sanjay Saboo, chairman, CII-Rajasthan. Sources in the RIICO said there is no direction from the government to work out a relief plan for the industry. “Currently, there is no order for working out a relief package for the industrial units,” said the source. The government expects to spend around Rs 3,000 crore for buying vaccines to inoculate the state’s population without any cost. On the contrary, the revenues, particularly, VAT collections are unlikely to reach last year’s levels because of the lock-down induced demand squeeze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fin-assistance-to-vulnerable-segments-or-relief-to-industry-unlikely/articleshow/83215375.cms||---

The downpour continued during the early hours of Thursday. The torrential rains uprooted several trees and electricity poles in many parts of north Gujarat and also damaged standing crops in farms. A number of animals including cows, buffaloes and goats were killed due to lightning. The sudden change in weather was under the influence of cyclonic circulation over central Pakistan and neighbourhood as south-westerly winds prevailed over the north Gujarat region. According to the weather department light thunderstorm with lightning and surface wind up to 30-40 kmph accompanied with light to moderate rain was likely at isolated places in the districts of north and central Gujarat districts like Dahod, Panchmahal, Patan, Kheda, Banaskantha, Chhota Udepur. Rain is also expected at isolated places in Saurashtra region. Kheralu in Mehsana, Becharji, Vadnagar, Vijapur and Satlasan recorded significant rainfall on Wednesday night and Thursday. At Hoda village in Dhanpura taluka of Aravalli district four thatched houses collapsed but nobody was injured in the incident. About 27 electricity polls fell in Bhiloda and Modasa towns. One buffalo and 13 goats died due to lightning in Aravalli district. A cow died on Bhiloda-Shamlaji road near Lati village got electrocuted. Angry villagers said that the electricity company was informed prior to the cow’s death, but no action was taken cutting off the electricity supply. At the Tintoi primary health centre in Modasa, a huge tree fell on an adjacent building but no no casualty was reported. However, strong winds with rains brought some relief from the sultry heat in the north Gujarat districts. Places such as Modasa, Meghraj, Bayad, Dhansura, Malpur, Bhiloda experienced gusty winds on Thursday morning which was followed by heavy rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/strong-wind-heavy-rains-take-north-gujarat-by-surprise/articleshow/83213563.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Pigs killed in Ambazari, is leopard on way back to forest?||NAGPUR: Even as the foresters spent another frustrating day attending more hoax calls on leopard in the city, the forest department is working on two theories – the leopard has reached Ambazari Biodiversity Park or it is still holed up in the city. “We are working on the first theory as on Wednesday we noticed some dead pigs in the Ambazari forest from Pandhrabodi side. Their flesh was also consumed. This indicates that the animal must have reached the forest. The last three calls seem to be hoax as no direct or indirect evidence has been found,” said P Kalyan Kumar, CCF, Nagpur. Officials suspect the way flesh of pigs has been consumed, it seems to be the handiwork of a leopard. The pig that was killed near Maharajbagh zoo must have been killed by dogs. On Wednesday night, a VNIT guard claimed he saw a leopard on the premises but it turned out to be a civet cat. Later, Ankit Jain from Sadar claimed he saw the leopard jumping into the divisional commissioner’s office. “We scanned entire area and offices including old high court building in Civil Lines but not an iota of evidence has been found either in camera traps and CCTV footage. We will capture the animal if found in the city,” said Kumar. On Thursday at 6.10 pm, a woman caller claimed she saw a leopard near GPO office. The forest team found that it was a Siberian Husky dog owned by a resident. This was followed by another call at 8.42pm to police control room but it was found to be a male cat. The department has appealed that if it is confirmed the animal is a leopard, people can contact 1926 or 0712-2515306 or police. CCF Kumar said, “We have set up camera traps in Ambazari.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pigs-killed-in-ambazari-is-leopard-on-way-back-to-forest/articleshow/83215382.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||India||Supreme Court, government now lock horns over tribunal reforms||NEW DELHI: A confrontation has been brewing between the Supreme Court and the Centre over the past weeks with the two constitutional entities locking horns, first over Covid-19 vaccination and pricing policies, and then on Thursday over promulgation of the Tribunal Reforms Ordinance, which is allegedly in utter disregard of apex court judgments. If a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat had termed the Centre’s Covid-19 vaccination policy for the 18-44 age group as “prima facie arbitrary and irrational” in an order published on Wednesday, another bench hit out at the government over the ordinance. Another bench of Justices Rao, Hemant Gupta and Bhat on Thursday said the ordinance was a reflection of the Centre’s “recalcitrant and adamant” attitude in attempting to override the mandate given by the SC. During the hearing on Covid-19 management issues on May 31, solicitor general Tushar Mehta repeatedly and firmly appealed to the SC not to step into the executive’s policy domain by seeking to tweak policy frameworks. Mehta had said the judiciary was barred from substituting the executive’s wisdom with its own. The SC had conceded that policy-making was within the executive’s sole domain but said it would not be a silent spectator when policies breached the constitutional rights of citizens. On Thursday, the bench of Justices Rao, Gupta and Bhat reserved its order on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, which sought to differ from the SC mandate for a fiveyear tenure to chairpersons and members of tribunals by prescribing a four-year tenure; also fixing eligibility age at 50, which negated the court order for allowing lawyers with 10 years experience to be in the zone of consideration. Justice Bhat asked, “Why is a recalcitrant executive going on enacting laws as if the judgments of the Supreme Court do not exist?” Attorney general K K Venugopal said it was Parliament’s job to enact laws as it was for the SC to determine their constitutional validity. Justice Rao said, “If the SC gives a mandate, the legislature enacts a law without heeding it, then the SC strikes down the law and the process gets repeated... how will finality be reached?” The AG said, “It is not that Parliament does not deliberate before enacting a legislation. There is a whole process to it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-government-now-lock-horns-over-tribunal-reforms/articleshow/83220855.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

On Thursday, Buldhana ZP CEO Bhagyashree Vispute also suspended school headmaster Mahendra Rothe and assistant teacher Mukund Narote. “Action has been taken on three persons so far. Investigation is still under way and report of district-level officials is yet to be received,” said Vispute. Buldhana collector S Ramamurthi said that a committee has been formed to investigate the matter and it will submit report on June 4. This means some more officials could face disciplinary action. Sources told TOI authorities were converting a government school at village Marodi into a CCC after 15 Covid patients were detected in the village. As the authorities could not find a labourer to clean the toilet, they asked this schoolboy to do the work. Sources said the now suspended headmaster and teacher insisted that this boy clean the toilet. A local villager, Bhau Bhojne, has also launched a police complaint against the authorities after the video went viral. As the video received angry responses, the administration swung into action. Tehsildar Tejashree Kore asked for a report from block development officer Sanjay Patil. In his report, gram sevak Mukinda Shivade was held responsible resulting in his suspended. Political leaders also expressed anger on the viral video. BJP’s Chitra Wagh said a schoolboy cleaning toilet was not only against the law but also against humanity. “I appeal to the district guardian minister to take stern action against the culprits,” Wagh said. Buldhana is the third worst-hit district due to Covid-19 after Nagpur and Amravati in Vidarbha region. The district has more than 85,000 cases, and 600+ deaths due to Covid-19. The district was badly hit in the second wave as cases are coming from rural and tribal regions of Buldhana. In the last two weeks, cases have gone down in the city and tehsil headquarters. Now, a majority of cases is coming from rural regions. As a result, schools and community halls in villages are being converted into temporary CCCs. As gram panchayats are allowed to spend 25% of their sanctioned funds on the development of CCCs, many villages have started developing their own CCCs in rural Maharashtra now.

The VC, however, added that the dates could change if the Centre comes up with a new policy or decides to conduct the all-India Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET). Joshi reiterated that since DU’s admission is based on merit, “this year, too, we will admit students on the basis of marks they have received from their boards.” “Since Class XII exams will not take place, we can start the registration for admissions on July 15 and are ready for it; unless the government decides to conduct the CUCET,” he added. Both CBSE and CISCE have announced that they will not conduct Class XII exams owing to the second wave of the Covid pandemic in the country. The DU vice-chancellor claimed that they would wait for other State boards to come up with a decision. “Many of the boards are following CBSE and deciding to not conduct exams.” “Unlike previous years, our admission process will end by July. So, there will be a delay, but we will try to start from mid-July, if the government allows,” he said, adding that, much like last year, the admission process would be completely online and contactless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-admissions-likely-to-start-on-july-15-says-vc/articleshow/83217495.cms||---
---||Mumbai||4,364km underground cabling done: MSEDCL||MUMBAI: The state power utility firm, MSEDCL, has completed 4,364km underground cabling as part of Integrated Power Development Scheme for expansion and strengthening of energy distribution networks in 254 cities/towns across Maharashtra. “Compared to other states, more work of underground cabling has been done in Maharashtra which is the main highlight of the scheme,” said MSEDCL chairman and managing director Vijay Singhal. Underground cables are better than overground wires which get damaged in case of gusty winds, downpour or cyclone. Recently, there was large-scale devastation in parts of MMR, Palghar, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg due to Cyclone Tauktae and the primary reason was the damage to the overground cabling network/poles. “The new underground cabling and strengthening power infra will benefit around 1.2 crore electricity consumers in urban areas,” Singhal said. The project involved carrying out works worth Rs 2,300 crore. Meanwhile, the power restoration work of 1,473 consumers in the remote areas of Palghar, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg affected by Cyclone Tauktae is almost complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4364km-underground-cabling-done-says-msedcl/articleshow/83219065.cms||Somit Sen
---||Goa||For Goa’s lost forest cover, state eyes afforestation in Madhya Pradesh||PANAJI: To make up for the forest cover lost in Goa over the years to different development projects, the state has proposed to carry out compensatory afforestation in Madhya Pradesh over an area of 300ha, citing that it faces a shortage of land. After hearing Goa’s proposal during a meeting on April 27, the national-level institution Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) has asked the state to approach the Union environment ministry for this change in area for compensatory afforestation. “As Goa is a very small state, there is no suitable land available (for compensatory afforestation). Already 1/3rd of the land is under forest cover, this is in addition to the area taken up by water bodies, etc. Also, you cannot plant trees on areas earmarked for playgrounds, schools, hospitals, etc. Land is required for such facilities. The environment ministry has allowed many states to carry out compensatory afforestation in other states and we decided to ask permission to do the same for Goa,” principal chief conservator of forests for Goa Subhash Chandra told TOI. Goa currently has a backlog of 1,600ha of compensatory afforestation to be carried out. Based on Goa’s request, Madhya Pradesh has made a provision to take up 300ha of afforestation during 2021-22. Goa has proposed to transfer the funds required for the afforestation to Madhya Pradesh. Goa will, however, have to seek a special permission from the environment ministry. In 2019, the ministry had altered the norms to allow states to take up compensatory afforestation in another state. But such a proposal is permitted for states that already have over 75% of its area under forest cover. Goa does not meet the criteria as only around 60% of its area is under forest cover, as per the India State of Forest Report 2019. But this is not the first time Goa has sought compensatory afforestation in another state. Last year, Karnataka agreed to Goa’s request and offered 800ha of land in Dharwad and Belagavi districts for afforestation, to make up for the forest cover to be lost in Goa to three infrastructural projects of highway expansion, railway doubling and high tension power line and substation. For 2021-22, Goa has set aside Rs 32.7 crore for compensatory afforestation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-goas-lost-forest-cover-state-eyes-afforestation-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/83215417.cms||---
---||Kochi||Epidemic bill gets passed in Kerala assembly unanimously||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state assembly on Thursday passed the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Bill, 2021, the first bill introduced by Pinarayi Vijayan’s second government. The bill, which gives the state government the power to impose whatever restrictions needed to curb infections at the time of an epidemic, was passed with the support of the Congress-led opposition. The bill will allow the state government to take special measures to prevent disease spread, including restriction or prohibition of any kind of gatherings, celebrations, and religious activities in the state. It also allows for inspecting and quarantining of travellers who are arriving to the state by air, rail, road, or sea. By invoking the proposed law, the government can seal the state’s borders, impose restrictions on public and road transport, prescribe social distancing norms, and regulate the functioning of offices (both in the government and private sector), shops and establishments, among other things. Those who disobey the rules and regulations face imprisonment up to two years or a fine of Rs 10,000 or both. “Any person or institution or company who is bound by regulations or order contravenes or disobeys any such regulation or order made under the law shall on conviction be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend up to Rs 10,000 or both,” says the Act. Though the bill was passed unanimously, opposition member Mathew Kuzhalnadan pointed out that certain clauses in the bill are not consistent with a similar Act enacted by the Union government and hence, there are chances of this bill getting challenged in the court of law. Another Congress member K Babu questioned the government’s decision to bring the bill before the House without placing it before the subject committee. The bill was brought before the House earlier in 2020 but was not taken up for consideration of the assembly. Hence, it was promulgated as an ordinance in March 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/epidemic-bill-gets-passed-in-assembly-unanimously/articleshow/83213580.cms||---
---||Jaipur||HC unhappy with govt over vaccination of Pak minorities||JODHPUR: Expressing displeasure over non-submission of steps taken by the state government to vaccinate the persons without identity documents with special reference to Pakistani minority migrants, the high court has directed the chief secretary to submit a detailed affidavit on the steps taken by the state government to vaccinate people without identity proof. The next hearing will be held on June 10. The division bench of justice Vijay Bishnoi and justice Ramehswar Vyas also sought explanation why the state government was not treating Pakistani minority migrants without prescribed identity cards eligible for Covid vaccination inspite of the clarification by the court in its previous order on May 28 that such people were eligible for inoculation. It may be noted that in its previous hearing, the court had directed AAG KS Rajpurohit to apprise the court of the steps taken by the state government for these migrants’ vaccination. But instead the AAG submitted a note prepared by the chief medical and health officer, Jodhpur, and letters written by the municipal corporation Jodhpur (North), SP (Intelligence), Jodhpur and deputy director of social justice and empowerment department, Jodhpur, and a copy of letter written by the National Health Mission, Medical, Health and family welfare department, government of Rajasthan, to the health and family welfare ministry, government of India, with a request to include minority migrants in the SOP. On this, the court said the court had already observed that the SOP did not exclude the Pakistani minority migrants and commented that “it is difficult to understand why the state government is seeking further clarification from the central government and requesting it to include Pakistani minority migrants in the SOP”. Sajjan Singh, amicus curiae appearing on behalf of the Pakistani minority migrants, submitted they were not being vaccinated on the ground that they did not have Aadhaar cards. Singh also apprised the court that adequate food packets/ ration kits have been provided to the migrants in Jodhpur, but not to those in Jaipur, Jaisalmer and Barmer. The court has also given direction to the AAG to submit a status report on availability of food to these migrants in Rajasthan in the next hearing, Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/uc-unhappy-with-govt-over-vaccination-of-pak-minorities/articleshow/83215394.cms||---
---||Delhi||Come Saturday, 2L poor without card may get ration in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Starting Saturday, Delhi government will start distributing free ration to those without ration cards in the city. To begin with, two lakh beneficiaries will receive the kit from 280 Delhi government schools designated for the purpose. “In Delhi, those people who don’t have ration cards will get it from June 5 at schools. Ration has started reaching schools from today. The Arvind Kejriwal government is making complete arrangements to ensure there is no shortage of food for poor in the capital,” deputy CM Manish Sisodia tweeted on Wednesday. On May 28, food & civil supplies minister Imran Hussain held a meeting to review the arrangements for distribution of ration to the 72 lakh ration card holders and those without the cards. Hussain had said the government would distribute 4kg wheat and 1kg rice per person for free to non-PDS (Public Distribution System) beneficiaries who do not possess a ration card. He added that foodgrains would be distributed from one school in each of the 280 wards in the capital, and directed officials to regularly visit the shortlisted schools for effective coordination. The non-PDS ration would be distributed from the designated schools from 10am to 4pm on all days, except Sundays. Each school identified would be provided a login ID and password for entering the stock received in the system for proper record and for registration at the site and distribution, the statement said. It added that the government was taking this relief initiative for the needy, who did not possess ration cards, including unorganised, migrant and construction workers, domestic help, among others. The benefits under this initiative would be provided to a maximum of two lakh beneficiaries in the initial phase, and later, as per demand and need assessment from the field, it could be extended to a maximum of 20 lakh beneficiaries, it said. While welcoming the provisions of walk-in registration and self-certification, Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA), which has been raising the issue of people without ration cards, had written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal about the delay in distribution of ration. It had also pointed out that in 2020, following the orders of Delhi High Court in the DRRAA case, 69.6 lakh people who did not possess ration cards registered under the e-coupon scheme were provided rations, which included an essential kit consisting cooking oil, pulses, sugar, salt and spices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/come-saturday-2l-poor-without-card-may-get-ration/articleshow/83217536.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Goa||Urban tag will turn Calangute into concrete jungle: Congress||Panaji/Calangute: Any attempt to grant urban status for Calangute will be disastrous and only lead to a concrete jungle along the coastal belt, said Congress on Thursday. The party claimed that waste management minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo was trying to seek urban status for the village in order to profit from the sale of land. Former Calangute MLA Agnelo Fernandes said that if Calangute was accorded urban status, the CRZ would get reduced to 50 metres from the existing 200 metres, which would allow hotels and mega commercial projects to come up right on the beach. Congress has demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant immediately withdraw the notification issued on May 27 which classifies Calangute as an urban area under the Goa Land Revenue Code. The party has threatened to launch a “strong agitation” with the support of villagers to compel the government to cancel it. The government had issued a similar notification in January 2020 notifying 56 villages as urban areas. However, after strong pressure and objection by locals, the gazette notification was withdrawn the following month. “We want to know what changed from February 2020 to May 2021 for the BJP government to issue a fresh notification to include only the village of Calangute as an urban area,” said architect and Congress spokesperson Tulio De Souza. Meanwhile, Congress member and former Calangute sarpanch Joseph Sequeira on Thursday said the urban area status for Calangute would “finish” the ethos and socio-cultural milieu of the coastal tourism hub. Permissions have been given for constructions in low-lying fields and multi-storied buildings are being constructed by cutting hills, resulting in irreparable damage to the environment, he pointed out. The former sarpanch said that most people are worried about the Covid-19 pandemic and are not even aware of this notification. He demanded that the state government to immediately withdraw the notification, “otherwise, we will have to take whatever steps are necessary to get it revoked”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/urban-tag-will-turn-calangute-into-concrete-jungle-congress/articleshow/83215458.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Muslim OBCs protest quota scrapping||Aurangabad: A section of Muslims community members who belong to the other backward class (OBC) are now protesting the scrapping of the quota for their caste. United under the banner of All-India Muslim OBC Organisation, the protestors have accused the state government of inaction. “The state government delayed submitting the affidavit in support of OBC quota in local self-governing bodies. As a result, the SC struck down the reservation. Such a laid back approach has exposed the inefficiency of the government,” organisation president Shabbir Ansari said on Thursday. Ansari said some leaders of the ruling parties want to suppress the OBC community on a political front. “There is unrest among OBCs from the Muslim community. Until the quota is restored, the government should not allow any election,” he said. OBC leader Mirza Abdul Qayyum Nadwi said , “While the demand for reservation in education and jobs for the Muslim community has been falling on deaf ears for years, the government has now snatched away the available quota too. A corrective action is a must. Otherwise there will be huge backlash.”tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/muslim-obcs-protest-quota-scrapping/articleshow/83211690.cms||---

Surendran told a news conference in Kozhikode on Thursday that the CPM and a section of the media were targeting the party in the Kodakara heist case by creating a smokescreen. “We have nothing to hide and the party has taken the stand that it will fully cooperate with the investigation if the probe is carried out in the right manner. But now, instead of nabbing the culprits in the robbery case and finding out the source of the money, police are inquiring matters outside their scope,” he said. Surendran added that BJP leaders were needlessly being summoned by the police for interrogation just because they happened to be in the call list of the complainant. He alleged that CPM, which had got mired in the gold smuggling case and dollar smuggling case, was using the case for taking revenge. Surendran said that BJP will politically resist attempts if the government is using the police to carry out the false campaign against the party. Meanwhile, he also refuted the allegations made by JRP state treasurer Pradeeda Azhikode on Wednesday that he had given Rs 10 lakh to JRP leader C K Janu to facilitate her re-entry to the NDA and said that the allegation was a fallout of the rift within that party. “C K Janu has not asked even for a single rupee from me and I had not given a rupee to her. She was the candidate of the NDA in Sulthan Bathery constituency and there were election expenses to be met and we have carried that through legal means,” he said. Asked about the purported audio clip of telephone conversation between him and Praseeda, Surendran said that during elections a large number of people will call for various reasons and it was not possible to remember all of them. “I am not saying that she has not called me. But in current times it is easy to create an audio clip by editing parts of a conversation and inserting additional parts. It will become clear what all was discussed only if the entire conversation is released,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/havent-given-money-to-janu-bjp-prez-surendran/articleshow/83213637.cms||---

But for 23-year-old Aruna Chaudhary and 26-year-old Harshita Chaudhary, he was a very gentle and soft man. Known for his tough decision making and as a man who preferred zero political interference during his tenure from1983 to1985, Kapoor is not only missed by his family members but also by his colleagues and the two girls, who are now air hostesses. TOI on Thursday spoke to various people including former IGs, SPs and people who were closed to Kapoor to know what kind of person he was. Kapoor died of post-Covid complications on May 31. “Harshita and Aruna are daughters of his domestic help Chotey Lal. Since the day both were born, sahab (Kapoor) asked their father that he will look after their education. Both were admitted to a convent school and got good education. I remember sahab (Kapoor) stood up and saluted both the girls when they became air hostesses,” said Nand Singh, a 36-yearold home guard, who has been staying with Kapoor at his Gopal Bari situated house for past 15 years. “When I was asked to provide my services at his house I was little scared as I had heard he is short-tempered. But he was always nice, even when he was hospitalised in last week of May,” Singh added. When contacted, Aruna, attributing all her success to Kapoor, whom she fondly called ‘Nanu’, said, “He was everything for us who ensured we get good education and do well in life. He saluted us when we secured good marks and got selected for air hostess.” Recalling an incident, Ashok Bhandari who had worked as Assistant Inspector general-I with Kapoor, said, “He disliked political interference and stood by his staff. As a boss he would trust you if you were honest in your work.” Rohit Mahajan a retired IG (Crime), said, “He always trusted his sub-ordinates than politicians. When I got shunted from one place to another, he ensured I get a fair deal.” Sampat Raj Vyas, who retired as additional SP and worked as a security officer with Kapoor, said, “He worked hard to put political interference away in policing.” Kapoor is survived by two married daughters, Nira and Nidhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ex-cop-who-left-a-legacy-of-kindness/articleshow/83217532.cms||Ashish Mehta

While one of the videos purportedly showed a heap of medicine boxes and tablet strips lying in one corner where garbage is dumped, the other showed that the medicines had been set ablaze. Locals and eyewitnesses claimed that the medicines which were found dumped had not expired and the drugs included injections prescribed to pregnant women for iron deficiency or anaemia. A local Akbar Khan said that he informed the in-charge of Saipau Hospital, Dr Narendra Agrawal, about the cartons filled with medicines lying in one corner of the road. However, according to Khan, the in-charge didn’t take any action in the matter.

---||Meerut||Pandemic turns turmeric into star crop, cultivation area doubles in parts of UP||MEERUT: Due to its medicinal properties, including the proven anti-inflammatory qualities, turmeric has suddenly become a crop much sought after by farmers. As demand for the key spice in Indian kitchens grew, and so did its price, many cultivators in UP have begun to favour the ubiquitous haldi. In at least six districts of western UP -- contiguous with NCR which also caters to the needs of Delhi-- the cultivation area of turmeric has almost doubled. “If one goes by the statistics, 300 hectares of land was being used for the cultivation of turmeric, which has increased to almost 600 in districts like Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Shamli, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Bijnor. The crop is sown in the April-June period,” said Dr RS Sengar, agriculture scientist in the department of biotechnology at College of Agriculture, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University (SVBPAU). “Even the government had promoted the use of Indian spices to make concoctions (like kadha) and doctors, too, prescribe home remedies to keep infections away. One popular drink was turmeric mixed in milk, which many families consume on a daily basis,” Sengar said. For farmers, it offered a quick income. “In the market, the rates of turmeric doubled from Rs 250/kg to almost Rs 500. We, too, got good prices for our crop at a time when there were no takers for conventional vegetables due to long lockdowns,” said Muzaffarnagar-based farmer Harbeer Chauhan. With the increase in production, growers have now felt the need for more processing plants in the region. “Turmeric is a root plant that comes from the ginger family. In seven to nine months, one hectare of land produces 200 to 250 quintals of turmeric. Though the ripe root also sells in the market, a processed one fetches more money. At present there are very few processing units here. If more processing units are installed, more farmers will turn towards the cultivation of turmeric,” said Dr Bijender Singh, dean at College of Horticulture, SVBPAU. Processing involves boiling, pealing, drying and grinding of the roots that ultimately produce the bright yellow-coloured powder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pandemic-turns-turmeric-into-star-crop-cultivation-area-doubles-in-parts-of-up/articleshow/83213707.cms||Sandeep Rai

Fernandes undermined the threat given by the councillors of staking claim for the BJP ticket in Canacona, if he fails to help the council get approvals for the works proposed by the council. Fernandes said, “Such threats are meaningless.” He said that the meeting with chief minister couldn't be held over the developmental works due to the Covid situation. Canacona MLA said the local authority is there to execute the works resolved by the council and further noted that the councillors should get the general works done from administrative authorities. He said he is ever ready to follow-up and get government approvals for issues that require government attention. He, however, said that by just saying “we are with the government” but not cooperating in carrying out proposed programs and activities, is “not a good sign”. He recalled that a few days ago, CMC chairperson Mario Simon Rebello had accused the chief officer and the engineer of failing to cooperate in executing development works in the municipality. He also recalled that Chaudi councillor Ramakant Naik Gaonkar who had said that the ruling panel will not support the BJP party candidate and instead field their own for the forthcoming assembly polls. Naik Gaonkar also alleged that the three BJP leaders, including Fernandes, were presently working in three different directions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rift-widensbetweenisidore-cmc-councillors/articleshow/83215484.cms||---

The probe team officially declined to endorse or deny the reports that BJP state president K Surendran would be summoned by them as part of the probe and said this would be decided as the probe progresses. However, the probe team sources said Surendran was likely to be summoned to seek more clarifications on the reported testimonies made by the complainant and RSS activist S Dharmarajan as well as others. Padmakumar has repeated the stance taken by other BJP leaders, who were questioned earlier, that the party had no links with the illegal transport of money or its looting, the sources said. Meanwhile, the probe team on Thursday arrested Sulfikkar Ali from Mankada in Malappuram for his alleged links in the looting case. Police have also recovered gold weighing about 9.5 sovereigns from the house of Deepthi, an accused who was arrested earlier in the case, in Thrissur. She is the wife of Ranjit, also an accused who was arrested in the case.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur Development Authority to redefine construction area in single patta plots||JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has forwarded a proposal to the state government seeking directions on the development of facility area on single patta (lease deed) plots. At present, in the single plots approximately 15% to 20% of the total land is surrendered to develop green-belt under high tension, construction of drains and road. Apart from this, it is mandatory to earmark 5% land for facility area. An official source said, “More than 20% land is surrendered for facility area in single patta, less land is available for construction. We have sent a proposal to redefine the facility area of single patta.” Apart from this, the JDA receives a nod from the urban development and housing (UDH) department not to levy external development and sewerage charges on warehouses developed on agriculture plots. An official said, “To promote the warehousing industry, the decision has been taken. However, in future, if sewerage is laid for other establishments in the vicinity of the warehouses, then charges will be imposed.” The UDH department has also made amendments in the existing Rajasthan Municipalities (Disposal of Urban Land) Rules, 1974 to promote investments in urban areas and strengthen the financial condition of local bodies in the state. As per the new rules, owners can deposit land conversion fee in one year instead of six months. Earlier, if the amount was not deposited for six months, the process of land conversion was automatically cancelled. The department has also decided not to impose lease amount on land conversion cases’ proceedings for warehouses and cold storage of agricultural products. An official said, “For warehouses and cold storage of agricultural products, the civic bodies will allot land at 50% of the reserved price, but allottees will have to construct in two years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-to-redefine-construction-area-in-single-patta-plots/articleshow/83217560.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 27% of black fungus patients were Covid positive at time of diagnosis||JAIPUR: Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, is not a post-Covid complication completely. At least 27% admitted patients diagnosed with mucormycosis were Covid positive and hadn’t recovered when they contracted the ailment. In all, 315 cases have been reported in the state who contracted mucormycosis when they were Covid positive. So far, 849 patients, accounting for 77% patients, were admitted to hospitals with mucormycosis after recovering from Covid. Almost one out of four persons getting admitted with mucormycosis are still Covid positive, which shows that black fungus is not completely a post-Covid complication. Sawai Man Singh Medical College has already pointed out that patients undergoing Covid treatment should monitor their sugar levels and control it as it is one of the major factor of Mucormycosis. “In some cases, Covid may lead to vicious cycle of misfortunes. For saving life of Covid patients, steroids are given, which lead to rise in sugar levels especially in diabetic patients. This enhances chances of bacterial and fungal infection such as mucormycosis. If a Covid patient contracts mucormycosis, then doctors need to carry out a surgery. There are studies that if surgery is done in Covid patients, there is high risk of mortality,” said Dr Pawal Singhal, professor (ENT), SMS Medical College. Out of 1,165 admitted patients diagnosed with mucormycosis in the state, 659 have undergone a surgical debridement for reducing load of fungus. Doctors are taking precautions while deciding to go for mucormycosis surgery of Covid patients. “Covid in itself causes immune deficiency. When a patient contracts mucormycosis, it makes his recovery even more difficult. Patients require surgical debridement to reduce load of fungus. When a patient is Covid positive, surgery is not easy as we have to take precautions. If we give antifungals, it may cause damage to kidneys,” said Dr Tarun Ojha, professor and head of the department (ENT) at a private medical university. What health experts say: Triple immune suppression is a combination of Covid, diabetes and steroid use that enhances risk of mucormycosis Diabetic patients need to sugar levels when infected with Covid, if they don’t do it, chances of weakening of immune system increases Take proper care of oral hygiene as poor oral hygiene may increase chances of contracting mucormycosis Avoid prolonged and unnecessary use of antibiotics||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/27-of-admitted-mucor-patients-were-covid-positive-at-time-of-diagnosis/articleshow/83215502.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

At many places, temporary huts and roofs of houses were blown away because of the storm in addition to killing goats and sheep. Solar panels of power projects of many private companies have also been damaged or blown away. However, the rain has provided relief to villages facing water crisis. The storm started on Wednesday evening and continued till late night especially in Mohangarh, Nachna, Ramgarh, Sultana, Lathi, Chandhan, Khetolai and Ramdevra. Winds blew at 40-50 kmph uprooting trees and electricity poles. The storm affected the entire power system in border areas and electricity supply got disrupted in 100-125 villages and hamlets in Ramgarh border area. Jodhpur Discom’s Jaisalmer superintendent engineer Narendra Joshi said more than 1,100 power poles fell due to the storm. In rural areas, many poles of 11kv and 33kv collapsed. At Chandhan Pokaran and Sheo Undu, 132kv towers collapsed. Overall, the electricity department suffered a loss of nearly Rs 5 crore. Around 200 villages and hamlets in rural areas of Jaisalmer are in darkness and efforts are being made to restore power.

The foundation stone of one such plant was laid at Ringus community health centre (CHC) on Thursday. The health department is also taking measures to strengthen oxygen generation at its hospitals in urban areas. An oxygen plant will be inaugurated at city’s Jaipuria hospital, which has been installed with the help of Jaipur Citizen Forum (JCF). Chief minister Ashok Gehlot is expected to inaugurate the oxygen plant at the hospital through a virtual platform on Friday. JCF chairperson Rajiv Arora said they had made the announcement for the oxygen plant on May 3. The plant has been imported from Turkey. Arora said another plant with 2.5 times more capacity than Jaipuria Hospital’s plant will be set up at RUHS Hospital. Across the state, the health department is making efforts to enhance oxygen production by installing oxygen plants and by installing oxygen concentrators. As many as 350 community health centres have been identified by the health department, which will be developed in such a way that they will have facilities for Covid treatment including oxygen. For the purpose, health department is now making efforts to install oxygen generation plants or if it is not possible, it is ensuring that the CHCs should have sufficient number of oxygen concentrators and supply of oxygen cylinders. A health department official said they were developing facilities in rural areas so that patients with mild to moderate symptoms get the facilities at the CHCs. Officials said CHCs will be categorized into A, B and C and accordingly the facilities will be strengthened. According to the categories, healthcare facilities such as ICU beds, centralized oxygen supply system, oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators and medicines will be provided for the treatment of Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oxygen-generation-plant-to-be-inaugurated-at-jaipuria-hospital-today/articleshow/83215520.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Netas slam BMC over 34 Twitter handles, Rs 2 crore/year cost to run them||MUMBAI: After deputy CM Ajit Pawar scrapped a controversial decision to pay a private agency Rs 6 crore to handle his social media accounts over high costs, netas are urging the BMC to review its spending of close to Rs 2 crore a year for handling its social accounts, especially its 34 Twitter accounts. MLAs and corporators from across parties alleged that there was no technical analysis to gauge the reach and impact of @mybmc and the 33 other Twitter handles, many of which are not verified (see graphic). They want the new tender process to be fast-tracked and a new agency to be appointed. Times ViewThe BMC’s efforts to reach out to citizens via social media platforms like Twitter has been welcomed. However, the use of over 30 handles by the corporation has a confusing effect and runs the risk of communication overlap or contradictions in messaging. The BMC must have a more cohesive social media presence, especially since it is spending close to Rs 2 crore per year. There must be a detailed audit of the performance of its social media handles and the BMC must appoint an agency through a transparent and competent tender process.In July 2019, the BMC, without floating a tender, awarded a Rs 5.8-crore contract to S2 Infotech International Ltd to manage the 34 Twitter handles till July 2022. “We didn’t float a tender as Maha IT Corporation gave the contract to S2 Infotech Inte-rnational, which, in turn, sub-contracted the work to another firm,” a civic official said. “Around 35 staffers, including designers and content creators, were deployed at wards and departments, to manage the handles.” While S2 Infotech International did not respond to TOI, BMC chief I S Chahal said the standing committee’s nod was obtained to use social media platforms to generate awareness about initiatives and services. This, he added, enabled the BMC to have “its own breaking news space and bust fake information in real-time”. “Active campaign posts, regular interactions and real-time redressals of complaints have increased BMC’s Twitter presence from 35,000 followers in July 2019 to 550.5 thousand now,” Chahal said. “In fact, during the first Covid wave, since the Twitter account was overloaded with queries and concerns, an Instagram account was created; it has 235 thousand followers.” He added that to “enhance the management of social media and other digital PR”, BMC floated a tender in March, but the deadline has been extended from June 10 to July 5 as the online system will be shut do-wn for an upgrade. “The new agency will be appointed throu-gh this tender process,” he said. But SP MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said while Mumbai Police has only one Twitter handle @MumbaiPolice, the BMC has 34, which has increased costs and led to confusion. Cybersecurity expert Ritesh Bhatia concurred. “A large population is not on Twitter in the first place... To connect with citizens, the BMC must have only one handle. Having so many unverified handles leads to confusion and this can be exploited by fake accounts to peddle false information,” he said. Shaikh wrote to Chahal: “A tender for appointing a new agency was floated, but certain agencies, who have created a social media mafia in BMC, are trying to block it. I urge you to direct the disaster management to cancel the contract... and give directions for the new tender to be finalised...” BJP MLA Ameet Satam and BJP corporator Vinod Mishra have also written to Chahal asking him to fast-track the new tender process. “The BMC must get an audit done to see its performance compared with other agencies. We will file a complaint with the Lokayukta,” Satam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-netas-slam-bmc-over-34-twitter-handles-rs-2cr/yr-cost-to-run-them/articleshow/83217669.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Three people were killed in a wall collapse due to the downpour in Gadhinglaj tehsil of Kolhapur district in the afternoon. No loss of life or property has been reported from Marathwada yet. The Kolhapur district disaster management office said Girija Kamble (32), Sangita Kamble (38) and Ajit Kamble (42) were caught in the rain in Mugali village of Gadhinglaj and had taken shelter next to the concrete wall of a poultry farm. Around 2.30 pm, the wall collapsed during the rains, killing all three. Several parts of Kolhapur and Sangli districts received continuous heavy rain for over three hours, damaging many properties and uprooting trees. Officials said Kolhapur district reported around 50mm rainfall. The IMD has predicted more heavy showers for the next couple of days. Weather expert Shantanu Patil said, “The rains were due to a low pressure area that had developed along the west coast. Strong westerlies too helped the moisture insurgence, aiding cloud formation.” Meanwhile, Chikalthana and some areas around Aurangabad city, along with seven other revenue circles, reported heavy rainfall of over 65mm in the 24-hour period ending Thursday morning. More rain is in store for the city and parts of Marathwada, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting rainfall in the afternoon or evening over the next couple of days. As per official data, Chikalthana area reported 67mm rain, whereas the Vihamandwa circle in Paithan taluka recorded 77mm. Two revenue circles in Majalgaon and one in Georai taluka of Beed district reported rainfall in the range of 70-80mm. Two circles in Parbhani — Shelgaon (108mm) in Sonpeth taluka, and one circle in Parbhani district — also reported heavy showers. Marathwada, comprising eight districts, has recorded an average of 25mm rainfall so far in June, which accounts for 189% of the normal showers. Aurangabad district has reported an average 33mm rainfall since June 1, which is 264% of normal. While the disaster management authorities have reported no loss of lives or property in Marathwada, the pre-monsoon showers have transformed the weather conditions. At 33 degrees celsius, the minimum temperature in Aurangabad was below normal by 5.3 units. The city recorded a minimum of 20.5 degree celsius, which is also below the normal by 4.2 units, revealed the IMD data. Kolhapur flight services disrupted Heavy rain also led to poor visibility at the Kolhapur airport. A flight carrying passengers from Hyderabad had to circle above the airport for over an hour. However, as the poor visibility continued, the flight had to return to Hyderabad. There were also visibility issues at the airport in Belagavi. Kamalkumar Kataria, the Kolhapur airport director, said, “Only one flight could operate from the Kolhapur airport in the morning. The remaining flight services had to be halted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-die-in-wall-collapse-as-heavy-rain-lashes-kolhapur-mwada/articleshow/83211799.cms||---
---||Chennai||Funding a future for folk art forms||Chennai: In the 10 years that gaana singer Muthu has been performing, he hasn’t seen a moment like this. People are dying by the hundreds, and, tragically, the call of the oppari and gaana that mark farewell processions, has also died. The pandemic is threatening to wipe out carefully-preserved traditions. “A friend of mine, also a gaana singer, took up work at a construction site after months of no performances. Not knowing the ways of this job, he suffered a steep fall and died,” says Muthu. With a comprehensive plan to help survive the crisis, independent musician-producer Tenma, arts development consultant and entrepreneur Shreya Nagarajan and Gaana Muthu have started a fundraiser to cover about 1,000 disenfranchised folk artists across TN, Telangana and Karnataka. “Sometime mid-May we did an audit asking folk communities in Madurai, Kancheepuram and North Chennai what their needs are. Based on this, we’re providing provisions, baby food and sanitary napkins. Based on specific requirements, we even give cash,” says Shreya. “We’re providing care packages in phases, so that they have enough to sustain them through the coming months.” By Wednesday night, the fundraiser – supported by patrons around the world, nationally and locally – had reached Rs 1,453,101 of the estimated Rs 2,000,000, benefiting gaana, karagattam, melam, chindu yaksha ganam, drama and puppetry artists. In the coming days, they plan to host events such as coffee tasting and an auction of heirloom saris to further fund the cause. The team also wants to boost work opportunities for disadvantaged artists. “The impact of a demoralised artist goes way beyond loss of work; it pushes them to leave the art form that has been the centre of their lives, become depressed and discourages their children to take it up. I foresee 2-3 genres of folk forms getting wiped out by the end of this pandemic,” says Tenma. He said he thinks having a year of carefully curated physical shows is the definite way to salvage the situation. Shreya says: “Opening up public spaces, creating more paid opportunities, giving artists access to funding, grants, stipends and health insurance, are ways the government can help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/funding-a-future-for-folk-art-forms/articleshow/83207392.cms||---

The accused, identified as Mohammed Azharuddin alias Waqil (21), is a resident of Jogabai extension in Jamia Nagar. He had got a tip-off from the businessman’s ex-driver, after which they executed the crime by sending their aide posing as a courier boy. “The prime accused was declared a proclaimed offender by the court. A reward of Rs 25,000 was also declared for his arrest,” DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha said. Azharuddin was arrested by inspector Ishwar Singh and others.

According to ‘Invisibility Amplified: A report on the impact of COVID-19 on intersex people in Asia’, while more than 40% of the people surveyed didn’t get directly affected by Covid-19, an alarming number of people didn’t see a doctor despite having Covid-19 symptoms. “Around 9% didn’t meet or consult a doctor due to the trauma they had suffered in a medical institution in the past as sex assignment surgeries are performed on intersex children,” says Prashant Singh, coordinator, Intersex Asia, and one of the authors of the survey. More than 7% of respondents did not receive the necessary treatment because of the discriminatory behaviour of healthcare workers, the report said. While around 9% got tested for Covid-19, only 7% went to a doctor. Many others reported refusal of healthcare professionals to provide them with the required care as they were intersex. Another 17% didn’t see medical help due to other reasons. The survey was conducted from September to October 2020. “The pandemic has had a huge impact on the intersex community. But none of the studies that were done captured the unique challenges faced by the intersex community or their experiences, so the international intersex community decided to study the impact of the pandemic region-wise,” says Hiker Chiu, executive director, Intersex Asia. To understand the impact of the pandemic, the survey focussed on different aspects – physical and mental health; and wellbeing, access to education, financial situation, housing, travel, personal safety, intersex activism. More than 65% of respondents stated that Covid–19 has exacerbated their economic vulnerability. Apart from finances, health (28%), mental health (46%), education (37%), and employment (43%) are other areas of their lives that have been impacted by the pandemic.  Intersex activist Gopi Shankar Madurai, who helped framed the questionnaire, says, “Since intersex people have unique medical challenges, the government also need to give priority to vaccinating community members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/intersex-people-with-symptoms-reluctant-to-seek-medical-aid/articleshow/83207413.cms||Priya Menon
---||Hyderabad||High court pulls up Telangana for claims on farmers giving up land||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday found fault with the state government and Siddipet district collector for raking up a 70-year-old ‘razinama’ (resignation) clause in the Land Revenue Act and taking away assigned land from poor farmers. The court also questioned as to why the government was claiming that the farmers had voluntarily given up their land at a time when they were desperately fighting to get back their land. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy asked the government to come up with instances of farmers giving up their land in the last 70 years under the razinama clause. The judges were hearing an appeal of farmer Balagoni Sai Kiran and three others of Duddeda village in Siddipet’s Kondapaka mandal who were dispossessed. The government took away six acres of assigned land from the four farmers and gave it to Yaprala Narasimha Reddy and a few others after their land was taken away for constructing double bedroom houses for the poor elsewhere. The high court took the matter seriously in the last hearing and had sought an explanation from the district collector. Counsel for the farmers, H Venugopal, said the authorities did not even issue notices to the farmers before forcibly dispossessing them. “The farmers are poor and they had never resigned (relinquished) from their land as claimed by the state government,” he said. He also said: “It is unfair to say that they relinquished their land voluntarily. It is a fraud played on them by the district administration.” The judges observed that the action of the officers was ‘unfortunate’ and ‘ uncalled for’. “Why should the state government give this land to another land loser after taking it away from the poor? It amounts to stealing,” the judges said and adjourned the case to July 22. Earlier in the day when the hearing resumed, state’s special counsel Harender Pershad informed the court that the state government had decided to provide a suitable compensation to the farmers. The collector would soon call them, he said. At this, the judges told him that the farmers were entitled to receive compensation under the provisions of the new Land Acquisition Act. “You (government) have to pay them at current rates. And let the collector go to them instead of calling the farmers,” the judges said. The judges said the rules under the new Act allow the collectors to negotiate with the farmers directly on the quantum of compensation to be paid. “Discuss with them on June 10,” the judges said, directing the state counsel to inform this to the collector. Venugopal said the dispossessed farmers were ready to go and meet the collector on June 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-pulls-up-t-for-claims-on-farmers-giving-up-land/articleshow/83215549.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Trade licence proof for retail workers in Kolkata||KOLKATA: After health workers, IT and ITeS professionals who are asked to show their identity cards at checkpoints, cops are asking the workers of retail stores to carry a photocopy of the trade licence and an authorisation from the store owners. The retail stores have been allowed to operate from 12 to 3pm. On Thursday, some retail store workers complained that they had been detained multiple times at checkpoints and questioned why they had ventured out during the restrictions. The problem, they said, could have been solved, had the police issued e-passes to them. The problem was highlighted on the Kolkata Police social media handles. “Please clarify if retail store owners and their workers, who are allowed to operate between 12pm to 3pm, will require vehicle e-pass to commute in their personal vehicles. This is because public transport is almost nil,” tweeted Nagendra Pagaria. Another shop owner, Sitangshu Kumar, highlighted the technical glitches faced while trying to apply for e-pass. While documents have to be uploaded to justify the need for a pass, the photograph has to be less than 100kb size, a difficult proposition since basic phone cameras take photographs of higher resolution. Till now, cops have issued very few e-passes. Cops in Lalbazar said that the retail owners need to produce some proof of ownership like trade licence. The workers can carry a declaration from the owner concerned along with the photocopy of the trade licence. “If the workers carry a reliable proof that they are employed in retail shops, we will allow them to commute for the first few days,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Those working in restaurants will also have to produce proof similarly when they are allowed to operate for three hours in the evening. “Those working in restaurants might not always be able to reach home by 9pm when the strict restrictions are in place. It is important that they carry relevant documents,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trade-licence-proof-for-retail-workers/articleshow/83215607.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The major dams in the district currently have around 40% stock of live water that can be brought to use for various purposes. Considering the erratic nature of monsoon, the irrigation department has ensured that adequate stock is maintained in the dams. Usually, the demand for water from the dams is high during summer. The irrigation department struggles to keep adequate quantity after the release of water for irrigation. For three months, the usage of water from the river is high and the department has to release water from the dams. Mahesh Surve, superintendent engineer of water resources department, said, even if there are dry spells in June, the district will not be water scarce due to adequate stock in the dams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dams-have-enough-stock/articleshow/83211866.cms||---

Many residents say that after the end of the GHMC elections, no development work took place in Old City except patch works and desilting, with officials citing lack of budget. Overflowing drains in localities and the piles of garbage along roadsides is a common sight. Moreover, many residents say that the old and dilapidated buildings, outdated drains, bad roads, dangling cables from trees could prove to be a nuisance in case of heavy downpour. “Long-pending issues are yet to be addressed, otherwise people would suffer again with waterlogging, overflowing drains and flooded houses like last year,” said Anwar, a resident of Yakutpura. A dug up road at Mustaidpura area is causing inconvenience to motorists. “Shastripuram, Kishanbagh, Vattepally, Chandrayangutta, Yakutpura, Chowk, Bahadurpura and other flood-prone areas must be inspected and a proper mechanism must be introduced before monsoon,” said Mohammed Ahmed, TDP, GHMC minority vice-president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pending-civic-works-a-cause-for-concern-for-old-city-residents/articleshow/83215594.cms||---

Following a tip off, two kingpins identified as Bharat Krishna Kate and Pandit Pawar were apprehended from Solapur on Tuesday, along with ample evidence, by a team from the crime branch. These touts were charging Rs 4 lakhs to 5 lakhs from the aspiring candidates giving them false promises for their selection in government services. The innocent aspirants were made to believe about their selection through fake call letters, admit cards, joining letters, medicals and training at dubious locations. The duo are part of a bigger racket spanning entire country, which is being probed by the crime branch and Army. According to sources, the module had recently hosted a fake website of Territorial Army with names of selected candidates uploaded on it. The aspirants were not only charged for their selection, but also were made to bear the expenses of travel, boarding and lodging during their trips to different dubious locations for fraudulent written exams, medical tests and training post the fraudulent recruitment. It may be noted that a similar racket had been bust by the Army in a recruitment rally in Udaipur in February this year and two persons had been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/fake-job-racket-busted-2-held/articleshow/83217617.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Heavy rain lashes districts, water enters houses in Chandur||HYDERABAD: Heavy rains lashed several districts of the state in the early hours of Thursday with the onset of southwest monsoon in Kerala. Bejgao in Siddipet district received very heavy rainfall of 12.2 cm, Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) said. Hyderabad Meteorological Centre has forecast rains in several parts of Telangana till June 6. Rivulets and streams overflowed, while paddy kept in paddy procurement centres at several places was damaged. Vegetables floated in the water in Mahabubabad town market even as electricity supply was affected in some places. Rainwater entered houses in Chandur mandal headquarters in Nalgonda district, while streams gushed onto roads in Nampally town. The premises of Yadadri temple was flooded, affecting the early morning ‘Suprabhatha Seva.’ Narayanpet, Jogulamba Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Nagarkurnool, Mahbubnagar, Vikarabad, Sangareddy, Nalgonda, Khammam, Rangareddy, Hyderabad, Medchal Malkajgiri and other districts received rains. Farmers who brought their produce and kept them at IKP centres for procurement were badly hit as the paddy was soaked in rain. Farmers said this was the second time that paddy had got wet as it had rained three days ago. Some farmers said it had been several weeks since they had bought paddy to the market yards and were waiting for it to be procured. The sudden heavy downpour in Mahabubabad town resulted in water stagnation at the vegetable market as large quantities of vegetables floated in the waters with growers running around and trying to retrieve them in the rain. Except for Miryalaguda and Neredugommu mandals which received deficient rainfall and Chityala which received excess rain, there was large excess rain in 28 other mandals in Nalgonda district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/heavy-rain-lashes-dists-water-enters-houses-in-chandur/articleshow/83215578.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Nagpur||Consider plea to skip registration to import mucor drug: Bombay HC||NAGPUR: With a view to increase availability of black fungus drug Amphotericin-B which is currently in short supply, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) asked the central government to consider city companies’ request to do away with the mandatory Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) registration for importing the medicine and its raw material. The directives came after Hingna pharmaceutical company Unijules Life Sciences wrote a letter to HC on May 31 about the difficulty it faced in procuring raw material for manufacturing the medicine, or for importing it directly. The letter submitted by amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar also referred to similar troubles faced by another interested firm Arco Life-Sciences (I). A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said, “On going through its contents, it appears that major hurdles that these interested importers are facing are in respect of the delay at level of DCGI in granting registration to the private players. We request the Centre to actively consider the prayers made in the letter, a copy of which be supplied to assistant solicitor general of India (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar.” The judges further directed to take a decision in this regard before the next hearing and submit the outcome. “We’re hopeful that some solution will be found, as the goal of this court is in communion with the government's objective, with the patient being at the centre of focus.” They further noted that in such a serious situation, some public-spirited importers from the city had come forward with a helping hand. “According to these private importers, who are willing to make the raw material available to the Indian manufacturers, if these hurdles are cleared, our society will substantially save itself from its present crisis.” The Centre had filed a pursis (a written statement) on May 27 stating that to augment Amphotericin-B’s production, DCGI had actively coordinated with the industry for identification of the manufacturers of alternative drugs and for the expeditious approval of new manufacturing facilities. The bench, however, pointed out that the pursis doesn’t say anything about expeditious grant of registration to the Indian importers. “A request has been made by these two importers that the procedure for obtaining DCGI registration for importing drugs or raw material required for its production within India should be done away with, at least during the pandemic situation. They demanded that these powers be delegated to the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) department of individual states.” Maharashtra, Nagpur not getting enough Amphotericin-B from Centre: HCThe HC bench observed that Maharashtra, and Nagpur in particular, have very high prevalence of mucormycosis infection and hence are in crying need of Amphotericin-B injections. “Despite there being so many patients in the state — major part of which are in Nagpur — it is not getting enough vials for their treatment because of deficit allocation and short supply of Amphotericin-B to state.” The judges added that the situation could be improved if there was sensible allocation of the drug. “This is already known to the Centre. But the response appears to be not on the expected lines.” The bench reiterated that as patients are losing lives due to these dreaded infections, urgent steps and relief are required. “This is a war-like situation for the state of Maharashtra and in particular, the city of Nagpur, which calls for rapid response and a mighty one. We hope that these entreaties would be positively answered by the Centre and if not, loss of lives of a few more patients, unfortunate as it may be, may be a fait accompli.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/consider-plea-to-skip-regn-to-import-mucor-drug-hc/articleshow/83215650.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: YSR Jagananna housing colonies to house 30 lakh families||AMAARAVATI: Housing minister Cherukuvada Sriranganatha Raju on Thursday said that YSR Jagananna housing colonies will create Rs.4 lakh crore worth assets in the state. He said that no state government has launched a housing programme for the poor on such a massive scale in the country. Speaking after chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy laid the foundation stone for the housing project on virtual mode on Thursday, the minister said that distribution of house sites to about 30 lakh poor families was a historic development in the country. He said that they could successfully complete the programme only due to the chief minister’s dedication and commitment. “Several evil forces, such as opposition TDP leaders, made every attempt to stall the distribution of house sites to the poor for over a year. We kept our promise due to the sheer guts displayed by the chief minister,” said Sriranganatha Raju. He said that they have started the housing programme in the plots distributed to the poor to create about 17,000 massive housing colonies. Ajay Jain, special chief secretary (housing), said that the foundation laying ceremonies would be continued in districts for about a week in adherence to Covid-19 protocols. He said that the chief minister has agreed to create a new post of joint collector to oversee the housing programme. He said that they would complete all the 31 lakh houses by 2023. A beneficiary, Anasuri Durga of Alamur village in East Godavari district, told the chief minister that she got the house site in the layout next only to local tehsildar office which could cost around Rs 10 lakh. “I have not dreamt of getting own house as we are so poor. We got the plot and house only because of your kindness,” she told the chief minister. She said that her 70-year old father got elderly pension only after YS Jagan became chief minister. Another beneficiary, Amaravati of Punganur village in Chittoor district, requested the chief minister to visit her house for housewarming function. She promised the chief minister that she would complete the construction by Dasara festival. Gandham Aparanjani, of Marteru in West Godavari district, said she got her plot and house sanctioned without meeting any leader as village volunteers knocked on her door and completed the process. She said that they survived Covid-19 only due to the state’s welfare schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagananna-colonies-to-house-30-lakh-families/articleshow/83213779.cms||Samdani MN

And only 88 out of the 911 people with severe disabilities have agreed to take the shots with the GCC. “I am the only earning member of my family. If something happens to me, who will take care of them?” asked T Gnanajothi, an accountant who has cerebral palsy. Gnanajothi lives with his wife and son, who is also disabled, and refused to get the shot when the health workers came to enquire. “Vaccine hesitancy is high amongst the general public, and maybe more among those with disabilities. The authorities should’ve started spreading awareness, six months ago, when we got the vaccines. But it’s not too late now,” said S Namburajan, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of All Types of Differently Abled and Caregivers. Namburajan said the state must also have a doctor as part of the helpline team. “A doctor will help clarify doubts and this might increase the number of people agreeing to take the vaccine,” he said. The corporation now vaccinates at home those availing themselves of maintenance allowance from the state. But activists say many more people with disabilities need this service. Smitha Sadasivan, Disability Rights Alliance TN, said people with different kinds of developmental and intellectual disabilities, who have been staying home for more than a year, may get confused, scared, or triggered environmentally if they are brought out all of a sudden to a public setting. “Many persons with disabilities need personalised support in movement, transportation, etc.”. Smitha has submitted to the government a list of more than 200 such people who need vaccination at home. “70 of them got the shots at home, we are waiting for others to get ,” she said. Officials from the differently abled department said, "Locally, zonal officers of corporation go to people’s houses on their own initiative. And we also connect them to experts for clarification." Persons with disabilities can call the helpline 18004250111 and video call helpline 9700799993, to schedule vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/less-than-20-of-disabled-people-willing-to-take-jabs/articleshow/83207425.cms||Aditi R

Upon the request from the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), the water resources department initiated discharge from the Radhanagari dam. Around 800 cusec of water was released from the dam for several hours to attain the required level at the barrages. Ajay Salokhe, the chief hydraulic engineer of KMC said, “Normal water supply has resumed. We started the pumps as soon as the water level started rising. The water level was low due to the leakage from the barrage. We are repairing the barrage, which is time-consuming and risky. We have supplied water tankers to the affected areas.” Every year the city faces water cuts once or twice due to the decline of the water level in the river. The only way to fix is to repair the leakages. The barrage panels, which is over 20 years old, need to be replaced. Till now, the minor repair works are being carried out. Salokhe said the plan to replace the old structure with a new one is ready, but the work can start only after the monsoon. It takes time for the water to reach the pumping stations. The dam has automatic gates and the water can be released only from the powerhouse section, which has limited discharge capacity. Salokhe said to ensure the water reaches on time and the water level at pumping stations attains an adequate level, the irrigation department was communicated early.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/water-supply-to-kolhapur-city-resumes-on-thursday/articleshow/83211911.cms||---

They have been asked to finalise the list of dilapidated structures in each circle and prepare a final list in respective circles. “In case of the most dangerous structures, advance precautionary measures shall be taken, such as vacation of inmates, sealing of building, barricading around the structure and displaying notices cautioning public not to move around the structure,” the circular signed by the commissioner read. In case of non-compliance by the owners, the officials will issue notices as per GHMC Act and action will be initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-to-identify-old-buildings/articleshow/83215764.cms||---

But these mass plantation drives are conducted without any proper study, which is turning out to be a threat to the local biodiversity. Environmentalists have urged the people to study the flora and fauna first and then select the plant for plantation according to its habitat. Umakant Chavan, nature researcher and founder of Sahyadri Sanvardhan Kendra said, “Tree plantation is good but the plant suited in the rainforest, grassland, urban or in farmlands needs to be studied first. Instead of planting saplings, it should be planted at places where trees have already been cut.” Amol Jadhav, a member of the Nature Conservation Society from Sangli said, “Foxes, hyenas, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies and grassland birds are habitats of grasslands. The lizards and Geckos lay their eggs in the soil creeks. Grassland is not a space to plant any sapling. If trees suited for rainforests grow on grasslands, dense forest animals will start migrating over there, then where will the foxes, hyenas go? Around 10 years ago, as part of a plantation drive, the forest department had largely planted Gliricidia sepium, a flowering plant, in the Dandoba hill region in Sangli and Ramling region in Kolhapur. Now the plant has grown like a wildfire blocking the growth of other plants. This plant is also known as rat repellent and the high count of such plants made the rats in the area migrate to human habitats and with rats being snakes’ food, snakes too have started migrating to human habitats, said Jadhav. Dr. Madhukar Bachulkar, a botanist said exotic and foreign plant species are planted by the forest department in their drives for tree plantation and it is shocking. Few tips for plantationDifferent plants species must be taken and a single plant monopoly should be avoided. Mostly Indian plants like banyan, peepal etc should be preferred for plantation. The plant must be selected upon the water content in the soil and its geographical location. The traditional method should be used. Grassland and plateaus should never be considered for plantation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/study-the-flora-fauna-before-plantation-drive/articleshow/83211991.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

While several foreign universities have made vaccination compulsory for all incoming students, states like Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra (Mumbai) have announced that doses will be reserved for these students at vaccine centres. But there is no such policy in Chennai or other parts of Tamil Nadu. Given the vaccine shortage, many students return home without getting jabs even after queuing up for long. While some have struggled to get the first dose at private hospitals, the long gap between doses has left many fearing whether they would get it before flying abroad. Vaibhav Singh, co-founder of Leap which offers financial services to Indian students wanting to pursue higher education abroad, said, “Many students who were supposed to start their classes last year deferred it to this year, hoping to be able to attend offline classes. The second wave added more uncertainty to their plans.” Now that countries like the US are opening up flights for international students, or allowing vaccinated students to attend classes; students will be able to attend classes in-person. Helping them with priority vaccinations will be a great move to allow them to start degrees in the Fall of 2021, he said. Many others are facing issues with visa appointments. Some foreign consulates in Chennai are closed and are not accepting regular and even expedited appointment (EA) requests. “I haven’t slept properly for weeks now because of the anxiety surrounding the visa process,” said a student, who got his PhD admission in the spring of 2021, requesting anonymity. He deferred his admission to the Fall because he was unable to get an appointment till November. His programme starts on September 1. Alekya Kastury, an engineer from Chennai, said further delay in appointments will impact their travel plans. “It is going to be a situation in which we will be entering classes as soon as we land,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/graduates-flying-abroad-in-fix-over-vaccine-shortage/articleshow/83207453.cms||Ram Sundaram

Some of the parboiled units replied to the NGT and said they were operating as per the norms. Petitioner Naveen Kumar Jalagam alleged that the parboiled rice units were causing air and water pollution by emitting pollutants and discharging untreated effluents in Komarabanda and surrounding areas. “Thick black smoke, dust and ash are let out from the industries which are getting deposited in the air and water. Groundwater quality has been affected. These units are supposed to have effluent treatment plants and should comply with zero liquid discharge system,” he said. The TSPCB inspected the units in June 2019 and found that they were not complying with the pollution norms. The PCB issued closure orders and disconnection of electricity. However, the industries didn’t comply with the orders and continued to operate. Opposing this, residents of KLR Avenue apartments in Kodad said the dust from the mills was polluting the atmosphere. Residents of Salarjungpeta also raised objections. The NGT, which took up the case on April 8 this year, asked the PCB to submit an action taken report and directed it to conduct a ground water analysis and an ambient air quality test. The collector was also asked to file an independent report on the units’ unauthorised functioning despite a closure order issued by TSPCB. The Kodad Rice Millers Association has filed a reply with the National Green Tribunal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngt-notice-to-pcb-on-parboiled-units-pollution/articleshow/83215478.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Large chunk of house help, drivers vaccinated in housing society camps||MUMBAI: Lower Parel’s 36-storey Marathon Era society on Thursday held a vaccination camp which was open to all its 236 flat members. Interestingly, of the 400 who turned up for their shots, merely 100 were residents while 300 were support staff such as house help and drivers. At the three 38-storey Ashford Royale towers in Nahur, too, in a drive on Thursday, almost 200 of the 500 doses were given to support staff who either live with the residents or visit as part-time house help. Society members from these two gated communities said several flat owners would feel safer if their staff is vaccinated within their own premises rather than a government centre where they would have no control on social distancing. That apart, as most of the house help is in the age group of 18-44 years, they were unable to find a slot anywhere. Bhavik Shah, committee member of Marathon Era society, said, “We had tied up with a private hospital from where we managed to get 400 vaccine doses. Three hundred of these doses were administered to drivers and part-time help on a cricket turf within our own premises. Local residents paid for the vaccine doses given to their help as they were not comfortable sending them outside to civic vaccination centres. Many among the house help who were reluctant to get vaccinated came forward on seeing the drive being carried out in the premises itself,” said Shah, adding residents paid Rs 1,200 per dose. Several residents in these highrises have already got vaccinated through their offices as large corporates have started their own drives. At Nahur’s Ashford Royale, Balan Narayanan said, “Some 200 doses were administered to house help and drivers of residents. We plan to have another drive especially for the security staff. Our complex has a lot of people in the 18-44 year age group who were able to take advantage of this drive as vaccination for this group is shut in civic centres.” Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha said in several drives held in complexes in his constituency, including Runwal Anthurium and Atmosphere, as many as 30% of those vaccinated were support staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-large-chunk-of-house-help-drivers-vaccinated-in-hsg-society-camps/articleshow/83211849.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Housing secretary S V R Srinivas to take over as MMRDA chief from R A Rajeev||MUMBAI: Housing secretary S V R Srinivas will be the new MMRDA commissioner in place of R A Rajeev whose extended three-month tenure ended on May 31. Rajeev was scheduled to retire on February 28 but was given a three-month extension. Srinivas, an IAS officer of the 1991 batch, had worked in MMRDA previously as additional commissioner. There was buzz in the corridors of power that Rajeev would be given an extension of one year. Following objections by a section of senior cabinet members and bureaucrats, though, he was given a threemonth extension. There was a proposal to give him a further extension of nine months. It was dropped, though, following a strongly worded letter from textiles minister Aslam Shaikh, who had raised a red flag over the state government’s extension policy. Shaikh’s contention was that as a principle, the government should not give extensions to retiring bureaucrats, as it results in great injustice to serving bureaucrats. Along with Rajeev, Shaikh had taken objection to the extension granted to Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) managing director Radheshyam Mopalwar and the appointment of veteran bureaucrat V K Gautam as an officer of special duty (OSD) in the water resources department. There was no information on whether Mopalwar has been given a fresh extension after his extended term expired on May 31. “Extension to retiring bureaucrats has a demoralising effect on serving bureaucrats. It also maligns the image of the government as it can be easily construed that such extensions are given on the basis of some consideration for doing work beyond the ambit of rules,” said Shaikh in his letter. Along with Srinivas, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has shifted more than half a dozen bureaucrats. General administration secretary Lokesh Chandra will be the new general manager of BEST in place of Suresh Bagde, who has taken up central deputation. Vikas Chandra Rastogi has been posted in the general administration department. Sicom managing director B Venugopal Reddy will be the new forest secretary. Shrikar Pardeshi, who was in the Prime Minister’s Office for a prolonged period, will be the new managing director of Sicom. Forest secretary Milind Mhaiskar has been posted as housing secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-housing-secretary-srinivas-to-take-over-as-mmrda-chief-from-rajeev/articleshow/83210838.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The facility will be part of the transport department’s ‘faceless services’. From February 18, the transport department has been providing 12 of its most transaction-heavy services totally online. As part of the next phase of its faceless services, e-licence for learners would be provided. Applicants will first have to register on the department’s website and get an appointment to take the test. There will be an online tutorial for them to go through. The 10 minute learner’s licence test has objective type questions and the applicant needs to score at least six out of ten marks. This will be followed by a colour-blindness test online, on clearing which an e-licence will be issued. “The purpose of the learner’s licence test is to see if the applicant understands the basic rules so they can learn driving and that is why an online test would suffice. Delhi will become the first state in India to issue such an e-licence,” an official said. “During the lockdown, we have been working on this project and expect to launch it as soon as restrictions are lifted,” he said. The department’s website would have a dedicated web link for the e-licence service and all information regarding fees, minimum age, eligibility, necessary documents, etc. will be available on the website, apart from frequently asked questions and a question bank with quizzes. “The time is not far when the transport department’s physical presence would be limited just to the automated driving test tracks as all services will eventually go completely online,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/click-for-a-learners-licence-instead-of-visiting-an-rto/articleshow/83217714.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The shifting of the prisoners began , with state director general of jails Rajiv Trivedi flagging off the vehicle moving the inmates. On the first day, 119 prisoners—80 male convicts and 39 women inmates—were shifted to Cherlapally jail and Chanchalguda prison. The Central jail housed 957 prisoners, of which 612 were convicted, and 345 are under trial. Speaking to the media, Rajiv Trivedi said: “As per the cabinet decision, we are handing over the Warangal Central Jail to the government. Those under trial are being moved to nearby jails and we are seeking permission from the court to shift the remand prisoners. High security prisoners will be shifted to Hyderabad. Within a fortnight, all prisoners will be shifted and staff will be transferred,” Trivedi Said.  After completion of the land acquisition process by revenue officials, authorities will start the construction of a new modern jail, the completion of which will take two years. At a cabinet meeting, CM K Chandrashekar Rao had directed jail authorities to hand over the campus to the health department within a month. Santhosh Kumar Roy, central prison superintendent, said that all security measures were taken while shifting the prisoners to various prisons across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/super-specialty-hosp-to-come-up-in-place-of-nizam-era-jail/articleshow/83215664.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

It was also the biggest ever monthly fine collected by Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) since its inception in December 2017. The cumulative fine collected by the NDS in the first five months of 2021 stands at Rs 3.26 crore, revealed NMC’s data. Despite a spike in Covid-19 cases and 35 civic cops testing positive, the 180-odd NDS members were on their toes since the outbreak of pandemic in March 2020 to ensure strict implementation of the rules. As per NMC data, the number of offenders caught daily has declined drastically. The civic officials attribute this to the restrictions in movement under ‘break the chain’ rules. But the fine amount has substantially increased. Offenders — mostly shopkeepers — were caught violating Covid protocols, said an NDS official. In January, the NDS team penalized 5,792 offenders for civic nuisance and violation of protocols and recovered Rs 44.84 lakh fine. In February, it recovered Rs 75.26 lakh fine from 7,337 violators. With a spike in Covid cases in February, NMC re-imposed certain restrictions, including weekend lockdown. This brought down the number of violators, but the fine amount remained almost unchanged. In March, the NDS team caught 5,212 violators and recovered Rs 70.50 lakh fine from them. In April, when far stricter restrictions were in place, the number of violators dropped and the NDS recovered Rs 53.65 lakh fine from 2,557 persons. With the extension of curbs in May, the number of violators reduced drastically but the fine amount increased substantially, said NDS chief Viresen Tambe. Most offenders caught last month were penalized for violating Covid-19 protocols. So, from 2,306 violators, the NDS team recovered Rs 82,48,700. When NDS began functioning in December 2017, it collected a fine of over Rs 4.27 lakh in its first month. In 2018, the fine amount rose to over Rs 1.53 crore. The number of cases in the 2020 increased by almost four times from 17,371 in 2019 to 63,239 cases. So, the fine amount too saw a corresponding rise from Rs 2.02 crore (in 2019) to Rs 5.03 crore (in 2020). Now, in five months this year, it has already collected Rs 3.26 crore fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nds-collects-rs82-48l-fine-in-may-most-in-a-month/articleshow/83215722.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

According to the police, Shivani Gohil was in a relationship with Milan Parmar, a resident of Anand, for the last three years. Last year she got married to Raju Gohil who stays in Angadh village. Despite getting married to Gohil, she continued her relationship with Parmar.

Gohil wanted Parmar to apologize for his acts but the duo got into a brawl during the meeting,” said ACP Bakul Chaudhary. Gohil got angry and hit Parmar on the head with a stick leaving him injured. After Parmar fell down, Shivani fed him some pesticide and the two dragged him out of their house. Parmar was accompanied by his friend Dharmendra Kumar who was waiting for him at a nearby place. When Parmar took too long to return, Dharmendra tried to contact him over the phone. Parmar somehow managed to walk up to Dharmendra Kumar who immediately called 108 emergency services. Parmar was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him dead.

---||Mumbai||20% of oxygen can be diverted to industries: Health department||MUMBAI: For the past two days, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government has stopped importing oxygen from other states. On Wednesday, the state public health department issued a notification allowing units manufacturing oxygen in the state to divert 20% of the production to industries. The notification, though, underlined that priority would be given to hospitals over industries, if need arises. The notification states in the last week of May, the Covid-19 recovery rate was much higher than the infection rate and the total requirement of oxygen had reduced. Avinash Dhakne, state transport commissioner, said since the past one week, import of oxygen from other states has drastically reduced. “For the past 7-8 days, we have been importing less than 60 metric tonne of oxygen per day from the Reliance plant at Jamnagar, though our allotted quota is 120 metric tonne per day. The 60 metric tonne is provided free of cost but there are issues of storage as demand has gone down and so we have stopped import,” he said. Sandeep Belsare, president, Pimpri Chinchwad Small Industries Association, said MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) have been without oxygen for 45 days. Even essential industries could not get it as the process to prove they are essential was tedious. The closure of MSMEs also hit large auto industries that had to cut back on production and go for block closures. The decision to partially restore oxygen supply would help units restart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-20-of-o2-can-be-diverted-to-industries-says-health-dept/articleshow/83211457.cms||Clara Lewis

The SP, in his message, has appealed to the people to refrain from chatting or communicating via video calls with unidentified women as such women could later cheat them. “There have been cases where people create accounts on various social media platforms like Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, dating apps, etc in name of women. In such cases people are lured into friendship and indulge in lewd activities that are video-taped only to make demand of extortion,” Patil said. “On most occasions, such accounts are handled by men who trap gullible people and victimize them. An FIR has been lodged in his jurisdiction and a few complaint letters have also been received by various police stations wherein men have been been threatened of dire consequences if they did not pay the extortion amount,” he added. All the complaints are being investigated. “Nonetheless, people should be cautious. If someone is getting threats of extortions from people through such modus operandi they should contact the rural police immediately,” Patil said. “Every application related to social media should be properly studied before making use of it. Exercising caution is the best way to avoid being cheated at the hands of conmen operating online,” he added. The use of internet has increased manifold even in rural areas after the work from home and study from home became a norm from last year after the outbreak of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sp-warns-against-unknown-women-on-social-media/articleshow/83212074.cms||---

That’s because his ground strokes were so measured that while leaving the opponent flat-footed, the ball landed precisely where he meant to, often at the far corners of the court.Ramesh was one of the last links with the halcyon days of Indian tennis which stretched from the late 1950s to the late 1980s. This was the time when Indian tennis basked in the sunshine under the glorious play exhibited by first Krishnan, then Vijay Amritraj and finally Ramesh.With an uncanny knack of directing his shots with a magical caress to the parts of the court where the opponent wasn’t, Ramesh was a chip of the old block. His father, pioneering great Ramanathan Krishnan, produced classic strokes that were straight out of the tennis coaching book. Ramesh was also the touch artist supreme and bewildered the man across the net with the accuracy and deceptiveness of his strokes.But then Ramesh was a chip of the old block too in that he lacked a killer stroke and a strong service, and this kept him from reaching the top echelons in the game. John McEnroe in the course of his US Open quarterfinal against Ramesh in 1981 at one time exasperatedly shouted, "This guy serves at 10 miles an hour’’. And yet Ramesh, through skilful court craft, took the ultimate champion to four sets before going down. He reached a career-high ranking of 23 in 1985, which was praiseworthy since the competition was really stiff in his time. Only Vijay Amritraj with a career-high ranking of 16 in 1980 is above him among Indians in the Open era. Among the innumerable victories around the ATP circuit, pride of place perhaps should be given to his shock win over Mats Wilander in the second round of the Australian Open in 1989. The Swede was the No. 1 ranked player in the game after winning three of the four Grand Slams the previous year, but had little answer to Ramesh’s impeccable stroke play and went down in straight sets.India made it to the Davis Cup final thrice, in 1966, 1974 and 1987. Krishnan entered the men’s singles semifinals at Wimbledon in the pre-Open era, in 1960 and 1961. Vijay made it to the quarterfinals at both Wimbledon (1973 and 1981) and the US Open (1973 and 1974) and Ramesh kept the lamp aglow by reaching the quarterfinals at Wimbledon (1986) and the US Open (1981 and 1987). Before that he had first served notice when he emulated his father in winning the Wimbledon junior title in 1979, a feat Krishnan had performed in 1954.By the end of the 1980s with Vijay’s game on the wane, Ramesh became the key player for India in the Davis Cup and indeed played a stellar role in India making it to the final in 1987. In the semifinal against Australia at Sydney, he won both his singles, first against John Fitzgerald and then the all-important final rubber against Wally Masur when the teams were level 2-2. Winning the crucial final match was not a new experience for Ramesh. In the Davis Cup first round tie against Argentina earlier that year he had prevailed over Horatio de la Pena with the teams again locked at two matches all.Six years later Ramesh was at it again, clinching a five-set victory after being down by two sets to one against Rodolphe Gilbert to complete a 3-2 triumph over France in the quarterfinal at Frejus, one of the greatest upsets in Davis Cup history. In all these matches Ramesh never allowed the pressure to get to him and remained calm and cool, serving and stroking smoothly. He acquired this unruffled temperament from his father who also was ice cool and phlegmatic on court. A Padma Shri awardee, Ramesh won eight titles on the ATP tour in a 15-year career before retiring in 1993. In the Davis Cup over roughly the same period he had a 29-21 winning record (23-19 in singles and 6-2 in doubles). Post retirement he has had a spell as Davis Cup non-playing captain and continues to hone young players through his involvement with the Krishnan Tennis Centre in Kottivakkam.(The writer is a senior sports journalist)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/touch-artist-with-a-surgical-precision/articleshow/83215697.cms||---

Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh are number two, Chandigarh claimed the top slot among UTs with a score of 79, which is an increase over its 2019 score of 70. Encouragingly, the report showed that in 2019-20, 10 states and UTs belonged to the category of ‘front runners’, but now 12 more -- Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Punjab, Haryana, Tripura, Delhi, Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have graduated from ‘performers’ to join this category. At the bottom of the list is Bihar with a score of (52) followed by Jharkhand (56) and Assam (57). However, compared to 2019 all these states have improved their scores by a few points remaining in the ‘performer’ category on a score index that classifies states based on their performance on goals as aspirant (0-49); performer (50-64); front-runners (65-99) and achiever with a full 100. In fast moving states (score-wise), top gainers are Mizoram (68), Haryana (67), and Uttarakhand (72) in 2020–21 with improvements of 12, 10 and 8 points from 2019 respectively. According to the SDG India Index report 2020-21, India’s overall score is up from 60 in 2019 to 66 and no state figures on the overall score among aspirants for the second year. The impressive performance of states on targets linked to “clean water and sanitation” and “affordable and clean energy” delivering an overall score of 83 and 92 respectively are being cited as key drivers that have helped enhance India’s overall score on the SDG Index by six points. Adding to this score is the performance on six goals including good health and well-being, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life on land and peace, justice and strong institutions, where the overall score for each goal is over 65. However, there are problem areas that need urgent attention. On two goals - “zero hunger” (goal 2) and “gender equality” (goal 5), the India score is a matter of concern at it is 47 and 48 respectively. This is the status even as nine states in goal 2 and 12 states in goal 5 have moved out of the aspirant category in 2020-21 as compared to 2019-20. In 2019 the score was even worse at 35 and 42 respectively. The report highlights the impact of schemes, policy measures taken and the challenges for each goal based on available data along with the scores for assigned indicator for the states. Interestingly, while goal 6 (clean water and sanitation) has the highest number of ‘front runners’ with 25 states in this category, goals 5 (gender equality) and goal 9 (industry innovation and infrastructure) have the highest ‘aspirants’ with 14 states each having a score less than 50. The index puts 14 states and UTs in performer category (50-64 score). These include Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Nagaland, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand and Bihar. With one-third of the journey towards achieving the 2030 Agenda behind us, this edition of the index report focuses on the significance of partnerships as its theme. Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog said, “The report reflects on the partnerships we have built and strengthened during our SDG efforts. The narrative throws light on how collaborative initiatives can result in better outcomes and greater impacts.” Watch SDG India index: Kerala bags top slot; Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam at bottom||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-bags-top-slot-in-sdg-india-index-bihar-jharkhand-assam-at-bottom/articleshow/83221185.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Hyderabad||Cong veterans oppose projecting Revanth as TPCC chief||Hyderabad: With Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy emerging as frontrunner for TPCC president’s post, the Congress Loyalists Forum (CLF) comprising party veterans has raised a banner of revolt against projecting him to revive the party. The loyalists have decided to write to Sonia Gandhi, arguing that it would be detrimental to the party to project one leader with serious charges pending against him and being investigated by the central and state agencies. This open dissent came at a time when Congress is trying to regain its foothold in Telangana and appoint a leader to lift the morale of party cadre. The CLF comprising former minister Marri Shashidhar Reddy, former MP V Hanumanth Rao, All India Kisan Congress vice-president M Kodanda Reddy, AICC member G Niranjan, former minister S Chandrasekhar, ex-MLC Kamalakar Rao, PCC intellectual cell chairman Shyam Mohan, among others, met here on Wednesday. They demanded appointment of a Congress loyalist with a clean image as TPCC chief than a turncoat. “We have nothing personal against any candidate or leader. It is the right time to revive the party in Telangana. People are angry with BJP and TRS governments at the Centre and in the state for mishandling the pandemic,” Hanumanth Rao said. The veterans also want the high command to select a TPCC chief who will not succumb to pressures from the BJP and TRS governments due to pending cases against him or her. Sources said AICC in charge of Telangana Manickam Tagore is keen on completing the long-pending appointment of TPCC chief by this month-end. However, he said the party high command is presently focused on helping Covid-19 affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-veterans-oppose-projecting-revanth-as-tpcc-chief/articleshow/83215738.cms||Roushan Ali

The committee, led by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, has already taken feedback from the party’s Punjab MLAs, MPs and former state presidents. Party incharge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat told mediapersons that the committee spoke to Ambika Soni also over phone and “took guidance from her”. She has sent a letter to the Congress president about the situation. A senior Congress leader said Capt Amarinder will meet the panel on Friday morning even as he left for Delhi on Thursday from Chandigarh. Party sources said the CM was also expected to connect with Rahul Gandhi through videoconferencing. Meanwhile, an official said no meeting with party president Sonia Gandhi had been fixed as yet. Rahul has been monitoring the entire exercise from behind the scenes and had also called up a dozen Punjab Congress MLAs to get first hand feedback. Meanwhile, Iqbal Singh, Manish Tiwari and other senior leaders also gave their inputs to the panel on the internal turmoil in the state unit and how to make the leaders put up a united face ahead of the next assembly elections.

This year, too Delhi could have a slightly below normal rainy season. While the normal mark for the June-September period is 648.9mm of rain, the city received 576.6mm last year and only 404.3mm in 2019. While the India Meteorological Department declared the onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala on Thursday, Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre in Delhi, said it was too early to forecast when the monsoons would hit Delhi. The normal date for the onset of the wet season in Delhi is June 27. Last year, the monsoon arrived two days early on June 25. June 29 had historically been the normal monsoon onset date for Delhi, but this was revised last year to June 27. “So far, the forecast shows monsoon in Delhi could be slightly below normal to normal, but we will see how this evolves,” said Srivastava. “We will be able to forecast more accurately when the monsoon could hit Delhi-NCR this year after the winds start moving inwards towards the west. At the moment, it is too early to say anything about the matter.” In the decade between 2010 and 2020, Delhi recorded the highest seasonal rainfall in 2010, 1031.5mm of rain poured over the city. The lowest during this period was 370.8mm in 2014. On average, Delhi receives only around 65.5mm of rainfall in June, largely because of pre-monsoon showers. In July, the normal average for precipitation is 210.6mm and in August, 247.7mm. IMD recently upgraded India’s rainfall forecast for this year to 101% of the Long Period Average, which is 880mm (1961- 2010). On Thursday, IMD declared the onset of the monsoon over Kerala and said it was likely to advance into more areas in southern India over the next two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/above-normal-monsoon-in-delhi-only-thrice-since-2010/articleshow/83215811.cms||---
---||Chennai||State plans genome sequencing lab||Chennai: When scientists across the globe sounded the alarm about new variants of the SARS-Cov 2, which they suspect carry mutations with a potential to offset vaccine efficacy, officials in the state public health laboratory were busy drafting a proposal to set up a whole genome sequencing lab for the state. If the proposal is cleared, the state will soon have its own lab to sequence genomic code of the virus by the end of June. As the virus multiplies, tiny changes or mutations accumulate in its genetic code. “Changes in the genetic structures can sometimes turn dangerous. We wanted to be on top of these changes,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “Thought at present, this may not immediately affect prevention strategies or treatment protocols, but it will give us information about the patterns of transmission and an insight into how the virus has evolved. This may help researchers find methods for rapid diagnosis or new drug pathways to stop the virus,” he said. The lab will cost about Rs 2 crore. Although several institutions in the state have facilities to sequence the genomes, the state health department does not have a specialised unit for the job. The lab officials say the proposed lab will help them track the variants of vector borne diseases and superbugs resistant to antibiotics. “While these are important scientific developments, we will still focus on the importance of masks, social distancing and vaccines,” said director of public health Dr TS Selvavinayagam. Delta variant Information available with the public health department shows the most common strain seen in the state, like in most parts of the country, is the double mutant B.1.617, now named Delta. Until now, Tamil Nadu has sent more than 600 samples – at least 518 between April and May – to the Bengaluru-based InStem, as per recommendations from the Centre. InStem is part of INSACOG (a consortium of 10 labs that track variants in Covid samples). Results of more than 192 samples returned by the lab showed that 77% of samples drawn during the peak were Delta. The remaining samples contained four other variants including Alpha and Beta. Results of remaining samples are still awaited. Sample from clusters Scientists at the state public health lab said the results of genomic sequencing wasn’t something “unexpected”. In January, scientists raised a red flag when they first noticed changes during PCR tests. “One of the most frequently tested gene targets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is the S gene. While the PCR detected N gene and open reading frame (ORF), it skipped S gene. That’s when we suspected mutations,” said a senior scientist.  Samples from across the state were divided into categories – family clusters, community clusters, Covid in children, young adults with severe lung infection, breakthrough infections (infected 14 days after two vaccinations), samples from deceased and travellers. "These categories will give us more information about what kind of variants are seen in each of these categories,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/state-plans-genome-sequencing-lab/articleshow/83207463.cms||---

The cabinet had on Wednesday cancelled the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams due to the pandemic. The SDMA, which is the final authority that decides on matters related to the pandemic, accepted the cabinet decision following a meeting headed by the CM. The decision has been communicated to Bombay HC, which was hearing a petition on cancellation of Class 10 exams. Over 14 lakh students who were registered for the HSC exams are now awaiting the evaluation pattern based on which final results will be declared. College heads said while they are yet to receive a communication on cancellation of exams, they are in touch with education department officials on the evaluation methodology to be adopted. Students and colleges have urged the state not to rely on Class 11 marks to grade the HSC students. The state may look at a Common Entrance Test (CET) on the lines of a similar test being planned for admission to first year junior colleges. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said the decision to cancel examinations was taken to ensure mental health and safety of students. The minister demanded that the teaching, non-teaching staff and students should be given the status of ‘frontline workers’ and they should be vaccinated on priority basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-body-gives-nod-to-cancel-hsc-exams/articleshow/83217812.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Goa||Goa: Differently-abled Tonca man walks 4km everyday to run his business||PANAJI: A differently abled man with impaired speech and a hip problem, Bashir Rehmansab Nawar, 40, walks from his home in Tonca to Miramar, St Inez and even Taleigao, collecting day old newspapers. This is his daily routine from 9am to 11am and 6pm to 8pm. Perhaps one of the rare types of entrepreneurs in Goa, he has a story to tell about not giving up despite all odds. Purchasing the newspapers for Rs 5-10 per kg, he fashions them into paper bags in both small and big sizes and sells them for a living. “I’ve been making these bags for the past 20 years along with my mother. She has needed to stay at home to look after my father after he suffered a heart attack. I am the only one who can venture out and gather newspapers,” he told TOI. Together, the mother-son duo can make 100 paper bags a day, which are then sold for Rs 1 and Rs 2 per piece for the small and big bag, respectively. Shopkeepers in Panaji and medical stores are his main clientele. Recognising his enterprising skill, a Panaji resident, who he only knows by the name “Mona madam”, donated a shopping trolley to him. Bashir then added a chain lock to it which he uses to fasten the cart to prevent it from moving and a horn to alert motorists before crossing roads in the city. Later, he even added a torch to allow him to maneuver around potholes and over speed bumps in the evenings. Walking nearly four kilometers every day has been a dreadful experience for him this summer season, yet he smiles and says that he is grateful that it’s not as bad as the monsoon. “Besides making sure that I remain covered, I have to ensure that the newspapers don’t get soaked. It gets difficult on days when the roads are flooded, but I still don’t take the day off,” he said. A confident speaker, despite his speech impairment, Bashir, however, still gets affected when he is treated with hostility by passersby who mistake his staggered walking and slurred speech for drunkenness and his impoverished appearance for homelessness. “Sometimes, people are genuinely curious and want to hear my story. But even then, others are suspicious and wonder why,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/differently-abled-tonca-man-walks-4km-everyday-to-run-his-business/articleshow/83215763.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Nashik||Flight training academy at Jalgaon airport||NASHIK: A Delhi-based aviation training institute, Skynex Areo Pvt Limited, has won the bid to establish and operate a state-of-the-art flight training academy on the premises of the Jalgaon airport, which is managed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). AAI had invited bids last year to set up eight flying training academies, including the one at Jalgaon, under its liberalised flying training organisation (FTO) policy aimed at making India a global flight training hub and prevent the exodus of Indian cadets to foreign FTOs. It has finalised the parties to run the academies. The Jalgaon airport authorities said as directed by AAI, the institute will be provided with 5000 sq metre of space in the airport to construct infrastructure like training building, taxiway, hangars etc in coordination with AAI. AAI had chosen Jalgaon airport for the project as it is not very busy with flights operating only to Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Also, the airport has night landing facilities, which is essential for training pilots. There is minimal disruption due to weather issues and civil/ military air traffic. AAI sources said the Jalgaon flying training academy will be the second one in Maharashtra that is being established with coordination with AAI. Rahul N V, the manager (training) of Skynex Aero, told TOI that the institute is keen to start its pilot training programme by September-October this year subject to various mandatory clearances from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and local agencies. “Our first batch will have around 40 cadets, who will be selected through aptitude test and personal interview,” he said. Skynex Aero will start the training programme with a small number of aircraft initially. Within the next two years, it will have a fleet of around 20 various aircraft to train the cadets. Jalgaon BJP MP Unmesh Patil thanked the civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri for including the Jalgaon airport for this project. “When the ministry was planning this project I had met Puri and senior ministry officials to include Jalgaon airport in it. The students of our state , who are keen to become pilots shall have an extremely good training institute to pursue their dreams,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/flight-training-academy-at-jalgaon-airport/articleshow/83212142.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Recently, the Supreme Court struck down Maharashtra’s 2018 law conferring 16% reservations on the Maratha community on the grounds that the overall reservation cannot exceed 50% in the state and that after the Constitution 102nd amendment brought into force on August 2018 by the BJP government, states have no power to identify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs).Article 366 (26C) introduced by this amendment states that SEBCs under the Constitution are only those notified under Article 342A, by the President, in consultation with the governor of the state. This notification can be altered only by an act of Parliament. When this amendment was discussed before the select committee of Parliament, an assurance was given by the government that the proposed amendment does not interfere with the powers of the States to identify SEBCs.DMK’s Kanimozhi raised concerns in her dissent note about the amendment’s impact on the states’ powers. When the bill was moved, the minister assured Parliament that the states’ powers to include and exclude SEBCs will not be affected. A note of caution was also sounded by DMK MP P Wilson in the Rajya Sabha in March. Despite this, the Supreme Court has held that after the passage of the 102nd amendment, the states have no power to identify the SEBCs.Before the introduction of Article 342A, the state and Union each had its own list of SEBCs. For example, the Tamil Nadu government had notified 252 Backward Classes based on the social fabric of the state.The findings of the Supreme Court are contrary to the Union’s stand before the court that the list specified in Article 342A was only the central list, namely the list of SEBCs for central institutions and employment, and not the state list. This stand of the Union government was rejected by the majority opinions of Justice S Ravindra Bhat, Justice L Nageshwara Rao and Justice Hemant Gupta. Thus, we are faced with a unique situation where the court’s interpretation is contrary to the assurances given by the government before the Parliament. The three judges held that such assurances are "external aids" and not relevant while interpreting constitutional provisions, where a ‘literal interpretation’ of the provision has to be adopted. Interestingly, the dissenting opinions of Justice Ashok Bushan and Justice Abdul Nazeer rely heavily on these assurances to hold that a ‘purposive construction’ of the Constitution’s provisions are required, to give effect to the intention of the lawmakers.Therefore, to tide over this situation, the government must necessarily bring in an amendment to Article 342(A), saving the power of the states to identify and notify SEBCs. Otherwise, we would have set a dangerous precedent in the annals of our Parliamentary democracy.Another offshoot of the Maratha judgment is the Union government’s reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) in forward castes is now in jeopardy. The Supreme Court has reiterated that reservations shall not exceed 50%, except in "extraordinary situations". Under central laws, 49.5% reservation is provided for SC, ST and OBCs. The EWS reservation, a challenge to which is pending before the Supreme Court, would breach the 50% mark. Applying the stringent tests in the Maratha judgment, this EWS reservation would therefore be unconstitutional, since no extraordinary case is made out for grant of these reservations.(The writer is an advocate at Madras high court)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/maratha-quota-order-denudes-power-of-reservation-of-states/articleshow/83215807.cms||---

Government of India and state government together will give Rs 4,000 per month to below-18 orphaned children and those above 18 years will get Rs 6,000 per month. We got representations that many children do not have death certificates, stating Covid-19 as the cause of death of parents. So the government has decided to cover all children who have lost parents from the period that the pandemic started, even if they don’t have related certificates. Many parents died because of co-morbidities post Covid also.”TOI in its reports on Thursday had highlighted the predicament of many Covid orphans who said that death certificates of most orphans' parents did mention death due to Covid. They questioned if their applications for government support would still be accepted.“The CM has directed to chalk out a scheme immediately. A government resolution will be issued shortly,” he added. He further said, “The government has decided to give priority to all orphan children in various welfare schemes like foreign education loan and assistance under Mukhyamantri Yuva Swavalamban Yojana among others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-vows-to-aid-orphans-even-sans-covid-certificates/articleshow/83215899.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Mutant virus, 10x oxygen demand spike marked second Covid wave||AHMEDABAD: The second wave of Covid cases not only had a mutated virus, but patients were pushed into a condition where they had to be put on oxygen of about 15 litres per minute within two or three days of testing positive for Covid-19. This resulted in a a tenfold increase in medical oxygen demand from 1,000 metric tonnes (MT) per day to 10,000 MT per day, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Thursday. Speaking at the e-dedication of nine oxygen plants installed in Gujarat by Vallabh Youth Organisation, Shah said that the Union and state governments took up the oxygen shortage challenge, diverting industrial-use oxygen for medical purposes. “The countrywide demand for oxygen now is about 3,500MT, an indication that the number of Covid-19 cases is declining in the country,” he said. Commenting on the crisis that the country has been passing through, Shah said, “The country had a testing time as not only were corona cases increasing but the west and east coasts were affected by cyclones. However, in this hour of crisis, the country managed well under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” “As you may have seen in the media, even highly developed countries struggled to tackle the pandemic. On the other hand, we fought the battle with patience and planning,” he said. He said in other countries, only the governments were fighting against the coronavirus. “In India, along with the government, 135 crore citizens also fought this battle under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. This is the reason for our success,” said Shah. “We have been able to bring Covid-19 under control quickly with the support of doctors and medical staff and the support of 135 crore Indians,” Shah said. Commenting on ensuring adequate availability of medical oxygen, Shah said that apart from a massive logistics exercise for procuring oxygen, 162 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants were set up and another 1,051 have been approved in 2021. “Where it was not possible to transport oxygen, patients were shifted to where there was availability of oxygen. In just 15 days, 12,000 oxygen beds were set up at 21 steel plants and refineries,” he said. “Also, 1.5 lakh oxygen concentrators were also purchased in a short while. The home minister further said that 21 crore people have been vaccinated and the country’s vaccination program was the fastest among all the countries in the world,” Shah said. Chief minister Vijay Rupani said the second wave made it clear that oxygen was crucial. He also said that the state was fully equipped to tackle a third wave of Covid cases. Vaishnav Acharya Vrajraj Kumar said the VYO decided to set up 29 oxygen plants and on Thursday 28 plants were already set up and functional. He said the VYO will also help orphans who lost their parents to Covid-19.

NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav will hold a meeting with the civic officials concerned about the possibilities of starting the city bus service. “The civic body was planning to start the city bus service, but could not due to Covid pandemic. But with the drop in new cases, we are planning to start the city bus service. The decision to this effect will be taken at the meeting to be held next week,” said NMC officials. Nashik RTO has also given its approval about the fares to be collected from commuters by NMC in its proposed city bus service. For the first two km, fare will be Rs 10 and thereafter it will be Rs 2 per km from three to 10 km. Commuters will have to pay Rs 30 for travelling 18 km and Rs 45 for 30 km. Officials said that they were considering starting the service with minimum 25 buses and then increase the number gradually. “Initially, the buses connecting two major industrial areas in the city – Satpur and Ambad — will be started,” said NMC officials, adding that the buses will ply from Nashik Road and Panchavati bus depots to these two industrial estates. NMC has plans to operate CNG and diesel buses initially and electric buses after a few months of operations. The civic body has already deployed two contractors to buy, operate, maintain and manage the city bus service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/decision-on-nashik-city-bus-service-next-week/articleshow/83212193.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Spurious favipiravir sold after creating fake prescription||AHMEDABAD: Counterfeit medicines finding their way into leading online pharmacy stores is emerging as a major concern for the Gujarat Food and Drugs Control Administration (FDCA). On Thursday, the FDCA seized more than 4,950 counterfeit tablets of the antiviral drug favipiravir — consisting mainly of starch — being sold under the brand name ‘Favimax-400’. FDCA officials traced the tablets to an online pharmacy’s warehouse in Vejalpur. An FDCA official posed as a buyer on the online platform and the online pharmacy even confirmed the order. The investigation allegedly also exposed the underbelly of the online pharmacy business, which even went to the extent of generating fake doctor’s prescriptions to sell scheduled drugs online. As for the online pharmacy, Gujarat FDCA officials first placed an order worth Rs 1,791 for Favimax-400 that was advertised on the online store. “Our official posing as a patient received a call from an online doctor in Bangalore who was ready to prescribe the drug to us. This is a serious lacunae and needs regulating in online pharmacies,” says Gujarat FDCA chief H G Koshia. Gujarat FDCA officials also say that the kingpin of the fake favipiravir racket Sudip Mukherji was being questioned in Mumbai by their Maharashtra counterparts. Koshia added, “The kingpin Sudip Mukherji is being questioned in Mumbai for more information on how many stockists in the country were sold the pills.” Gujarat FDCA officials traced four doctors — Dr Chetan Gautam, Dr Surabhi Bansal, Dr M Navin Kumar and Dr Shweta B — who were posing as consultants and prescribing the counterfeit favipiravir to patients in Ahmedabad. The online pharmacy had procured the Favimax-400 stock of 4,900 tablets from Paawan Pharma in Ghatlodia, which inturn procured the tablets form two stores — Parshv Medical Stores in Satara and Shiv Shrushti Surgimed in Goregaon (East) in Mumbai. “We are investigating the malpractices followed by online pharmacies. We suspect many prescription drugs are being sold through dubious processes,” says Koshia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/spurious-favipiravir-sold-after-creating-fake-prescription/articleshow/83215897.cms||---

While the average positivity percentage of Uttarakhand in the last seven days (from May 27 to June 2) was 4.3%, it was 8.84% in Almora, 8.40% in Pithoragarh, 8.23% in Chamoli and 7.95% in Pauri – all hill districts. In sharp contrast, four districts in the plains which accounted for maximum Covid cases had a relatively low positivity rate, with Dehradun at 3.96%, Haridwar at 2.35%, Udham Singh Nagar at 2.28% and Nainital at 6.92%. In the same time span, Rudraprayag had a 6.38% positivity rate followed by Uttarkashi at 4.62%, Tehri at 4.16%, Bageshwar at 3.45% and Champawat at 3.40%. Social activist Anoop Nautiyal termed the trend as “alarming”. “District and state health authorities need to make extra efforts to increase testing and focus on isolation and containment especially in the four districts of Pithoragarh, Pauri, Almora and Chamoli,” said Nautiyal. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal when queried about the issue, said, “We have been successful in bringing down the numbers in the plains as well as the hills. The state government has made several efforts in the hills, which were led by the CM himself, who visited hospitals in each hill district to take stock of the situation.” Uniyal further said that the government was monitoring the situation at the block level too. “Our teams are visiting villages, collecting and updating records of returnees and constant efforts are underway to improve health facilities in the hills,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/high-positivity-rate-in-hills-remains-a-major-challenge-for-uttarakhand/articleshow/83212303.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Kolkata||Baishali Dalmiya plaint: Cops check CCTV grabs in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The CCTV footage of the May 31 incident at Behala Chowrasta crossing may provide key leads to ascertain whether it was a road rage or an attack on the son of BJP leader Baishali Dalmiya, Aditya. In her FIR lodged with the police, Baishali claimed that three persons were involved in the attack on her son, which, she alleged, was “orchestrated”. Her complaint names three persons — two persons in the car and an unidentified bike-borne assailant. She, however, suspects that there were seven others involved in the incident. Cops arrested the car driver, Parijat Laha, who was later granted bail. Others will be questioned. Baishali on Thursday told TOI, “I have shared a few important leads with the police. This includes the registration number of a bike, the owner of which was involved in the attack too. I have done the medico-legal report of my son from a government hospital. I have told them how the assailants tore his T-shirt and wrapped it around his neck in a bid to choke him. This happened even though my son was not driving the car. This shows criminals were involved in the attack.” The FIR has been drawn under IPC sections like 323, 241, 327 and section 114. She also said, “When I reached the spot, I too was pushed around, for which I am planning to lodge another FIR. I cannot believe that there can be such open hooliganism in the daylight at this place. Criminals have no political affiliation, but they must not be allowed to get away,” she said.  “The process to trace the accused is still on,” said a police officer.Cops are also probing the reasons that led to the violence. “Statements are being recorded,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/baishali-plaint-cops-check-cctv-grabs/articleshow/83215889.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Meerut||Indian-origin scientist identifies metal ions that help SARS-CoV-2 enter cells undetected, lays ground for drug discovery||MEERUT: How does the novel coronavirus thrive in a host’s body? A new study led by an Indian-origin scientist, published in ‘Nature Communications’, has solved one more piece of the puzzle. They have discovered that magnesium, calcium and manganese ions in the body form “a bridge” that helps the virus enter a cell undetected. The findings could pave the way for antiviral drugs that counter the virus. “Last year, my team and I discovered the mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 modifies its messenger RNA (or mRNA) and evades immune system resistance,” said Dr Yogesh Gupta, 42, from the University of Texas Health Science Center, originally from Jasrana in Firozabad. “Now, we have discovered that different metal ions help a process called RNA capping to ensure undetected growth in a host’s body. This is an important breakthrough in our understanding of the mutating virus.” Proteins in our cells carry out processes necessary for body functions — mRNA carries these instructions. RNA capping, meanwhile, is essential for efficient production of viral proteins and protection of the virus’s RNA from the host’s immune response. “We found metal ions were the real culprits helping the virus disguise itself and appear to the immune mechanism that it is its own. These ions form a bridge between the viral mRNA and the virus’s two proteins (non-structural protein (nsp)16 and nsp10),” Gupta explained. Metal ions are found in blood, bones and tissue in the body. “The virus then uses its own proteins to modify its mRNA cap so that it mimics the cellular mRNA. Consequently, the immune system can’t recognise it. After the RNA cap modification, the nsp16-nsp10 protein complex stretches itself, in which ion binding helps.” While the search for a Covid-19 drug is on, prescribed options have, so far, relied on medicines for other diseases repurposed for novel coronavirus patients. Knowing the full mechanism of how a virus enters the body and protects itself opens up an understanding of how to target its survival mechanisms and the possibility of antivirals specifically targeted at SARS-CoV-2. “With our new study, we have a much better understanding of exactly how the virus employs RNA cap modification for its survival,” Gupta said. “Since we now have atomic-level details of this mechanism, it will help us develop new drug candidates (anti-virals) capable of blocking this camouflage activity by targeting the ion binding process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/indian-origin-scientist-identifies-metal-ions-that-help-sars-cov-2-enter-cells-undetected-lays-ground-for-drug-discovery/articleshow/83214040.cms||Sandeep Rai

In a detailed order, Jadhav pointed out that the prosecution story was based merely on suspicion about the involvement of accused in the crime. Singh was married to Jayprakash Singh, then a central excise commissioner. She was the sister of music composer duo Jatin-Lalit and yesteryear actresses Sulakshana and Vijeta Pandit. At the hearing on May 13, the judge pointed out lacunae that led to the acquittal. “... [I]n order to establish the crime against any person on the basis of circumstantial evidence, the circumstance must be strong enough and should be proved by unbroken chain showing exclusive involvement of the accused in said crime,” the judge said. Jadhav said that to convert suspicion into evidence, the prosecution ought to have proved certain circumstances showing the involvement of accused beyond reasonable doubt. “Said circumstances can be recovery of dead body or human remains at the instance of accused, the recovery of weapon, the recovery of blood stained clothes, etc. In the present case, nothing has been recovered or discovered at the instance of the accused,” the judge said. The judge said the prosecution had not proved any circumstance to presume the accused was within exclusive knowledge of death, cause of death and place of death of the deceased. “Under such circumstances, no inference can be drawn against the accused,” the judge said. The state may appeal against the order in high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-mere-suspicion-not-proof-says-judge-in-sandhya-singh-case/articleshow/83217919.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Schools, government devise plans to enhance online classes this year||HYDERABAD: From devising interactive online content to tying up with online learning service providers, schools and government authorities have upped their game ahead of the commencement of classes for the next academic year. Last year, when the pandemic hit, schools and students had to abruptly shift from physical to online classes, giving no time for school managements and government authorities to plan the transition. This year, many have sought feedback from all the stakeholders and have chalked out detailed plans to enhance the learning experience of students. The Telangana State Recognised School Managements Association (TRSMA), which has close to 30,000 budget schools under its ambit, has tied up with digital learning platforms for online classes and practicals as well. “We have tied up with a platform that is going to enable online learning for students. They will be developing content as per the prescribed syllabus. Using QR codes, students will be able to take up assignments and worksheets. Multiple choice question tests and auto-evaluation is also being enabled,” said S Madhusudan, general secretary, TRSMA, adding that another platform will enable virtual practicals for science subjects. While the government has decided to continue its online classes through T-SAT and DD Yadagiri, they will begin with bridge courses for the first two months. “For June and July, the school education department has decided to conduct revision classes and has asked all schools to extend support. Last year, many students were facing issues due to technical glitches, lack of access to resources such as internet and television. This year, we are focusing more on students who have no resources at their disposal,” said Manju Latha Narra, headmistress of Raj Bhavan Government School in Somajiguda. Many private schools have focused largely on teacher training. “This year, we are at a greater advantage as teachers have learnt to utilise many free tools that are available online. Many schools have invested in hours of teacher training to ensure that the teaching and learning process is seamless,” said Shailaja Gopinath, principal, Delhi Public School, Secunderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-govt-devise-plans-to-enhance-online-classes-this-year/articleshow/83215946.cms||Preeti Biswas

Section engineer Nanasaheb Suriyawanshi rushed to the office. The citizens complained that they have not been supplied drinking water since last 8-10 days. When it is supplied, the water is muddy and contaminated, they said. The people of Yavatmal are facing drinking water crisis for more than 30 years now. The central government had sanctioned Rs302 crore Amrut drinking water scheme for Yavatmal city. A plan was laid to bring water from the Bembla irrigation project, which is 26km from the city in Babhulgaon tehsil of Yavatmal. A Nashik-based private company laid the pipeline, which has busted at a number of places. The then district guardian minister Madan Yerawar had promised that water from Bembla would reach the city by May 2018. The water from Bembla won't be available for at least next couple of years, say experts. Meanwhile, RTI activist Digambar Pajgade has filed a criminal case in the high court alleging rampant corruption in Amrut scheme. He has pleaded for a thorough probe. Pintu Bangar submitted a list of demands to the section engineer, including regular supply of drinking water. He has also demanded that the contractor of Bembla project should be blacklisted and the work should be given to another agency. He warned the MJP officials of intensifying the protest if the drinking water is not supplied regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-citizens-ransack-lock-mjp-office-over-non-supply-of-drinking-water/articleshow/83216184.cms||---

RMC also decided to pay this subsidy with retrospective effect to those who were not eligible for cycle subsidy earlier as per last year’s rule. When the scheme was initiated two years ago, only one person of a family was eligible for subsidy. However, now it has decided to deposit Rs 1,000 in the account of other people of the same family who opt for this green mode of transport with retrospective effect. All those who have purchased bicycles after July 15, 2019 will be eligible for subsidy. Beginning this financial year, the civic body also started providing a Rs 5,000 subsidy to those who buy e-bikes in order, which go a long way in reducing vehicular pollution. RMC had sanctioned Rs one crore in the 2019-20 budget and Rs 30 lakh in the 2020-21 budget for promoting cycling. RMC has paid Rs 45 lakh subsidy to 4,500 beneficiaries in the last two financial years while in the current year, it has sanctioned a budget of Rs 50 lakh for this scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rmc-to-give-rs-1000-subsidy-for-cycle-purchase/articleshow/83213972.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government resumes work on controversial Laldhang-Chillarkhal road between Corbett & Rajaji||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government has once again resumed work on the contentious 11.5-km long Laldhang-Chillarkhal road. The road has been riddled in controversy for long as it has a 4.5 km stretch, from Chamaria bend to Siggadi Sot, which is ecologically-sensitive and the only wildlife corridor between the world’s highest tiger density reserve – Corbett and the Rajaji Tiger Reserve. Though the fate of the road will be decided in the upcoming meeting of National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) next week, the road is being constructed by invoking powers given under the ‘Uttarakhand Disaster Management Act’ to the district magistrate, according to state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat. Forest officials meanwhile said that the construction is being carried out in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and the Forest Conservation Act. “This is nothing but abuse of law. Disaster Management Act can’t be used anywhere to bypass forest and wildlife laws,” said a senior IFS officer. The project had run into controversy after the Supreme Court in June 2019 raised objections for beginning work without getting permissions from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and ministry of environment and forests (MoEF). Subsequently, the project got permission but with three riders. The Uttarakhand government in July 2020 sought relaxation in the riders laid by the NTCA, like reducing the length of the underpass for wild animals to 479 meters at the rate of 100 meters per km instead of 705 meters and to do away with the forest clearance under the Forest Conservation Act. But in October 2020, the 59th standing committee meeting of NBWL declined the request to modify the riders. The relaxation sought in third rider was reducing the height of the underpasses from 8 metres to 5 metres. In March this year, the minutes of the 61st standing committee of the NBWL (a copy of which is with TOI) regarding the decision taken reads, “After discussion, the standing committee decided to defer the matter.” Once again, the state will be moving the issue to the NBWL on June 11 for reconsideration with some amendments, Rawat — who has been pushing the controversial project as it lies in his constituency, Kotdwar — told TOI. In defence of the project, Rawat said that “the road is essential as it will provide much-needed connectivity to people, especially in reaching hospitals during the time of Covid-19.” “A report by the district magistrate, disaster management officer, SDM and all the concerned authorities of Pauri district agreed upon the need to have the road. A committee was also formed which realised that there is a need to have a proper road so that we can save the lives of patients who stay in this area during the Covid pandemic,” said Rawat. He added that work in the sensitive stretch will be done only after the decision of the NBWL next week, “We will see what’s the decision of the NBWL and accordingly work will be done on the 4.5-km patch,” he said. Even though sources told TOI that work at Chillarkhal has already begun, the minister denied it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-resumes-work-on-controversial-laldhang-chillarkhal-road-between-corbett-rajaji/articleshow/83212314.cms||Shivani Azad

Those in the age group of 18-44 years across Gujarat will be able to avail free vaccination from Friday. The state government’s decision comes 34 days after it began vaccination for this age group in 10 municipal corporations and district areas on May 1. In the past one month, 18 lakh people in this age group have been vaccinated, according to the state health department officials. On Thursday, the Covid-19 core committee chaired by CM Vijay Rupani decided to extend the vaccination drive to all districts. “From Friday, about 2.15 lakh youths will be covered daily under the initiative. The vaccination will be provided through registration at 1,200 centres in the state. The beneficiaries will be intimated about time and place through SMS,” said CM Rupani. “About 75,000 persons in 45-plus age group will also also be covered daily. In all, the target is to inoculate 3 lakh persons daily,” said Rupani. “So far, about 1.25 lakh youths used to get the vaccination in 10 cities. We have ordered 3 crore vaccines for inoculation.” In the past one week, out of 11.75 lakh shots, 7 lakh or about 60% were administered in the 18-44 years age group. The beneficiaries in 45-60 years were 2.43 lakh, and 60-plus years were 1.03 lakh according to CoWIN portal data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/free-vaccination-opens-for-18-44-age-group-across-state/articleshow/83216049.cms||---

Both of them tested positive but became friends following a short chat at the testing centre. But destiny had different plans for the two friends. On May 29, Parmar succumbed to post-Covid complications. The next day Vankar went to Parmar’s besna (condolence meet). While returning on his motorcycle he rammed into a neelgai (blue bull) and died on the spot near Ghatisana village, said Vankar’s cousin Suresh Solanki. “I got a call from Shanaji Thakor of my village. He said that my brother Bladev Vankar (45) lost his balance when a blue bull suddenly appeared before his motorcycle. He fell into a pit on the roadside,” said Solanki in his FIR filed with Detroj police station. When Solanki reached the accident spot, he found that Vankar was lying unconscious. Soon a team of 108 ambulance reached but they declared him dead. Solaki said that Vankar worked as a security guard at a private firm. He had developed Covid like symptoms in the last week of April. So he went to a community health centre to get tested and there he met Parmar from Jakasana village. After testing positive, Vankar and Parmar used to call and enquire about each others health. Both of them recovered after 15 days. But Parmar developed some complications and died of cardiac arrest on May 29, said Solanki. Though, family members advised Vannkar against attending the condolence meet, he went despite ill health, added Solanki. Detroj police have accused Vankar of rash driving leading to his own death and begun investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-returning-from-covid-friends-besna-dies-in-accident/articleshow/83216093.cms||---

We saw the villagers wading through waist deep water to receive relief material from us,” said Saumitra Mitra of Purba Paschim. The condition of several areas in North 24 Parganas worsened after high tide inundated the villages during Yaas. “Embankments got breached in several places and water entered the villages. Hundreds have lost their homes overnight with almost nothing to survive on. When we started with the relief work at places like Kumirmari, the perils of these people brought tears to our eyes. We are a small organization with limited resources, but we managed to feed them so far. Several non-government organisations have also come forward to help,” said Swami Parisuddhananda, secretary of Ramkrishna Mission Ashram, Taki. “Since the cyclone had hit the areas, they started to serve khichuri to the villagers while taking care of their basic needs. Several organisations are also helping them with dry ration,” Mitra said. “We have formed different teams that are working in the areas like Gherir Bandh, Kumirmari, Khan Pukur, Haola Para and Sandeshkhali. We had a better response from the NGOs last year when Amphan struck the state. But the numbers are low as the pandemic has restricted the movement of people, said Parisuddhananda. With more volunteers and larger participation of voluntary organisations, he is hopeful of feeding hundreds till the situation swings back to normalcy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/theatre-group-lends-a-helping-hand-to-yaas-affected-villagers/articleshow/83215932.cms||Rohit Khanna

The day also saw an all-time high of 4,546 patients getting discharged from various treatment centres, bringing the active Covid cases down to 37,505. Of the 1,79,898 people who were tested positive for the virus in the district, 1,40,999 have recovered so far. The recovery rate has now slightly improved to 78.3%. With the state listing another 48 Covid deaths that occurred in the district, the toll has gone up to 1,394. This (48) is the highest single-day fatality figure that the district has reported since the pandemic began last year. Among the deceased were a 26-year-old man with learning difficulties who died on May 23 within 24 hours of admission to the government hospital at Udumalpet, a 35-year-old man who died in the same hospital on May 28 after four days of hospitalization, a 36-year-old man with systemic hypertension and chronic kidney disease who died within 24 hours of admission on Tuesday, and a 40-year-old woman, who died on Wednesday in the government hospital at Pollachi, where she was admitted on May 23, after eight days of home isolation. The city corporation has, meanwhile, introduced 50 car ambulances to pick up people who test positive for the virus and need to visit either a hospital or a triage centre. One car ambulance has been allotted for every two wards. The ambulance service could be contacted by dialling 108. The ambulance will take the patients to the triage centre and drop them back home for home isolation or take them to a Covid care centre or hospital based on the advice from the triage centre. “We sincerely request the patients not to go to triage centres or hospitals in private vehicles,” the civic body said in a press note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fresh-coronavirus-cases-fall-below-3000-mark/articleshow/83215987.cms||---
---||Pune||PMPML makes another business plan, but activists unimpressed||TIMES VIEW Pune badly needs an efficient public transport system. Citizens will happily use buses, instead of private vehicles, if the PMPML becomes as good as BEST in Mumbai. But there has been a lack of intent and continuity when it comes to appointing officials to run the transport utility in Pune. The chairmen and managing directors are changed frequently and some even get a tenure of a few months. The system will not improve just by drafting another business plan. Changes have to be seen on the ground. With the Pune Metro work progressing steadily, the PMPML needs to become an effective and economically viable feeder service. Pune: The PMPML’s new business plan might have got its board of directors’ approval, but has failed to impress transport activists with most of them saying several such proposals had earlier been made and rejected. Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) chairman-cum-managing director Rajendra Jagtap said the transport utility’s business plan aimed at key strategies, such as ways to increase revenue while lowering expenses, reduction of manpower cost, more ridership, fuel efficiency, revenue via advertisements, mobile ticketing and pass system. “The business plan has been approved and will be available on the PMPML’s website,” he added. In 2015, then PMPML chairman-cum-managing director Shrikhar Pardeshi had initiated a business plan that never saw the light of the day, a source said. “There have been many business plans, but the implementation part is missing. The same company, which made the new business plan, had prepared the earlier one too. There were several changes since 2015 when new CMDs took over. In 2017, another plan was rejected by former PMML chairman-cum-managing director Tukaram Mundhe terming it non-workable,” an official with the transport body told TOI. Jagtap’s response to the lack of implementation was awaited till the time of going to press. In 2019, the PMPML had come up with a business plan made by the same company whose earlier proposal had been rejected. A senior official said the company had been roped in as it was aware of the PMPML’s functioning. “We have a long-standing agreement with the company and preparing a business plan is not an easy job. It was a better idea to let the company do it, rather than floating tenders and going through the process all over again,” the official said. Sanjay Shitole, an activist and active member with the PMP Pravasi Manch, said, “The PMPML should show all their cards and tell us how many business plans have been finalized, which company prepared them, how much money the utility has spent on the proposals and what happened to the ideas.” He told TOI, “The PMPML needs to collaborate with different stakeholders, be it transport activists and experts, departments and agencies concerned and come up with a plan, rather than giving the responsibility to a private company.” At a Glance Important points of the current PMPML business plan * Achieve 2.7 million riders by 203 * A total of 3600 buses by 2030 * 100% bus coverage to PMC, PCMC and cantonment areas * A maximum of 5 minutes waiting time for transit * A 100% low emission bus fleet * To achieve and ensure zero fatal accidents * 100% software-based data driven planning and scheduling * Minimum number of breakdowns * Fleet utilization of 90% * To ensure 10% of the revenue comes from non-fare revenue * Reducing cancelled kilometres Pre-Pandemic Ground Reality ---------------------------- * Presently, the passenger traffic of the PMPML (before pandemic) rested at 10.47 lakh per day * The fleet utilization of the hired buses of the PMPML is more than PMPML-owned buses * The gap between revenue and expenditure was Rs23 crore in 2011-12, which increased to Rs315 crore in 2019-20 * According to the PMPML, the estimated cumulative losses of the PMPML for the next 10 years will be close to Rs9,600 crore * The current fleet size consists of around 2,300 buses but then just around 1,400 buses remain on the streets on a daily basis (pre-pandemic times)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-makes-another-business-plan-but-activists-unimpressed/articleshow/83216080.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s recovery rate of 94% betters India’s 92%||HYDERABAD: In what could bring cheer in the second wave of pandemic, Telangana seems to be doing fairly well with its Covid-19 recovery rate touching 94% (as on June 2) when compared to other southern states. According to health experts, a recovery rate of above 90%-92% augurs well in Covid-19 management and that the state should breathe easy. Currently, the country’s overall recovery rate stands at 92%. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka’s recovery rate, on the other hand, continues to be below 90%. Officials said the recovery rate in Telangana had jumped by 5% in just 20 days. From 89% on May 16, the recovery rate now stands at 94%. IIT Hyderabad professor M Vidyasagar, who was part of the team to predict SUTRA Model on Covid-19, said apart from Telangana, many states and countries are now recording a good recovery rate. “The key factor is maintaining the rate, which is important. This will automatically lead to a better declining rate in the positive cases being reported,” he said. He further said a good recovery rate will depend a lot on the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour among the people and not just on containment and other Covid-19 measures initiated by the government. Between May 16 and June 2, there were 54,405 positive cases reported in the state and 71,637 people had recovered from the infection in this period. Officials said on May 16, the active cases tally was 50,969, while only 5,892 people had recovered in the state on that day. “Whereas, if we look at a comparison of recoveries and active cases in the state on June 2, the active cases stand at 33,379, while 2,242 people have recovered from the virus which is a very good sign,” a senior health official explained. Medical and health experts said the current recovery rate actually reflects the status of dipping Covid-19 cases in the last fortnight and called for maintaining this trend. Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, professor and director, Centre for Health Care Management, ASCI, said the severity of the virus is low now compared to previous two weeks when the active cases were high and the recovery rate was less than 90%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-recovery-rate-of-94-betters-indias-92/articleshow/83216062.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal said that among various complaints was the example of an auxiliary nurse midwife who had been giving empty injection shots and throwing away vaccines. “Someone made a video of this and submitted to the government. There have been some other similar complaints too after which the CM has given directions to take action against such persons,” he said. The health department, he added, will be carrying out a drive to ensure that there is zero wastage of vaccine in the state.

Two days after the Centre told TN that it would find a partner to operationalise the vaccine complex, top brass from Bharat Biotech met chief minister M K Stalin at the secretariat on Thursday. Bharat Biotech joint MD Suchitra Ella and senior official Sai Prasad, who met Stalin on Thursday, are likely to visit IVC on Friday. Experts said if the vaccine bulk is transported to the centres, the unit can formulate the vaccine and package them into 5ml vials. State officials said they were happy with the development, as the plant may soon become operational at a time when all states are awaiting more vaccines. Last week, Stalin had written to the Union government requesting it to either lease or hand over the facility to the Tamil Nadu government, so it could find a partner to manufacture the vaccine. In another letter to the Centre On Wednesday, Stalin said that the Union government had decided to identify a partner of its own to run the IVC facility. He reiterated the need to put to use the state of the art facility established in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-facility-to-produce-covaxin-soon/articleshow/83216042.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC backs state move to cancel Class X exams||MUMBAI: Questioning who would take responsibility if students got affected due to Covid-19, Bombay high court on Thursday declined to interfere with the state government’s decision to cancel SSC exams, stating that it was a policy matter. “These are all matters of policy. The executive has taken a decision. It may appear to you and me as foolish…Is there a ground to interfere?” asked a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. The judges said they would only interfere “if the policy decision manifests arbitrariness or it is infringing upon the right of a person bound by the decision.” The court heard a petition by Dhananjay Kulkarni, a retired teacher from Pune, who had challenged the state’s May 12 decision to cancel the exams for 16 lakh students and for results based on internal assessment/tests, saying it would lead to problems for Class XI admissions. At the outset, the CJ asked, “If the exams are held and the student community gets affected, who will be responsible?” The judges pointed out that the pandemic situation is more grave this year and almost all states had cancelled exams. The judges said under the Constitutional scheme certain statutory bodies are entrusted to take such policy decisions. They wondered how the decision to cancel exams affected the public and if it impeded fundamental rights. The judges called for a need to be practical and take steps “that will not peril our young generation”. Kulkarni’s advocate Uday Warunjikar argued “there is defect in the system introduced by them (state)”. He said a CET had been planned for Class XI admissions even though the three boards would be adopting different evaluation formulas. Advocate-general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni contended the CET was introduced to address the issue of bringing students of the three boards on one platform. He said the CET was being held for meritorious students and there were students who wanted to get into colleges of their choice. The AG clarified the CET was optional and students could take the test irrespective of the board. “If all boards are allowed to participate in the CET, what is the arbitrariness in this?’’ the CJ asked. The judges dismissed the petition as withdrawn after Warunjikar said his client did not wish to proceed with it as his prayer against cancellation of exams had been taken care of by CET for all streams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-backs-state-move-to-cancel-class-x-exams/articleshow/83217944.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Chandigarh||Khaira makes it back to Cong but has long way to go||Jalandhar: Despite mixed reactions to Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s return to Congress fold, electoral politics in his Bholath constituency seems to be favouring him. After he left Congress in 2016, no one from the Congress could fill his shoes. It is learnt that Khaira reached out to local Congress leaders and workers in the constituency before taking the decision to join the party. Although this triggered negative comments on social media, at some places in the constituency, ladoos were distributed by a section of Congress workers. In the last 24 years, Bholath has seen five contests between Khaira and SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur (fifth in 2017 was through proxy as Bibi’s son-in-law Yuvraj Bhupinder Singh had contested). Even though Bibi lost twice, the constituency remains a stronghold for her and Shiromani Akali Dal. Khaira would need a chunk of votes on party lines to increase his chances of victory in the 2022 elections. After burning bridges with AAP, which otherwise also did not have much presence in the constituency, especially with the party losing ground after 2017, he was left with few options. However, his re-entry into the Congress would cause some bitterness. It was Khaira who strongly raised the issue of alleged irregularities in allottment of a mining contract, which led to Kapurthala Congress MLA Rana Gurjit Singh resigning from the state cabinet. Rana was the power minister in the government led by Captain Amarinder Singh. In his video statements on Thursday, Khaira mentioned Rana’s resignation without naming him and added that he had to face an NDPS case due to this reason, thus indicating that there was no love lost between the two. Those close to Rana in Bholath constituency are bitter over Khaira’s entry into the Congress. Sources in the Congress said Khaira’s joining would not go down well with Rana Gurjit Singh, known to be a loyalist of Captain Amarinder Singh. After the 2017 elections, Rana made his protégé and Khadoor Sahib MLA Raamandeep Singh get active in Bholath constituency but the latter withdrew from the scene after a few months. Bholath was a Panthic constituency and Khaira’s father, late Sukhjinder Singh, represented it thrice as Akali Dal MLA. He also remained minister in two Shiromani Akali Dal governments. However, when former CM Parkash Singh Badal promoted and projected Bibi Jagir Kaur in place of Sukhjinder Singh in the mid-nineties, his political career ended. Sukhpal Khaira then joined the Congress and contested for the first time on Congress ticket in 1997. After losing twice, he won in 2007 but lost in 2012 and then again won in 2017 on AAP ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khaira-makes-it-back-to-cong-but-has-long-way-to-go/articleshow/83217946.cms||IP Singh
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Haven’t received tokens, say GHMC vaccination drive beneficiaries||HYDERABAD: With just three days remaining for the special vaccination drive initiated by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) for ‘super-spreaders’ to end, the civic body continues to draw flak as beneficiaries allege that the officials fail to issue tokens in many areas. Owners and workers of grocery stores, vegetable and liquor shops in many areas have said that they have not received any message or tokens for vaccination despite giving their names to the Sanitary Field Assistants (SFAs) almost a week ago when the drive started. “I work in a general store in Moosapet. The officials who visited the shop a week ago said that I will be receiving a token for vaccination in two or three days, but I haven’t heard from them till now. Since there are just three days left for the drive to end, I do not know if I will be vaccinated anytime soon,” said B Nagesh. A tailor shop owner from Banjara Hills, Lakshman Rao said, “As part of my job, I meet several people every day and I am always in fear of contracting the infection. I was really looking forward to getting vaccinated in the ongoing drive because it has become very difficult to get a slot on the government website. I request officials to consider our plea and at least extend the drive and see those who are eligible and did not receive the token get the vaccine.” As per the instructions of the government, GHMC initiated the drive for ‘super-spreaders’ on May 28. While the target of 30,000 beneficiaries per day has been fixed by the GHMC, the daily vaccination data released by the civic body reveals that the civic body was not able to reach the target till date. The highest number of beneficiaries vaccinated during the last one week since the drive began was 24,897 on May 31. This shows that the civic body may not be able to achieve the intended target of vaccinating 3 lakh ‘super-spreaders’ in all limits during the next three days before the drive ends on June 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/havent-received-tokens-say-ghmc-vax-drive-beneficiaries/articleshow/83216153.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Delhi||Centre giving jabs for youths to private hospitals, not Delhi govt: AAP||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi alleged on Thursday a collusion between the central government and private hospitals. She claimed the Centre was providing the Covid vaccine to such hospitals, which were then charging people in the 18-44 age group exorbitant rates for the jab, and not to Delhi government. For the last 11 days, Delhi has halted vaccination for this age group due to unavailability of vaccine. The Centre had earlier assured of vaccine supply for this group on June 10. “On June 2, a total of 37,793 people in Delhi were injected, including 29,735 receiving the first dose and 8,058, the second. On Wednesdays, however, the Covid immunisation process couldn’t even be carried out in our government dispensaries. The vaccination numbers have thus been much lower than earlier in the past few days,” explained Atishi at Thursday’s press conference. “The number of people being inoculated in Delhi is continuously lower than earlier because the vaccines are not available for the youth. Around 50% of those above the age of 45 years have been vaccinated, but only 10-12% of the young people in the city have got the jab.” Atishi said, “If the youngsters want to get vaccinated today, they have only one option, which is to go to private hospitals to get inoculated at a high cost of Rs 800-1,450. The big question is why Delhi government is not getting vaccines to be administered for free, but private hospitals are getting ample vaccines to be administered at exorbitant rates. What kind of a nexus is this between the BJP-led central government and the private hospitals? Delhi government has completely exhausted its supply of free vaccines for the 18-44 group since the past 10 days and more supplies aren’t even being sent for the next one week.” Delhi government received 2.25 lakh fresh doses of Covishield on Wednesday, which takes the vaccination stock for the 45+ group to 6,25,660, out of which around six lakh doses are of Covishield and around 23,000 of Covaxin. The doses of Covaxin are only being used for the second injections, with all first-time vaccination being done through the use of Covishield. “We have Covaxin available for 1-2 more days and we have 29 days of Covishield doses available,” said Atishi. Atishi appealed to the Centre not to delay sending vaccines to Delhi to be administered to the younger citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-giving-jabs-for-youths-to-pvt-hosps-not-delhi-govt/articleshow/83216206.cms||---

Modern School, Aliganj and the Cambridge Campus of City Montessori School, Gomtinagar, are considering the option of setting up the vaccination camp on the school premises. CMS, Gomti Nagar Extension campus, is affiliated with the Cambridge Assessment International Education Board, which is part of the University of Cambridge. About 99% of students in this school have plans to study abroad after class XII. President and managing director of the City Montessori School, Geeta Gandhi Kingdon said, “We are in a process of arranging Covid jabs for our students who are bound for universities abroad. Instead of letting pupils arrange their vaccination, we as a school can facilitate it.” Director of Modern School, Siddhartha Kapoor, said, “We look forward to arrange Covid jabs for our students and alumni. It’s a great idea to vaccinate school students on the campus.” “We are struggling to get a slot for our daughter Akarshita who is planning to pursue her higher education from Dublin Institute of Technology, England. She has to leave by September and for it getting a jab is a must. If camps are set up in schools it will be a great relief for us,” said a parent Anamika Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-campus-jabs-for-students-ready-to-study-abroad/articleshow/83217945.cms||---

Yet, para swimmer, Akal Chowdhury, has come forward to use his meagre income of Rs 6,000 per month and funds provided by Civilian Welfare Foundation, to run a community kitchen at Kaitha in Birbhum to support 50 families, especially those with disabilities, during this time of crisis. He cooks the food himself and is helped by his parents, wife and children for the initiative. The daily menu that includes egg curry, dal and rice requires a budget of around Rs 1,000 for both lunch and dinner.  Fish or chicken is on menu once a week, depending on the budget. “These poor people cannot travel for work due to the restrictions for the pandemic, so I provide them with meals twice a day. It is a small way to help them get through this difficult phase,” said the 25-year-old, a Bengali Honours graduate from Netaji Open University, who has also done a BEd. The national level swimmer, who has won 11 medals to his credit, has a right leg disability due to a wrongly administered dose of polio and has to use a crutch to move around. However, that has hardly posed a challenge for this champion. “Both my sister and I were given the injection from the same vial.

Two years on, BCCI ethics officer Justice (retd) D K Jain on Thursday found the TNCA president guilty of “conflict of interest” following a plea by Sanjeev Gupta, an-ex life member of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association. As per the order, a copy of which is with TOI, Rupa, daughter of N Srinivasan and a whole-time director of India Cements Limited, has indirect conflict because of her role in TNCA. Jain said that Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited (CSKCL) has been formed under the umbrella of ICL and that has led to the conflict regarding Rupa. But according to CSK’s lawyers, Jain has not mentioned in his order that Rupa has to step down from either of the posts of the TNCA president or as a whole-time director of ICL. “Jain has only said that there is a potential for a conflict because she has association with the directors of CSKCL. He has not pronounced in his order that she has to step down,” one of the legal heads of CSKCL told TOI.Jain observed in his order that Rupa’s is a case of “indirect” conflict if not “direct” since CSKCL has entered into a franchise agreement with the BCCI. The TNCA and CSK authorities argued that according to rule 38(3A), once the conflict is indirect, it is “tractable” and it only needs a “full disclosure to the BCCI”. Then it is up to the BCCI to decide how it wants to go about it. “Rupa has disclosed her position to TNCA and will also do it to BCCI. So, there’s no question of her stepping down from any of the posts,” the source said. Once the ball is in the BCCI’s court, CSK is planning to go by what the Board wants it to do. “If the BCCI asks her not to participate in any IPL-related activity, she will obviously not do it. In fact, she hasn’t been part of any IPL activity. If BCCI says that ICL cannot be a sponsor of Chennai Super Kings, that can also be done,” a source close to the developments said. The order, meanwhile, could be one of the last passed by Jain as his contract ends on June 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tnca-president-guilty-of-conflict-of-interest/articleshow/83216212.cms||Dwaipayan Datta

The product that costs one-fourth of the conventional ones available in the market has been installed at Kalimpong District Hospital, Kalimpong Municipality, local police station and traffic police offices. “The dispensers available in the market are expensive and not meant for the lower middle-class people. We used bamboo and waste materials like wires, plastic bottles,” said Valentine Shankar, member of the students’ voluntary organisation, Samarthan.

---||Pune||Experts suggest 300-mark entrance test for FYJC to firm up choice of streams||Pune: The optional entrance examination announced for Std XI students must be for 300 marks instead of the 100 marks announced by the state government, Pune-based NGO Syscom has said. Since there are six subjects in Std X, the entrance exam should be for 300 marks, the NGO has said. However, some principals said a 300-mark test will be harder for students and debilitating for a majority of the students who have had no access to education throughout the year. Vaishali Bafna of Syscom said, “The 100-mark weightage must be given for all science subjects followed by 100 marks for language, 50 marks for social sciences and another 50 marks for mathematics. The test results will give students and their parents an idea of the subjects they have performed well in and they can opt for arts, commerce or science streams in Std XI. This test should be taken in two parts at half-an-hour interval on the same day. Admissions must be based on average marks,” he said. Bafna said since the students have already paid the Std X examination fee and that has not been refunded to the students, the entrance test must be held free for all students registered with the state board. “As the cost for the CET exam will be less than the fee charged for the Std X exam, the remaining amount should be refunded,” Bafna added. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said the 100 marks optional examination is best for all students. “Currently, students are relaxed about the examination and if we spring another surprise by saying that the exam will be of 300 marks, it will only increase their anxiety. Once a decision has been announced, we must stick to it. Moreover, a 300-mark exam will be welcomed only by the top 20% of students. The remaining large majority doesn’t want an exam. Most students did not have any access to lectures this year and we need to look at the greater good while deciding on a policy. Hence, the 100 marks exam is the best,” Sinnarkar said. Counterpoint No need for an entrance examination in most districts Problem in just three metro cities where online admissions happen Entrance exam will delay Std XI admissions and the start of the academic year The best college for Std XI is the nearest college quote Most students in these classes focus on self-study.

---||Chandigarh||AAP, Cong in constitutional, democratic fraud: Sukhbir||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal has hit out at the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), alleging they were playing a fixed match and AAP had continuously allowed its MLAs to shift their loyalties to the Congress as part of an unofficial tie up. Sukhbir termed it as a constitutional and democratic fraud perpetrated on people of Punjab. Reacting to Bholath legislator Sukhpal Singh Khaira and two other AAP MLAs, Jadev Singh Kamalu and Pirmal Singh Khalsa, joining the Congress camp in the presence of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday, he said this proved beyond any doubt the two parties were one and the same. “The Congress routinely takes AAP legislators on deputation as and when needed, particularly during elections, and has now again taken three legislators on board during a time when the chief minister is facing a challenge to his chair,” the former deputy CM claimed. Sukhbir said it was shocking that all constitutional requirements had been thrown to the winds with turncoat AAP legislators allowed to keep their seats in Punjab Vidhan Sabha only because they were supporting the Congress government. He said AAP legislators were allowed to keep their membership of the legislative assembly despite leaving the parent party, forming new parties and even switching over to the Congress openly. “This is also a democratic fraud on the people who elected these members as AAP legislators,” he pointed out. The Akali Dal chief said Khaira, who was elected on the AAP ticket, left the party to form his own outfit – People Ekta Party (PEP) in January 2019. Later, Khaira contested the Bathinda Lok Sabha elections as a PEP candidate and lost his security deposit. “However, instead of being suspended from the assembly, Khaira was allowed to continue as a member because he did all this at the instance of the Congress. Now, when the chief minister’s chair is in trouble, Khaira and two AAP legislators have again jumped into the fray to help him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-cong-in-constitutional-democratic-fraud-sukhbir/articleshow/83218001.cms||---

The state’s circular directs hospitals or medical centres not to refuse admission to any patient on any count and not to refuse health services, said Dr Sadhana Tayade, director at the office of commission of health services, in an affidavit before HC. “It can never be conceived that any person who has developed any common Covid symptoms without reason would approach for getting admitted to a hospital or medical centre,” said the HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. HC called for strict implementation of guidelines in a petition filed by a lawyer to ensure no patient with symptoms is denied admission for want of a RT-PCR positive report.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Downpour disrupts vaccination drive, but 20,500 still take the jab||LUCKNOW: A sudden thunderstorm and heavy rain disrupted the vaccination drive briefly on Thursday afternoon but by end of the day nearly 20,500 people, including first and second dose beneficiaries, were vaccinated on Thursday at 150 booths across the city. The work was mainly hit for an hour at two mega centres - KD Singh Babu Stadium and Chhota Imambara. The impact was less at the third special centre in the Ekana Stadium. These three centres with 38 booths accounted for nearly one fourth (4,887) of total vaccinations, but the number was below the 10,800 target. Though the overall vaccinations were more than Wednesday, the turnout of women continued to be lower than men. Of the total 20,499 people who took the jab, 60% (12,360) were men and 40% women (8139). People in the 18-44 years category comprised 80% (16,289) of the total beneficiaries followed by 15% (3068) in 45-59 years age group. The remaining were elderly, 60 years or above and healthcare and frontline workers. Aditya Kapur and his wife Bhavya from Cantonment area were on their maiden visit to the historic Chhota Imambara on Thursday which they had chosen as their vaccination site. "When we left the house, it was quite hot and humid. The weather change was completely unexpected, but it made our first dose even more memorable. After getting the jab, we were waiting for the 30-minute-observation period, when it started raining. The tents were aflutter and plastic chairs were scattered all around. We ran through the rain to reach our car and it became sort of an adventure," said Aditya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/downpour-disrupts-vaccination-drive-but-20500-still-take-the-jab/articleshow/83218008.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Rs 1.5 crore seized in ED raids was a gift to Nayani Narasimha Reddy: Son-in-law||HYDERABAD: The multi-crore Employee State Insurance (ESI) and Insurance Medical Services (IMS) scam case took a new twist with former home minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy’s son-in-law V Srinivas Reddy denying that Rs 1.58 crore cash seized from his residence and premises of other accused on April 10 this year was his and said it belonged to his late father-in-law. Srinivas claimed that well-wishers gifted his father-in-law the cash when he was ailing. In a reply to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) which conducted simulataneous raids at seven places in Hyderabad as part of investigation into the scam, Srinivas said: “Out of Rs 1.60 crore found, the ED seized Rs 1.58 crore after allowing me to keep Rs 2 lakh for personal expenses. The seized cash belongs to my father-in-law Nayani Narasimha Reddy, the first home minister of Telangana state.” Narasimha Reddy had passed away in October 2020 due to Covid-19 at the age of 86. The ED had earlier grilled Srinivas, Narasimha Reddy’s personal secretary Mukund Reddy and others in connection with the scam. Following the searches, the ED summoned Srinivas and sought his explanation on the source of money seized from his residence. Srinivas further explained, “As the news of my father-in-law’s ill-health spread, several well-wishers offered support for his medical expenses. Ever since my marriage to his daughter Samantha, I have been associated with his activities, was depending on him and living with them.” He also said that several of Narasimha Reddy’s well-wishers during his last stages of life visited him and gave cash as a token of their affection and love. “The cash was handed over to my mother-in-law and sometimes to my wife. We have not opened the bags. At the time of the search, ED sleuths found them,” he recalled. Srinivas, who was a corporator in 2016, is now a trade union president in VST Company and Super Max. The ED booked a case against the accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act based on eight FIRs lodged by the Anti Corruption Bureau. The ED alleged that total contracts were worth Rs 900 crore and the bribery involved would be around Rs 200 crore in the ESI-IMS scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-1-5cr-seized-in-ed-raids-was-a-gift-to-nayani-son-in-law/articleshow/83216227.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The startup will start with 2,000 riders in Hyderabad and later expand its services to include 10,000 riders across other cities like Bengaluru and Chennai as well over the next one year. GoKea has already tied up with e-commerce players like Swiggy, Zomato, Flipkart, Bigbasket, Apollo Pharmacy, QMart, among others. GoKea co-founder & CEO Manu Mathew said that thanks to the pandemic, entrepreneurs across segments are seeing e-retail as the most prudent way to optimise sales but not every new business can afford to invest in technology or permanent hiring of riders, which is where GoKea hopes to drive home its on-demand rider positioning. “This works well for many clients whose business are volatile and yet gives them the ability to scale up with no strings attached,” Mathew said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/firm-floats-hyperlocal-delivery-3pl-startup/articleshow/83216203.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Two Dudhwa rhinos give birth for 1st time since their translocation in 2018||BAREILLY: In good news for wildlife, three years after their translocation to Belrayan range in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR), two rhinos have given birth for the first time to a calf each earlier this week. With this, the small herd of three cows and a bull, translocated from Dudhwa National Park in 2018, has increased to six rhinos. A small success but part of a larger plan to repopulate Dudhwa with the Indian single-horned rhino that once roamed about freely in the floodplains of the Ganga. By the 1870s, the rhino had disappeared from UP’s forest. Under the Rhino Rehabilitation Project, five rhinos were brought to Dudhwa in 1984 from the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam -- home to two-thirds of the world’s one-horned rhinos. Another four were added from Nepal the following year. In 2018, it was decided to translocate four rhinos to Belrayan range to give more space to this pachyderm listed as vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list and protected under schedule-1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. According to the 2020 census, Dudhwa now has a total of 42 one-horned species. But the number at Belrayan did not increase. In 2021, a cow, Himangini, gave birth to a calf but it died within a month due to natural reasons. This time, Dudhwa foresters are being extra careful. “Tigers are a threat to rhino calves but fortunately, there are not many tigers in the Belrayan range and it is a wide area. We are monitoring the movement of the rhinos and patrolling has also been increased to reduce any threat from outsiders,” said field director Sanjay Pathak. The enclosure for rhinos in the Belrayan range spans 14 square kilometres and multiple teams are monitoring the movement of the rhinos and providing day-to-day information about them to senior officials. Pathak told TOI, “Presently, we have 38 adult and four sub-adult rhinos in the reserve. The new rhino calves will be included in the total census after they complete one year. All our staff are very happy with the increase in the members of the rhino family under the Rhino Rehabilitation phase two. Their hard work in ensuring a favorable environment for rhinos has paid off. There is no threat of poachers.” Rhinos play an important role in the ecosystem as they are the umbrella species and their absence directly impacts the survival of other mammals, fish, insects and birds. When they run, they flatten the grasslands, making it easier for smaller mammals to walk. The possibility of forest fire decreases drastically in the area where rhinos stay. They also help in pollination of seeds through their dung and enrich the soil as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-dudhwa-rhinos-give-birth-for-1st-time-since-their-translocation-in-2018/articleshow/83214107.cms||---

Prathamesh Parmar had put up with family friends at Kandivli (E) since his father got a job as a driver in Goa two months ago. The father-son duo had grown close after Parmar’s parents’ separation five years ago. On Thursday, the child’s body was sent for autopsy and will be shortly handed over to his father. The motorist who hit him is yet to be identified. Parmar’s father told police that when the two spoke on Tuesday the boy mentioned that he needed a haircut but salons were shut due to lockdown. His father promised to return to Mumbai within few days and get his haircut done. “His father planned to take him along to Goa once lockdown was lifted so they could live together, and he could be enrolled in a local school,” said a police officer. The family friend told investigators Parmar had been out playing on Wednesday evening and they spoke to him last around 8pm. Thereafter, he did not return home and there is no clarity where he wanted to go and why. Four hours later, Parmar was hit by a vehicle near Patra Gate on WEH at Vile Parle. Police estimate the boy walked the 10km stretch from Kandivli to Vile Parle. “Parmar’s mother severed ties with him and his father when the boy was five. He had lived with his father since then. After his father moved to Goa for a new job, the two would speak over the phone frequently,” said a police officer. On Wednesday, few hours before the boy walked away, his father tried to reach him on the family friend’s phone but the friend was out at a doctor’s clinic and the father and son could not converse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hit-run-victim-gave-no-hint-of-what-was-on-mind/articleshow/83218067.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ICU, pathology lab required at Bolarum General Hospital||SECUNDERABAD: An ICU and a pathology lab is required at the Bolarum General Hospital now as admissions for Covid treatment in the hospital in Secunderabad Cantonment are in full swing. Keeping in view the increase in number of Covid patients, Bolarum Senior Citizens Association urged the SCB officials to set up a dedicated pathology lab at the hospital. Though Covid treatment is free, patients are finding it difficult to get tests conducted at the hospital due to lack of a pathology lab. In fact, staff for the lab has been recruited, but no lab services are available in it, according to the association’s president, Dhananjaya Chary. The common man cannot afford amounts that are collected by the private pathology labs in the city, he added. He urged the Cantonment Board officials to speed up efforts of setting up a dedicated oxygen plant too. Over 20 patients were admitted within a span of 10 days and out of them, nearly five patients got discharged after recovery. But the hospital doesn’t have an ICU. “A single death has been reported so far. After treatment was started in this hospital, patients from other parts of the city apart from Secunderabad Cantonment are also getting admitted, hospital authorities told TOI. Enough stock of oxygen cylinders, contributed by DRDO, are available. Meanwhile, a Cantonment based NGO donated 10 oxygen concentrators on Thursday. “The process of installing the oxygen plant on the hospital premises is already in progress and a decision may likely be taken within a week,” sources in SCB health and sanitation wing told TOI. As the number of patients continue to rise at the hospital, the SCB is conducting sanitisation on hourly basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/icu-pathology-lab-required-at-bolarum-general-hospital/articleshow/83216244.cms||---

Pratapgarhi has been the party's star campaigner and enjoys popularity among admirers of Urdu poetry. Former vice-president UP Congress and member of the advisory council of UP Congress Committee, Imran Masood, was also elevated with a key responsibility. Accused of hate speech against PM Narendra Modi, he was an MLA from Muzaffarabad in 2007, but lost subsequent elections. Masood enjoys significant influence on 8-10 seats of western UP. Another appointment from UP was that of Brijal Khabri, a BSP turncoat who joined Congress ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The district could expect a normal rainfall of around 200mm. Tamil Nadu Agricultural University’s agro climate research centre director S P Ramanathan said the district may not receive widespread rainfall over the next couple of days as it is being in the rain shadow region. “We don’t see any sign for showers in the next two days, but the district will start receiving rain soon,” he said. “However, the monsoon will intensify only later this month,” he added. It was predicted on May 22 that Coimbatore would receive around 200mm of rainfall this monsoon against the average 210mm, which is ‘normal’. Independent weather blogger Santhosh Krishnan, whose blog is called ‘Coimbatore Weatherman’, said Coimbatore’s catchment areas located along the Western Ghats may receive widespread rain after June 9. “However, the city has only fewer chances of receiving showers immediately,” he said. He said there is a possibility of good rain in the Palakkad pass, west Coimbatore, Western Ghats and Kerala after the low-pressure area forms and activates the southwest monsoon over the landmass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/monsoon-may-hit-dist-after-june-9/articleshow/83216248.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: West zone bucks trend, registers more cases||COIMBATORE: While fresh Covid-19 cases in corporation limits have recorded an 18% drop in the last 10 days, it does not seem uniform across the five zones. Data with the civic body shows that while earlier problematic zones like the south zone and east zone, known for industrial and housing clusters, have managed to reduce transmission drastically, the west zone is seeing an uptick in cases. The zone has the city’s posh and commercial hubs like R S Puram, Poo Market, Gandhi Park and a portion of Saibaba Colony. West zone topped the table, reporting 276 out of the 1,182 fresh cases recorded on Tuesday. The figure was not just the highest on Tuesday, but the highest reported in the last six days. The last time it recorded more than 276 cases was on May 26, when it reported 410 cases, and the district’s case figures were at their peak. The health department, however said the figures were not worrying. “We have to analyze whether the high numbers are because of an increase in sample collection in the zone on Tuesday, and due to high positivity rate. Many may have tested positive,” said city health officer Dr S Raja. “However, there has been no new cluster in the zone,” he said. During the first wave and beginning of the second wave in April, the district saw many cases in R S Puram’s dense residential areas, the crowded Poo Market and parts of Saibaba Colony. “The densely crowded Poo Market, Anna Market, Saibaba Colony Market, MGR Market and TK Market are in the west zone. But the markets have been closed for the last three weeks, which led to the drop in cases. This sudden increase in cases could just be a one-off,” said a corporation official. Comparatively, the other zones, which reported a higher number of cases due to presence of industries, especially jewellery and trading houses, and dense housing, have been bringing cases under control. The east and north zone, which were both reporting 400-500 cases each a day in May last week, brought them down to 178 and 231 cases respectively on Tuesday. “The drop in cases in those zones can be attributed to the decision to ban all industries from working, except those in essential services,” said Raja. “Once employees stopped getting infected in industries, they didn’t infect others,” said a health department official. The corporation insisted that the positivity rate is below 30%. The civic body has been taking several control measures like conducting 120 fever camps a day, trying to cover streets with new positive cases, widening containment in streets with more than three cases each and has begun door-to-door surveillance of houses near new positive cases. “This is to identify those with even the earliest symptoms like fever and sore throat,” said Raja. The health department hopes this would happen in rural areas also, where the spike in cases is due to industrial clusters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/west-zone-bucks-trend-registers-more-cases/articleshow/83216334.cms||---

In a press note, Stalin said the decision to release water from the dam was taken in the meeting that he had held with the ministers of water resources and agriculture and secretaries of the respective departments earlier this month. The water level in the dam stood at 97.13ft on Thursday. Presently, it has 61.43TMC water. As per the weather reports, the southwest monsoon would lash the state at the right time. “Considering all these, I have ordered for water release,” the chief minister said. He said 5.21 lakh acres of land in the Cauvery delta districts, including Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, would benefit from the water release. “Desilting works have been carried out on the water pathways at a cost of Rs 65.11 crore to enable the Cauvery water to reach the tail-end villages. I have instructed the agriculture department officials to keep sufficient stock of paddy seed, fertilizers, pesticide and other farm materials to facilitate the farming activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/mettur-dam-water-to-be-released-on-june-12/articleshow/83216282.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The study, which involved healthy children of various schools in the city, has found that a majority of them have low levels of essential fatty acids, particularly poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). PUFA is not synthesised by the body and it has to be taken through diet for a healthy living and growth in children, particularly of the age group 7 to 13 years. These fatty acids are important for the good health of heart and circulatory system, mental development and a healthy immune system to fight infectious diseases. This is perhaps the first study on essential fatty acids intake and children in the country. Most studies published thus far revolved around adults. The result of the NIN study was published in recent issue of the leading scientific publication, Journal of Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids. Fatty acids are essential for the healthy growth of an individual. But certain fatty acids like PUFA, alpha-linolenic acid (Omega-3) and linoleic acid (Omega-6) are not produced by the body. They should be consumed through the daily food. “Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are the biologically active long chain Omega-3. DHA is the most abundant Omega-3 PUFA in the brain, which is required throughout the life to maintain cardiovascular, cognitive and immune health,” NIN senior scientist Dr P Devraj, who led the study, said. NIN director Dr R Hemalatha said there are hardly any such studies conducted in the Indian context. Based on these findings, efforts need to be taken up to increase consumption of foods such as nuts, oil seeds, fish and sea foods rich in omega-3 PUFA to improve cognition, concentration, and behaviour among children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-kids-eat-foods-low-in-fatty-acids-nin-study/articleshow/83216378.cms||Syed Akbar

The daily oxygen production in the district is 355 metric tonnes, said the collector. Of the available oxygen, 80% would still be reserved for medical use, he said in a statement issued to the media. According to the notification, priority would be given to oxygen supply to hospitals in case the need arises. Industries have been demanding revision of the ratio of oxygen supply for their production units. During the peak of the Covid-19 second wave, the requirement of medical oxygen in the district went up to 363 metric tonnes daily. Now, the daily requirement is 190 metric tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/20-oxygen-for-industrial-use-in-district/articleshow/83216385.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: PETA’s push for vegan milk raises hackles of minister, dairy industry||MUMBAI: Minister of state for home and information technology Satej Patil, who also heads the Gokul milk cooperative, Thursday criticised animal rights' NGO PETA for suggesting that the dairy manufacture “plant-based milk products”. He tweeted, “Milk not just provides a healthy diet option to the common man but also provides livelihood to millions of farmers. Any NGO can’t come and dictate terms to us about our food preferences!” Patil helms the Kolhapur Zilla Sahakari Dudh Utpadak Sangh, whose brand Gokul is a leading milk cooperative in Maharashtra. Dr Kiran Ahuja, vegan outreach coordinator, PETA India, told TOI, “Consumers dictate market trends and increasingly they are opting for plant milk because they do not want to support an industry from where the beef and leather industries get cattle to kill. (They want) better health and (want to) help fight climate change. Meat and dairy businesses around the world are opting to embrace changing consumer choice by investing in or creating vegan foods and milk, and Satej Patil’s Gokul Dairy could opt to do the same." She added, “One of India’s dairies also makes coconut yoghurt and almond milk. Plant milks and vegan foods are made from plants found in abundance in India, they are grown on farms, and so it is common sense that vegan foods are an excellent new opportunity for Indian farmers. Farmers in Tamil Nadu and Kerala already earn over 19 million USD a year as jackfruit is now turned into burgers and other replacements for meat in India and around the world.” Meanwhile, advertising regulator Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) dismissed a plea filed by PETA against Amul for stating that plant-based products cannot be called milk. Food regulator FSSAI states that non-dairy products like soya and almond extract cannot use the word ‘milk’ in their nomenclature. PETA had recently written to India’s largest dairy Amul, asking it to switch to plant-based vegan products. Amul hit back urging PM Narendra Modi to ban the NGO. It said that millions of dairy farmers subsisted on milk production, adding that “foreign funded NGOs are running campaigns to tarnish the Indian dairy industry”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-petas-push-for-vegan-milk-raises-hackles-of-minister-dairy-industry/articleshow/83218110.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

---||Delhi||What happened to Rs 36,000 crore marked for vax: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday slammed the BJP for attacking CM Arvind Kejriwal and said that the Centre had neither a plan nor a mission to fight Covid-19. “They don’t have the vision or purpose for better Covid-19 management. The nation needs to know what happened to Rs 36,000 crore earmarked for India’s vaccination plan. It has been eight months since the vaccine was developed in India and we still see a huge shortage. BJP needs to accept that it has grossly mismanaged the vaccine plan in India,” Sisodia stated, referring to BJP functionary Sambit Patra’s press conference held earlier in the day. Patra attacked Kejriwal over vaccine procurement and other Covid-19 issues. “It has become a classic trademark of BJP to redirect any blame to Kejriwal whether the question is on procuring vaccines or deliberating on Covid-19 management plan. Where are the vaccines for our children? When will more vaccines arrive in the nation? Why did BJP sell vaccines of our children to other nations? The BJP-led central government was more interested in its image management abroad than Covid management in the country,” Sisodia stated in reaction to Patra’s remarks. Sisodia asked the BJP to give people an answer. “Instead of finding ways to evade this important topic by blaming everything on Kejriwal, BJP will have to give answers on the Rs 36,000 crore plan to vaccinate people. We need to know why and how this budget has been used. The BJP is responsible for closures of government vaccination centres while private hospitals continue to receive vaccines which citizens have to pay for. BJP is using the backdoor to provide vaccines to private hospitals while government centres with free vaccines face scarcity,” Sisodia stated. He further said that not one state right now had free vaccines to inoculate citizens. “Was Rs 36,000 crore earmarked for the nation’s vaccination plan or was it BJP’s conspiracy to earn Rs 36,000 crore by selling vaccines? I am again imploring the BJP to understand that the nation needs vaccines. It does not need to hear misinformed opinions against Kejriwal,” Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/what-happened-to-rs-36000-crore-marked-for-vax/articleshow/83216592.cms||---

Principal Madhura Kale said until the education department declares the exact basis of evaluation, it is going to be challenging to assess the students. “The government’s order to not conduct exams stated that those schools unable to conduct exams should not take any efforts to assess the students. So, many schools stopped where they were and now there is an issue about the basis of marks to be considered,” she said. Secretary of the principals’ association, Pandurang Kegar, said last year, many students were not assessed. “Nearly 35-40% students were absent from regular classes. The government has stated that if assessments are not conducted, then schools must conduct it by the routine method. Our understanding is that it means offline assessment which is not possible now. Many students are incommunicado and schools cannot contact them. The state government must provide immediate clarity for schools.” A senior official in the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education said the government was working out the exact details of assessments in all possible scenarios which would be released at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/school-fret-about-absent-std-x-students/articleshow/83216306.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

To this end, the company has extended its exclusive pact with US-based biopharma player Ocugen for the US market, to include Canada as well. Bharat Biotech and Ocugen on Thursday said in a joint statement that they have entered into an amendment to their co-development, supply and commercialisation agreement to expand Ocugen’s exclusive territory to commercialise Covaxin to include Canada, in addition to its existing rights to commercialise Covaxin in the United States. As part of this amended deal, just like the US pact, Ocugen will make an upfront payment and milestone payment upon first commercial sale in Canada to Bharat Biotech and will retain 45% of the profits from Covaxin sales in Canada, while Bharat Biotech will get 55% share of the profits. “As we work towards the submission of the emergency use application in the US, we will simultaneously seek authorisation under interim order for emergency use in Canada. We believe Covaxin has the potential to play a key role in saving lives from Covid-19 in the US and Canada, as well as across the globe, due to the strong immune response it generates against multiple antigens,” said Dr Shankar Musunuri, chairman of the board, CEO and co-founder, Ocugen. Ocugen has already submitted the vaccine’s master file to the USFDA in the run-up to seeking EUA, with rollout slated for second half of 2021. Bharat Biotech CMD Dr Krishna Ella said: “With its potential effectiveness against multiple existing and emerging variants, we believe that Covaxin is an important vaccine for everyone, including children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-biotech-ties-up-with-ocugen-to-take-covaxin-to-canada-too/articleshow/83216404.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Sources said that the girl had gone to meet the victim, Mohammed Sajim, at his house when the girl’s family members reached there and murdered him in front of his maternal grandmother. Police have sent the body for autopsy and are registering an FIR against the girl’s family. Sajim had lost his mother in his childhood and used to live in Babat village with his elderly grandmother and maternal uncle. Police said Sajim allegedly had an affair with the girl who lived in the same village. According to sources, the girl had come to meet Sajim on Wednesday night. Later her brother found her at his house. Sajim’s uncle alleged the girl’s kin thrashed his nephew and later hanged him to death. “My nephew was killed by Lekhraj, Jhabbu and Saurabh on Wednesday night.

The hoteliers said that they have been suffering losses for the last several months and it has become untenable for them to keep their establishments shut. Speaking to TOI, Arvind Singh, a hotelier from the Pangot area of Nainital, said that he has lost several lakhs of rupees in the last two months. “We have had no income for more than two months now. How can we pay staff and maintain the hotel if we don’t earn anything?” he said. Another hotelier said currently, rooms are being given only to the people seeking ‘workation (working vacation) packages’ and willing to spend a few weeks working from hills. “We do not want to take any risks either, that's why Covid-negative report is mandatory for bookings. Besides, we only rent rooms if people are willing to stay for a few weeks,” said the hotelier. Meanwhile, hotel associations said that they expect the state government to ease tourist restrictions as Covid cases are declining. “Even though a few hotels on the outskirts have opened up, most of us have chosen to keep our establishments shut because there are no tourists. We expect that the government will soon ease Covid restrictions and by the middle of June, we can have good tourist footfall,” said Ved Sah, secretary of Nainital Hotel and Restaurant Association. Similarly, in Mussoorie, about a dozen hotels have opened up recently. "With Covid-19 cases going down and people getting vaccinated, hoteliers are expecting tourist activities to pick up in the latter half of June. Therefore, some hotels have started opening up in anticipation," said Sandeep Sahni, president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hotels-in-nainital-mussoorie-start-to-open-up-for-tourists/articleshow/83212459.cms||Prashant Jha

On Thursday morning, when TOI took the ghat road, a herd of Nilgiri tahr was spotted on the scenic 13th hairpin bend. Four adults, along with a fawn, were seen leisurely walking across the road and grazing on the slopes. On normal days, motorists would halt by the 9th to 14th hairpin bends to sight the tahr, but only to be disappointed many a time. Lion-tailed macaques were also found lazing along the roadside. More than a dozen of them were spotted playing with each other, plucking fruits from the jungle trees and eating them. They move away whenever an ambulance speeds past the stretch. Birds too were spotted all along the ghat section, a rare sight. Malabar whistling thrush, Kingfisher and bulbul, among others, were spotted on the way uphill from Pollachi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/animals-roam-freely-on-deserted-ghat-road/articleshow/83216402.cms||---

District collector J Innocent Divya, meanwhile, hinted that there won’t be much hindrance to the vaccination drive as the district was likely to get regular supply of vaccine henceforth. Of the 7,000 Covishield doses that arrived in the district on the day, 5,900 were distributed to the primary health centres (PHCs) in the rural areas, 800 to the PHCs in the municipal limits and 50 each to the six government hospitals in the district. In addition, 1,000 doses of Covaxin were also distributed among a few centres. “It is a good sign that people are coming forward to get inoculated. We are expecting regular supply of the vaccine in the coming weeks,” Divya said. She said there were more than 600 containment zones in the district, where vigil has been tightened. “Vigil on border check posts has also been enhanced. Especially, the veracity of e-registration of the people entering the district is double checked.” Divya inspected the containments zones in Gudalur and Nelliyalam municipalities on Thursday and appealed the people there not to venture out for 14 days and cooperate with the administration in containing the virus spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nilgiris-gets-7000-doses-of-covishield/articleshow/83216390.cms||---

The court also directed that the prayer for interim relief will be considered after the reply is filed by the respondents. The court in its earlier hearing had stayed the collection of toll tax at the Sanwara toll plaza till June 2. The court posted the matter for June 22. A division bench comprising Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a public interest litigation. The petitioner has alleged that the establishment of the toll plaza at Sanwara is illegal and contrary to the National Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, which provides that no toll plaza can be established in the same section within 60km. The petitioner said other toll plazas are situated in Chandimandir in Panchkula district of Haryana and at Parwanoo in Solan district, within 60km from the Sanwara toll plaza. Petitioner has also challenged the completion certificate issued to G R Infra projects by the NHAI and has alleged that major part of the construction work of flyover and its under pass at Kumarhatti, Saproon and Timber Trail Resort at Parwanoo is not complete and the toll is being levied before completion of construction work. He has alleged that the public is compelled to pay toll for incomplete facilities, that too at exorbitant rates. He has also alleged that the toll road has not been maintained properly and part of the stretch is accident prone, as there is no proper barricading of the roads, which join the toll road from the towns and villages along the highway. The petitioner has prayed to issue directions to forbear the respondents from collecting fee at its toll plaza at Sanwara. He has also prayed to quash the contract, construction, completion certificate issued to G R Infraprojects by the NHAI and also to quash the notification fixing the toll charges payable by the vehicles crossing the Sanwara toll plaza.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-seeks-reply-from-centre-hp-on-sanwara-toll-plaza/articleshow/83218148.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: SSC type assessment for Class XII tough to put through, say colleges||PUNE: The cancellation of the higher secondary certificate (HSC, Std XII) examination by the state has made many principals and teachers question how the assessment will be done for the 14 lakh registered students. Many believe that a formula similar to Std X where 50% weightage is given to the score obtained in the previous class, may be detrimental as students tend to score less in Std XI due to a sudden change in the nature of teaching as they shift from school to college and the higher difficulty level in Std XI. Seema Purohit, principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC) said Std XI is taken lightly by most students because they feel it is their first taste of independence outside the rigid school system. “They want to enjoy college life and hence studies take a back seat resulting in scoring less. If the same formula as Std X is followed, many students will suffer. However, for senior college admissions, we will conduct our own entrance examination with a 70-30 rule, where 70% admissions will be via the entrance examination and 30% via the merit obtained in Std XII based on the pattern of assessment the boards adopt,” she added. Purohit said this is a way to give deserving students an opportunity to do well irrespective of their Std XII marks. “We will give six weeks before the entrance examination for preparation for the online entrance test,” she added. Practical Problems In the online exam, the college won’t be able to address malpractice and ascertain the student speaking is the one registered with them. Students studying in colleges that tie-up with private coaching classes may get high marks without appearing for any exam. “The government has shifted its responsibility to colleges. Our students are from rural areas and only 50% have cellphones. The online evaluation will be skewed. Practical/viva marks without calling them to school is difficult,” said Avinash Takawale, principal of Poona Night High School and Junior College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-may-find-std-xii-assessment-without-exam-tough-to-put-through/articleshow/83216422.cms||Ardhra Nair

Along with Covid, there will also be diseases related to the rains and the situation can get very scary. Without being scared, we have to start work immediately to not just handle Covid but also other waterborne diseases. For that, sanitisaton, sanitation and fogging are crucial,” Yogi said. Asking them to ensure that fogging was done twice or thrice in each colony, Yogi said the process will help in controlling Covid and diseases like encephalitis, chikungunya, kala azar later. Governor Anandiben Patel, who was also part of the meeting, said that representatives of local bodies must ensure clean drinking water, sewage system, roads and drainage in their areas. For clean drinking water, she said, ongoing government schemes must be reviewed constantly. “Sewage treatment plants are being set up on priority in each area. You must ensure that cleanliness and sanitation is maintained near CHCs, PHCs, anganwadi centres and primary schools. In light of the anticipated third wave which is being expected to impact children more, public representatives should carry out sensitisation programmes, especially with mothers,” she said. The CM added that if someone is unable to perform the last rites of a loved one due to financial constraints, the government is providing Rs 5,000 for the last rites.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: 972 bottles of liquor stolen from Tasmac outlet||COIMBATORE: Cases of liquor smuggling and stealing are on the rise in the district with the Tasmac outlets and bars remaining closed because of the lockdown. On Thursday alone, the district reported two such cases - two men broke into a Tasmac outlet on Sulur-Kangeyampalayam road and made away with 972 bottles of liquor worth Rs 1.73 lakh, while another two smuggled 320 bottles of liquor into Bharathi Nagar near Mettupalayam from Karnataka. The Sulur police said two unidentified people, who had covered their faces with clothes, entered the Tamac shop in their jurisdiction by making a hole on the wall in the early hours of the day. A police officer said the incident came to light when they visited the outlet during the night rounds. “Immediately, we alerted higher officials, who rushed to the spot. The Tasmac outlet has two CCTV cameras and we have collected the footage from them for further investigation.” In the second incident, a truck owner and driver were arrested while smuggling 320 bottles of liquor worth Rs 1.14 lakh into the district from Karnataka. The Mettupalayam police said they stopped the truck at Bharathi Nagar in the morning based on a tip that two people were smuggling liquor bottles by hiding them in a truck laden with paper. A police officer identified the accused driver as K Babu alias Muniyappan, 45, of Badugar Colony at Mettupalayam, and truck owner as C Rajendran, a resident of Gandhi Nagar. “We have arrested the duo and seized the liquor bottles along with the truck.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/972-bottles-of-liquor-stolen-from-tasmac-outlet/articleshow/83216410.cms||---
---||Pune||In Pune district, 1st-jab coverage has reached only 37% of target||PUNE: Out of the 57 lakh eligible beneficiaries in the district, only 21 lakh (37%) have been given a dose of the Covid-19 vaccines, data compiled till June 1 has shown. Civic officials in the PMR said coverage would have been wider if supply of vaccines to the region was steady. They said shortages have slowed down the vaccine drive, which had considerable momentum till early April. Coverage data provided by the District Health Office revealed that out of the total 21 lakh beneficiaries given first doses, rural Pune had over 9 lakh recipients while the PMC and PCMC had 8.32 and 3.2 lakh recipients respectively within their limits. Importantly, only 5.95 lakh people (just 10% of the target population) have received second doses in the district. Rajesh Patil, chief of the PCMC, said, "“Our daily coverage had peaked to nearly 15,000 jabs per day. We had then decided to take it to 25,000 daily. But shortages have played spoilsport. We are still doing everything we can to improve coverage, but a streamlined vaccine supply is the only solution." An official with the PMC said the civic body had set up such extensive vaccination infrastructure - with over 150 centres - that they could have achieved complete coverage of their target population within two months. "But inconsistent vaccine supply caused irregularities in the vaccination drive. Sometimes, we have Covishield but not Covaxin doses. And on some days, it is the opposite. There were times when we didn't have enough of both," the official said. Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 containment and former director-general of Health Services (Maharashtra), said that to tackle future surges of Covid, regional authorities have to ensure maximum possible vaccination coverage. "After all this time, we should have vaccinated at least 70% of the target number of citizens here. But we have been able to cover less than half. He added that officials are set to ask the chief minister for more streamlined vaccine supply from the Centre. On Thursday, vaccination coverage picked up with a total of 36,699 people inoculated across the district. On Wednesday, the number was just over 24,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/first-jab-coverage-has-reached-only-37-of-target/articleshow/83216466.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Further, no decision has been taken on conducting JEE and NEET which will decide the admission to premier institutions for professional degree programmes in the country. Padma Srinivasan, principal of Santhanam Vidyalaya CBSE school, said there is considerable confusion among parents waiting to send their children to premier technical institutions. However, they are optimistic about a better solution from the CBSE. Welcoming the decision on cancellation of examination, S Dayanandan, principal of Sri Vignesh Vidyalaya, said students were anxious about the exams and stressful while waiting for updates. Most of the schools had completed the portion by December and over the last five months were training the students for board exams. Most CBSE schools have done justice in terms of imparting subject knowledge. Students are not losing anything as the learning process has been completed, he said. Considerable liberty has been given to schools to assess students’ performance in Class X and give marks. The same is expected for Class XII as well. Therefore, teachers have a responsible task ahead, he added. However, C J Chacko, principal, Samadh higher secondary school, a CBSE school in Trichy, said, “Parents are not concerned about the criteria but we are prepared with the marks of Class XII students irrespective of the calculation methodology that CBSE is expected to adopt. We have conducted seven tests for the students and kept the details ready,” he said. Entrance tests like JEE and NEET are unlikely to be scrapped as they can be conducted online which the students can appear sitting at home. The students should keep themselves prepared for it, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parents-anxious-about-method-to-be-used-for-calculating-marks/articleshow/83216496.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||State caps rates of 28 ops to treat black fungus||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government on Friday capped the charges of surgical treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus after reports of patients having to spend lakhs at private hospitals came to light. In a circular issued by the public health department, the cost of 28 surgical procedures that patients of mucormycosis normally require has been fixed. The charges are graded and have been classified into three categories for Class A, B and C cities. They range from a minimum of Rs 6,000 in a Class C city to a maximum of Rs 1 lakh in a Class A city. A senior official pointed at instances of patients shelling out up to Rs 39 lakh in Mumbai, prompting the government to regulate the treatment cost. Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal disease that needs extensive medical and surgical management. A patient could need multiple surgeries, involving ENT, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, to arrest the spread of the infection that usually starts from the sinuses and can spread into surrounding areas around the eye and brain. In rare cases, it could also travel down to the lung. Accordingly, the rates have been capped for 11 ENT surgeries, five neuro, two ophthalmological, two orthopaedic and five surgical oncology procedures. For those not requiring surgery and only medical intervention, the hospitalisation rates laid down under the 80:20 scheme would be applicable. Over 511 people have lost their lives while 6,133 have been affected by the fungal infection that is increasingly being seen among people who have had Covid treatment in the second wave in Maharashtra so far. More than 4,041 people are undergoing treatment and 1,543 have recovered, according to state’s latest figures. Dr Sudhakar Shinde, who was instrumental in fixing the rates, said they studied the surgery packages from two leading hospitals each in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur to reach an average. A formula has been worked out even for situations where a patient undergoes multiple surgeries in a single sitting. Here, the patient will be charged 100% for the highest costing surgery, 50% for the second highest and 25% for any subsequent surgery as specified on the list. Hospitals can charge up to 110% of net procurement cost for devices and prosthesis used during surgery. Commonly performed procedures such as debridement of the wound, lobectomy (removal of an organ lobe), pneumonectomy (removal of a lung), skull base surgery, maxillofacial reconstruction, excision of tumour, among others, feature on the capped list. Lobectomy, for instance, will cost Rs 1 lakh in a Class A city hospital, Rs 75,000 in a Class B city and Rs 60,000 in a Class C city. A large wound debridement will cost Rs 38,000 in a Class A city and Rs 22,800 in a Class C city. Treatment for mucormycosis is free at 132 of the 1,000-odd hospitals empanelled under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. But people not covered under any health insurance scheme or those who have exhausted their cover are being charged exorbitantly by private healthcare providers causing hardships, the state official said. The state order also mandates hospitals to prominently display the details of rates. Local authorities such as collectors and municipal commissioners have been asked to appoint auditors to review bills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-caps-rates-of-28-ops-to-treat-black-fungus/articleshow/83249031.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The viable proposals in the draft report of the project titled ‘Kochi Eco Challenge’ will be implemented by including them in the budget of the local body. All the educational institutions in the corporation limits and suburbs can delegate students’ teams to take part in Kochi Eco Challenge. “Groups comprising four or five students should identify the ecologically sensitive areas or habitats in Kochi corporation and prepare a report on how the conservation of the place or habitat can be possible,” said Nirmala Padmanabhan, dean, Innovation and Incubation Centre, St Teresa’s College, Ernakulam, which is also part of implementing the project. “The students can select any ecosystem, trees, etc. for protection. They should prepare a detailed plan for its protection. Such projects will be validated by experts,” she said. The project aims at ecosystem restoration which is the theme of this year’s World Environment Day. Awards will be given to the best proposals in school and college categories. “We have conviction that the Kochi Eco Challenge programme which is to be launched on the World Environment Day on Saturday will certainly help us in introducing some quality projects for environmental conservation. We have examples where participation by the public helped us get better projects for improving the facilities in the city,” mayor M Anilkumar said. The students’ team should submit proposals for the Kochi Eco Challenge by September 1, 2021. Actor couple Indrajith and Poornima are the brand ambassadors of the project.

The helpline 7823995552 and a web portal was launched as part of the initiative, which will be handled by 100 odd students and teachers of HCC. A team with 15 students led by a few faculty members will handle calls from people requiring any information and assistance related to Covid-19.The portal provides 10 services including information on availability of beds in hospital, ambulance service, food, blood availability and other needs. The portal will be updated with more services when need arises. “Now that we are on the verge of attaining saturation in terms of covid spread, we will also be offering virtual doctors connecting to people suffering from post-covid complications like black fungus disease,” said P Pauline Monisha, a final year BCA student from HCC. Monisha was instrumental in launching the initiative through HCC, which is presently operational in Madurai and Tuticorin. She said the state and Central governments are coming up with various initiatives for those affected with covid. “But not many would know how to avail those services. Covid Free Trichy will play a role in ensuring that the services reach the beneficiaries,” she said. The portal will act as a bridge between people in need and also those who want to provide voluntary services. Trichy East MLA Inigo Iruthayaraj appreciated the efforts of Holy Cross College coming forward to assist affected people. CFT joint convenor Sivarajah Ramanathan asked the volunteers to work closely with the district administration to ensure that people get maximum benefit out of the initiative. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/holy-cross-college-opens-portal-to-help-covid-patients/articleshow/83216485.cms||---

We are going to review more districts, including Gadwal...If we can control the number of cases there, we can lift lockdown after June 10,” said state director for public health (DPH), Dr G Srinivasa Rao. The health director said a special committee will be formed to negotiate refund of excessive charges levied by private hospitals. So far, 185 complaints against 114 hospitals across the state have been received. “We have served show-cause notices to all 114 hospitals, cancelled licences of 22 hospitals,” added the official. On vaccination, the DPH said the Centre had announced vaccination drives for all categories without supplying adequate stocks. “We have nine lakh Covid-19 doses whereas in the 18-44 years category, there are 1.75 crore beneficiaries. Across all categories, we have 5.6 crore beneficiaries but have received only 60 to 61 lakh doses so far,” said Dr Rao. He added that there is a procurement policy for mucormycosis drugs and hospitals will now have to prepare a list of patients, visit the nodal officer every day, get approval, and then procure drugs from stockists. Speaking about bed availability and ongoing preparations for a possible third wave, director of medical education (DME), Dr K Ramesh Reddy, said the procurement of medicines and preparation of beds for children are underway. “However, there is no evidence that the third wave will hit children primarily. Going by the example of countries which have a third wave too this is not seen,” he said adding that in case of post-Covid symptoms in children, immediate medical attention should be sought as cases of MIS-C (Multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children) is being increasingly seen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-lockdown-beyond-june-10-if-cases-in-border-dists-dip/articleshow/83216506.cms||Amrita Didyala

Saying that the pandemic situation is very grim all over the country, S Sahaya Sathish, ACTA general secretary, said the second wave has caused unexpected damage and people are undergoing traumatic experiences. A few teachers also lost their lives to Covid-19 and many are hospitalised for treatment. It would not be wise to conduct exams under such circumstances, he said.Many states including Tamil Nadu are in lockdown and there is a possibility of extension of lockdown. For the last one year the colleges are conducting classes only online, which are inaccessible to the rural and the underprivileged students. “The online classes and examinations can never be an alternative to interpersonal classroom dynamics. Any concrete, meaningful and functional decisions can be taken only after the situation improves,” said Sathish. He said a comprehensive decision pertaining to the calenderisation of working days and the conduct of classes and the examinations can be taken only when the pandemic situation improves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/suspend-sem-exams-say-aided-college-teachers/articleshow/83216448.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||No funds to pay scholarship dues after Covid-19 pandemic: Govt to Bombay HC||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra government has admitted before the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court that it does not have funds to pay scholarship amount to backward class students due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The admission came as a big setback to reserved category students and private colleges, particularly those offering professional courses like engineering and law, as their dues were pending since the last couple of years. As a result, colleges had been unable to pay salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff for the last six months or so in the pandemic. Stating that there was resentment among staffers due to non-payment of wages, some college managements had also threatened to cancel students’ admissions. While hearing a suo motu PIL based on a TOI report, government pleader Ketki Joshi submitted that as funds were diverted for dealing with Covid-19 pandemic, no funds are currently available to reimburse fees of students under various scholarship schemes. The issue of scholarship dues was raised by Akshay Naik, who was pleading for NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, and Lata Mangeshkar Hospital. After the HC asked both institutions to install oxygen generation plants, Naik had expressed the inability of these hospitals, due to expenses on Covid patients, who were getting treatment at highly subsidised rates. Naik pointed out that scholarship dues worth crores had not been released by the government, and if they get them, they would be in a position to set up the oxygen plants. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote then directed the government to release Rs 2.5 crore to the students of both colleges by way of reimbursement of college fees under the scholarship scheme. “It should be done by crediting the proportionate amount to the accounts of each student. Their list shall be submitted by college and hospital to the government before June 5 to facilitate and expedite the process of crediting the amount to accounts of the students,” they said. “Considering the government response, we’re of the view that at least to the extent of making available funds for Covid cause, it can always release some amount by way of reimbursement of college fees to students, so that some money will resultantly come to the college, which would be ultimately spent for Covid management,” they added. While modifying its order, the HC allowed the collector to issue work order to ‘W-2-E Engineering Private Limited’ for setting up an oxygen generation plant at Lata Mangeshkar Hospital subject to the condition of refund of money spent for this purpose. Earlier, the HC had directed the collector to use CSR funds received from MOIL to set it up. “The government shall release the said amount from the date of submission of the list of the eligible students to it. Both would refund whatever amount is spent from MOIL funds within four weeks of the date of credit of fees to accounts of students by the government.” Engineering colleges ask Dhananjay Munde to release scholarship duesThe Vidarbha Unaided Engineering College Managements (VUECMA) under its president and MLC Abhijeet Wanjari recently met social justice minister Dhananjay Munde with a demand to release their ‘tuition fees scholarship’ for 2020-21 as early as possible. The members, including Avinash Dorsatwar, submitted a representation to the minister at his office at Mantralaya. The minister assured he would talk to the social welfare commissioner and release their dues as early as possible. He informed them that he had already secured approval from the state finance department in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-funds-to-pay-scholarship-dues-after-covid-19-pandemic-govt-to-hc/articleshow/83216494.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The state has managed to get two more points, more than the previous year but has failed to improve its rank. But the score is little above than the national average 66 points. In the previous year’s report (2019-2020) SDG, Telangana had scored 67 points and ranked third in the country. Interestingly, Andhra Pradesh also was ranked third in the last year. Though the overall performance is not very impressive, the state has shown improvement in some goals and indicators. For instance, in SDG 6, Clean Water and Sanitation, Telangana ranked second in the country and no 1 in major states with availability of clean water and sanitation. The state government has been implementing Mission Bhagiratha scheme for the past few years providing potable water to every household in the state. The scheme was praised by the Centre and some states like UP studied it to replicate in their states. In another parameter, Affordable and Clean Energy, the state got 100 points of 100.

He said the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had relaxed some rules, but they would not help states much in procuring vaccines directly from the global manufacturers because the latter might want to deal only with the Centre. Tope said, “The state is willing to pay for the vaccines, but the Centre should facilitate them.” DCGI recently said the foreign-approved vaccines no longer needed bridging clinical trials. It also waived off testing of every batch of overseas vaccine to ease the supply. The state’s global tender, floated earlier, received response from intermediaries and not from the actual companies. So, the government was not keen to pursue it further, said an official. Against this backdrop, Tope said, “The state is unable to make plans or boost the vaccination because of the shortage in supply of doses.” He said that the state was in talks with Sputnik for supply. The local manufacturing unit would start supplying doses to the state soon, he added. Several states had approached the Centre regarding legal indemnity, procurement from source country, transportation and duties of vaccines from abroad. But the Union health ministry officials stressed that there was a shortage of vaccines in the world and the only way ahead was to focus on enhancing the supply from local manufacturers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-should-procure-vaccines-for-state-from-abroad-tope/articleshow/83216580.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Pune||Health ministry steps up surveillance of MIS-C in kids||PUNE: After post-Covid mucormycosis in adults, the Centre has now stepped up efforts to estimate the burden of post-Covid multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) across the country. The director-general of health services (DGHS), in a letter on June 2, asked all states and UTs to submit weekly data on new cases of MIS-C. Unlike mucormycosis, which has been made a notifiable disease under the law, reporting of MIS-C cases is currently not mandatory. Therefore, experts have stressed on forming a central registry to determine its prevalence. Currently, there is no system in place, with cases scattered across hospitals. "We are trying to estimate the burden of the MIS-C in the country. As this is a condition not being routinely reported through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) or any other portal, I request you to kindly share the weekly incidence (new cases) of MIS-C reported in the state/UT," Sunil Kumar, DGHS, Union health ministry said in the letter to states and UTs on June 2, 2021. Experts said a registry will help doctors determine areas with high caseloads and possible identifiable risk factors - information that could result in a more targeted approach while dealing with MIS-C. Most big hospitals and medical colleges are currently treating about five to 15 cases of MIS-C, which impacts infants and children who may have a brush with Covid. In mucormycosis, the exact number of patients only emerged after the Centre made it a notifiable condition last month - mandating every healthcare provider to report cases to authorities. The number of MIS-C cases is currently much lower than mucormycosis, but experts said an 'MIS-C registry' is needed because hospitals have been reporting a rise in cases. "Besides, MIS-C can be missed due to its similarity with Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, dengue and many other febrile viral infections. Lack of awareness among medical professionals, particularly those working in non-urban areas, may also be resulting in missed cases," said paediatric intensivist Sumant Patil of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. Paediatric rheumatologist Jitendra Oswal said, "The registry will help the government track and study emerging trends in MIS-C. It will help strengthen state/UT-wise infrastructure and train doctors on how to deal with the condition." Paediatric intensivist Sachin Shah of Surya Mother and Child Superspeciality hospital added, "The disease is evolving and a full range of complications, clinical course and its pathogenesis are not fully understood.

According to a survey conducted by an independent community engagement platform among 35,000 users, 23% admitted to paying more than Rs 1,000 for a single dose of vaccine while 3% said they paid more than Rs Rs 2,000. Some private hospitals, citizens claimed, are extracting a high service charge and even a registration fee. As per the survey, “73% citizens want private hospital service charges to be capped by the state government at Rs 100 to Rs 200 (at hospital) and at Rs 200 to Rs 400 (offsite at societies, colonies/offices/clubs). Also, 79% citizens want the government to prohibit private hospitals from levying a registration fee for Covid-19 vaccine.” The survey by LocalCircles stated that close to 83% participants wanted the government to mandate publishing maximum retail price by manufacturers on Covid-19 vaccine vial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cap-vax-price-at-pvt-hosps-say-citizens/articleshow/83216535.cms||---

Police said an autopsy report is awaited to find out whether the child was stillborn or if the baby was alive when abandoned. “If the latter is the case, then we will charge her with murder,” said an officer. Police have charged her with Section 317 (whoever, being the father or mother of a child under the age of twelve years, or having the care of such child, exposing or leaving such child in any place with the intention of wholly abandoning such child) of the IPC. The incident came to light after the woman reportedly developed excessive bleeding following the delivery. Her minor son had alerted the health workers. Her three children and her father-in-law were living with her. Police said that she was initially moved to the Tripunithura Taluk Hospital and then to Ernakulam General Hospital. Police were alerted by the hospital authorities after finding that the newborn was not with her. Police said the woman was arrested on the discovery of the body. She was recuperating at the hospital even as the police imitated proceedings to remand her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mother-held-after-body-of-newborn-found-in-quarry-pond/articleshow/83214239.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: Worried about assessment process with no board exam, say students||LUCKNOW: Mahi Patel is disappointed that she will not be appearing for the class 12th board examination. Though the 18-year-old says she understands concerns of the government, she is apprehensive about the assessment process on which her future will depend. With UP board also announcing its decision to cancel class 12 exams after CBSE and CISCE, many students like Patel worry about results and criteria of universities as they now prepare to join undergraduate courses. However, there are some who are happy with the decision. A science student of a school in Rajajipuram affiliated to UP board, Patel says that she and many other students were taking online classes to prepare for examination. “We had put in all efforts because class 12 marks determine our admissions in universities. Safety is our priority also, but since we have been preparing for exams for two years, it is quite disheartening that exams have been cancelled. How we will be assessed now is still not clear,” added Patel. Meanwhile, Jagrati Singh says her main aim was to top the state this year. “If marks of class 11 or pre-board exams are taken into consideration for the final result, then I might not get recognition,” said Singh. Ayushi Singh had a similar concern. “Class 12 is a stepping stone towards higher education. Students deserve to know how they will be assessed. Those who did not do well in class 11 or in internal tests or pre-boards and had thought to improve their performance in the final board exams are at a disadvantage,” said Singh. “I welcome the government’s concern, but at stake is our future,” said Pranjal Saxena, ISC board student of a school on Sitapur road. However, Aviral Srivastav, a CBSE student preparing for IIT-JEE exams, said he was happy. “Had I contracted the virus it would not have been possible for me to appear in competitive examinations.” Expressing similar views, Rashika Nandi said that she was not mentally prepared for the examination. “The entire year has been exhausting,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/worried-about-assessment-process-with-no-board-exam-say-students/articleshow/83218191.cms||Aditi Singh

They demanded that the government expedite its efforts to get the state’s due share of water from Karnataka, and sanction fresh crop loans.Stating that the announcement about the release was a little late, Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers’ protection association’s secretary Swamimalai S Vimalanathan insisted the state government pressurize Karnataka to release water. “The foremost thing is that we should get our due share for the month of February, March, April and May so that we can comfortably carry on with kuruvai cultivation. We are yet to get the water as per the directions of the Cauvery water management board,” he said.Kuruvai cultivation has been earmarked on 3.37 lakh acres in Cauvery delta zone (CDZ) comprising Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagappattinam and parts of Trichy, Ariyalur, Cuddalore and Pudukkottai districts.Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to CPI highlighted the plight of farmers struggling with financial crisis to carry out cultivation. “Successive onslaught of cyclones and loss caused by Covid-19 in the last two years have left the farmers financially crippled. Sanctioning of fresh crop loans will help farmers take up the cultivation,” said Trichy district secretary of the association Ayilai S Sivasurian.He also pointed out that more than 50% of beneficiaries of the Rs 12,110 crore crop loan waiver announced by former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami were yet to get the waiver certificate. Bharatiya Kisan Sangam state spokesperson N Veerasekaran said the release of water would help recharge groundwater level. “Many of the fields in the delta areas are cut from the traditional canals due to real estate. So, farmers depend on borewell water,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/delta-farmers-hail-decision-to-release-mettur-water-want-govt-to-get-due-share-from-ktaka/articleshow/83216574.cms||Gokul Rajendran

The court intervened as his visa is about to expire this week. Justice N Nagaresh ordered Kuttanelloor sub registrar to conduct the marriage on Friday and issue a marriage certificate on the same day after considering a petition filed by Dennis Joseph Thomas, who is originally from Poonjar. Marriage of Dennis and a woman from Thrissur was postponed since May 5 last year. While allowing the marriage, the court said life and relationships have to more forward and that mankind has to survive the pandemic.

---||Nagpur||Schools can put Std XII practical exams on hold: CBSE||NAGPUR: CBSE has given schools the option to put their Std XII practical exams on hold till a new evaluation policy is finalized. Many parents were unhappy over CBSE continuing with practical exams, citing fear of Covid-19 on campus due to students’ gathering. CBSE’s Std XII theory papers were cancelled earlier, but no notification had been issued regarding practicals. CBSE’s controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj told TOI that schools can take a call at their level. “Our policy on assessment of Std XII will be ready soon. In that, we shall also address the issue of practical exams. Till this comes, schools can definitely put their exams on hold. The choice is theirs,” said Bhardwaj. He added that the state laws have to be followed if exams are being held. “If a state or district authority does not permit, then obviously practical exam cannot take place as of now. And even if permission is granted, then practical exams have to be conducted by adhering to all safety protocols,” said Bhardwaj. There are speculations that CBSE may offer alternatives to conducting physical practicals, as ‘mode’ of conducting practicals is also being discussed, according to sources in the board. Bhardwaj, however, did not comment on this. Schools feel that CBSE has put them in a tricky spot. “The reason we are pushing for practical exams is that June 11 is the deadline for uploading of marks. So, obviously everything has to be finished by then. Also, conducting practicals involves a lot of coordination with externals as everyone is hopping from one school to the other. So, if any exam is cancelled or put on hold by us now, then the entire schedule goes awry,” said a principal. Another said CBSE erred in not clarifying this issue at the time of theory paper cancellation itself. “They could have just typed a single line saying that schools have to complete practical exams as per schedule, or that we have to put everything on hold till the new policy is released. This lack of communication means principals are facing flak from parents,” said the principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-can-put-std-xii-practical-exams-on-hold-cbse/articleshow/83224083.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||RBI to give booster shot to Covid-hit services, MSMEs||Mumbai: In a fresh round of Covid relief measures, the Reserve Bank of India nudged banks to lend to contact-intensive sectors such as hotels, restaurants, tourism, bus operators and other services by opening a Rs 15,000 crore liquidity window for the lenders. It provided another Rs 16,000 crore to SIDBI to meet the short- and medium-term credit requirements of micro, small and medium enterprises. The twin moves came along with an expansion of the loan restructuring window for loans taken by individuals and MSMEs, with the eligibility limit for debt doubled to Rs 50 crore. The latest measures announced by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday came within a month of a separate facility being made available for the healthcare sector, with banks going ahead and offering loans to individuals. With several banks already flush with liquidity, large lenders may not need the refinance provided by the central bank for contact-intensive services. However, for lenders it is a signal that they should extend their loans here. “Announcement of on-tap liquidity facility of Rs 15,000 crore will ensure credit flow to the contact-intensive sectors and MSMEs including hotels, tourism, aviation, etc, which have been adversely impacted,” said S S Mallikarjuna Rao, MD & CEO, Punjab National Bank. Last month, RBI had said that banks could restructure loans up to Rs 25 crore advanced to individuals and small business. The restructuring would give the borrowers more time to repay without classifying them as defaulters thus ensuring continued support from the banking system. This limit has now been increased to Rs 50 crore. State Bank of India MD Ashwini Kumar Tewari said that since small businesses were able to avail of liquidity under the emergency line credit guarantee scheme last year, not many sought restructuring. He added that the second wave was also ebbing, which would reduce the pandemic’s economic impact. “Almost two-thirds of the CRISIL-rated mid-sized companies in the corporate sector now come under its ambit, compared with only half as per the previous threshold. Specifically, this will support companies with relatively weaker credit profiles. Three out of four companies eligible for restructuring have sub-investment category ratings, which indicates their relatively lower ability to manage liquidity shocks. Rescheduling of repayments under the scheme will help mitigate this,” said Subodh Rai, chief ratings officer, Crisil Ratings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rbi-to-give-booster-shot-to-covid-hit-services-msmes/articleshow/83249117.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Curbs' effect: Maharashtra revenues plummet by 23% in 1 month||MUMBAI: The lockdown-like restrictions introduced in Maharashtra to curb the pandemic’s second wave have slowed down the economy and slashed the revenues of the state government by as much as 23% between April and May. Revenues were down by Rs 4,509 crore in this period, the latest data shows. The restrictions were introduced at the beginning of April and by the end of the month, the revenues collected were Rs 19,453 crore. By the end of May, the number declined to Rs 14, 944 crore. With purchasing power hit by the curbs, consumption slowed down and the state’s tax collections plummeted by 30%—from Rs 15,239 crore to Rs 10,675 crore between April and May, a Rs 4,564-crore drop. The taxes include stamp duty and registration fees from real estate transactions, excise collections from liquor sales and motor vehicle tax from the sale of vehicles. The curbs were clamped down on most sectors, barring agriculture, manufacturing, construction and essential services. With expenditure outstripping income, the state’s revenue deficit is Rs 2,981 crore. The total income of the state between April and May was Rs 34,397 crore and expenditure Rs 37,378 crore. Maharashtra’s borrowings by now are Rs 16,504 crore, mostly open market borrowings. However, the revenue loss is much lower than it was during the stringent national lockdown last year when most sectors, barring agriculture, were closed. Between April and May 2020, the state’s earnings were just Rs 24,102 crore—43% lower than the income earned during the same period this year. “During the restrictions this year, we kept manufacturing, agriculture and construction open. The economic hit was not as deep this time,” said a senior finance department official. Also, the official pointed out, the migrant exodus was lower than last year, mainly because the construction sector, which employs a large number of migrants, was kept open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/curbs-effect-maharashtra-revenues-plummet-by-23-in-1-month/articleshow/83218220.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Nagpur||No clarity if foreign-bound students would get 2nd jab before cut-off date||NAGPUR: Even as Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) announced the second dose of Covaxin for 18-44 year age band beneficiaries from Friday, there was no clarity if foreign-bound students would get the second jab before their cut off date to join institutions abroad. Of the over 200 applicants, 112 received their first dose of Covishield at Nagpur University’s Girls Hostel at Gandhi Nagar and Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital on Thursday. The students received auto-generated message with the designated centre’s details. NMC had circulated a Google sheet seeking basic details as well as the name and offer letter from foreign educational institutions to ensure only genuine students received the doses. Some more have applied on Thursday. As per the revised guidelines of health ministry, the second dose of Covishield is now given only after a gap of 84 days. All foreign-bound students need to take Covishield as Covaxin is not approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). As a consequence, many countries may not permit the entry of such beneficiaries. Some worried parents and students met civic officials and office bearers detailing the hurdle posed by the extended gap mandated between two doses of Covishield. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI some parents approached him as well. “They said their kids need to join their courses abroad next month. We haven’t received any guidelines permitting foreign-bound students to take the second dose after 28 days,” he said. Joshi added that the drive for foreign-bound students would continue on Friday and for another two days – next Thursday and Friday. “We expected over 1,000 applications from the students willing to go abroad. But this figure may remain around 500. Half of them would get the first dose next week,” he said. The civic body also started the second dose of Covaxin for eligible beneficiaries at GMCH and NMC’s Mahal health centre. While the gap for Covishield is 12 weeks, it is unchanged for Covaxin and beneficiaries can take the second dose after 28 days. Following shortage of vaccines, the drive for 18-44 years group was put on hold in the state and is now being gradually restarted in phases. The city had three centres for this age group where both vaccines were available initially. The second dose of Covaxin and Covishield would also be available for other age groups from Friday. Meanwhile, 3,748 took the jab, including 1,956 at private centres, on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-clarity-if-foreign-bound-students-would-get-2nd-jab-before-cut-off-date/articleshow/83214303.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Delhi||DMRC, industries seek help to vax workforce||New Delhi: With manufacturing units and construction sites allowed to operate in the first phase of the unlock process, many workers who had left for their villages during the lockdown have now slowly started coming back. Manufacturers want their workers and employees to be vaccinated as early as possible so the process of economic revival can be done with safety. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has also sought the Delhi government’s help to inoculate its construction workers. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said that there was a significant decline in the number of workers during the lockdown, with the number of workers in NCR dipping from around 4,100 a day before lockdown to around 2,900 in last week of April and to 2,500 by the end of May. “However, during these difficult times also, we took care of the workers who were available by taking care of their medical and other requirements. With the lifting of restrictions, we are hopeful that more workers will gradually join back their sites,” he said. “Vaccination drives have already been conducted at some of our sites and some more shall follow in due course. DMRC is in touch with government authorities also for the same,” he said. Dayal said that DMRC’s contractors are in touch with the workers on a regular basis. “All efforts are being made to instil the necessary confidence so that they can return to work in the NCR area. There is a gradual increase in the number of workers at many of our sites and we are hopeful that by next week, there will be a significant difference in the number of workers available,” he said. Rajeev Kumar Goel, president of the Bawana Manufacturers Welfare Association, said that out of the nearly 15,000 small manufacturing units in the area, around 8,000 units are now operational and nearly one lakh workers are back. “It is our demand to the government to treat us also as frontline workers and vaccinate our workers because only if they are safe, our work can flourish. We are ready to provide space for vaccination camps and all supporting infrastructure and also financial help to the workers,” Goel said. “While the organised sector can approach the government and get its workers vaccinated, in the case of micro, small and medium enterprises and workers at small construction sites, the government should take the lead in getting their workers vaccinated,” said Navdeep Malhotra, president, Mayapuri Industrial Welfare Association, adding that with workers safe from Covid-19, economic activity would bounce back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-industries-seek-help-to-vax-workforce/articleshow/83216698.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Trichy||Vax hesitancy still high among elderly||Trichy: It’s been three months since those aged above 60 were allowed to be vaccinated against Covid-19, but only 23% of them in Trichy have received at least one dose of vaccine till May. This at a time when 4% of those in the 18-44 age group were covered in a special vaccination drive within a week. This points to the continuing hesitation among senior citizens to take the shot despite being a vulnerable group. Apart from fear of side effects, the hesitation also spawns from unverified information being circulated against vaccination in social media.Though senior citizens including those with comorbidities were allowed to take Covaxin or Covishield vaccine from March 1, even some retired government officials were yet to take the jab. A few have even succumbed to the dreaded infection. “Since I am not venturing out, I did not take the vaccine. I am already taking medication for diabetes and hypertension,” A Sivaji, a retired state government employee, said. However, health officials clarified that even people who claimed to have not ventured out of their houses have tested positive. Relatives of senior citizens opine that they find it difficult to convince their parents. “Only after his friend who did not take the vaccine died did my father agree after consulting his doctor. False information in social media is a distraction,” B Swathi, daughter of a senior citizen, said.“There is no risk involved in diabetic and heart patients taking the shot. Family doctors who know the patient’s contraindications history must be consulted,” Dr Senthilkumar Nallusamy, Trichy-based cardiologist said. While heart patients were the most hesitant, authorities have failed to clear the air by motivating the senior citizens. “There is some hesitation still prevalent among the elderly population. We are considering setting up a dedicated helpline to resolve their queries on vaccination,” an official involved in Trichy corporation’s vaccination camp said. On Wednesday, only three of the 18 UPHCs vaccinating the elderly population could exhaust their allocated stocks while 15 returned 10 to 15 vials each, indicating poor patronage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vax-hesitancy-still-high-among-elderly/articleshow/83216601.cms||Deepak Karthik

While the timing of the third wave was uncertain, the experts said that there was a consensus that it might affect a different age group and may be larger in magnitude than the current wave. “Precautions such as wearing a face mask and maintaining social distancing need to be continued, vaccination is the only way we can prevent another surge in future. When we compare the first and second waves, we saw a major surge in the second wave where more young people were getting affected. Vaccination is the strongest defence against such a scenario in the future,” said Dr Vinay Sekhar, head, general medicine, Gandhi Hospital. The doctor added that experience from other countries amply proved that those with high vaccination rates have been able to bring down the number of positive cases and subsequently ease the lockdown measures. Dr Raghu Prasad, a consultant pulmonologist, said, “While it is difficult to predict its timing and severity, there is a possibility of the third wave in future if the vaccination drive against Covid-19 is not ramped up by governments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-drive-can-stymie-third-wave-experts/articleshow/83216650.cms||---

A late night video conferencing held on Thursday with IGGMCH Dean Dr Ajay Keoliya, representatives of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) and Dr Lahane produced no result. MARD members told TOI Dr Lahane was positive about their demands and he asked the dean to start the process of vacating the surgical complex building so that non-Covid patients could be shifted there and the residents will have opportunity to treat the patients of their respective specializations. “On this, the dean and the district collector will meet on Friday and work out a solution, we are told,” said Dr Ganesh Parve, MARD advisor for IGGMCH. “All assurances were verbal and we are still to get anything in writing. So we have decided to continue our mass leave protest tomorrow also. We won’t join duties unless and until we get the surgical complex building back for non-Covid works,” Dr Parve added. More than 200 residents of IGGMC are on mass leave protest for three days. Their agitation is regarding the academic loss they are suffering due to Covid-19 duties. As number of Covid-19 patients has gone down significantly in the region, the residents are now demanding the authorities relieve them from Covid duties and bring them to their respective specializations. For this, the surgical complex in Mayo Hospital is must for them. Dr Lahane or Dr Keoliya were not available for comment. “We want what we have taken admission for in this college. We want our academics back. We want our operation theatres back. We were ethically responsible during entire pandemic and we did our duty to this society in past 15 months. We are going to serve during upcoming surge also. But, at this time, we can definitely get the academic block back for our studies,” said MARD president of IGGMCH Dr Rajat Agrawal. The residents have decided they will be on leave from ICUs except ICUs in Covid Complex even on Friday. “We need solution this time. Assurances are not enough,” said Dr Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-dmer-intervention-mayo-residents-stir-to-continue/articleshow/83214354.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

As per plan, the party seeks to invoke national pride and collective conscience of people, something akin to Trinamool boss Mamata Banerjee’s ‘Bengali asmita’ rhetoric that successfully countered aggressive campaigns by BJP bigwigs, including PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah during the assembly poll. Read AlsoIs BJP under Yogi ready for 2022 polls?Apart from the fallout of the pandemic, the party is also assessing the impact of farmers’ protests in western UP, the BJP’s strongest turf for years. Thought is also being given to how far the Ram temple in Ayodhya can go in papering over the caste fault lines, particularly the discontent amongSources said, the party was in no mood to shift the spotlight from the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which is being projected as a key achievement of BJP. This comes amid Hindutva activists’ unsparing calls of “Ayodhya toh sirf jhaanki hai...Kashi, Mathura baaki hai.” “The cadre needs to be charged up with emotional appeals to make them work aggressively at the grassroots, just like the ‘Bengali asmita’ issue worked well for TMC during Bengal elections,” said a top UP BJP leader, who was deployed by the party in West Bengal during assembly elections. Sources said, the party seeks to come up with a plan once the pandemic subsides, allowing party workers to fan out in the state. “For the time being, the party will be carrying out social campaigns like ‘Sewa Hi Sangathan’ to neutralise the narrative peddled by the Opposition. Political activities would be taken up at a later stage,” he said. Sources said, BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and party vice-president Radha Mohan Singh too had stressed on cadre mobilisation and redressal of their complaints during meetings with UP BJP leaders. “This is possible through regular communication and dialogue with grassroots workers. Issues related to them would be solved gradually,” the leader said, adding the party would soon be charting out a set of programmes for cadre welfare.

With this, the number of cases registered against Irshad in the last two days has become three. An Abkari Act case registered by the excise officers at Vamanapuram range and the counterfeit currency note case registered by Palode police are the other two cases. Irshad continues to be at large. Palode police station house officer inspector C K Manoj said that they seized 2.6kg of ganja from the residence of the suspect at Kochalummood under Pangode police station limits. The contraband was found in two packages. Besides the ganja, the police also seized an airgun and cash worth Rs 36,500 from his house. The search was conducted as part of a probe to find out the source of fake currency notes seized from his car. It was the excise department officers of Vamanapuram range that found the counterfeit currency notes in a secret compartment of Irshad’s car when they raided his illicit liquor brewing centre that was functioning in a rented house at Thattupalam near Madathara under Palode police station limits on Wednesday. There were 323 fake notes of denomination of Rs 500. Irshad fled from the house as the excise officers reached outside. During the raid, the officers had also seized 40 litres of liquor, 1,220 litres of wash and cash worth Rs 35,000. Irshad, a businessman who owns an enterprise called Irfana Earthmovers at Pangode, is a habitual offender who has been booked several times by the law enforcers for the offence of brewing liquor. He was arrested last year too for the same offence during the first phase of nationwide lockdown induced by Covid-19. Both excise officers and police are searching for Irshad currently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ganja-seized-from-fake-currency-case-accuseds-house/articleshow/83214349.cms||---

As per a public notice issued on Thursday, the garden department of the civic body also announced that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will be transplanting over 5,000 trees rather than felling them.  The earlier notice stated that 4,522 trees will be felled for the IMS and another 408 for railway over bridge at Ajni. Experts have come down heavily on NHAI, stating that transplantation is a big failure in the city and will only lead to major environmental destruction and wastage of public money. Till Thursday night, NMC had received 420 objection letters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ajni-tree-felling-submit-objections-now-till-june-30/articleshow/83214332.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Quest Mall will flag off the unique drive on Friday that allows visitors to drive their four-wheelers into the mall’s car park and get vaccinated right inside the vehicle. All they need to do is register for the shot on the Co-Win portal, then on a WhatsApp number (8335999000) and carry the ID mentioned in the registration. It is the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) which will be providing the vaccines – 400 a day – to the Quest authorities. The vaccinators, too, will be from the KMC. “The recipients will have to join a car queue and proceed to the car park. They will have to remain seated in the car as the vaccinators inject them and then drive to the next level and wait there for 30 minutes,” said Dilip Sen, managing director, Quest.The recipients, however, should be aged above 45. Not more than four per vehicle will be allowed. Authorities of Acropolis Mall have approached three hospitals — AMRI, Medica and Genesis — and offered them 10,000 sq ft space to set up vaccination camps. “The hospitals are waiting for vaccines,” said Acropolis general manager K Vijayan. Mani Square has also started vaccination at the banquet hall in collaboration with IQ City Medical College & Hospital. “We are vaccinating around 600 a day since Wednesday,” said group director Sudarshana Gangulee. South City Mall authorities said a vaccination centre is already functional at the South City International School with 800 people getting vaccinated daily. “AMRI will set up a second centre,” said South City Mall VP Manmohan Bagree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drive-into-mall-to-get-the-jab/articleshow/83214386.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: Private hospitals urged to reduce charges for firms inoculating staff||PUNE: Corporates and public officials from the district have now requested the state government to help reduce the per dose price of vaccines being charged by private hospitals for citizens and companies that have tie-ups with them. Currently, price per dose of Covishield given onsite at private hospitals is Rs 850 to Rs 1,000. Corporates said the charges per dose for staff (for on-campus drives) are in the range of Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200. Most hospitals have received Covishield for their drives. Pune Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad said, “Senior authorities said they would look into the matter. There should be a reduction in price for everyone, including citizens. The Covid-19 pandemic is a national emergency and vaccination is for public good. Private entities should then bring prices down to the extent they can cover costs incurred. But they should not increase the price beyond that limit.” Bomi Bhote, president of the Association of Hospitals (Pune), said private units in Pune charge a fixed Rs 1,200 per Covishield dose for corporates with tie-ups. Bhote said, “Drives have to be carried out at companies’ campuses, to where we have to send staff and infrastructure. Apart from storage and transportation costs, we have to engage teams of nurses, doctors, paramedics and data entry operators — all of which costs money. Corporates can also opt for vaccination at hospital sites, in which case they would be charged the regular Rs 900 per dose.” Dr J Ravindranath, vice president of Association of Hospitals, said, “On-campus drives for staff of corporate firms are not as easy as vaccination on hospital premises. On-campus drives need additional manpower. Also, it is between a hospital and the company to decide final cost. The price of doses could be negotiated.” Some said price per dose should be moderated according to procurement price. Sources from the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) said some private hospitals are currently charging up to Rs 1,000-1,200 per dose for corporates, which could ultimately limit efforts by companies who wish to vaccinate staff. Sudhir Mehta, MCCIA president, said, “There is a finite pool of money so vaccination charges should be reasonable. Some private hospitals have been charging corporate firms up to Rs 1,200 per dose. This price should be moderated, considering that Covishield procurement price for private hospitals is Rs 630 per dose. Then, Rs 800-900 seems like an appropriate range to ask firms that tie-up with hospitals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-hospitals-urged-to-reduce-vax-price-for-firms-covering-staff/articleshow/83216681.cms||Neha Madaan

The youth along with like-minded environmentalists in the delta districts has planned to utilise the bunds of the desilted water bodies to plant the saplings. Nimal Raghavan, an environmentalist from Nadiyam village in Thanjavur district, has come up with a plan to plant tree saplings in memory of people who died of Covid-19. In the past two days, Raghavan has planted 20 native tree saplings and has received 50 new requests from people across the state who lost their dear ones to Covid-19. Raghavan said that he drew inspiration for the initiative from his friends who had planted tree saplings by sowing dozens of seed balls during the funeral of Raghavan’s father V S V Raghavan. Since the relatives of Covid-19 victims were barred from conducting a normal funeral with the mortal remains reaching crematoriums and burial grounds directly from hospitals, the families have shown interest to grow a tree in memory of the dead. “Free of cost, we will plant and maintain a sapling on request. Bunds of 67 tanks we desilted in the delta districts have adequate space,” Raghavan told TOI. “We lost our uncle to Covid-19 last month. A sapling was planted to keep his memories around us,” Durai Pandian, a resident of Chennai, said. Raghavan can be reached on WhatsApp (99622-00666) for placing a request.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/he-plants-trees-in-memory-of-covid-victims-on-kins-request/articleshow/83216676.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Fluoride, arsenic detected in groundwater in 3 districts||LUCKNOW: Fluoride contamination in groundwater was found to be alarmingly high in Sonbhadra, the second-largest district of Uttar Pradesh, while high arsenic toxicity has gripped eastern districts of Gonda and Basti. In all three districts, the volume of contaminants in groundwater is alarmingly high with values recorded several times higher than permissible limits, reveals a study conducted by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), northern region, Lucknow. The study was conducted by a team of five geologists led by GSI director (geology) Abhinandan Srivastav. In Sonbhadra, GSI carried out the study in the south-western part of the district in which over 200 samples were collected from handpumps and wells. In around 20 villages, fluoride contamination was found double of permissible limits, especially in villages around Govind Ballab Pant Reservoir. The presence of high fluoride in groundwater has led to health issues like tooth decay, discolouration and yellowness of teeth, joint pains and dental fluorosis among villagers. “In villages like Jhapar, Siswa, Bichhiari and Pindari, fluoride contamination was found to be 3milligram per litre (mg/litre), which is double of the permissible limit of 1.5mg/litre as set by the Bureau of Indian Standards,” said superintending geologist, GSI, Suparna Hazra. In three villages, Pipri, Dhaurahwa and Sonwani, an alarming 5mg/litre of fluoride was found in groundwater, she said. Meanwhile, in Gonda and Basti, high arsenic toxicity has led to health issues like hyperpigmentation, keratosis on palm and sole and hearing loss. In Gonda, villages falling in Nawabganj, Tarabganj, Paraspur, Haldarmau and Katra Bajar blocks recorded 20-25 times higher arsenic contamination than permissible limi he highest contamination of about 250 parts per billion (ppb) was found at three places: Gokula village, Bhihanpur Kalan Temple and Gosain Purwa. The acceptable limit of arsenic in drinking water is 10 ppb only. In Basti, most parts of Captanganj, Bahadurpur and Kudraha blocks recorded high arsenic contamination. The maximum concentration of 250 ppb has been observed in Agauna village. GSI suggested that rainwater harvesting may be practised and pretreated rivers may be used for supply to rural households in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fluoride-arsenic-detected-in-groundwater-in-3-dists/articleshow/83218226.cms||Mohita Tewari

Police personnel and volunteers restricted people at the entry points. Trichy district on Thursday vaccinated 10,085 people (all age groups), the highest in the state except Chennai and Coimbatore.Vaccination camps were held at six locations of which Kalaiarangam hall, Thevar hall and K Abishekapuram zonal office saw people with families waiting in serpentine queues to take the vaccine. As many as 1,971 people were vaccinated in the six locations. Even as the public was told that they have to wait for about an hour to get the jab, people patiently waited in queues. As the vaccination camps were not held for the past four days, youths who were eager to get vaccinated arrived at the venues in large numbers. “We ran out of stock in a few hours after which people were not allowed in the hall. Later, we brought a few vials from the corporation office to vaccinate those who were waiting in queues,” a volunteer at Thevar hall said. As there were complaints of delay in getting provisional vaccination certificates, more volunteers were assigned to ensure a seamless registration process, corporation sources said. As Covisheild vaccines were exhausted, the corporation has planned to take Covaxin for the young age group in Kalaiarangam hall and Thevar hall on Friday. Ambulances were not stationed at the venues to rush the people to health centres if they develop any complications. “We will mobillise 108 ambulances in our camps. Once we receive an adequate stock of vaccines, more special camps will be organised to vaccinate people in the 18-44 years age group,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/18-turn-up-in-good-numbers-for-jabs/articleshow/83216645.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Doctors on state panel against physical exams right now||KOLKATA: Two health experts roped in by the state government to decide on the fate of board examinations hinted they favoured a deferral for now. The first round of meeting among the six members of the expert committee took place on Wednesday, hours after it being formed. Pointing out that physical exams could be risky for the candidates, gastroenterologist G K Dhali cited numbers at the meeting. He said while the number of children affected by the novel coronavirus in the first wave across India was 14,000, the figure in the second wave, from February till May 25, was 21,000.  “We are trying to figure out the pros and cons of holding the examinations during a pandemic. Children are not vaccinated and moreover, we are seeing the rate of infection among children rising in this second wave. Though the number of cases has come down appreciably, I feel we should observe the situation for some more time,” said Dhali, who heads the School of Digestive & Liver Diseases at SSKM Hospital. Educationists voiced their concern that since the board examinations were career-shaping milestones for students, not holding the tests could be detrimental to them. But health experts felt that even if the examinations were not called off, it could be deferred. “Safety of the children is much more important for now,” said Dhali. The committee had a second round of brainstorming on Thursday, as the team has been asked to submit its reports by Saturday. “I would try to give my input on whether children would be mentally prepared to go to examination centres or not. The psychological aspects of candidates, their parents and teachers have to be taken into consideration. I personally feel this is the right time to change the mind set of paying so much priority to marks,” said Pradip Saha, director of Institute of Psychiatry at IPMGER. In addition to students, many teachers who will be working as invigilators are yet to be vaccinated. Paediatrician Apurba Ghosh, director of Institute of Child Health Kolkata, said physical examinations during the pandemic might not be advisable. Ghosh is not part of the committee. “We could look for alternative options, like online examination. Though 12% of the entire novel coronavirus-infected population is children and young adults up to 20 years of age and also only 3% of the total deaths is among this age group, losing even one is a huge loss. At the same time, the youngsters should not be subjected to losing an academic year or be kept under uncertainty,” said Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-on-state-panel-against-physical-exams-right-now/articleshow/83216739.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Mission vax on wheels: Kolkata Municipal Corporation takes the shot to those who couldn’t go for it||KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Thursday launched the much awaited vaccination-on-wheels programme with an air-conditioned bus serving as a mobile clinic to inoculate priority groups like transport workers, hawkers and retail sellers of vegetables, groceries and fish. KMC began the drive from Posta market, a densely populated area in Burrabazar. Several thousands in the adjacent neighbourhoods frequently visit this market area to purchase commodities. The area also houses a wholesale fruit hub and is home to hundreds of transport workers. A state transport-run AC bus, which was converted into a mobile vaccination clinic, reached Posta around 11am and started an on-the-spot registration of the recipients. By 1pm, over 100 people were given the jab. However, chaos broke out at the venue after the civic officials resumed vaccination at 2pm after a break. Several hundreds jostled to get into the bus. According to a KMC health department official, around 200 could be administered the first dose on Thursday. Manoj Hazra, a 58-year old transport worker who was enrolled for the first dose of vaccination, expressed satisfaction after taking the jab. “It is a unique initiative to bring priority group members like us into the vaccination net. I am happy that I could avail of the opportunity,” Hazra said. Similarly, Gopal Gupta, a 49-year-old who deals in spices at Posta, waited patiently for three hours before the vaccination vehicle reached the spot and enrolled him as a recipient. “I was lucky to have received the jab. This will boost my confidence amid this pandemic,” he said. KMC health officials have decided to take the Covid vaccines to the road, particularly to the markets considering a high rate of infection among a section of priority group workers in markets that are located in densely populated areas. Civic doctors and paramedics will take the mobile vaccination clinic to Lake Mall on Friday. An expanding fleet of mobile clinics is expected to roll into other major markets gradually, said a KMC official. “Our goal is to reach out to unvaccinated traders and their employees to minimize the risk of infection,” said Firhad Hakim, chairman of the KMC board of administrators. According to a KMC health department official, the transport department is supposed to provide a fleet of AC buses that will be converted into mobile vaccination clinics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mission-vax-on-wheels-kmc-takes-the-shot-to-those-who-couldnt-go-for-it/articleshow/83214369.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Nagpur||Nine of 11 Vidarbha districts may open in first phase, if new plan is implemented||NAGPUR: If the government implements the five-level unlock plan announced by minister of disaster management Vijay Wadettiwar, 9 out of 11 districts in Vidarbha region will be fully unlocked in the first phase. However, the chief minister’s office (CMO) has clarified that this plan is still under consideration, and will be implemented later in a phased manner. As per the disaster management ministry’s plan, there are two criteria for district to be in level 1. First is less than 5% test positivity while the second is less than 25% occupancy of total oxygen beds. In Vidarbha, 9 districts; Nagpur, Bhandara, Buldhana, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Gondia, Wardha, Washim and Yavatmal, fit in both criteria. This means, the day this five-level scheme is implemented, these nine districts will get fully unlocked. Positivity rate in Vidarbha districts for the week from May 31 to June 3 is as follows: Amravati 5%, Akola 6%, Yavatmal 2%, Buldhana 4%, Washim 3%, Nagpur 1.7%, Bhandara 3.4% , Chandrapur 4%, Gondia 1.6%, Wardha 4%, and Gadchiroli 4%. Barring Amravati and Akola, all districts have less than 5% test positivity. Moreover, less than 25% oxygen beds are occupied in all districts of Vidarbha (even in Akola and Amravati). This makes nine districts eligible for unlock in level 1. Meanwhile, Thursday brought major relief for Vidarbha region with only 1,525 new cases, 3,254 recoveries and 44 deaths reported in last 24 hours. Now, 10,42,043 out of total 10,85,176 patients have recovered in Vidarbha region, with recovery rate at 96%. This is better than both state and national average. Out of 44 deaths, Nagpur city (2) and Nagpur rural (2) reported lowest deaths since March. Bhandara and Gondia reported zero deaths, Gadchiroli and Washim 1 each. Yavatmal (2), Amravati 9, Akola 8, Buldhana 6, Chandrapur 5, and Wardha reported 4 deaths. Four patients referred from other states to Nagpur died. Overall case fatality rate is still above 1.8%, but reducing steadily. Total 44,890 tests were conducted in Vidarbha region on Thursday, with only 1,525 of them positive, the test positivity in Vidarbha is less than 3.5%. Now, 21,908 patients are under treatment and most of them are in home isolation. This suggests that oxygen beds in the region are also less occupied. Overall, a good indicator for unlock in the region. Akola: The district reported 181 cases out of 3,828 tests, while 419 patients recovered on Thursday while 8 died. Now, Akola’s total Covid-19 case load is 56,239, including 51,503 recoveries and 1,088 deaths. Total 3,648 patients are under treatment. Washim: Only 78 out of 3,485 samples tested in last 24 hours were positive in Washim. 335 patients recovered while 1 death was reported. Now, the district has 40,353 cases, 38,172 recoveries and 587 deaths. Total 1,593 patients are under treatment. Buldhana: 151 out of 4,092 tests conducted in last 24 hours were positive in Buldhana. This took total case load to 85,232. With 335 recoveries and six deaths in last 24 hours, Buldhana’s recovery count is 83,295 and death toll is 622. Total 1,315 patients are under treatment. Gadchiroli: Only 38 samples out of 1,026 tested in last 24 hours were positive in Gadchiroli. Case reached 29,503, with 141 recoveries and 1 death. Gadchiroli now has 28,193 patients recovered and death toll is 723, with 587 patients under treatment. Gondia: 45 patients tested positive out of total 2,720 tests in last 24 hours. On the other hand, 63 recovered. No death was reported on Thursday. Now, Gondia district has 40,845 cases, 39,832 recoveries and 690 deaths to date. Only 323 patients are under treatment. Bhandara: After three days, the new case load reached above 100 in Bhandara. Total 101 out of 1,359 tests done in last 24 hours were positive. This took total case load to 59,046. With 52 recoveries on Thursday, 56,948 of them have recovered.

Senior cardiologist Dr Prashant Jagtap of Viveka Multispecialty Hospital said there has been a sudden spurt of heart attack cases among non-Covid patients for around last 10 days. “We have been getting post-Covid cardiac complications but have observed a trend of non-Covid patients too getting diagnosed with heart attacks in substantial numbers,” said Dr Jagtap. He suggested that anyone with chest pain, burning sensation, acidity and such symptoms must approach emergency desk of their nearest hospitals. Renowned cardiologist Dr Shailendra Ganjewar too said he is seeing more non-Covid patients coming for treatment after suffering from cardiac ailments due to increased stress. “The sedentary life-style of the lockdown phase with restrictions on morning walks, least exercises, changed sleeping pattern, overeating of oily spicy food and so on have contributed to heart attacks among non-Covid persons,” said Dr Ganjewar. He said in the coming few months, citizens must follow sound life-style practices like exercise, walking, yoga, cycling and low carbohydrate diets to avoid cardiac complications. Dr PP Deshmukh, head of the department of cardiology, Super Speciality Hospital, said stress is one of the biggest side-effects of lockdown. “A range of problems like financial losses to job or salary cuts will contribute to the stress-induced cardiac problems in the coming days,” said Dr Deshmukh. Cardiologist Dr Manish Juneja suggested persons should not allow mental health to slip and resort to different ‘stress-busters’ like spending quality time with family and such positive habits to reduce resurgence of cardiac problems in the non-Covid section of the population. Senior cardiologist Dr Mahesh Fulwani of Shreekrishna Hridayalaya also said he is foreseeing an increase of cardiac related problems in the masses to rise in the coming days because of the financial crunch and related stress. Another renowned cardiologist Dr Jaspal Singh Arneja of Arneja Heart and Multispecialty Hospital felt more numbers of patients can also mean it was after the decline of the Covid wave that they felt safer to step out and visit hospitals unlike in the past. “I would rather say that more people are now reporting cardiac problems as they are feeling comfortable to come to hospitals,” he said. Cardiologist Dr Harshawardhan Mardikar of Spandan Heart Institute and Research Centre also attributed cardiac problems to multiple factors, including falling of air quality through pollution once the transportation and their movements increases apart from work. “Once the work would start along with the normal hustle and bustle of the city, the stress too is likely to come in,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cardiologists-warn-non-covid-patients-against-socio-economic-stress/articleshow/83214367.cms||Soumitra Bose

The initiative, launched on June 5, 2019, is being implemented with the support of local bodies, agriculture department, biodiversity board, social forestry department, employment guarantee scheme, environmental organizations, and people’s representatives. Thiruvananthapuram is the first district to create green spaces in all local bodies. The largest Pachathurutu in the district is located at Kallikkad grama panchayat. At Kallikkad the authorities have used the land of KTDC (dam site) to set up Pachathuruthu. Out of the eight acres, four acres have been utilized for the purpose. On June 5, 2019, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the first-ever green space in the state at Vengode Family Health Centre in Pothencode grama panchayat. The area has now it has turned into a micro forest, with varied species of indigenous plants. Currently, Pachathuruthu has been set up on nearly 39 acres. On these plots, authorities have planted 12,598 trees, 8,166 bushes and 821 climbers. Also, the authorities envisaged a system to conduct frequent visits to these green spaces, and if required replantation is done. The district also has the credit of setting up the first green space on the premises of a police station. On the 30 cents near the Pangode police station green space has been set up and later a similar green space was created on the premises of Neyyattinkara police station too. “Through social forestry, three lakh saplings will be made available to all local bodies as per their requirements. We aim at distributing 2,32,000 saplings by the end of June and 68,000 by July. In addition to this we are also planning to make available two lakh saplings developed in nurseries as part of the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee programme,” said Haritha Keralam Mission district coordinator D Humayoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/300-green-spaces-in-2-yrs-district-to-expand-project/articleshow/83214392.cms||---

The positivity rate has been hovering around 0.5% for few days. Acknowledging the trend, secretary to CM, Alok Kumar III said: “UP has been on the forefront of Covid-19 testing. Case positivity rate for past 24 hours was in fact 0.3%, which is an all-time low.”  Adding that early detection remains the key to check virus spread, he said, “state’s positivity has remained around 0.5% over last 3 days and this is an encouraging sign.” Notably, case positivity rate refers to number of persons testing Covid positive among those who gave samples and is an indicator of the pandemic situation at any place. Average number of tests in UP these days is over 3lakh with 3,40,411 tests conducted in past 24 hours. Talking about UP’s case positivity rate, additional chief secretary health and family welfare Amit Mohan Prasad said: “As on date, UP’s cumulative case positivity is around 3.4%, which is way less than the figure of 18% recorded at peak.” He also said, 1,268 new cases were reported in 24 hours, taking the state’s tally to 16,95,212.

The statement highlighted the point that the assistant barge master told him the barge had been “abandoned” and the vessel company and those who chartered it had told them to stay where she was being anchored despite it hitting the oil platform and getting severely damaged. Many onboard tried to escape but got caught in cyclone Tauktae and were rescued later. Last month, the panel recorded the statement of chief engineer Mustafizur Rahman Shaikh (48) via video-call. Shaikh filed a case against barge master Rakesh Ballav (52) and others, saying they were “responsible” for the mishap. Shaikh’s brother, Alam, told TOI, “His brother will be undergoing another round of surgery on his leg on Friday.” Nine bodies were identified through DNA tests. Eight bodies belonged to P305 and one to tug Varaparda. Ballav’s family, who earlier identified him, now sought a test by a private lab. DNA samples of nine bodies, including Ballav, matched, while three bodies were handed over to families after results arrived. Ballav was named as an accused in the FIR registered at Yellow Gate police station. “Initially, Ballav’s family told us his tooth was of gold. Later, they said it was silver. The blood sample of Ballav’s son matched. Now, they are talking to other family members,” said a senior officer. The body of Vicky Bhooplal (30), identified based on his younger brother, Sunil’s (27) blood samples, was sent for DNA matching. Sunil is with Indian Army. Vicky, from Palwal city in Haryana, had joined Varaprada as a seaman on September 8 last year. Vicky was married and had a three-year-old son. He had been with shipping companies for eight years. “We handed over three bodies whose DNA samples matched with relatives,” said Suhas Hemade, senior inspector, Yellow Gate police station. Bodies of Jaunpur (UP) residents Vivek Singh (26) and Santoshkmar Yadav (34) were also identified. Singh was a fireman and Yadav an electrician. Son of a farmer, Yadav had two sons and a six-year-old daughter. He had been on ships since 2015. Police are informing relatives whose DNA samples have matched. “We will perform cremations in Mumbai and not take the bodies to UP,” said relatives of two deceased, citing distance. Meanwhile, an employee of ONGC at JJ Hospital said the company had made arrangements for accommodation in hotels for relatives of crew who came from other parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-was-told-barge-abandoned-says-chief-engineer-to-probe-panel/articleshow/83218269.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Kolkata||Form common pool to vaccinate workers: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to industry bodies||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, while interacting with various chambers of commerce and industry bodies on Thursday, urged the latter to come together to form a common pool for vaccination of workers. The committee, which will monitor the pool, will have members from all the leading chambers — CII, FICCI, Indian Chamber, Bengal Chamber, MCC, Bharat Chamber, Credai and BNCCI, along with others — andwill be headed by chief secretary H K Dwivedi. The CM, in the meeting, wanted the industries to support the government in vaccinating all workers. The proposal of the vaccination pool initially came from Bengal Chamber president Deb Mukherjee. FICCI Bengal region chairman Rudra Chatterjee added that they were conducting vaccination drive. Indian Chamber has also initiated vaccination for its employees. The CM said that the industries can take help from the health department in vaccinating their staff. The health department will help in procuring and vaccinating the workers but the cost has to be provided by the industries. Banerjee stressed that the industries have to come forward to vaccinate super spreaders like the workers. “Industries can take the responsibility of arranging the vaccine and we will give all support,” she said. The CM said that keeping in mind the need and problems faced by common people, there was no curfew and there had been many relaxations from June 1. The IT sector can function with 10% staff. They can operate from 8am to noon and another shift can work between noon and 4pm. The CM added that the retail stores can operate between noon to 4pm following all norms and thus there was an hour increase. She said that keeping in mind the need for domestic help, they are to be given vaccines on a priority basis as they work in several households. The CM said that the state was providing vaccines to hawkers, vegetable sellers along with drivers and conductors on a regular basis. Commenting on cyclone Yaas, she pleaded to donate generously in the CM’s relief fund so that the affected people can be supported properly. The CM said that the industries were also providing relief and in some places there are duplications, so she urged donations in the CM’s relief fund so that all people can get proper help. “Collect the money and give it to the CM’s relief fund, so that the state can disburse it. The government is there to help all people and the damage is to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore. Somebody is getting too much and some are not getting anything at all,” she said. The CM advised the chamber officials to adopt some affected villages. Bharat Chamber officials said they had adopted 14 villages in Kulpi. She wanted other chambers in providing healthcare facilities to villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/form-common-pool-to-vaccinate-workers-cm-to-industry-bodies/articleshow/83214407.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi has best facilities, but not getting enough vaccines: Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Moolchand hospital started Delhi’s first drive-through vaccination facility on a hospital campus on Thursday. It will administer Covaxin, the vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech, at a cost of Rs 1800 per dose. Vibhu Talwar, managing director of the Moolchand Healthcare Group said the drive-through vaccination facility was started at 2pm on Thursday and within three hours they were able to vaccinate around 50 people. “Drive through vaccination is the safest way to get vaccinated and avoid crowds, unwanted exposure and also get vaccinated from the comfort of one’s own vehicle,” Talwar said. He added that theirs was the first facility to have a drive-through vaccination on a hospital campus. “We have doctors available for any emergency need,” he said. Few other hospitals like Max Saket and Aakash Super Specialty hospitals are also running drive-through vaccination facilities. Covishield is offered at Rs 1,100 at a drive-through facility organised by Max Hospital at DLF Avenue Mall and The Chanakya Mall, for example. Meanwhile, the state-run vaccination centres where vaccines are available for free continue to face shortage. State health minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday that Delhi government is fully prepared and has the best facility to vaccinate the entire population, “but we are not getting the required amount of vaccines from the central government.” “I understand that many people who have taken the first jab of Covaxin are not getting the scheduled second jab in Delhi. The situation has become like this because of the mismanagement on the behalf of the central government. They have changed the schedule of vaccination. If the Centre had given us the required number of vaccines, then no problem should have happened. But they are not providing vaccines. We are hopeful that people who are waiting for the Covaxin second dose will get it as early as possible,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-has-best-facilities-but-not-getting-enough-vaccines-jain/articleshow/83216815.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In hospital for month and coming out Covid -ve to tell the story||NAGPUR: Techie Gaurav Chatterjee, 30, and Neelam Khandale, who was eight months pregnant, had no hopes. Infected with Covid, both landed at the Alexis Hospital in the city with low oxygen and high infection levels. There were moments when doctors too thought that the battle was lost for the two. After 28 days of hospitalization, Gaurav was discharged on Wednesday while Neelam returned home a week ago after a 45-day state in the hospital. She is due to deliver by the end of this month or July first week.TOI spoke with Gaurav at the hospital and also Neelam’s husband Jeetendra, who is an engineer working at Mumbai, over phone. Amid the despair, the patients and their kin kept hopes high, they said. Doctors also attribute their recovery to team’s efforts and patients’ willpower.Initially, Neelam was being treated at home but had to visit hospital every day. “After three days, her oxygen level dipped to 70. On April 17, she was admitted and finally discharged on May 25,” said Jeetendra.There were days when 5 patients were dying every day, “but I constantly boosted her courage”. “I secured special permission to be with her in the ward. The anaesthesia during tracheostomy (inserting tube in windpipe to help breath) could have harmed the baby, but the child survived,” said Jeetendra.“The doctors often counselled her about the threat to the baby. One day, the woman next to her passed away and that broke Neelam’s courage too. Along with the doctors, I tried to keep her spirits high and she slowly recovered,” said Jeetendra.At home, Neelam is maintaining an oxygen level of 96 as the family awaits the second child.“I had come to Nagpur and was set to take a job abroad when I got infected. Even my father was hospitalized due to Covid and a number of other acquaintances too were diagnosed positive. After some days I stated feeling breathless. Even walking to the wash room left me panting and I was at the ICU after getting in the emergency ward here first,” said Gaurav.“I could see people and hear voices. I knew there was something wrong with me but deep inside I felt everything would be okay soon. I just wanted dada (elder brother to be with me). I still remember the day when I saw him standing in a PPE kit, and that was the turning point,” said Gaurav, now readying to go home.Brother Saurav came to Nagpur from Canada after changing five flights. “Gaurav’s HRCT level was more than 20, which made it a rather critical case. Even with 100% oxygen he was not being able to maintain the normal oxygen level. At at one point, the family had planned to air lift him to Mumbai,” said Dr Nitin Shinde who was treating him. The patient’s willpower also helped.“We had to take certain tough decisions,. The question was about immunity and saving a life. During Gaurav’s time, medicines like tociluzumab were not available anywhere. We took a call and injected him with a dose of infliximab and it worked,” said Dr Manoj Pethe.Infliximab is an injection given to patients of rheumatoid arthritis to reduce inflammation. “This worked for Gaurav and the inflammation in his lungs caused due to Covid reduced,” said Dr Pethe.Dr Rashmi Shinde, the gynaecologist treating Neelam, said, “Her requirement of oxygen support only increased by the day and finally she was put on the ventilator. At that time, we felt it would be tough to save her. But the oxygen support was aggressively continued and slowly she began to respond.”“The baby was also constantly monitored during the days and is now doing well,” said Dr Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-hospital-for-month-and-coming-out-covid-ve-to-tell-the-story/articleshow/83214405.cms||Shishir Arya

On Wednesday, Covid vaccination began at Kolgustia primary health care centre. Fifty people were vaccinated. There were allegations that only Trinamool supporters were chosen for vaccination. Local BJP leader Ashok Singha alleged: “When some BJP workers went there demanding vaccines, Trinamool supporters attacked them. Some BJP workers were assaulted. They even opened fire.” However, Bengal’s cooperative minister Arup Roy rubbished the claims. “There was no discrimination on the basis of political colour. But BJP tried to discredit the Trinamool workers. Even though there was no vaccination on Thursday, they came and started instigating our workers. They attacked our workers and a clash erupted.” Howrah chief medical officer (health) Netai Chandra Mandal said, “There was vaccination on Wednesday, but on Thursday, there was no scheduled vaccination at the health centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-bjp-clash-over-vax-drive/articleshow/83214428.cms||Rupak Banerjee

Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Delhi who works in a private firm, is among those who is contemplating shifting to the hills for some time. “The Covid-19 situation is very bad in Delhi. My wife and I decided that we should get away from the city for some time and that is why, I have started making queries regarding getting rental accommodation for six months in Pithoragarh where the Covid-19 situation is not so extreme. Since I am presently working from home and the children are also taking online classes, we feel that we can make the shift for a few months.” Kishore Pant, a house owner in Berinag, said that he had received calls from people in Delhi, Bhopal as well as other cities seeking to take homes on rent for around 6 to 8 months. “The only mandatory requirement that they have is that the area should have good internet connectivity so that they can continue with their work online,” he added. Puran Pande, a hotelier in Munsyari said that he, too, has been getting calls for long-duration stays. “A person called from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh and enquired about rental accommodation for two months whereas at least 10 persons have asked for long-duration rental accommodation, and are ready to stay anywhere in the hills,” he said. In view of the queries, some homestays have started offering monthly packages. Charu Joshi who runs a six-room homestay at Bhimtal near Nainital told TOI, “Earlier we were charging on a daily or weekly basis but now that there are more enquiries about long stays, we are providing monthly rates and have slashed the charges as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/many-look-to-book-long-stays-in-hills-to-escape-covid-surge-in-cities/articleshow/82376323.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Lucknow||Mayawati sacks 2 party veterans on charges of anti-party activities||LUCKNOW: In a move that surprised many within the party and leaves BSP highly vulnerable ahead of the 2022 UP Assembly polls, party chief Mayawati on Thursday expelled two of its senior most leaders, Lalji Verma and Ram Achal Rajbhar, for anti-party activities during the just-concluded panchayat polls. Verma was the head of BSP legislative party and a former minister CL Verma. Rajbhar, a five-time MLA and a BSP veteran was former state president of the party. Verma has been replaced as chief of the legislative party by two-time Azamgarh MLA Shah Alam. The move also leaves the party with just seven MLAs, out of 19 who were originally elected in 2017. In October 2020, Mayawati had suspended seven MLAs on charges of conspiring against the party and trying to sabotage the election of BSP’s Rajya Sabha candidate Ramji Gautam. The seven MLAs, who were finally expelled, were in touch with the Samajwadi Party, Mayawati had said. Earlier, two other MLAs had rebelled too while one, Ritesh Pandey, became an MP in 2019. His seat went to SP in October 2020 bypolls. The move also leaves the party with just seven MLAs, out of 19 originally elected in 2017. In October 2020, party chief Mayawati had suspended seven MLAs on charges of conspiring against the party and trying to sabotage the election of BSP’s Rajya Sabha candidate Ramji Gautam. The seven MLAs, Mayawati had said, were in touch with the Samajwadi Party. Verma and Rajbhar were MLAs from Katehari and Akbarpur respectively, both part of the Ambedkar Nagar constituency, a BSP stronghold. Verma, who has held several important portfolios including finance under the previous BSP governments, told TOI that he was making efforts to speak to Mayawati but had not been successful till Thursday evening. He accused another party leader from Ambedkar Nagar, Ghanshyam Singh Kharwar, of having lied to the party chief about him, which led to the action against him. “Kharwar has created misinformation about me, saying that I am planning to move to SP or BJP. I have been trying to talk to Behenji but have not been successful. I was down with Covid when the panchayat elections took place and in hospital. I have called senior party leader SC Mishra also but he has not taken my call. Right now I am in touch with other party members to see what can be done,” Verma told TOI, adding that he had learnt about his expulsion from the party through a press note issued by the BSP. He added that when he was unwell, Mayawati had called him thrice to ask about his health and had assured him of all help. “I may quit politics completely if things do not work out with BSP,” he said. Rajbhar was UP BSP president till 2018 after which he was appointed joint national general secretary. He also was a minister in all four governments headed by Mayawati in UP. At the time of his expulsion, he did not hold any position in the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-sacks-2-party-veterans-on-charges-of-anti-party-activities/articleshow/83218273.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||India||Covid-19 forced ordinances, Kerala topped with 81: Study||NEW DELHI: Kerala promulgated the highest number (81) of ordinances followed by Karnataka (24), Uttar Pradesh (23), Maharashtra (21) and Andhra Pradesh (16) during Covid-hit 2020 when assemblies in most of the states had sat for far fewer days compared to their average sittings during 2016-19. Data of 19 state legislatures, including UT of Delhi, analysed by not-for-profit organisation PRS Legislative, show that on average, they issued 14 ordinances over the last year. This number was, however, skewed by Kerala with 81 ordinances. “Nearly half of these 81 ordinances were ones that were re-promulgated, i.e. the same ordinance was issued again after an intervening session,” said PRS in its report on ‘annual review of state laws’, analysing available data on states that account for 90% of India’s population. An ordinance is promulgated when the assembly or Parliament is not in session and immediate action is required. It is in force until six weeks after the next meeting of the legislature. The government can go for its repromulgation if it’s not enacted during the session. Though all governments take the ordinance route to make laws, the decision is invariably criticised by the opposition as it is seen as bypassing the legislature and scrutiny of elected representatives. The PRS Legislative noted that states on average had last year enacted 20 laws (excluding appropriation laws). While Karnataka passed the highest number of laws (55), followed by Andhra Pradesh (41), Kerala, which had enacted a yearly average of 23 laws in the preceding three years, used the ordinance route for making laws and only legislated three laws in 2020. The report also analysed passing of bills and time taken by state assemblies in the process, and found that state legislatures had passed “most bills without detailed scrutiny”. The states had passed an average of 22 Bills (excluding Appropriation Bills) in 2020 when Karnataka passed 61 Bills, the highest in the country. The lowest was by Delhi, which passed one Bill, followed by West Bengal and Kerala, which passed two and three Bills, respectively. As far as time taken for passing the Bills is concerned, 59% of the Bills were passed on the same day that they were introduced in the legislature whereas 14% were passed within a day of being introduced. “States that passed all Bills on the same day as their introduction include Bihar (13), Jharkhand (8), Madhya Pradesh (5), and Punjab (26), "said the report, released on Thursday. Haryana passed 34 out of 35 Bills and Uttar Pradesh 32 out of 37 Bills on the same day as their introduction. In 2020, 19 states met for an average of 18 days in the year as sittings were affected due to Covid-19. Between 2016 and 2019, these 19 states met for an average of 29 days a year. Times ViewLegislatures are fundamental to democracy. Ordinances bypass them. Under special circumstances, they are fine. But using them with abandon and as a first option rather than a last resort is unhealthy. Both states and Centre should keep this in mind.Data show that Karnataka (31 days) met for the highest number of days, followed by Rajasthan (29 days), and Himachal Pradesh (25 days). Kerala dropped from an average of 53 days in the previous four years to meeting for just 20 days in 2020, said the PRS Legislative while noting that the Parliament had met for 33 days in 2020. At present, there are 30 state legislatures in the country, including in the two union territories (UTs) of Delhi and Puducherry. The PRS focused on the legislative work performed by states in the calendar year 2020. It is based on data compiled from state legislature websites and state gazettes. Figures of northeastern states, Odisha, Uttarakhand and Puducherry were not analysed for this report. “Information and data on state legislatures is not easily available. While some state legislatures publish data on a regular basis, many do not have a systematic way of reporting legislative proceedings and business,” said the PRS Legislative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-forced-ordinances-kerala-topped-with-81-study/articleshow/83221712.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 49 convicts say no to parole over Covid fear||PUNE: Factors like assured food, medical facilities, prospect of quick vaccination, prevailing Covid concerns outside and poor living conditions back home have prompted at least 49 convicts in state jails to refuse emergency parole despite being eligible for such relief, additional director-general of prisons Sunil Ramanand said. “Many undertrial prisoners (UPs), too, are reluctant to apply for temporary bail, for which they are eligible, as part of the ongoing exercise to decongest prisons to check the spread of Covid-19 virus,” he added. “All prisons are attached to Covid care facilities. If an inmate develops Covid symptoms, he is given medical aid and is shifted to the facility,” Ramanand said. “Besides, the inmates feel assured of medical facilities, quality food and maintenance of proper social distancing norms,” he added. According to the Supreme Court directives issued last year, the UPs involved in offences attracting punishment of less than seven years and convicts serving less than seven years’ jail sentences are eligible for temporary bail and emergency parole, respectively. Ramanand said, “Those who have refused to apply for parole have cited varied reasons ranging from poverty back home, lack of medical facilities, employment and food in their areas. At the same time, the vaccination drive is picking up and they want to get vaccinated in the prison only.” “So far, 4,000 inmates have been vaccinated with the first dose across the state,” he added. The ADG (prisons) said, “In a way, the reluctance of the convicts to opt for parole is an indication that the prison administration is managing the jails and the Covid situation in a fairly effective manner.” A senior prison officer told TOI, “Some convicts say life outside jail is difficult due to Covid restrictions, apart from livelihood issues. From job to food, there are basic questions they will have to address if they step out of the prison. Many live in slum pockets and fear contracting Covid infection if they go back home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/49-convicts-say-no-to-parole-over-covid-fear/articleshow/83214528.cms||---

The woman had recently approached the Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner, Krishna Prakash, to narrate her woes. Subsequently, the arrests were made. The police have applied charges under sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offence), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code, and the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act in the case. Krishna Prakash said the woman and the suspects had been residing in the same locality. “One of the arrested suspects had recorded the woman while her friend was forcing himself on her,” he said. “The suspects then raped the woman by threatening her to upload the video on social media. Her friend also shared the video with four more suspects, including two minors. They too blackmailed and raped her,” Krishna Prakash said.

---||Delhi||Not caught red-handed, no recovery of remdesivir made, accused gets bail||New Delhi: A Delhi court released a man accused of black marketing remdesivir injections meant for treating Covid-19, after finding out that he was not apprehended red-handed and no recovery was made from him. Additional sessions judge Ashutosh Kumar observed that accused Deepak Narang’s role was on a “lesser footing” than other accused persons involved in the case and there was nothing on record to suggest that he was in any way a beneficiary of the alleged transaction. The case stems from a complaint lodged on May 5, 2020, when it came to police’s knowledge that one Aakash Jain was allegedly black marketing remdesivir injections. The complainant in the case had ordered an injection from Jain when the latter was apprehended and according to the police the injection appeared to be a “duplicate”. Jain then purportedly disclosed the names of the applicant among others as his associates. The additional prosecutor opposed the bail, stating the offence was serious in nature and relied on a purported conference call of all accused persons to contend there being a conspiracy. The court, however, pointed out that nothing in the investigating officer’s (IO) reply indicated that the applicant was aware of the fact that the injection was spurious. It was also learnt that Jain’s disclosure of the Narang’s role was not legally admissible against the latter. “Nowhere from the reply of the IO or submissions of the additional public prosecutor does it appear that the applicant/accused was in any way a beneficiary of the said transaction,” the court observed. It also came on record that other accused, namely Rishi and Bharat Bhatia, had not joined the investigation and were absconding. The court noted that the IO had not obtained non-bailable warrants for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-caught-red-handed-no-recovery-of-remdesivir-made-accused-gets-bail/articleshow/83216966.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The police said the three would visit places in the Hinjewadi, Hadapsar, Wanowrie and Bharati Vidyapeeth areas where construction workers stay and steal their ornaments and cellphones by breaking into their shantis at night. A police team, led by senior inspector Prasad Gokule, arrested Suresh Vaishnav (26) of Bhor taluka and detained his two minor accomplices. Vaishnav has three vehicle theft cases against his name. The police said his aides, both aged 15 years, minors had 19 cases of vehicle theft registered against them. “The suspects would travel to the housing colonies of construction workers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad at night in an autorickshaw,” inspector Ambarish Deshmukh said. “The minors would enter the shanties by opening the door locks through the gaps. They would pick up the cellphones and other valuables and flee the scene,” Deshmukh said, adding that the three had stolen such valuables from Bhor taluka also. Deshmukh said, “We have traced the owners of 11 cellphones and gold ornaments.” The police are yet to trace such people who have gone to their home towns because of the Covid-imduced restrictions in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trio-in-net-for-stealing-11g-gold-33-cellphones/articleshow/83214560.cms||---

The others were similar yet variously priced, else not properly packaged. The study assessed pulse oximeters being sold in the open markets of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane and elsewhere in Maharashtra. Dr Manohar Kamath, honorary secretary of CGSI, said, “While 40 pulse oximeter samples did not comply with standard specifications. Most other or 85% did comply but faced other issues.” CGSI said poor quality oximeters mean that a patient would never know when his oxygen saturation levels drop or will trigger panic in others with normal oxygen levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-study-finds-15-oximeters-in-market-of-poor-quality/articleshow/83218304.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Pune||Motorcyclist knocks down man on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass||Pune: A 31-year-old man died after being hit by a speeding motorcycle while he was crossing the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass at Chandni Chowk on Thursday evening. The motorcyclist also sustained serious injuries in the accident, police said. The Warje police identified the deceased as Sheetalraj Vishwas Patil, a resident of Karve Road. The police said the motorcycle rider was injured in the accident and taken to a nearby hospital.Sub-inspector Abhijit Patil of the Warje police said, “The motorcycle rider was headed for Katraj from Hinjewadi around 6.15pm when Patil was crossing the road. The biker was speeding and failed to stop the two-wheeler after spotting Patil in the middle of the road.”Patil was walking back home after the day’s work when the accident occurred. “We are yet to record statements of his family members and friends. No one from the motorcycle rider’s family has, however, approached us so far. We will study how the accident occurred before registering a case,” the officer said. The accident triggered heavy traffic snarl in the area. Vehicular movement remained affected on the bypass for nearly an hour.Accidents have been frequent on the bypass, much to the concern of people using the road. The traffic police and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had last year decided to double the number of rumbler strips between new Katraj tunnel and Navale bridge, after discovering that the existing strips have failed to slow down cars and trucks on the accident prone stretch. Following a string of serious accidents involving speeding heavy vehicles near the bridge, rumbler strips were affixed at different spots on this stretch of the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass.Three persons were killed and 18 others were injured, one of them critically, in seven accidents occurring within a span of six hours since 4.30am on January 11 on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. Six of these accidents had occurred at different spots within a one-km stretch of each other along the approach route to Bhumkar bridge at Narhe. The seventh accident had occurred near the Kiwale bridge, which is 29km from Bhumkar bridge towards the Dehu Road end of the 40-km long bypass linking the Mumbai and Bengaluru highways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/motorcyclist-knocks-down-man-on-katraj-dehu-road-bypass/articleshow/83214633.cms||---

Kadam said, “Lalwani, who is unemployed, does not have criminal antecedents. We are questioning him to find out if he has used the same modus operandi to cheat other people encountering problems in withdrawing cash from ATMs in Hadapsar and adjoining areas.” The woman in her FIR stated, “I had visited the ATM to withdraw cash around 1.30pm on May 4. The suspect told me that the machine was not working and told me to visit another machine. He followed me when I visited another ATM and stole the PIN while I was withdrawing cash. He also replaced my debit card with a defunct one.” The FIR read, “The suspect misused her card and withdrew Rs15,000 from an ATM. The woman realised that her card had been replaced after she received an SMS about the transaction.” Kadam said, “At the time, the woman did not register a police complaint, nor did she file a complaint plea with the cyber police immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-arrested-for-cheating-woman-at-atm-kiosk/articleshow/83214647.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks Hany Babu Tharayil’s health report by June 14||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday called for a health update by June 14 from specialist doctors on Professor Hany Babu Tharayil’s condition. The HC continued his hospitalisation and granted his wife, mother and daughter permission to visit him at Breach Candy Hospital. The hospital in a report said Babu was ready for discharge. But the HC said he required further examination on how he could be cared for while convalescing. Babu’s counsel Yug Chaudhary said if the hospital was discharging him, he may be sent to ‘house arrest’ and not to jail where conditions are not conducive since the discharge report mentions swelling in his optical nerves. “We cannot agree for a house arrest unless we hear the matter fully on merit,” said the vacation bench of Justices S S Shinde and Abhay Ahuja, adjourning the matter, after National Investigation Agency (NIA) counsel Sandesh Patil opposed the ‘house arrest’ plea. The HC will on June 15 hear Babu’s plea for ‘house arrest’ over judicial custody. The bench took all present at the virtual hearing by surprise when mid- hearing it referred to a recent article penned by an advocate, an associate of Babu’s counsel Yug Chaudhary, in a matter of another co-accused Fr Stan Swamy’s bail plea. “If your associate or you feel that by writing articles in the newspapers, when you are appearing in the matters, that you will succeed, then it is your choice,” the judges said.  “Unless you have faith in the system, how will you assist us…We are the last to say there should be some restriction of freedom of expression but an advocate arguing before us should have faith in us,’’ the judges remarked. “We are not party to the earlier bench order (referred to in the article). We do not think it is ethical or professional in identical matters (to write) …that is not acceptable.” Chaudhary said, “I hope your lordships are not saying that your lordships cannot be criticised for actions your lordships take.” He said that he had not written anything about the cases he appears in and, if he does, he can be “rightly rebuked”. He added he had a right to write and also be heard and would continue to practice both. The HC said it only wished to convey congenially that “advocates arguing before us must have faith in us, in the system.’’ Chaudhary said he had great faith and that is why he was before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-seeks-hany-babus-health-report-by-june-14/articleshow/83218322.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Lucknow||Mainpuri’s Sarus circuit to be major attraction for eco-tourists||Lucknow: UP's Mainpuri district, home to the biggest population of Sarus cranes in the country, will soon see a Sarus circuit as a major eco-tourism project. The circuit, which will have over a dozen wetlands and a bird sanctuary, is ready and would be thrown open to the public once the restrictions due to Covid-19 are lifted, said a state government official. CDO, Mainpuri, Eesha Priya said, "It's an eco-tourism project and, at the same time, a step towards conservation branding. It will help conserve Sarus and give eco-tourists a reason to visit Mainpuri." The first phase of the three-round Sarus census had counted over 2,866 Sarus in Mainpuri in September last year. The circuit will connect two blocks of Mainpuri, Kishni and Karhal, and spread over 676 hectare, including around 526 hectare of Saman bird sanctuary which is also a Ramsar site (a wetland with international recognition), a forest department official said. About a dozen wetlands which lie outside Saman but are part of the circuit cover over 152 hectare. "If you enter Karhal, which has Lucknow-Agra Expressway passing through it, you would see three of these wetlands close to each other," said the CDO. Kishni and Karhal had several of its wetlands lost due to encroachment, illegal cultivation and other factors over a period of time. Mainpuri is also a place of natural depression. Some of the wetlands in the past had been given away as 'patta' to people. Sarus and other migratory birds used to flock to these wetlands. It is noteworthy that conservationists cite habitat destruction as the biggest threat to the population of Sarus which is known to stay at its habitat for the entire lifetime till it is forced to leave the site. In Mainpuri, after the district administration started reviving and digging the lost wetlands, in December last year, Sarus were seen returning to these sites. "We did not use JCB to dig the machines but it was done under MNREGS, involving local labourers, who would also take pride in the kind of work they are doing," said the CDO. Sarus could be seen at these wetlands at present. About a dozen of these wetlands are connected to the web of canals and would have enough water to support the population of Sarus and other migratory birds. "It is, in a way, a community-driven project. We are making gram pradhans own it up. They would make watch towers on the circuit for the visitors. It's a bottom-to-top mode of development," said Priya. The point to make the project also economically beneficial for the locals would, however, come up for consideration only when the tourists start coming and footfalls increase. There might be a ticket put for a watch tower or at the entry of the circuit. "It has to be decided by the local bodies," said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mainpuris-sarus-circuit-to-be-major-attraction-for-eco-tourists/articleshow/83218315.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Pune||Amusement parks’ body seeks relief from Centre||Pune: A group representing operators of amusement and entertainment park spaces, including suppliers to the industry, has written to the Centre, seeking goods and services tax (GST) holiday as well as cuts on import duties in view of the loss suffered by them owing to the pandemic. The Indian Association of Amusement Parks and Industries (IAAPI) said that the sector pumps billions into the economy and generates four lakh direct and indirect jobs. The industry is also marked by high levels of capital investment, due to shortage of skilled labour, dependence on imports for equipment, such as rides and arcades, cost of land, property tax and electricity charges. The IAAPI added that the pandemic has been especially debilitating for the industry across India, being the first to close and last to open during the first wave of the pandemic, and once again so during the second wave. “There is no professional course in India that teaches how to operate an amusement park or a similar space, like indoor gaming arcades. We undertake a lot of skill development programmes as a result, which enriches the industry a lot. All the activities have been shut due to the pandemic, and thousands of jobs, both direct and indirect, have been lost. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we estimate around Rs90,000 crore of revenues have been lost, and we have always been the first to close and the last to open during the imposition of the lockdowns,” said Rajeev Jalnapurkar, chairman of the IAAPI, and CEO Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad. Both waves of the pandemic in India in 2020 and 2021 have emerged at peak season for the amusement parks industry, with April to June being the biggest window for revenues and footfall due to school holidays. “Up to 80% to 90% of our revenue comes during the April to June period and thus we have missed out on two consecutive windows due to the pandemic. All the while, we have had to maintain the rides and machines for safety, so we have had to retain skilled labour, pay electricity charges, and local taxes to the gram panchayat. Overall, it has been a huge loss with regard to revenues and employment. It would be great if the government allows us to reopen as soon as possible. We have already completed vaccination for half of our employees,” said Jai Malpani, director of the Wet N Joy water park and Magic Mountain amusement park, both located at the popular weekend destination of Lonavala. The IAAPI’s letter to the Union government seeks GST holiday, relief on electricity charges and property taxes, and granting of industry status on amusement parks, which, it said, would enable it to seek foreign direct investment as well as increase the number of amusement parks in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/amusement-parks-body-seeks-relief-from-centre/articleshow/83214650.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Lucknow||UP Board cancels Class 12 exam, promotion policy soon||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh on Thursday joined other states to cancel Class 12 state board examinations to ward off infections amidst the second corona wave. The move comes three days after the Union government cancelled Class 12 examinations conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), reports Isha Jain. Over 26.1 lakh students in the state had registered for Class 12 exams conducted by UP Secondary Education Board (UPSEB) and another 29.9 lakh for Class 10 exams, which too was cancelled last month. Putting student safety first, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma who heads secondary education in the state, said, “This is the first time in 100 years of the UP Board that both class 10 and 12 exams have been cancelled.” UPSEB, which is in its centenary year, has hammered out a tentative formula for promoting class 10 and 12 students, which will be approved by a government-appointed committee. Class 12 students will be promoted on the basis of average marks derived from their performance in class 10 board exam and annual exams in class 11. Students who failed to appear for class 11 exams last year due to the pandemic, would be evaluated by their class 12 pre-board exam marks, Sharma said. In absence of average marks, both regular and private students will be uniformly promoted, but these students would only get a class promotion certificate. In the interest of class 12 students, the government also decided to provide them a chance to appear for improvement examinations in one or all subjects to better their scores. Such students (registered for class 12 exams-2021) can appear next year with the 2022 batch. Marks obtained in improvement exams will be counted as 2021 intermediate marks only. Similarly, for Class 10 students, an average of class 9 and pre-board exam marks will be tabulated. In absence of any of these, students will be promoted uniformly to class 11. Class 10 students too can appear for improvement exams next year, Sharma said. “Now, class 12 students can swiftly get admission in higher educational institutions, while class 10 students can begin online classes for their next class,” the minister said. Sharma, however, said the promotion formula is not final. A committee headed by additional chief secretary, secondary education, Aradhana Shukla, has been formed and the promotion policy will be formulated after the panel tables its recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-board-cancels-class-12-exam-promotion-policy-soon/articleshow/83218320.cms||Isha Jain

---||Pune||Two cyclones give India wettest May in 31 years||PUNE: Two cyclones, Tauktae and Yaas, have caused the highest May rainfall in the country in the last 31 years, data from India Meteorological Department (IMD) show. At 107.9mm and 74% all-India excess, the pre-monsoon rainfall in May was also the second highest for the month in over a century since1901. Pulak Guhathakurta, head (climate research division), IMD, Pune, told TOI, “As much as 64% of the country recorded excess rain in May, with maximum sub-divisions in central, northwest and south peninsular India showing large excess in the monthly rainfall.” Since 1901, Guhathakurta said, India has recorded triple digit May rainfall only five times and this year was one of them. “The highest May rainfall so far was in 1990 at110.7mm. All meteorological subdivisions recorded high positive departures in May, the highest departure in Central India, followed by northwest India, then south peninsular India, followed by east and northeast India.” Cyclone Yaas caused widespread rain over Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Orissa while Tauktae caused extensive rain over Konkan, Goa, Saurashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Maharashtra, coastal Karnataka among others. In northwest India, regions like east and west UP, Uttarakhand, Harayana, Chandigarh, Delhi, west and east Rajasthan also recorded large excess in May rainfall, said Guhathakurta. Kripan Ghosh, head of the agriculture meteorology division, IMD, Pune said, “Good rainfall in May is a boon for pre-kharif activities. Widespread rainfall in this month can be beneficial if rain in June as well as other monsoon months remain consistent, which is also what the second stage Long Range Forecast (LRF) had recently indicated. IMD had said in the forecast that most parts of the country would receive normal to above normal rainfall with well distributed showers spatially in the June-September period.” Ghosh said in rice-growing areas, nurseries could be prepared beforehand for kharif sowing with a good premonsoon rainfall. “In the absence of such rainfall, the soil hardens which hampers land preparation for kharif sowing. When there is widespread rainfall before the monsoon sets in, all these activities could be done in advance so that actual sowing can begin in time with the arrival of the monsoon,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wettest-may-in-31-years-with-2-back-to-back-cyclones/articleshow/83214668.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Delhi||After O2 trauma, Delhi govt fills up gaps, builds up buffer stocks||NEW DELHI: With Covid-19 on the decline after a cruel rampage in the capital, Delhi government is using the respite to prepare for a possible new wave of infections. Eleven PSA oxygen plants have been installed, with 46 more to be installed by August. The government has mobilised 3,700 big oxygen cylinders from across India, imported 6,000 from China and also procured 4,600 oxygen concentrators in the past two months. Another 3,300 concentrators will be purchased this month. The government is also maintaining buffer stocks of liquid medical oxygen to meet any increase in demand. The government is stocking children-size oxygen masks, increasing the number of paediatric hospital beds and ICU beds in expectation of kids being most affected by a third wave. It is also running training programmes for nurses and frontline health staff on how to deal with infected children. While Delhi government is planning financial incentives for any firm or hospital that wishes to set up a liquid medical oxygen manufacturing plant, oxygen generation plant or purchase cryogenic oxygen tankers, it has already upped the number of Covid beds from 7,000 to 30,000 and the ICU beds too now number a good 6,900. An official said 11 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants have been installed at hospital complexes and these provide medical quality oxygen directly for the hospital’s consumption. Another 46 will be installed within two months. Together, these will boost the oxygen supply to the hospitals and will hopefully prevent the deaths caused by oxygen shortage as reported from a couple of hospitals during the recent wave. The so-called D type oxygen cylinders, used for oxygen backup storage by large hospitals and as the main source of oxygen supply by temporary facilities with no central oxygen pipeline, are also being acquired; 3,700 such cylinders have already been sourced from within the country and 6,000 have been imported from China in the largest consignment of the sort during the pandemic. A Delhi government report claimed that the cylinders were airlifted from China at short notice to augment Delhi’s Covid preparedness for a possible new wave. A government official informed that two of these cylinders are required for the continuous functioning of an oxygen-equipped Covid bed. Therefore, these 9.700 cylinders can facilitate the quick setting up of 4,800 oxygen beds in an emergency. Of the 4,600 oxygen concentrators procured over the last two months, the higher capacity 10-litres per minute ones are to be used for oxygen beds in hospitals and Covid care centres. The 5-litre ones are meant to be delivered within two hours of a request to the homes of Delhi residents. In the coming three weeks, 3,300 oxygen concentrators will be added to the inventory. The government official added, “Buffer storage is being planned too for the extra liquor medical oxygen likely to be required during a surge in the next round of the pandemic. Five buffer tanks with a combined capacity of 271 metric tonnes have been ordered and will be installed by June 10.” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain pointed out that though the new cases are dipping significantly, Delhi government will continue to build infrastructure in preparation of a renewed cycle of infection. “Be it beds, oxygen, medication or vaccines, we will do what it takes to be ready. We have learnt a lot from the second wave and are leaving no stone unturned to counter the possible next wave, which may be more severe,” Jain asserted. “People are concerned about the impact that another wave may have on children. We are aware of this and are making special arrangements because managing paediatric patients will need a different approach altogether.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-o2-trauma-govt-fills-up-gaps-builds-up-buffer-stocks/articleshow/83214675.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Ranchi||‘Cycling helps prevent serious Covid-19 infection’: Ranchi's Bicycle Mayor||Ranchi: More than 50% of those who cycled regularly remained unaffected by Covid-19 virus since its outbreak last year, a survey conducted on 367 cycling enthusiasts across the country by Ranchi’s ‘bicycle mayor’ Kanishk Poddar has revealed. Only 1% cyclists in the sample size were severely affected by coronavirus whereas over 98% had mild to moderate levels of infection. Poddar said that while the sample size could be small considering the rate of infection, especially during the second wave this year, the survey has, nevertheless, highlighted the health benefits of cycling. Even the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs had launched two flagship programmes — ‘Cycle for Change’ and ‘Streets for People’ — to make cities cycling-friendly amid the pandemic. The World Health Organization, too, has recommended the use of bicycles as it helps maintain social distancing, besides allowing people to lead an active life. As per the survey, out of 367 cyclists, 24.5% got infected by the Covid-19 virus whereas over 75% stayed negative even though they continued cycling during the lockdown. “Of the 90 people (24.5%) who contracted Covid-19, only four got severely ill and had to be admitted in an ICU. This is just over 1% of the total survey size. The remaining people had only mild or moderate symptoms. They all stated that cycling helped them gain stronger lungs and aided the recovery process. Importantly, out of 90 infected, over 60% recovered under 10 days while 85% recovered under 15 days,” Poddar said. Many didn’t face any post-recovery problems. “Out of the total recovered, 87% of people didn’t have any post-recovery problem,” he said. Of the total respondents, only about 6.3% were under the age of 18, but a majority of people involved in cycling activities were above the age of 25 and they were cycling regularly either for recreational, fitness purposes or to commute for work, he said. “Over 91% of the participants were men,” he said. Asked about the frequency of cycling, Poddar said 26% of those surveyed rode daily, whereas 44% rode for five days or more in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cycling-helps-prevent-serious-covid-19-infection/articleshow/83214241.cms||ASRP Mukesh

He also laid down the measures that government is taking in the event of a possible third wave of Covid-19.” He added that the central leadership was satisfied with the government’s work and gave a few ideas to the party to improve their work further. Meanwhile, Congress’s Mahagama MLA Deepika Pandey Singh has been appointed as one of the national general secretaries and given charge of Uttarakhand affairs. “It’s a huge responsibility and I thank the central leadership for putting their faith in me,” she said. Meanwhile, the state unit of BJP also held a virtual meeting over the ‘continued post-poll violence in Bengal’. State president Deepak Prakash said, “Governments in both Bengal and Jharkhand are working against the constitutional principles. We appeal to the intelligentsia to break their silence over the ongoing loot, unlawful activities in Jharkhand and Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/aicc-takes-stock-of-partys-cov-control-work-in-state/articleshow/83214207.cms||---
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand: Adityapur industries set to resume production by next week as govt gives nod for oxygen usage||JAMSHEDPUR: Following the state government’s approval to use oxygen cylinders in industrial activities earlier this week, around 900 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Adityapur are expected to resume production by next week after being shut for nearly two months. Ever since the second wave of Covid-19 struck Jharkhand in April, the state government had to divert the supply of oxygen cylinders to hospitals from the industries, thereby forcing the latter to stop production. “Industrial production was stopped abruptly after the supply of oxygen cylinders was stopped to industries and as a consequence, entrepreneurs and workers had to sit idle at home without work for the past two months,” factory owner Mahesh Sonthalia said. The SMEs, which consist of a large chunk of Tata Motors’ ancillary units, require 2,000 units of oxygen cylinders every day. “There are about 100 fabrication-linked factories where the requirement for oxygen is pretty high while other factories, including several Tata Motors’ ancillaries, require around two to 10 cylinders per day,” entrepreneur Parveen Sonthalia said. “Nearly 90% of the SMEs need to use oxygen cylinders for manufacturing activities as it is a raw material for the industry,” Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA) president Inder Agarwal said. On May 31, the Department of Promotion of Industries and Internal Trade (DPIIT), which is a unit of Union Ministry of Commerce and Trade, issued orders to all the states, asking them to take appropriate steps for resuming the supply of oxygen cylinders to industries, following which the state industries department on June 1 gave its approval for the use of oxygen cylinders in the production activities. “On May 21, we had written to the additional secretary of DPIIT, following which the officials concerned took the decision in our favour after consultation with different agencies of the government,” Agarwal said. He thanked Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar for being instrumental in pursuing the case with the Union government. Entrepreneur Vijay Anand Moonka, who had sent a tweet to chief minister Hemant Soren on May 24 seeking his approval for resuming the supply of oxygen cylinders to industries, said the purpose was to resume industrial activity so that everyone involved in the manufacturing process can get back to work. “The welfare of thousands of workers depends on the resumption of production activities and that is why I reached out to the CM,” Moonka, who is also the vice-president of Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry, added. Although the industries have suffered huge losses during the two-months-long shutdown, the entrepreneurs refrained from divulging the total amount of the loss incurred. “Commercial activities take a backseat when it comes to saving the lives of thousands of Covid patients. Estimating the production loss is a foolish thing to do in the current situation,” entrepreneur and ASIA functionary Santosh Khetan said. Meanwhile, ancillary worker S K Sarkar said, “Several companies paid the staff a lumpsum amount during the shutdown period. I just hope the company will call us back when production resumes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/adityapur-industries-set-to-resume-production-by-next-week-as-govt-gives-nod-for-oxygen-usage/articleshow/83224666.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Medicos miffed at ‘people’s silence over attacks on doctors’||RANCHI: Miffed at the silence of the non-medical fraternity over the recent attacks on doctors in some parts of the country, a few resident doctors in Jharkhand have expressed their anger on social media. Dr Tanu Sharma, who is a senior resident at Phulo Jhano Medical College and Hospital in Dumka, said, “It is heart-wrenching to see that a doctor being beaten to death for trying his best to save a patient with limited resources during a pandemic. I have been in similar situations where people have tried to attack me while on duty and have tried making videos of the attack. I am scared for my safety while I discharging my duties.” Earlier this week, a doctor was attacked at a Covid care centre in Assam by the relatives of a Covid patient. The relatives had alleged that the doctor had left their patient unattended for two hours, which led to his death. In Karnataka, a doctor was assaulted after a six-year-old boy, whom he was treating for dengue, died on Wednesday. Upset by his death, his relatives attacked the doctor, resulting in him being admitted to hospital where his condition is said to be serious. Dr Lily Singh, a senior resident at the Patliputra Medical College and Hospital, Dhanbad posted a picture of the Karnataka-based doctor on her social media profile and said, “Enough is enough! Was the Zomato delivery guy from Bangalore injured as grievously as this doctor and yet there was an outpouring of sympathy from everyone on social media. If that was inhumane, then what is this? Are the attacks on doctors not the same?” She added, “We too condemned the attack on the delivery boy but when a doctor is beaten to death, where is the conscience of society? Aren’t we also human beings? We have been serving the society amid the pandemic for the past last two years.” Dr Singh was referring to an incident that took place in March in Bengaluru where an employee of a food delivery app was allegedly assaulted by a woman customer, which lead to an uproar on social media. Dr Vikas Kumar, who is the president of the Junior Doctors’ Association at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, said that resident doctors are always at receiving end of such attacks as they are on the frontline and if anything goes wrong they are the ones who have to face the brunt. He added, “The doctor in Assam was trying to help the patient even when he knew that patient was critical and he had limited resources in store and referring him to a higher centre wasn’t a good idea as it was far away. Instead of appreciating his efforts, the boy’s family members thrashed him. Every time a doctor is assaulted, another 100 stop taking the risks they would usually do to save someone. Please do stand with us as it could be one of you who might bear the price of it and you wouldn’t know.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/medicos-miffed-at-peoples-silence-over-attacks-on-docs/articleshow/83214299.cms||---

On Thursday, the Diamond City recorded 80 new cases and one Covid-19 death. On March 8, the city had recorded 90 new cases before being hit by the second wave. According to Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials, a 66-year-old man from Godadara of Limbayat zone succumbed to the infection on Thursday. “Covid-19 cases are now in double digit and it is all due to the massive efforts put in by the civic body. On an average we are conducting 21,000 Covid-19 tests per day in the city which includes 9000 RT-PCR tests. Vaccination programme is also going on full swing and we are issuing vaccination cards to traders. The traders who have not taken vaccines have been asked to go for a test once in a week,” Dr Ashish Naik, Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Health), Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) told TOI. For the second day in running, five of the eight civic zones recorded below-10 new Covid cases. Central zone recorded six while Varachha-A (8), Varachha-B (7), Limbayat (6) and Udhna (5) too recorded single digit new cases. With 20 new cases Rander zone recorded the highest daily cases followed by 18 in Athwa zone. For the last three weeks the city has witnessed a steep decline in new cases giving a much needed relief to the medical fraternity and the civic body. But the civic body is not letting the guard down. “We are now preparing for the third wave of the coronavirus wherein it is predicted that children might be in vulnerable situations. So, we are preparing in this regard and are ensuring that we will face any eventuality,” Dr Naik added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surats-ncov-cases-dip-below-100-for-first-time-in-three-months/articleshow/83213625.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: JMM rejects graft charge against CM aide||RANCHI: Rejecting the corruption charges levelled by BJP MLA Babulal Marandi, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Thursday claimed all illegal activities in Santhal Pargana have stopped since the Hemant Soren government assumed office in January 2020. "More than 900 vehicles involved in illegal mining and transportation have been seized and Rs 90 lakh has been levied as fine in Santhal Pargana till May this year. Our government is determined to halt all illegal activities in the region," JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. On June 1, Marandi had accused JMM of being involved in corruption, extortion and other criminal activities in the division. Marandi had pointed fingers at Pankaj Mishra, representative of chief minister Hemant Soren in the Barhait assembly constituency, and said he was actively involved in a host of illegal activities. Marandi had claimed Mishra had threatened a local BJP functionary for tweeting against the incumbent government and usurping the lands of various families in the area by force. Bhattacharya on Thursday rejected Marandi' charges against Mishra, who also holds the post of a secretary in JMM's central committee. "Marandi sat down for a press conference on Tuesday with a few men who had criminal antecedents and a few people who made false claims," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-rejects-graft-charge-against-cm-aide/articleshow/83215376.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Protests in Ranchi seeking CBI probe in Rupa ‘suicide’ case||RANCHI: Several organizations on Thursday formed a human chain while maintaining social distancing between Albert Ekka Chowk and Sarjana Chowk here demanding a CBI inquiry into the alleged suicide by sub-inspector Rupa Tirkey. The protest was held to mark one month of the alleged suicide. Notably, Tirkey, a tribal woman who was posted as officer-in-charge of the women police station in Sahibganj district, was found hanging in her official quarter on May 3. Police state that prima facie it was a case of suicide. Tirkey’s parents, however, say there are indications that their daughter was murdered and expressed no confidence in the police investigation. The human chain was formed by members of Adivasi Chhatra Sangh, All India Progressive Women’s Association, Adivasi Janadhikar Mahasabha and Akhil Bhartiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad for about two hours demanding the CBI inquiry into the case. Maintaining social distancing, the protesters displayed placards and also shouted slogans. A homage was also paid to Tirkey at the venue. Tirkey’s father Devanand Oroan, who took part in the protest, said, “Only a CBI inquiry can reveal the truth. There are many missing links in the information provided to us by the police. I had sought time from chief minister Hemant Soren to raise the demand but there has been no response so far.” Aloka Kujur of Adivasi Janadhikar Mahasabha said, “ The state government should break its silence over Tirkey’s case and order a CBI inquiry. Our agitation in this regard is going on as we are not satisfied with the investigation done by the police.” Another protest to press for the demand is also scheduled on Saturday to mark one month of Tirkey’s burial. Political parties, including BJP, are also demanding a CBI inquiry into the case. So far, Sahibganj police have arrested sub-inspector Shiv Kumar Kanaujia for abetment of suicide in the case. Tirkey’s parents are, however, accusing sub-inspectors Manisha Kumari and Jyotsana Kumari and one Pankaj Mishra in the "murder".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/protests-in-ranchi-seeking-cbi-probe-in-rupa-suicide-case/articleshow/83214158.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand at bottom of SDG hunger index||RANCHI: Jharkhand is among the three worst-performing states along with Bihar and Assam in this year’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index released by Niti Aayog on Thursday. In terms of hunger reduction, the state fared at the bottom of all 28 states. While the state government is yet to issue any formal reaction to the report, the ruling Congress party has rejected the ratings. State finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, who also holds the food and civil supplies portfolio, could not be reached for comments, spokesperson of his party, Alok Dubey said, “We are yet to go through the details, but going by the preliminary report, we do not agree to the findings. As far as the hunger situation is concerned, the state government is at the forefront since the outbreak of the pandemic to help the people like running community kitchens and distributing advance ration among others. All ruling parties of our alliance government also run separate welfare camps to ensure that no one goes hungry.” However, Niti Aayog has put Jharkhand, with an overall score of 56, at 27th rank in the SDG, while neighbouring Bihar was in 28th position and Assam was placed just above Jharkhand. In 2019, the state’s overall score was 53. On the other hand, Kerala has retained its top slot in this year’s index. Niti Aayog released the SDG index for the third consecutive year to evaluate the performance of the states on 16 different parameters comprising poverty, health, food security, environment protection and industry among other growth indicators. According to the report, Jharkhand was rated on 15 parameters in which it showed progress in 10 indicators compared to 2019 but fared miserably in the remaining five. For example, last year, the state scored 22 in the zero hunger indicator which slipped to 19 this year. Under the decent work & economic growth category, it scored 54 against 70 in 2019. In industry, innovation and infrastructure, too, the score came down to 37 from last year’s 70. The other two parameters where it failed badly are climate action with a score of 25, two notches below year, and life on land category where its scoring fell to 71 from last year’s 99. Siraj Datta of Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch, a conglomeration of different rights groups which works on various social issues, said the state’s poor performance towards zero hunger index doesn’t come as a surprise and the Covid-19 pandemic could be one of the reasons to have further worsen it. “PDS, MNREGA and pensions schemes are the three important tools which can potentially address the issues of hunger. In Jharkhand, we are witnessing lots of exclusion of genuine beneficiaries in all these three sections. Ironically, the JMM-Congress-RJD government came to power raking up issues of hunger, poverty, joblessness and the likes but we are yet to see any concrete action to address those on the ground,” he remarked. Ashrafi Nand Prasad, the convener of the Right to Food campaign, said, "Even though the state government announced green ration cards to include about 15 lakh people, who were originally left out of the National Food Security Act by linking them to the public distribution system (PDS), it is yet to be implemented in the right earnest till today." He added, "Moreover, we have been demanding to restart distribution of eggs to anganwadis to address the issues of malnutrition among children, but is yet be to done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-at-bottom-of-sdg-hunger-index/articleshow/83215471.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Monsoon likely to arrive in Jharkhand by middle of this month, says IMD||RANCHI: Southwest monsoon rains are expected to set in over Jharkhand between June 15 and June 18 this year, the Ranchi office of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday. The announcement came after the IMD’s New Delhi quarters formally notified the onset of monsoon over Kerala in the afternoon. The monsoon currents are expected to move inland towards Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karnataka and parts of south and central Bay of Bengal in the next 48 hours, the IMD said. While the lockdown hampered Jharkhand’s mining and industrial sector in 2020, the timely onset of monsoon rains in the state had come as a relief to the farmers last year. The previous monsoon in Jharkhand was recorded as normal after the state received a cumulative rainfall of 901.9 mm rain, which was 14% less than the state’s normal average of 1,054.77 mm. Many districts had faced drought-like scenario in 2018 and 2019 after the monsoon rains were deficient by 28% and 21% in the two consecutive seasons. Even though severe cyclonic storm Yaas brought destruction in the state, it also brought in heavy rains which will help in timely sowing of kharif crops by June 15. Due to heavy downpour, Ranchi recorded 239.33 mm rain last month, which is the highest rain in May since 1959 (151 mm). Abhishek Anand, a scientist at IMD Ranchi, said: “Currently, there is a cyclonic circulation which is persisting over north Chhattisgarh. Under its influence, isolated places in Jharkhand will receive light to moderate rains with thundering in the next four to five days. Pre-monsoon showers are also expected in the coming days.” Meanwhile, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth on Thursday wrote a letter to chief minister Hemant Soren and urged him to set up a state-level committee to assess and report the damages which have been caused by the rains due to cyclone Yaas at the block and panchayat levels in the state. Notably, the state disaster management department has asked all the districts to submit a report of the damages caused by the cyclone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/monsoon-likely-to-arrive-in-jharkhand-by-middle-of-this-month-says-imd/articleshow/83214097.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: 1 held for axe attack on Covid survey team||RANCHI: Khunti police arrested one person for allegedly threatening sahiyas and sevikas with an axe when they were carrying out a door-to-door survey for Covid-19 infections. The accused has been identified as Rafael Kandulna of Unkuna village of Khunti district. The incident happened when a group of sahiyas and sevikas, which was engaged in a Covid mapping and awareness drive, went to in Unkuda village under Torpa police station on Tuesday. During their visit, Kandulan came out of his house wielding an axe saying that his mother died due to the Covid vaccine and started chasing a sahiya. When the sevikas tried to intervene, he threatened to kill them as well and attacked them. An aganwadi sevika was injured in the incident. Police have registered an FIR under sections 186, 188, 269, 270, 271 341, 323, 332, and 353 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act against Kandulna. It may be stated here that earlier a drunken man had also misbehaved with the survey team in the district. Khunti SP Ashutosh Shekhar said, “Police are vigilant to prevent attacks on survey teams. We are also carrying out an awareness drive on Covid-19 pandemic and associated measures with the help of gram sabhas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/1-held-for-axe-attack-on-cov-survey-team/articleshow/83215507.cms||---
---||Ranchi||7 arrested with 6 kg of uranium in Bokaro city||BOKARO: A special police team arrested seven persons and recovered 6kg of uranium from them following raids at different parts of the city on Thursday. Bokaro SP Chandan Kumar Jha said, “We have seized the yellow substance and will send it to experts for tests. Uranium is a highly radioactive substance used at nuclear facilities.” Police said the accused, suspected to be part of national gang involved in illegal uranium trade, were searching for customers and had fixed its price at Rs 50 lakhs per kg. Notably, a kilo of uranium sells for around Rs 18 crores in the global market, sources said. This is for the first time uranium has been seized in this industrial town. Those arrested have been identified as Bapi Da alias Bapi Chandra, Anil Singh, Deepak Kumar, Krishna Kant, Hare Ram Sharma, Mahavir Mahto and Pankaj Mahto. They are residents of different parts of the district. Deepak and Bapi have criminal history. It is illegal to possess uranium without a license in India and violation of the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, can attract stringent punishment. Jha said police received information that some criminals are preparing to sell uranium. A nine member team headed by Chas DSP Mukesh Kumar and City DSP Kuldeep Kumar were involved in the raids. “It is still unclear how they got their hands on the radioactive metal. During interrogation, they mentioned West Bengal, Giridih and a few other places. Seven mobile phones and a motorcycle were also seized from them,” he said. Notably, Jharkhand is among a few states in the country that has uranium mines. Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) also has a uranium processing plant at Jaduguda, about 150km from Bokaro city. Sources said police is also investigating to ascertain whether the arrested accused have any links with a similar racket busted by Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) on May 5 after it nabbed two persons. A total of 7.1 kg of natural uranium worth Rs 21.3 crore was seized from the duo identified as Jigar Jayesh Pandya (27) and Abu Tahir Afzal Choudhary (31).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/7-arrested-with-6-kg-of-uranium-in-bokaro-city/articleshow/83215431.cms||Divy Khare
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Vaccination urgency ebbs with relaxation in restrictions||VADODARA: Within a week of gaining momentum, the vaccination drive in the city is losing steam again. Against around 19,000 vaccines a day towards the end of May, 12,086 persons were vaccinated on Thursday. The drive had earlier begun on a bitter note with the administration being targeted for not being able to provide sufficient vaccines even when people were looking to get the jab. After this, people were unable to get vaccines slots online and could do so only after several attempts. With no walk-in facility, prior registration and scheduling of vaccine was a must. Now, when vaccines as well as slots are available online, people lose interest. Workers of political parties and other organisations have also been relaying information regarding sessions where slots are available. Officials said that 20,000 persons of the 18-44 years age group can be vaccinated every day across 100 centres. Apart from this, vaccination of other age groups is also continuing including second doses. The fall in numbers has been more significant for the past couple of days. It fell by over 2,200 on Wednesday as compared to Tuesday. The fall was even more drastic with vaccination nose diving by over 4,200 again on Thursday. Officials too have expressed concern and said that the session sites were increased in large numbers following several complaints. Now, these will have to be reduced again. The sites were increased to 100 in the last week of May. Within 14 days, it already seems to be much higher than the actual vaccination. VMC medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel, however, said that the sudden fall does not seem to be due to vaccine hesitancy. “When there was rush everyone was keen to get a vaccine. Now, things are the other way around,” said Patel, adding that steps to create awareness and ensure high vaccination were under consideration. Members of the elected wing of the VMC are also looking to adopt means to ensure high vaccination. Sources said that the decrease in the number of Covid-19 cases also seems to have contributed to lower vaccination as people are no longer in a hurry to get vaccinated and may do so at their convenience. The relaxation in restrictions also seems to have made people busy on the work front with vaccination taking the backseat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccination-urgency-ebbs-with-relaxation-in-restrictions/articleshow/83213335.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||India||Times Face-off: What's at stake for Lakshadweep?||The Lakshadweep issue has gone beyond the environment vs development debate. Here's a look at what’s at stake for this unique UT.FOR: Aim is to put Lakshadweep on the global tourism map like MaldivesS Asker Ali, District Collector, LakshadweepA few hundred miles away from Lakshadweep is Maldives. But though the two archipelagos have a lot in common in terms of topography, one has emerged as a great tourism destination globally, while Lakshadweep is nowhere on the world tourism map. The reason is that it has negligible facilities for tourists. It is in this backdrop that we should see the activities that the administration of Lakshadweep has launched for the prosperity and bright future of all its citizens especially fishermen, women and the youth of the Union Territory, who are being left behind in the race for development. However, the people whose vested interests are hit by the administration’s development works are propagating a misinformation campaign against the administration. Read AlsoExplained: Why new rules in Lakshadweep have caused angerWith politicians joining the chorus of protests, everyone knows something is going on in Lakshadweep. Here's what you need to knowThe proposed development will be implemented with minimum impact on the island ecosystem which is considered an ecologically protected area. It will be in consonance with the larger vision statement of sustainable development and the approved Integrated Island Management Plan (IIMP) of the various islands of Lakshadweep. Three eco-friendly water villa projects in Minicoy, Kadmat and Suheli are being developed for tourism by the Lakshadweep administration in collaboration with NITI Aayog on the lines of Maldives. Work shall start from August. With this, tourism will get a new dimension and tourists will get facilities for accommodation and entertainment. Also, local residents will get new opportunities for employment and business. Keeping tourism in mind, liquor permits have been given at selected establishments only for tourists. A few weeks ago, 300 kg of heroin with an international value of Rs 3000 crore, five AK-47 rifles and 1,000 live rounds were confiscated from a boat in the Arabian Sea near Minicoy island. Similarly, many cases of illegal smuggling of marijuana and liquor and cases under the Pocso Act have also been reported here. These illegal businesses are casting a shadow on the future of the youth here. Hence, strict laws are needed to ensure that they do not get misguided. Also, as there are inadequate facilities of higher education, the administration has taken the initiative to set up a nursing college and paramedical college in Kavaratti and a polytechnic college in Minicoy. Many states of the country have enacted cow protection laws and the law in Lakshadweep is on the same lines. With regard to mid-day meals, fish is available in plenty and is a good source of protein as are eggs so we have decided to provide these instead of red meat. Both are readily available in the local market also. Another misleading propaganda which is doing the rounds is that the administration is proposing a law which makes a person with more than two children ineligible to run in an election. It is clarified in this context that when this Panchayat Act is notified, its provisions will only apply to the parents of infants born after the due date of notification and not retrospectively. Keeping in mind the development and upliftment and empowerment of women, the administration has provided 50% reservation to women under the Panchayat Act here. With this, the women here will also be able to plan the development of Lakshadweep and can take over the reins of its future. Further, amendments have been made in the panchayat law here which are on the same lines as those in other states of the country. In today’s modern era, it is very important to have internet connectivity for the overall development of any region. But even after 73 years of independence, connectivity is a very big problem in Lakshadweep. PM Narendra Modi has awarded a submarine optical fibre cable project of Rs 1,072 crore, which will be completed by 2023-24. With this, online education, e-medicine and various types of technical facilities will be available here, so that the local people will get new opportunities in the field of education, employment and business. The administration has also started the process of expansion of Agatti airstrip in collaboration with the Government of India. This will enable high capacity aircrafts such as Boeing and Airbus to land here, which shall facilitate connectivity and promote tourism. The administration has taken special initiative to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic and has taken efforts to install two oxygen plants at Agatti and Kavaratti with the help of the centre. Along with this, one oxygen plant is going to be set up in Minicoy through CSR. This is an important step towards making the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, which is about 500 kms away from the mainland, self-reliant in the field of health. AGAINST: One man is single-handedly taking away the rights of an indigenous populationFaseela Odivalukanjarugothi is from Minicoy island, Lakshadweep, and a lawyer in the Kerala high courtKnown for its emerald sea, white sandy beaches and a peaceful and coherent ecosystem, the Union Territory of Lakshadweep comprises a group of islands in the Arabian Sea with a cumulative area of approx 32 sqkm. The natives of these islands today are facing a bleak and scary future. After taking charge in December 2020, one of the first actions of administrator Praful Khoda Patel was a waiver that allowed anyone with a negative Covid certificate of 48 hours to enter the islands, overturning an earlier procedure that mandated a seven-day quarantine before such entry. This resulted in a spike of cases in the islands, which until then was zero, and strained the health infrastructure, thereby endangering the lives of islanders. This caused great resentment and prompted various village panchayats to pass resolutions against the administrator’s actions. Given the rising dissent and protests, the administration retaliated by proposing a Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulations 2021 that provides for preventive detention without trial for maintenance of public order. This has been a great cause of panic and anxiety among the populace as these are the exact kind of laws, fascists and dictatorial regimes use to clamp down voices of dissent and protestors. It is pertinent to note here that, according to the 2019 report of the National Crime Records Bureau, Lakshadweep has one of the lowest crime rates in the country. Patel’s next act was a direct attack on the democratic set-up of the Union Territory, done with an aim to centralise power into his own hands. The Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation 2021 proposes a blatant reduction of the scope of powers of local self- government organisations. Their powers in areas such as education, health, fisheries, animal husbandry etc. have been curtailed and vested to the respective directorates which are under the direct authority of the administrator himself. This aims at heavily curtailing the administrative, political and financial powers of the panchayats and gram sabhas. In the islands where these local self-governments are the only elected governing bodies such curtailments would not only be undemocratic, but also against the very tenets of the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution. However, what triggered the greatest resentment among the natives of the islands was the Draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (LDAR), 2021. It provides for unchecked powers to the administrator and the authorities appointed by him to alter, modify, remove, relocate, directly interfere with the right of an islander to possess, enjoy, retain their own property. It has stringent provisions that empower the administrator to earmark any land for development activities provided under this regulation. Furthermore, the constitution of the Planning and Development Authority, which is the body assigned to oversee the developmental activities under these regulations, is not done in a representative and democratic manner. With a majority of its members being appointed by the administrator, the whole authority will be a mere puppet at the hands of one single authority, ie. the administrator of UT of Lakshadweep. It also provides for massive development activities such as mining, quarrying, building of national highways, railways, tram-ways etc. In these tiny islands, these kinds of activities can have devastating effects on the extremely fragile ecosystem of the islands, its people, their lands and livelihoods. It might also cause forced migration of the population. Patel continued the repressive measures with a ban on transportation, sale, storage and consumption of beef in the islands. For the local residents, beef is part of their staple diet so this directly attacks their right to consume food of their choice. Meat has also been removed from mid-day meals in schools and anganwadis. Respecting the cultural choices of Muslims, who constitute 96.6% of the local population according to the 2011 Census, transportation and sale of liquor had been banned in these islands. But the new administrator issued directives to open sales outlets for sale of alcohol in the islands. Any rules or orders for development or reform in the UT need to take into account the benefit of the people of the islands and its fragile ecosystem. The appointment of the administrator should go back to the historical way, which means appointing a serving civil servant who would be accountable for his actions during the tenure. Placing arbitrary powers at the hands of a political appointee puts the democratic and administrative set of the small group of islands, consisting mostly of Scheduled Tribes, in grave danger. No man, however powerful, should be allowed to single-handedly decide the fate of an indigenous population by taking away their constitutional rights to land, life and liberties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/times-face-off-whats-at-stake-for-lakshadweep/articleshow/83216599.cms||---
---||India||Monsoon arrives over Kerala, two days after its normal date||NEW DELHI: Marking the beginning of the rainy season in India, the monsoon on Thursday hit the southern part of Kerala against its normal onset date of June 1. It is expected to cover the entire country by early July. “The southwest monsoon has advanced into some parts of south Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep area, south Kerala, south Tamil Nadu, remaining parts of Comorin–Maldives area and some more parts of southwest Bay of Bengal on Thursday,” said M Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department, announcing the onset over Kerala. The IMD had on May 14 predicted the onset to be around May 31 with model error of +/- 4 days. It was, however, slightly delayed due to disruptions in certain meteorological conditions due to two back-to-back cyclones last month. These conditions were met on Thursday, the department said. The weather department has been issuing operational forecasts for the date of monsoon onset over Kerala since 2005. Previous record shows operational forecasts of the date of monsoon onset over the state have proved to be correct except in 2015. The IMD said monsoon was likely to advance into remaining parts of Kerala & Lakshadweep, some more parts of Tamil Nadu & Puducherry, parts of coastal & south interior Karnataka, Rayalaseema and some more parts of south and central Bay of Bengal during the next two days. The IMD on Tuesday said most parts of the country was expected to receive “normal to above normal” rainfall with “well distributed” showers during June-September. Even the pre-monsoon phase turned out to be a period of good rainfall. Rainfall figures show that cumulative rainfall during the March 1-May 31 period was 18% more than the long period average (normal) rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/monsoon-arrives-over-kerala-two-days-after-its-normal-date/articleshow/83222121.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Quashing a year-old sedition FIR registered by Himachal police against journalist Vinod Dua for his social media video criticising the government and hitting out at PM Modi for the miseries of migrant labourers in the wake of last year’s lockdown, Justices U U Lalit and Vineet Saran said going by the allegations in the FIR and after perusing the content of Dua’s video, ingredients of the offences of sedition or defamation were not made out. The SC also warded off the threat of invoking the Disaster Management Act against Dua. SC: Dua’s views don’t constitute any offenceThe SC said the views expressed by Vinod Dua did not constitute any offence under the Disaster Management Act or any provision of the IPC. But the court refused to equate journalists with doctors in whose favour the apex court had ruled that a medical practitioner facing charge of negligence should not be arrested without a preliminary inquiry. The court rejected Dua’s plea, made by senior advocate Vikas Singh, for a direction to the Centre and states to set up a committee to examine the charges levelled in an FIR against any journalist with 10 years’ experience. Dua had pleaded a journalist should be arrested only when the committee was satisfied that the charges required arrest. Times ViewIn recent years, journalists have often come under attack in different parts of the country. In many cases, spurious charges have been slapped on them. Given this backdrop, the Supreme Court’s judgment is most welcome. It’s notable that the apex court did not lay down any new rules. Rather, it reminded the police about a landmark case that happened 60 years ago. The sad truth is that authorities have to be repeatedly told about well-established democratic norms these days.Writing the 117-page judgment, Justice Lalit extensively referred to the 60-year-old, five-judge constitution bench judgment in Kedar Nath Singh case, in which the apex court had laid down the definition of what constituted the offence of sedition and had ruled that a citizen’s right to criticism, however harsh, could never be a ground to prompt police to lodge an FIR under Section 124A of IPC (sedition). “The principles culled out from the decision in Kedar Nath Singh show a citizen has a right to criticise or comment upon the measures undertaken by the government and its functionaries, so long as he does not incite people to violence against the government established by law or with the intention of creating public disorder; and that it is only when the words or expressions have pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order that Sections 124A and 505 of the IPC must step in,” the bench said. “Every journalist will be entitled to protection in terms of Kedar Nath Singh, as every prosecution under Sections 124A and 505 of the IPC must be in strict conformity with the scope and ambit of said sections as explained in, and completely in tune with, the law laid down in Kedar Nath Singh,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/journalists-cant-be-arrested-just-for-criticising-govt-supreme-court/articleshow/83222172.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Business||Rapid rise in global food prices in May||NEW DELHI: Global food prices rose in May at their fastest monthly rate in more than a decade, even as world cereal production is on course to reach a new record high, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations said on Thursday. The FAO Food Price Index averaged 127.1 points in May, 4.8% higher than in April and 39.7% higher than in May 2020. A combination of factors have been attributed to the sharp increase including rising demand, production delays, disruption in harvest and supply bottlenecks. A surge in international prices of vegetable oils, sugar and cereals led to increase in the index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices of commonly traded food commodities, to its highest value since September 2011 and only 7.6% below its all-time peak. The FAO Cereal Price Index increased 6.0% from April, led by international maize prices, which averaged 89.9% above their year-earlier value. However, maize prices started to retreat at the end of May, mostly on improved production prospects in the US. International wheat prices also showed a late-month decline but averaged 6.8% higher in May than in April, while international rice quotations held steady. The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index gained 7.8% in May, mainly reflecting rising palm, soy and rapeseed oil quotations. Palm oil prices rose due to slow production in southeast Asian countries, while prospects of robust global demand, especially from the biodiesel sector, drove soyoil prices higher. The FAO Sugar Price Index increased by 6.8% from April, due largely to harvest delays and concerns over reduced crop yields in Brazil even as large export volumes from India contributed to easing the price surge. The FAO Meat Price Index increased by 2.2% from April due to a faster pace of import purchases by China, as well as rising internal demand for poultry and pig meats in the leading producing regions. The FAO Dairy Price Index rose by 1.8% in the month, averaging 285 above its level of one year ago. The increase was led by solid import demand for skim and whole milk powders, while butter prices declined for the first time in almost a year on increased export supplies from New Zealand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rapid-rise-in-global-food-prices-in-may/articleshow/83222211.cms||---
---||India||Gambhir’s NGO caused Fabiflu shortage, HC told||NEW DELHI: The Gautam Gambhir Foundation, run by the member of Parliament from east Delhi, committed an offence through the unauthorised procurement, stocking and distribution of viral medicine Fabiflu, the drug controller for the city informed Delhi High Court on Thursday. Days after the high court pulled up the drug controller for giving Gautam Gambhir a clean chit, the volte face came before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, which accepted that the BJP MP did a lot of charity work but caused a shortage of drug and inconvenience to society. The court said action must be taken under the relevant provisions of law against all such persons and the chemists/dealers who sold them Fabiflu in such large quantities. The bench reiterated that the manner in which a huge quantity of the drug was procured left genuine patients who needed the medicine at that particular time in the lurch. It took a dim view of the conduct of the foundation, noting, “This is not the way to do charity. When you do charity, you have to do it only with charity as an angle. No other angle, else it is not charity,” the court said. “It should not be that I will do it for one class or for my constituency people. It should not be to gain popularity.” The bench wanted the drug controller to curb this practice in the future. The drug controller assured the high court that action would be taken without delay against the foundation, dealers, AAP MLA Praveen Kumar and other people for similar acts. It said show-cause notices had been issued to licensees under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the responses are awaited. During the hearing, the court also drew a distinction between medical oxygen bought for personal use and bulk purchases like in the Gambhir case. “The endeavour of the drug controller should be on such violators whose actions resulted in choking of the system, including medical oxygen, for bona fide use in the treatment of Covid-19,” the bench noted. The drug controller said it was under the impression that Garg Hospital was the agency through which Fabiflu was procured and distributed at the Gautam Gambhir Foundation’s medical camps. But the hospital clarified it was not directly involved and its role was limited to verification that the correct drug was being given to patients. The court had taken strong exception to the drug controller’s report concluding that the dealers had ample stocks of Fabiflu for patients and said everyone knew that the medicine was in short supply. The court has sought a status report on the progress in the matter and listed the case for July 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gambhirs-ngo-caused-fabiflu-shortage-hc-told/articleshow/83222242.cms||Abhinav Garg

These four districts fit in both the parameters of less than 5% test positivity and less than 25% oxygen bed occupancy set by the state government’s disaster management department for the unlock in first level. All shops, markets, malls, activities and events will be allowed and all offices will function with 100% capacity in the districts/units coming under Level 1. As the state government has released the unlock plan with detailed parameters, it’s now up to the respective district collectors and municipal commissioners to take the updated figures of test positivity and oxygen bed occupancy in their districts/units and issue the unlock-related guidelines. The bed occupancy report in the week that ended on June 3 shows that Bhandara, Wardha, Buldhana, Washim, Gadchiroli have less than 25% O2 beds occupied which means they fit in one parameter. But, the test positivity in these districts is slightly higher than 5% and 10% in Buldhana. Due to this, they may not get ‘unlocked’ from Monday. Along with Buldhana, Amravati and Akola are out of the ambit for a full unlockdown from Monday as of now. Amravati, with 6.56% positivity and 28.5% oxygen beds occupied and Akola, with 7.74% positivity and 43% of oxygen beds are in Level 3. State government has given some relaxations for these district too but they will be limited.

Even as the city was battling the spread of the deadly contagion with Covid tests, a few engineering experts were conducting their own set of tests on the metro route. Even as the work lags behind by almost a month, officials claim that they will cover up the delay by increasing workforce and machinery. The first corridor from Dream City to Sarthana is under development. Second corridor Bhesan to Saroli will be in next phase. The project, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2021, is being developed by Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC). Of the first corridor, almost 77.27 percent of geotechnical investigation and 47 percent test pile casting work on one section of Dream City to Kadarsha Ni Nal stretch of 11.6 km has been completed. “In test pile casting, we check load capacity. We try to find out if the design matches the requirements of the spot of construction. So far, the results are satisfactory,” said a GMRC official. “The project work continued amid the pandemic and testing work is completed on some portion. As the situation becomes normal the work will take speed,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. Currently 300 workers are engaged at multiple locations in the city. “In normal circumstances we would have completed the pile testing work at least on one section. We are delayed by one month but we will cover it soon by increasing our total workforce and machinery,” said the official. “We will gradually increase the total workforce to 1,000 labourers by the end of August that will accelerate the work further,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-metro-rail-project-on-track-despite-pandemic/articleshow/83213703.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Senior police inspector from Sitabuldi Atul Sabnis had on June 1 prevented hawkers from operating on Sitabuldi main road. “Hawkers have been running businesses on Sitabuldi main road for several years. They put up their stalls like any regular day on June 1. At around 1pm, Sabnis approached the hawkers, asking them to produce guidelines issued by NMC regarding allowing hawkers to do business,” said association secretary Durgadas Kewalramani. The hawkers claimed that street vendors from the entire city were being allowed to do business. Citing examples, they claimed that when vegetable vendors and hawkers in Sakkardara, Jaripatka, Khamla etc are allowed, “why only we are being prevented from earning our livelihood”. The senior PI stopped hawkers from vending on Wednesday too. A delegation of hawkers also met Dharampeth zone assistant municipal commissioner Prakash Warade. He clarified that NMC won’t allow Sitabuldi hawkers to operate since no guidelines have been issued regarding hawking business. Subsequently, the hawkers staged a silent sit-down protest to draw attention of the state government, and allow them to earn a livelihood. “Hundreds of street vendors from Sitabuldi have been badly impacted due to the lockdown like restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19,” said hawker Sandip Sahu. “We are into the second month of lockdown from April 5, and hawkers here have not been able to earn a livelihood. We have absolutely no other means to feed our family,” he said. The hawkers claimed that not allowing vendors to do business is also a violation of the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, which guarantees hawkers can continue activity till they are relocated. “Since non-essential shops have been allowed to operate we should also be permitted for vending,” said the hawkers. Ambhore pointed out that last year after the lockdown was lifted and non-essential shops were allowed to operate, our members were also permitted to resume their business activity. “However, for no reason, the same is not being followed this year, which has resulted in critical condition of our members and families.” He further said until they get permission, the association will continue with their silent protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/not-allowed-to-set-up-stalls-sitabuldi-hawkers-stage-protest/articleshow/83215870.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The index is just about 300 points away from its all-time peak of 52,526, touched in intraday trade on February 16 this year. The Nifty is already at a new all-time high at near the 15,700 points level as sliding new daily Covid infection numbers and also dipping positivity rate lifted investor sentiment on Dalal Street. The current rally is a broad-based one as is evident from its spread: Along with the sensex, even BSE’s Midcap and Smallcap indices hit record intraday peaks on Thursday at 22,395 points and 24,138 levels, respectively. As a result investors’ wealth, measured by BSE’s market capitalisation too settled at a record peak at nearly Rs 229 lakh crore. The sensex, since scaling its all-time high level in mid-February, had touched an interim low at about 47,700 mark in the third week of April, but has since been on an northward journey, despite net selling by foreign funds and muted global cues in recent days. According to Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, in recent days global cues were mixed as investors weighed inflation concerns ahead of key US economic data while oil prices rose to near one-anda-half year highs. “On the domestic side, Nifty, after two days of flat closing, scaled to new highs as consistent falls in daily Covid-19 cases, and a stronger rupee, kept market mood upbeat.” The sentiments were buoyant despite Services PMI contracting in May for the first time in eight months, Khemka wrote in a post-market note. Dalal Street would be looking at the outcome of RBI’s policy meeting on Friday. The central bank’s main policy making body is expected to keep rates unchanged but may come out with some new measures to support the economy battered again by the Covid second wave in India. Investors, however, would be keenly watching what the RBI has to say about the inflation in the economy which has, in recent times, been sticky at an elevated level. For the next few weeks investors will be closely watching how states lift Covidrelated restrictions which are in place now, how the vaccination drive of the government picks up pace and then how the economy tries to make a comeback. Technically, the Nifty is on course to scale the 16,000 level. “For the Nifty, 15,550/15,600 are the support levels. However, the resistance is close to 15,750/15,800. The 15,770/15,780 levels could be a big hurdle,” said Shrikant Chouhan, executive VP (equity technical research) at Kotak Securities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-closes-at-record-peak-of-52232-as-covid-cases-drop/articleshow/83222277.cms||---

The deceased was identified as 37-year-old M Venu Babu, a resident of Gollalapalem village in Bheemili mandal on the outskirts of Vizag. Venu Babu was critical when he was admitted to VIMS on June 1. However, according to family members, he was recovering steadily. Depressed and scared of the condition of his health, Venu Babu jumped off a three-storied building. This is the second suicide of a Covid-19 patient to be reported from VIMS. On May 23, a 45-year-old Covid-19 patient committed suicide at the hospital.

Only the shops selling essential commodities will be allowed to function from June 5 to 9. All other shops which have been given permission now to open will close at 7pm on June 4. The shops which are selling the raw materials for industrial units and those shops which are selling construction materials will be allowed to open. All the government, semigovernment, corporations, commissions and public sector undertakings will function with 50% employees from June 10. Earlier, it was decided to operate these offices with 50% employees from June 7. The government has also decided not to make mandatory Covid negative certificates who are travelling from one district to another, including the delivery boys. However, the people who are coming from outside the state will need Covid-19 negative certificates. Death certification:The chief minister said that it has been decided to bring in amendments in determining the Covid-19 deaths in the state. It has been decided to determine the deaths in the district level by a team of doctors. At present a state-level committee is determining the deaths after collecting the data from all districts. Now, it has been decided that the deaths will be determined in the respective districts itself. The decision has been taken following widespread allegations that there is under reporting of Covid deaths in the state. The opposition had even raised the issue in the assembly recently. The chief minister has also given directive to take effective steps to prevent a third wave in the state. All people who are staying in the panchayats along the state borders will be vaccinated. Apart from this all guest workers will be vaccinated. If anyone is getting positive in an apartment complex, all the residents in that building should be informed about this. This will have to be informed to the neighbouring health centre, police station and local body authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/more-curbs-in-kerala-from-tomorrow-to-reduce-tpr/articleshow/83222297.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa government increasing vaccination centres, but failing to mobilise people||PANAJI: Although the government has increased vaccination centres, it is yet to simultaneously mobilise people to take the vaccine. Many have attributed the lukewarm response to the top down approach the government has used to administer vaccines. Some centres functioning from 9am to 5pm, have been receiving response in single digits raising questions on whether vaccines are being judiciously used or wasted. A vaccine vial which contains 10 to 12 doses must be utilised within four hours or discarded. Goa last month the Union ministry of health and family welfare rated Goa the highest, even above Kerala, for its efficient utilisation of vials and making use of leftover doses in vials. “The government has started so many more centres but this doesn’t make sense. It has to be coupled with measures to mobilise the population,” a private doctor said. In Margao, seven centres vaccinated 268 people in the new categories of divyang, lactating mothers and parents of infants on Thursday. Social worker and founder of human touch foundation Peter Borges said civil society groups, NGOs, influencers, social and religious leaders should have all been roped in to get the population vaccinated as fast as possible. “They could have made an open call for vaccination. It was a model adopted for HIV testing where even religious leaders tested in public and encouraged others to do so. Influential leaders should be brought on board as ambassadors to spread the word that vaccination is not harmful,” he said. In the past, polio vaccination too got a big fillip when civil society organisations like Rotary came on board, he said. “Unfortunately, here it is largely driven by the government. If NGOs were engaged, they would take the vaccination programme forward. The government needs to change its strategy and be innovative. Meanwhile, Manipal Hospital will open online slots for registration of Covaxine and Covishield vaccination first dose and Covaxine vaccination second dose for the 18-44-year age group on June 4 at 11am. The slots will be available from June 7 to June 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-increasing-vax-centres-but-failing-to-mobilise-people/articleshow/83216211.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||India||CBSE can’t refuse to change names after declaring results: Supreme court||NEW DELHI: New Delhi: In an important judgment on name ordained identity of individuals, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the CBSE cannot impose a blanket ban on effecting changes in the names of students, parents and other particulars in the certificates or mark sheets after declaration of results of board examinations. This judgment was delivered by a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari on 22 petitions relating to correction/change in name/surname or date of birth of candidates or their parents in the CBSE certificates. Various High Courts had given conflicting rulings on this issue - some permitting effecting of the changes while others refusing. Times ViewThere could be several bona fide reasons for which an individual needs a new name. CBSE should facilitate the process, rather than being cussed about it. The SC has rightly made them see the light.Writing the 132-page judgment, Justice Khanwilkar said that the right to change name is a constituent element of freedom of expression of identity. "Afterall, in the social sphere, an individual is not only recognized by how an individual identifies oneself but also by how his/her official records identify him/her. For, in every public transaction of an individual, official records introduce the person by his/her name and other relevant particulars." The bench termed the CBSE certificates as an important public document often relied for establishing one's identity and directed the Board to take immediate steps to amend its bye-laws to allow candidates to change their or parents' names in the certificate even after declaration of results. The SC said, "Identity, therefore, is an amalgam of various internal and external including acquired characteristics of an individual and name can be regarded as one of the foremost indicators of identity. And therefore, an individual must be in complete control of her name and law must enable her to retain as well as to exercise such control freely 'for all times'. Such control would inevitably include the aspiration of an individual to be recognized by a different name for a just cause." Justices Khanwilkar, Gavai and Murari gave two important examples to give credence to its decision in forcing the CBSE to entertain requests for change of name and other particulars even after declaration of results, which under the CBSE bye-laws had been permitted only on the orders of the court prior to declaration of results. Post-declaration of results, only the correction of discrepancies between the school records and CBSE records were permitted. The SC said the Board's obligation to take additional administrative burden for entertaining requests for change of names and other details post declaration of results is no doubt onerous but the propensity of a student losing career opportunities due to inaccurate certificate is unparalleled. "Illustratively, a juvenile accused of being in conflict with the law or a victim of sexual abuse whose identity gets compromised due to lapses by media or the investigative body, despite there being complete legal protection for the same, may consider changing the name to seek rehabilitation in the society in exercise of her right to be forgotten. If the Board, in such a case, refuses to change the name, the student would be compelled to live with the scars of the past," the bench said. "In such circumstances, the avowed public interest in securing rehabilitation of affected persons would overwhelm the Board’s interest in securing administrative efficiency. In fact, it would be against the human dignity of the student, the protection whereof is the highest duty of all concerned. A Board dealing with maintenance of educational standards cannot arrogate to itself the power to impact the identity of students who enrol with it. The right to control one’s identity must remain with the individual, subject, of course, to reasonable restrictions," it said. Highlighting the importance of CBSE certificates in seeking admissions to higher courses and applying for jobs, the bench said, "an inaccuracy or denial of change could be fatal to a student’s future prospects and all these concerns cannot be brushed aside in the name of administrative exigencies." It said CBSE cannot refuse request for change of name when UIDAI entertains such request for Aadhar Cards and ministry of external affairs for passports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbse-cant-refuse-to-change-names-after-declaring-results-supreme-court/articleshow/83222310.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The state reported 572 new cases and its active caseload fell below 10,000. At 17 deaths, the state saw a drop in Covid casualties in the last 24-hours, taking the toll to 2,711, while the recovery rate rose to 92%. A 36-year-old man from Chimbel, who was the youngest among the deceased, died after 10 days of treatment at Goa Medical College (GMC). He had no comorbidities and the immediate cause of his death was cardiac arrest and acute respiratory distress syndrome. A 62-year-old woman from Cortalim died at the South Goa district hospital within a few hours of admission, she was in home isolation after she had tested positive a few days ago. Another death reported in 24-hours of admission to a hospital was that of a 70-year-old woman from Curchorem, who had comorbidities. She died at the ESI hospital. Of the 17 casualties reported during the day, ten deaths were recorded at GMC, two were reported by SGDH, and four patients died at different private hospitals. Doctors feel that the measures adopted by the State since last month, has helped to bring down the caseload, and people should continue to take follow covid appropriate measures. Health minister Vishwajit Rane had a virtual meeting with health officers of the directorate of the health services, directing them to reach out at the grassroots level to conduct awareness of vaccination. The health officers directed about the steps to be taken during the rains.

---||Goa||Goa doctors cite risks of steroid abuse by Covid patients||PANAJI: The second wave of the pandemic has brought to the fore the misuse of steroids. The abuse of the drugs by Covid patients in Goa may not be as rampant as seen in other parts of the country, but it is happening here, too, the state’s doctors said, warning about the various adverse effects. Steroids have an important role to play in the treatment of Covid patients, but introduced with bad timing can lead to complications. The drug is not to be administered at the beginning of the infection, only after day five and that too, if there is evidence of the patient having developed pneumonia, doctors said. However, they have found that many patients are either self-medicating or using them on the recommendation of their own doctors or, in many cases, even a quack. “The decision of administering steroids to a Covid patient has to be taken by experts. Given in the right settings, it will be a lifesaver, but over usage will lead to problems,” consultant cardiologist at GMC, Dr Manjunath Desai said, adding that while steroids are very useful in Covid treatment, there is timing for its administration. A senior doctor in private practice said that he has seen several Covid patients who had used steroids from day one of their infection on their doctor’s advice. In some cases, they had consulted quacks. “I have seen it in many home-isolated patients who consumed steroids after contracting the virus. In most cases, they had consulted their own doctors,” the doctor said. “If taken from the beginning of the infection, it will suppress immunity and will allow the virus to grow to cause viremia,” Desai said. Dr Anil Mehndiratta, a chest physician, said misuse or overuse of steroids can lead to adverse effects such as raised sugar levels, high blood pressure and weakness. There is also a risk that the patient may develop a fungal infection of the eye after taking high doses of steroids. Consulting physician at Heathway Hospital Dr Chitralekha Nayak said that while she has not seen it in Goa, she has seen doctors in places like Delhi and elsewhere prescribing high doses of steroids from the beginning. “If you have a cough for two days, there is absolutely no need for steroids to be taken. But if a patient’s CT scan shows evidence of Covid pneumonia, he needs to be started on steroids, as it is likely that his condition will worsen on the ninth day, leading to falling in his oxygen level. It will be fatal to wait for it to happen,” Nayak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/docs-cite-risks-of-steroid-abuse-by-covid-patients/articleshow/83216498.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||India||PM Modi joins interaction with Class 12 students||NEW DELHI: Post the cancellation of Class XII Boards, PM Narendra Modi joined students and their parents in an unscheduled interaction and asked whether they will now watch sports and await the Olympics even as he advised students to use their time in a productive and creative manner. Joining the online interaction, the PM asked the students about their reaction to the cancellation of the Board exams due to the pandemic and how they intend to use their time during this period. The interaction had been organised by the ministry of education. During 30-odd minutes, Modi told students that they should always remember the mantra of “health is wealth” and enquired what they do to remain physically fit. Students too shared their experiences and expressed relief following Tuesday’s announcement on cancellation of the exams, which ended a long spell of uncertainty. Hiteshwar Sharma from Panchkula said: “The pressure on us was just increasing each day. I was preparing to be among the toppers, but I feel what is studied is never wasted.” When the Prime Minister asked the students whether the cancellation created a vacuum for them as till morning of June 1 they would have been busy studying and making time-tables, a student from Guwahati, said: “Sir, you have said before that exams should be celebrated as a festival. So, there was no fear. Though circumstances outside were not good, I had faith that a wise decision would be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-joins-interaction-with-class-12-students/articleshow/83222338.cms||---

Party spokesperson Prashant Naik told reporters on Thursday that as there was no provision in the Goa Board of Secondary and higher secondary education Act for cancellation exams or alternative marking system to evaluate students’ performance, the decision to cancel the exams was devoid of any legal sanctity. He asked the government to seek legal advice over the matter 43,000 students’ future was at stake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cancelling-exams-has-no-legal-sanctity/articleshow/83216602.cms||---

Those who are not satisfied with their results, declared through a scheme to be announced by the board, will be later provided an opportunity to appear for an exam when conditions are conducive, Goa Board said in its circular. “Class XII assessment will be made as per well-defined objective criteria in a time-bound manner. It is decided that any student who is not satisfied with the assessment, an option to appear in the examinations would be provided by the Board as and when the situation becomes conducive,” the Board said. Chief minister and education minister Pramod Sawant had announced the decision to cancel the state board Class XII examinations for 2021 on Wednesday evening, after extensive consultations with education officials. “Due to an unprecedented situation arising out of Covid-19 in the state, the HSSC public examination 2021, which were postponed, hereby stands cancelled,” the Board stated. In 2021, 19,200 students have registered to appear for the Class XII exams. Earlier, the Class X examinations, for which 23,400 students had registered, were called off too due to the pandemic. Goa Board has already announced the evaluation scheme to be adopted for Class X students based on their internal assessment scores. Official sources have said that marking scheme on similar lines is on the anvil for Class XII students as well, where their performance in internal tests as well as during the previous academic years, like Class XI, are likely to be taken into consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/can-appear-for-exam-later-if-not-happy-with-result/articleshow/83216690.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Good Samaritans provide succor to patients at Benaulim centre||COLVA: On May 30, a 54-year old Covid-19 patient walked out of the Benaulim quarantine centre (BQC) fully recovered. She hesitantly left the centre; she wanted to stay back and lend the other patients there a helping hand. During trying times like this, voluntary organisations bridge the gap between the government and citizens. They identify the people’s needs and provide the necessary support and services where the government is unable to reach. Isolation centres are among the many requirements fulfilled by voluntary organisations and well-meaning citizens. BQC, a brainchild of Royla Fernandes, former sarpanch of Benaulim, has provided solace to many patients. She roped in a number of professionals from various fields through Goa Dimension, a business group, and set-up the centre within 14 days. Fernandes said there was a critical urgency to save lives. “I called a few friends and set the ball rolling. Parish priest of St John the Baptist Church in Benaulim, Fr Lucio Dias, provided us the church hall to house patients, shack owners gave us their beach beds and mattresses and one businessman gave us pillows. Help like finance, food, medical aid and security started coming in from various well wishers from Goa and abroad,” she said A panch member from Orlim, Gaudencio Luis, was the core planner of this endeavour. He oversees the logistics of food supply for the patients. “Breakfast is provided by Maa Vaishnavi Devi temple trust every morning, we just have to tell them the number of patients and breakfast is delivered, lunch and dinner is provided by well wishers,” Luis said, adding that the response from Good Samaritans was overwhelming. Thirty-eight patients have benefitted from the BQC centre till date. Fourteen have been discharged, said medical professional Anirudh Bhat, who volunteers and reviews all the medical processes at the centre. When cyclone Tauktae struck, the centre was powered with the generator belonging to the church, 10 oxygen cylinders with masks were provided by clubs, six oxygen concentrators were given by NGOs, two air-purifiers were sponsored by a Goan working in the Gulf, Fernandes said. “To make all this work we needed to step beyond the box, to reach out to the public to spread awareness about the facilities available at the BQC. We used technology to the maximum,” Kuwait-based IT consultant working for the centre, Raymond Pereira said. He said that doctors make it a point to visit the centre as and when required despite being stretched the limit. Though most work is voluntary, the centre pays nurses, cleaning staff and security a substantial honorary amount for their services, Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/good-samaritans-provide-succor-to-patients-at-benaulim-centre/articleshow/83216906.cms||Nisser Dias
---||Goa||Goa: Cos step forward to augment state’s Covid resources||PANAJI: Even as the state’s health infrastructure remains overburdened by the deluge of Covid-19 patients, organisations and individuals have stepped forward to lend oxygen concentrators and regulators to home-isolated patients until they find a bed, and in some cases, even to recovered patients. In Margao, the Rotary Club has started an oxygen concentrator bank from which the units are lent to patients for free. A day after it started, eight of the twelve units were given away to patients that were discharged from hospitals but whose oxygen was still low. They are also receiving requests from people under home isolation, and have placed orders for more devices. “Some of these people need a higher flow of oxygen and cannot use a concentrator. In such cases, we also have a spare oxygen cylinder that we are lending to patients,” said the club’s chair, Dr Lenny Da Costa. Similarly, the Pai Kane group has started ‘Oxygenate Goa’ under the Devidas Pai Kane health, education and fellowship trust. The oxygen concentrator bank allows people to gain access to oxygen concentrators from the comfort of their home for free on a returnable basis, for a maximum period of eight days. When Covid-19 cases peaked last month, the humanitarian relief society of Goa realised that patients are struggling to source regulators. Thus, they began letting people borrow an emergency regulator from them for emergency use only, and are asking borrowers to return the same when no longer required. “We also help them find oxygen cylinders if they need any, and offer pick-up and drop service to hospitals,” said Arman Shaikh, one of the volunteers in charge. They have 20 regulators at their disposal, which over the past 25 days they have lent for free to nearly 70 beneficiaries across Goa. Meanwhile, VM Salgaocar and its sister concerns have donated a batch of ventilators and oxygen concentrators to Goa Medical College, South Goa district hospital, Margao, and sub-district hospital, Chicalim. The units are imported from the Netherlands. The company has also donated oximeters to the sub-district hospital, Chicalim, the village panchayats of Chicalim and Benaulim, and to the Indian Medical Association, Mormugao, to provide for patients under home isolation. The Swayam charitable trust, Goa Carbon and the Vassudeva Dempo family trust, together with the SaveLIFE foundation, provided 200 type-D medical oxygen cylinders for use in hospitals and Covid care centers. The total value of the donation is approximately Rs 65 lakh. Similarly, Vedanta has extended a helping hand by donating 74 oxygen concentrators at the SP Mukherjee stadium Covid care centre, and the Fomento group has placed a 4MT oxygen tanker at the disposal of state hospitals to augment existing resources. The confederation of Indian industry (CII), Goa, donated 45 oxygen concentrators of 10L capacity each, 80 pedestal fans and 200 oximeters towards relief initiatives. Apart from the relief work, CII said that they are also working with the government to boost vaccine infrastructure in the country. As part of GCCI’s support to the government in its fight against Covid, Persistent systems, a member of the chamber, donated eight oxygen concentrators to the Rotary club of Panaji, and 20 to the government. Also, Novotel resorts in Candolim have donated 15 oxygen concentrators to the Candolim panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cos-step-forward-to-augment-states-covid-resources/articleshow/83216990.cms||Nida Sayed

The pace of recognising startups has picked up after the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) tweaked the norms a few years ago, which also enable them to get fiscal and infrastructural support. A startup registered with DPIIT, for instance, enjoys a simplified compliance structure, 80% reduction in the cost of filing patents, tax exemptions and can wind up its business within 90 days of its application to do so. While many more startups would have been set up, the recognition by the government is part of a special programme to incentivise entrepreneurs. In fact, the Covid-19 pandemic does not seem to have dampened the spirit in any way with record recognitions given last year (see graphic). Separate data available with the ministry of corporate affairs had shown a 27% jump in the number of new companies during 2020-21, which added up to over 1.5 lakh, with another 42,000 limited liability partnership firms also being registered during the year. “As on June 3, 2021, 50,000 startups across have been recognised as startups by DPIIT, of which 19,896 have been recognised since April 1, 2020,” DPIIT said in a statement. These startups are present across 623 districts with at least one startup in each state and union territory (UT). While Maharashtra, Karnataka, New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat have the highest number of startups, 30 states and UTs have announced specific policies to support them. To be eligible for registration under Startup India, a government initiative launched in 2016 to bolster the domestic startup ecosystem, a company needs to fulfill several criteria, including being incorporated and registered in India up to 10 years from the date of incorporation and having annual turnover of not more than Rs 100 crore for the financial years since registration. “Recognized startups have contributed significantly to job creation, with 5,49,842 jobs reported by 48,093 startups with an average number of 11 employees per startup,” the department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-recognises-50000-startups-across-india/articleshow/83222389.cms||John Sarkar
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: No consensus on Class XII exams||CHENNAI: Parents and students want the state board Class XII exams cancelled in line with the CBSE, while teachers want to hold them. The state government has asked around 7,000 higher secondary schools to find out what parents and teachers think. The schools compiled the feedback and sent it to the directorate of school education on Thursday. The school education department will hold an online meeting of health experts, educationists, and officials on Friday. It will submit a report to chief minister M K Stalin on Saturday on the issue. C Thenmozhi, a parent from Kolathur, said students were under pressure due to the postponement of exams. "Health experts are also saying the third wave will affect the children. So, it is better if the exams are cancelled," she said. K P O Suresh, state president of the Tamil Nadu Post-Graduate Teachers Association, said the board exams are necessary for admission to higher education courses. "A majority of students do not have access to online classes. The question paper pattern should be more liberal," he said. "In a survey among parents and students, only 25% of parents wanted the board exams. Parents say the life of a child is more important than exams," said Agnes Rita, principal of GRT Mahalakshmi Vidhyalaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Ashok Nagar. "Due to uncertainty and the long wait, a majority of parents and students were not in favour of board exams. The state government should have conducted some form of online assessment earlier," said B Purushothaman, senior principal of Everwin Group of Schools in Chennai. Padmaja R, headmistress of Chennai Girls Higher Secondary School in Saidapet, said teachers and top rankers want exams. "But, a majority of students were not for exams citing mental exhaustion and tiredness. They were also not confident of writing the exams after facing just three months of offline classes. Some students only gave Covid-19 as a reason for not wanting exams," she said. Parents from government schools also were not in favour of exams. "Of 600 students in our school, parents of above 400 students were not for exams," a headmaster of a government school in the city said. "In our school, 30% students and 100% teachers were in favour of conducting the exams. The state government should at least conduct an online assessment test to evaluate the students," said GJ Manohar, principal of MCC Higher Secondary School in Chetpet. N Vijayan, senior principal of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaram, said the state government should conduct the exams after the cases come down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-no-consensus-on-class-xii-exams/articleshow/83226635.cms||A Ragu Raman

Conducting in-person examinations during the ongoing pandemic will put the safety of students at risk, said NSUI. They wrote to Goa governor and GU asking for the evaluation based on the marks obtained by students in the previous academic year “Students are in a panic situation regarding their end semester exams,” said NSUI North Goa president. It recommended conducting “a small online exam with 30% weightage” and calculating the remaining 70% based on previous semester exams and internal assessment marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/varsity-must-follow-goa-board-nsui/articleshow/83217053.cms||---

He also assured availability of two oxygen cylinders for each of the eight panchayats under Quepem taluka. Kavlekar held a meeting to discuss disaster management and Covid-19 management which was attended by health officials and deputy collectors of Quepem, Sanguem, Canacona and Dharbandora taluka at the Quepem municipal hall. The MLA assured health officers that their requirements for respective primary health centres (PHCs) will be met. Kavlekar also said that since there are only three PHCs in Quepem taluka, health centres are facing an acute shortage of vehicles to bring Covid positive patients for immediate treatment from the hinterland villages like Cavrem, Barcem and Khola. “Keeping in mind their difficulties I will provide two cylinders in each panchayat office for immediate first-aid till patients reach the nearest health centre. Village panchayats of Betul, Khola, Barcem, Fatorpa, Morpirla, Balli, Ambaulim and Avedem will get oxygen cylinders within next two days including one trainer in each panchayat,” said Kavlekar. He also requested health officers, councilors and panchas to mobilize people for vaccination. Dr Mamata Kakodkar, health officer of Balli PHC pointed to the priority of providing oxygen concentrators to the deputy CM. Currently the Curchorem community health centre (CHC) and Sanguem PHC has two oxygen concentrators each whereas Quepem PHC has 17 concentrators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kavlekar-inspects-quepem-health-infra-for-preparedness-for-third-wave/articleshow/83217077.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Ghar wapsi’, bypolls on TMC’s Sat meet agenda||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress’s first organisational meeting after polls, likely to be chaired by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday, will decide, among others, on how to deal with the ‘ghar-wapsi’ brigade. Several leaders who had defected to BJP ahead of polls have been sending feelers expressing their willingness to return. Trinamool has indicated it may decide this on a “case-to-case basis” after accommodate views of local leaders. The high-voltage elections have created a “trust-deficit” between these defectors and local workers, leaders said. The party is also likely to discuss threadbare a proposal mooted by party MP Abhishek Banerjee, sources said, for a one-leader-one-post formula in which leaders with ministerial berths and administrative responsibilities may be relieved of their party roles. Many district presidents and office-bearers have made their way to the cabinet, in addition to leaders working as Board of Administrators chairperson or members across municipalities. Polls to Bengal’s civic bodies are overdue since 2020 due to the pandemic. Banerjee is also expected to throw light on the bypoll issue. Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay has resigned as Bhowanipore MLA and started his outreach in Khardah. The party has not made any formal announcement that Banerjee would re-contest from her old Bhowanipore seat. Likewise, Covid deaths and resignation of two BJP MPs Nisith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar as MLAs have also thrown open five assembly seats for by-elections. All senior leaders, including Abhishek Banerjee and strategist Prasant Krishor are likely to attend the meeting. Some leaders said they expected the party’s top decision-making bodies to be rejigged to accommodate some new faces. However, there was no formal word on this. The ‘ghar-wapsi’ issue, however, remains foremost on the agenda, sources said. While some defectors have turned up at Kalighat, some have sent their kin to meet Banerjee to seek her “forgiveness”. Party leaders have also been receiving “calls” and “feelers” from many, most of whom have lost the polls on a BJP ticket. “There cannot be a one-rule-for-all formula. Several of them not only deserted the party at a crucial hour, they also spoke out against senior leaders alleging corruption. Re-inducting many names is out of the question,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ghar-wapsi-bypolls-on-tmcs-sat-meet-agenda/articleshow/83217055.cms||---
---||Kolkata||PM calls up Mukul to ask after his ailing wife day after Abhishek hosp visit||Kolkata: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday called up Mukul Roy to enquire about his wife’s health. This comes a day after the Bengal BJP president visited Roy’s ailing wife in hospital, but Roy claimed he did not have any knowledge about Dilip Ghosh’s visit. Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee had first gone to the hospital to meet Roy’s wife Krishna and spoke to his son, Subhrangshu, triggering visits and calls by senior BJP leaders. “I received a call from the PM around 10.30am. Amitji (Shah) also called me up to ask about her health. They are the two biggest figures in Indian politics and I am grateful to them. They wanted to know about the condition of their colleague. That is quite natural,” Roy said. After his wife tested Covid-positive and was admitted to hospital in Kolkata on May 11, Roy had not left the city and kept tabs on her condition. On Wednesday, he shifted to his son’s Bijpur home. “Her health is not well and she is critical. I am thankful to those who have taken out time to visit her. I express my gratitude to each one of them,” Roy said. Apart from Union home minister Shah, BJP’s national president J P Nadda too called up Roy. On Wednesday night, Abhishek visited Roy’s wife in hospital, creating a buzz around the veteran leader’s next move in politics. “She is like my mother. I have spent a lot of moments with her when I was a kid. There could be political differences, but that cannot tarnish personal bonds,” the Trinamool MP said after coming out of hospital. A little after Abhishek left, Ghosh arrived to enquire about her health. Asked about Abhishek’s visit, he brushed aside any speculation and said the two families had known each other for long. “Everyone should remain supportive of the other during distress,” he said. Trinamool leaders were quick to raise questions about Ghosh’s visit only after Abhishek visited the hospital. On Thursday, Roy said he was not aware of Ghosh’s visit. “Neither did they contact me nor did I have any word with them. I will not be able to comment on who went to meet whom. Anyone can come to visit anyone at the hospital and there is nothing wrong in that,” Roy said. Roy’s son, on the other hand, expressed his gratitude to Abhishek. Subhrangshu, who raised speculations in political circles a few days back over his social media posts, said Abhishek had always asked about his mother’s health whenever they met. “He rushed to the hospital after he heard that my mother was critical. I am grateful to him. This courtesy will surely take politics to a new high. It does not have any relation with politics,” he said. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee too has asked about my parents’ health during this crisis. I cannot comment on Modiji’s call as he spoke to my father, but we are grateful to each one who has asked about her well-being. I pray to God for her speedy recovery,” Subhrangshu added. Lakshman Seth eyes TMC stint Former CPM leader from Haldia, Lakshman Seth, who had also joined BJP and Congress, on Thursday expressed his willingness to join Trinamool. “I am willing to join TMC if I get a chance. I never had any word with chief minister Mamata Banerjee. But I have always supported the development of the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pm-calls-up-mukul-to-ask-after-his-ailing-wife-day-after-abhishek-hosp-visit/articleshow/83217138.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Eateries, malls may be allowed to reopen after staffers get jab in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The state may shortly allow restaurants and malls, shut since May 1, to resume operations after vaccinating their staff, chief minister Mamata Banerjee indicated at an interaction with businessmen at the state secretariat on Thursday. The state government, in an order on April 30 — a day after the last phase of the eight-phase assembly elections — had prohibited them from staying open in a bid to restrict gatherings, in an effort to curb a surging second wave of the pandemic. The operating time for standalone retail shops would also be increased by an hour in the afternoons (noon to 4pm), Banerjee indicated. Restaurants would be allowed to operate between 5pm and 8pm, and malls at 25% of their optimal footfall. Standalone restaurants are likely to open before the end of the second fortnight of restrictions on June 15, but those in malls may start only when the facilities resume operations. A firm decision on reopening malls will be taken after June 16. Pointing out that the restrictions were needed to curb Covid infections, Banerjee told members of various business chambers that she was also conscious of the need for businesses to resume with all necessary precautions, so that people did not lose jobs. Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar, who was present at the meeting, requested Banerjee to allow restaurants and bars to reopen for some hours. For malls, the request came from Credai West Bengal president Sushil Mohta. Pointing out that the hospitality sector employed more than 5.7 lakh people, Poddar said several people had lost their jobs, as many businesses were on the brink of closure because of the pandemic. “Home delivery of food, which is currently allowed, consists of 10% to 15% of business that restaurants usually generate. It would be great if restaurants and bars could be reopened from 5pm to 9pm,” said Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar. Responding to the request, Banerjee said operations till 8pm would be considered but stressed that employees would have to be vaccinated first. Poddar later told TOI that vaccination was being carried out in association with the state tourism department. Responding to requests on reopening malls, the CM had said the numbers needed to be managed and hinted at limiting footfall to a fourth of each mall’s full capacity. Mohta, who is the eastern region chairman of Shopping Centres Association of India (a non-profit organisation set up to “engage in, and encourage, the development of the shopping centre industry in India”, according to its official website), pointed out that each of the bigger malls in Kolkata employed around 5,000 people. He said crowd management wasn’t difficult as most facilities had automatic sensor-based cameras to regulate the number of people allowed in at a time. Also, he said that most malls had either already vaccinated all of their staff, or were in the process of doing so. Leading restaurants and malls welcomed the prospect of resuming business. Debaditya Chaudhury, director of Chowman, Oudh 1590 & Chapter 2, said it would be a huge relief to the F&B industry if operations could resume soon. Aminia director Kabir Azhar and Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, also welcomed the CM’s proposals. Mall authorities, too, expressed their happiness. Quest Mall vice-president Sanjiv Mehra and South City Mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree said it would be fantastic if the facilities were allowed to resume operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eateries-malls-may-be-allowed-to-reopen-after-staffers-get-jab/articleshow/83218179.cms||---

On Thursday, CBI counsel and solicitor general Tushar Mehta cited before the Calcutta High Court’s five-judge bench, hearing the Narada matter, how Delhi HC had directed identification of the person and drawing up contempt proceedings against him. He also cited how the Supreme Court had transferred a trial from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi based on a letter. The accused’s counsel, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, contested the CBI argument and said there was no interruption during virtual hearing on May 17. He also contested CBI’s transfer plea of the Narada case on grounds of “perceived bias” in proceedings in the special CBI court. “There is nothing known in Indian law where the perception argument can lie based on law and order,” Singhvi argued. “There is no principle in any country which takes into account the perception of common man to examine obstruction or access to justice. If this is accepted, then no actual obstruction would be needed. Only a perception of a common man would be required.” Mehta focused on the “mobocracy” plea citing the situation in front of the CBI office at Nizam Palace the day Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim, Madan Mitra and Sovan Chatterjee were arrested. He added that the chief minister went to the CBI office and the state law minister went to the court premises like nowhere else in the country. All four leaders, who had been released on interim bail, filed affidavits on Thursday contesting CBI’s move, right from the procedure of arrest to moving high court via mail. The CM and the law minister are yet to file their affidavit in opposition, said lawyer Niladri Bhattacharya. Senior counsel Kalyan Bandyopadhyay too filed an affidavit opposing the CBI’s plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbi-cites-juhi-fans-antics-to-bolster-narada-argument/articleshow/83217096.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: I report to CM, so acted on her instruction, ex-CS Alapan Bandyopadhyay tells MHA||KOLKATA: Former state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay wrote to the Union home ministry on Thursday, denying he had “abstained” from PM Narendra Modi’s May 28 cyclone review meeting in Kalaikunda. Bandyopadhyay, now CM Mamata Banerjee’s chief adviser, has said he attended the meeting and then left at Banerjee’s instructions — to whom he “reports” — to conduct and coordinate post-cyclone review meetings in East Midnapore. State chief secretary H K Dwivedi wrote a separate letter to the Centre’s department of personnel and training on Thursday, stating that Bandyopadhyay had already retired from service on Monday before the second central government letter — instructing him to report to Delhi’s North Block — reached the state. He had chosen not to accept the three-month extension given to him on May 24 before getting this second letter, Dwivedi’s letter said. “Both replies have been sent,” a senior state government officer confirmed. The Union home ministry sent Bandyopadhyay a notice on Monday, asking him to explain why action should not be taken against him under the Disaster Management Act (2005) for not attending the PM’s review meet on May 28. The state government has insisted that both the CM and the former state chief secretary had a brief interaction with Modi and then left after seeking his permission, a point denied by the Centre. The Bengal CM also wrote a five-page letter to the PM on Monday and said it would be unfortunate if the Centre’s “vindictive and illegal” moves against Bandyopadhyay were part of its “anti-Bengal political vendetta after being rejected by Bengal’s voters in the assembly polls”. Banerjee iterated on Wednesday that Bandyopadhyay enjoyed the Bengal government’s “full support... on whatever was going on with him”. The Centre’s notice to Bandyopadhyay on Monday said the “PM and other members of his entourage” waited for 15 minutes for state officers. But the Bengal CM and the former chief secretary arrived when called and left “immediately”. By abstaining from a meeting convened by the Modi, also the National Disaster Management Authority chairperson, Bandyopadhyay “refused to comply with the lawful direction of the central government” and had violated sections of the disaster law, the centre’s notice to Bandyopadhyay said. Senior officers in Bengal, however, countered this, saying Yaas had not been declared a “disaster” at that time and — even according to the centre’s notice — Bandyopadhyay did not skip the PM’s review meeting. Besides, several persons who were not part of the NDMA were also invited to the meeting, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/i-report-to-cm-so-acted-on-her-instruction-ex-cs-tells-mha/articleshow/83218079.cms||---
---||India||RJD MP held for laundering, sent to 10 days of ED custody||NEW DELHI: After registering a money laundering investigation against top officials of the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd (Iffco), the Enforcement Directorate on Thursday arrested A D Singh, Rajya Sabha MP from Rashtriya Janata Dal, in connection with an alleged Rs 685 crore bribery scam involving import of fertilisers by Iffco between 2007 and 2014. A Delhi court sent Singh to 10-day ED custody. AgustaWestland bribery accused Rajiv Saxena has emerged as the alleged common link, with ED sources claiming that the foreign firms from which Iffco imported fertilisers parked “commissions” with him. Saxena later routed it through his shell companies to A D Singh, they claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rjd-mp-held-for-laundering-sent-to-10-days-of-ed-custody/articleshow/83222397.cms||---

The signatories, including academics Aditya Mukherjee, Mridula Mukherjee, Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib; economists Kaushik Basu, Prabhat Patnaik and Jayati Ghosh; activists Shantha Sinha, Harsh Mander and Wilson Bezwada, said the pandemic has deepened the fault-lines in society and in the light of the acts of omission and commission by the Union government, it is now up to the opposition to step up and ready themselves for the next wave. “India is thirsty for a compassionate, consensual and cooperative leadership... We hope you will rise to the occasion...,” the open letter said. Endorsing the joint letter that 12 opposition leaders had written to PM Narendra Modi on May 12, the group said, “Despite the offer to cooperate and work with the Union government, it is shocking that the GoI has neither welcomed the suggestions, nor created a truly national task force comprising all parties, state governments, experts and civil society to tackle the unprecedented situation India is facing.” They also alleged that the government “seems to have reneged on its moral and constitutional responsibilities”, and repeated the opposition charge that the Union has outsourced procurement of vaccines to states, resulting in “differential and exorbitant rates”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lead-covid-fight-187-prominent-people-urge-opposition/articleshow/83222415.cms||---
---||Chennai||Relax curbs in parts of Tamil Nadu that have Covid under control, suggest experts||Public health experts say there are no epidemiological reasons to extend the lockdown uniformly across the state to control the Covid-19 pandemic. Vaccination, people's behaviour and viral mutations need to be factored in while devising strategy, they say, stressing that lockdown isn't the only solution. Consider this: A week after fresh cases began to fall from a peak of 36,184 cases on May 21, active cases in the state began to drop (from May 28) for the first time since March 6. Besides, say experts, deaths, which are nearly plateauing at around 480 a day, are likely to fall within a day or two.  "These graphs should help the state make a policy decision on lockdown," said Vellore-based senior virologist Dr T Jacob John. The growth rate of cases was at the peak at around 9% in April. After the fall in this "momentum peak", the state touched the "numerical peak" of cases on May 21. On that day, the growth rate fell to 2%. By the time, active cases began to record a fall, the growth rate was almost negative at -0.1%. Dr John said there were no epidemiological reasons for extending the lockdown across the state. Several other public health experts agree. On Wednesday, National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, who is also a member of the state medical expert committee, had said the government lockdown should be relaxed in certain parts of the state such as the Chennai region where cases have drastically fallen. "The second wave started and peaked in different parts of the state at different times. Bed availability is also different in different districts. So, the same rules of lockdown cannot be extended to all districts," she said. Activity is more inside hospitals, than in the community, said Dr John. "On an average there is a 12- to 14-day gap between fall in fresh cases and peaking of deaths. So, tier 2 cities and small towns must forecast mortality peaks, plan human resources, drugs and infrastructure," he said. While officials worry about a drop in seropositivity - number of people with antibodies against the infection -from 32% in October 2020 to 23% in April this year, experts say it is expected. "We do not maintain high antibody levels to every pathogen we have ever encountered. If the memory response has been set up, we will be able to respond quickly when re-infected and mitigate the severity of disease," said Christian Medical College senior microbiologist Dr Gagandeep Kang. Nevertheless, there is a large population that is still unprotected and hence the threat of a third wave remains. Factors such as vaccination, people's behaviour and viral mutations may influence another wave. Scientists say a close watch on genomic changes is essential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/relax-curbs-in-parts-of-tamil-nadu-that-have-covid-under-control-suggest-experts/articleshow/83222416.cms||Pushpa Narayan
