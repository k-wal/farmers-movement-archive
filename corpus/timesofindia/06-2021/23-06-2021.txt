Today, the volunteer-based Relief Riders has expanded to 14 cities and over 750 riders, where they cater to the needs of senior citizens. Sathya Sankaran, bicycle evangelist and one of the founders of this initiative, takes us through their journey. Sathya recalls, "It was in March 2020, when the first lockdown started, someone pinged me on Twitter asking what are the cyclists of Bengaluru doing. Immediately, it got me thinking and I pinged on a WhatsApp group of ours that has all our ambassadors, about their thoughts on helping people. One of them pitched the idea of calling our initiative Relief Riders. We began with six people volunteering. Soon, we expanded to 20 volunteers and by the end of two months, we were around 80 of us serving around 250 senior citizens and others." The inquiries died down through the unlock phases, but Sathya says that they have expanded and been doing a lot more work this time. "The second wave hit us like we never imagined. The number of riders is over 250 people in Bengaluru alone. Another interesting development was that other cities also got inspired by the idea and we have over 750 volunteers riding across 14 cities in the country. This is the largest contingent of cycling based help that I have heard of anywhere in the world," he proudly shares. No compromise on the environmentAnother idea that Sathya is excited about, is the fact that this is also a green initiative. "In a month of the second lockdown, we had delivered to more than 2,000 people and more importantly, saved around four tonnes of carbon dioxide in all the cities put together. I had two goals behind this initiative - we are not just saving lives in the pandemic but also future lives from climate change. We have tried to show that climate change does not need to be compromised while trying to do something. This is why our slogan reads we are part of the solution and not the problem," he explains. Adding a personal touchThe riders have all learnt some interesting lessons in dealing with their tasks too, shares Sathya, adding that the elders have a different way of functioning. "They do not believe in this impersonal way of communicating. They may call our main helpline once or twice. But after that they latch on to the person who has delivered. For us, we have an algorithm that says closest people first when it comes to riding. We have a back end system which calculates who is the closest active Relief Rider to the request. But the elders end up calling the same person again as they like the personal touch. They know them by name. We have now figured out a way to deal with that, where we answer the call and then excuse ourselves by saying we might not come in for that and send in someone else," he explains. There are times they have had two or three riders doing a relay to ferry something that is available in another part of the city, too. "The elders have really appreciated us, as simple chores like buying coriander leaves, tomatoes or medicines are not done so easily by someone living far away from them. They are not comfortable with the online delivery apps either. They like the personal touch. These might be small deeds we are doing, but they find them valuable," says Sathya. Ensuring safety of ridersFor the Relief Riders, ensuring safety is their topmost priority. "When we know we are at risk, we take greater care of ourselves. We have a collective culture where we say if one gets infected then they let everyone down. So everyone takes all the precautions. We also work on rotations and have more people now, so we do just one or two sortees in a day. We don't have targets to meet, so that's our advantage and it allows people to rest and not be over exposed," he reveals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bicycle-evangelist-sathya-sankaran-shares-how-his-volunteers-have-been-helping-people-since-the-first-lockdown/articleshow/83744348.cms||Sunayana Suresh

Police who identified the deceased as P Sathya Sairam of Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district suspect it to be a case of suicide. The spot where the body was found is 8km from his hostel and 1km from where his bicycle was found. Police said CCTV camera footage showed him buying petrol at an outlet on ECR at 4.15am on Sunday. Police said Sairam, a category I trainee scientist at IGCAR, Kalpakkam, moved into a hostel at the Pudupatnam township in February 2020 and was in room 88. Police said Sairam, who went out for cycling at 5am and return at 6am daily, on Sunday set out earlier than usual but did not return. Some of his colleagues went in search but couldn’t spot. His phone remained switched off. His friend Siva Krishnan informed his father Pasumarthy Nageswar Rao who arrived and filed a police complaint on Monday evening. Police said Sairam’s betrothal was scheduled for June 27. “We are awaiting the postmortem report,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/charred-body-of-kalpakkam-scientist-found/articleshow/83759160.cms||Sindhu Kannan
---||World||How Big Tech created a data 'treasure trove' for police||PROVIDENCE: When US law enforcement officials need to cast a wide net for information, they're increasingly turning to the vast digital ponds of personal data created by Big Tech companies via the devices and online services that have hooked billions of people around the world.  Data compiled by four of the biggest tech companies shows that law enforcement requests for user information - phone calls, emails, texts, photos, shopping histories, driving routes and more - have more than tripled in the US since 2015. Police are also increasingly savvy about covering their tracks so as not to alert suspects of their interest.  That's the backdrop for recent revelations that the Trump-era US Justice Department sought data from Apple, Microsoft and Google about members of Congress, their aides and news reporters in leak investigations -- then pursued court orders that blocked those companies from informing their targets.  In just the first half of 2020 -- the most recent data available -- Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft together fielded more than 112,000 data requests from local, state and federal officials. The companies agreed to hand over some data in 85% of those cases. Facebook, including its Instagram service, accounted for the largest number of disclosures.  Consider Newport, Rhode Island, a coastal city of 24,000 residents that attracts a flood of summer tourists. Fewer than 100 officers patrol the city -- but they make multiple requests a week for online data from tech companies.  That's because most crimes - from larceny and financial scams to a recent fatal house party stabbing at a vacation rental booked online - can be at least partly traced on the internet. Tech providers, especially social media platforms, offer a "treasure trove of information" that can help solve them, said Lt. Robert Salter, a supervising police detective in Newport.  "Everything happens on Facebook," Salter said. "The amount of information you can get from people's conversations online -- it's insane."  As ordinary people have become increasingly dependent on Big Tech services to help manage their lives, American law enforcement officials have grown far more savvy about technology than they were five or six years ago, said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.  That's created what Cohn calls "the golden age of government surveillance." Not only has it become far easier for police to trace the online trails left by suspects, they can also frequently hide their requests by obtaining gag orders from judges and magistrates. Those orders block Big Tech companies from notifying the target of a subpoena or warrant of law enforcement's interest in their information - contrary to the companies' stated policies.  Of course, there's often a reason for such secrecy, said Andrew Pak, a former federal prosecutor. It helps prevent investigations getting sidetracked because someone learns about it, he said -"the target, perhaps, or someone close to it."  Longstanding opposition to such gag orders has recently resurfaced in the wake of the Trump-era orders. Apple in 2018 shared phone and account data generated by two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, but the politicians didn't find out until May, once a series of gag orders expired.  Microsoft also shared data about a congressional aide and had to wait more than two years before telling that person. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, last week called for an end to the overuse of secret gag orders, arguing in a Washington Post opinion piece that "prosecutors too often are exploiting technology to abuse our fundamental freedoms."  Critics like Cohn have called for revision of US surveillance laws drawn up years ago when the police and prosecutors typically had to deliver warrants to the home of the person being targeted for searches. Now that most personal information is now kept in the equivalent of vast digital storehouses controlled by Big Tech companies, such searches can proceed in secret.  "Our surveillance laws are really based on the idea that if something is really important, we store it at home, and that doesn't pass the giggle test these days," Cohn said. "It's just not true."  Many tech companies are quick to point out that the majority of the information they are forced to share is considered "non-content" data. But that can include useful details such as the basic personal details you supply when you register for an account, or the metadata that shows if and when you called or messaged someone, though not what you said to them.  Law enforcement can also ask tech companies to preserve any data generated by a particular user, which prevents the target from deleting it. Doing so doesn't require a search warrant or any judicial oversight, said Armin Tadayon, a cybersecurity associate at advisory firm the Brunswick Group.  If police later find reasonable grounds for conducting a search, they can return with a warrant and seize the preserved data. If not, the provider deletes the copies and "the user likely never finds out," Tadayon said.  In Newport, getting a search warrant for richer online data isn't that difficult. Salter said it requires a quick trip to a nearby courthouse to seek a judge's approval; some judges are also available after hours for emergency requests. And if a judge finds there is probable cause to search through online data, tech companies almost always comply.  "Most of the companies do play ball," Salter said. "We can speak with people, get questions answered. They're usually pretty helpful."  Nearly all big tech companies - from Amazon to rental sites like Airbnb, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft and service providers like Verizon - now have teams to respond to such requests and regularly publish reports about how much they disclosed. Some of the most dramatic increases in requests have been to tech companies that cater to younger people.  As the messaging app Snapchat has grown in popularity, so have government requests for its data. Snap, the company behind the app, fielded nearly 17,000 data requests in the first six months of 2020, compared to 762 in the same period of 2015.  Salter said the fact that we're all doing so much online means police detectives need to stay tech-savvy. But training courses for how to file such requests aren't hard to find.  For those worried about the growing volume of online data sought by law enforcement, Salter said: "Don't commit crimes and don't use your computer and phones to do it."  "Judges are not going to sign off on something if we don't have probable cause to go forward," he said. "We're not going to look at people's information without having something to go on."  But Cohn said more tech companies should be using encryption technology to make all personal information, including metadata, virtually impossible to decipher without a user key to unlock it.  Until then, she said, police can short circuit constitutional protections against unreasonable searches "by just going to the company instead of coming directly to us."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/how-big-tech-created-a-data-treasure-trove-for-police/articleshow/83759294.cms||---

---||World||Indian national sentenced in US for abusive sexual contact aboard airplane||WASHINGTON: A 29-year-old Indian national has been convicted by a federal jury of abusive sexual contact aboard an airplane and sentenced to two years of imprisonment, the Department of Justice said on Tuesday. Siva K Durbesula was convicted by the jury of abusive sexual contact aboard an airplane, the acting US Attorney for the District of South Carolina M Rhett DeHart said. According to filed court documents, witness testimony and evidence presented at trial, on June 23, 2019, Durbesula was a passenger aboard a flight from Chicago O'Hare airport to Myrtle Beach. Over the course of the flight, Durbesula sexually assaulted a 22-year-old female who was seated next to him. As the victim testified at trial, Durbesula pulled her toward him and groped her repeatedly mid-flight. Court records show that after the flight crew moved Durbesula away from the victim, Durbesula asked to return to his previous seat so he could speak to the victim again, the media statement said. During the trial, prosecutors also presented the testimony of a second victim, who testified that on March 21, 2019 – approximately three months prior to the assault on the airplane – Durbesula pinned her into the corner on a New York City subway train and groped her. The victim was able to video record Durbesula's exiting the train, which assisted the New York Police Department to identify Durbesula and charge him. Those charges were still pending when Durbesula sexually assaulted the victim on the airplane that resulted in federal charges. In addition to the prison term imposed, Judge Reidinger ordered Durbesula to serve 10 years of supervised release and to pay a $5,000 assessment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/indian-national-sentenced-in-us-for-abusive-sexual-contact-aboard-airplane/articleshow/83758771.cms||---
---||World||France's Sarkozy faces jail term in campaign financing trial||PARIS: The trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy concluded Tuesday in Paris, after a month during which the court sought to determine whether he broke laws on campaign financing in his unsuccessful 2012 re-election bid. The verdict is to be delivered on September 30. Prosecutors have requested a six-month prison term, as well as a six-month suspended sentence and a fine of 3,750 euros ($4,468). Sarkozy, France's president from 2007 to 2012, denies wrongdoing. He is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros ($27.5 million) on the re-election bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande. The trial comes after Sarkozy, 66, was found guilty on March 1 of corruption and influence-peddling in another case. He has appealed that verdict. In their conclusions last week, prosecutors said Sarkozy knew weeks before the 2012 election that his campaign financing, strictly limited under French law, was getting close to the legal maximum. They accused him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning against racking up additional expenses. Instead, he gave instructions that led to more money being spent and did not put in place a supervision system, prosecutors said. "Sarkozy is the signatory and the only person responsible for his campaign financing. He is responsible for monitoring expenses, which he did not do,'' prosecutor Vanessa Perree said. He showed "his intention to exceed (the limit) by continuing to hold his rallies,'' she added. Prosecutors said on March 10, 2012, eight weeks before the presidential election runoff, the campaign's budget was already above the legal limit. The next day, Sarkozy held a giant rally at Villepinte, north of Paris, which alone cost 6 million euros. Closer to election day, Sarkozy held almost one rally per day, including two major ones in Paris at a cost of several million euros. During his one-day appearance at the Paris court last week, Sarkozy vehemently denied wrongdoing. He said the extra money did not go to his campaign but instead helped make other people richer. He said, voice often raised in anger, that he followed the financial recommendations of his staff, including canceling two planned rallies. "I don't see where I was careless, where I was negligent,'' he said. He said he "never'' gave any direct instructions to service providers in charge of the organization because he had a team to do that. "We made mistakes, probably... But was there malicious intent, fraudulent intent? No, no,'' he said. Sarkozy's lawyer, Gesche Le Fur, argued on Tuesday that her client could not be blamed for the amount of spending because ``he was not aware of the fraud and did not order it. He signed no contract, no invoice, he accepted to restrict expenses. He is respectful of the values of the Republic.'' In addition to the former president, 13 other people are on trial, including members of his conservative Republican party, accountants, and heads of the communication group in charge of organizing the rallies, named Bygmalion. They face charges including forgery, breach of trust, fraud, and complicity in illegal campaign financing. Some have already admitted wrongdoing and detailed the system of false invoices that was meant to cover up the overspending. Prosecutors requested mostly suspended prison sentences, and up to one year in prison for the Bygmalion co-funder. The defendants "disagree on everything. The declarations are not credible, possibly they are lies,'' Perree said. Sarkozy retired from active politics in 2017 but is still playing a role behind the scenes within his party, The Republicans. French media have reported that he may end up supporting centrist President Emmanuel Macron, through an alliance with figures on the traditional right, in next year's presidential election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/frances-sarkozy-faces-jail-term-in-campaign-financing-trial/articleshow/83758831.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Vaccine rush sparks fears of Covid-19 infection spread in Assam||GUWAHATI: The vaccination drive launched Assam is seeing large crowds of beneficiaries at Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs) since morning, but what is causing concern is the flouting of Covid-appropriate behaviour. With a target of inoculating nearly three lakh people every day, the vaccination centres are overflowing with people. Though they are in masks, the social distance norm has gone for a toss. Like the election days, Adivasi student leader Joseph Minz was waiting till noon before he stepped at the vaccination centre at the Doolahat Tea Estate in upper Assam's Lakhimpur district. Joseph's wait only made him a loser on the first day of vaccination Monday, as he had to ultimately take the vaccine last. There was no respite from the crowd till the end of the drive. “At around noon, I had to take the vaccine because there was no sign of any decline in the rush of people," he said. Joseph tried to manage the crowd but due to the limited number of vaccines administered in the centres each day, the locals dashed to the session site again on Tuesday morning. "The tea garden people got the information that only 400 doses will be administered in a day. So they rushed to get the shots before their neighbours. It has become like a race," he added. The total vaccination in two days crossed the stipulated target of six lakh by Tuesday evening. There was an overwhelming response across villages and towns. “People should not hurry. The violation of Covid rules can lead to the spread of the virus. We are going to continue the vaccination drive and there will be absolutely no dearth of vaccines. People must come to the vaccination centres as per the daily allocation in their nearby centres,” said vaccination spokesperson Munindra Nath Ngatey. The highest number of jabs was administered in Kamrup (Metropolitan) district on Tuesday with more than 24,000 beneficiaries getting inoculated. Besides size and population of the districts, the vulnerability in the second wave has been kept in mind by the health department while distributing the vaccines. But locals blamed proper information-providing mechanism as the reason behind the chaos in many centres. Partha Saikia of Rangamati went to the Bholaguri Kamala Miri HS School centre in Golaghat district at 8.30am. But the session site was already full with villagers who started arriving there from 6am. A token system was adopted by the centre management but maintaining a queue was beyond their control. "District administration should come up with a more systematic approach. Only with prior intimation, beneficiaries should be brought to the vaccination centres. Otherwise chaotic situation in the initial days is very likely to pose another heath threat," he said. Golaghat district has reported the third highest number of Covid cases (1,972) in the last 10 days, if new cases during the period are counted for all 33 districts of the state. For the health officials there is big concern for a few upper Assam districts and Golaghat is one among them. Even the district can face a lockdown this week, as the state government is considering stricter restrictions in some districts where the situation is yet to come under control. As per the state immunization office data, there are a total 2.31 crore 18+ population in Assam. Out of them, 48.71 lakh people have been vaccinated with the first jab, while 11.2 lakh got both doses. Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma was hopeful that by August 15, every 18+ citizen in Assam will get the first dose at least.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/vaccine-rush-sparks-fears-of-covid-19-infection-spread-in-assam/articleshow/83759218.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Business||No conclusive evidence that Choksi was abducted: Antigua PM||SAINT JOHN'S [ANTIGUA]: Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne on Tuesday said that he was not aware of any evidence that fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi was abducted and taken to Dominica. PM Browne faced a barrage of questions on Mehul Choksi in parliament by the MPs. Answering a question whether he or the minister of national security was aware or if any other investigative body has found any evidence that Mehul Choksi was taken to Dominica by involuntary means, Browne said, "I'm not aware of evidence, but there's information in the public domain Mehul Choksi was abducted." "And I'm aware that law enforcement here would have done some research, and perhaps may have some individuals of interests, but in so far as evidence is concerned, I am not aware that there is any such conclusive evidence. I am not aware that the sea vessel would have breached the security of the state, my understanding is that the vessel ostensibly that was utilised to abduct MC came here legally," Browne said while answering a query related to the integrity of Antigua and Barbuda borders. He also said that the royal Antigua and Barbuda police force issued the yellow notice to Interpol in the first instance to try and locate Mehul Choksi when he was reported missing. "It's well known that throughout the Caribbean region, we have relatively porous borders because of all of the different keys and the different beaches, and evidently we do not have enough resources including manpower," he said. "It is an area that we continue to struggle with, we have been assisted by the US government and other external agencies to help us to build capacity in that area. But admittedly, it is one of the weak areas in which the countries in the Caribbean, you know, they all have porous borders," he added. Choksi had gone missing from Antigua on May 23 after going out for dinner and was caught in Dominica a few days later. He was charged with illegal entry by the police in Dominica after he allegedly escaped from Antigua and Barbuda in a possible attempt to evade extradition to India. The Indian government is actively engaged with the Dominican government to seek the early deportation of Choksi. Choksi's lawyers have claimed that he was kidnapped and didn't go to Dominica of his own free will. The 62-year-old fugitive is wanted in India in connection with a Rs 13,500-crore fraud in the Punjab National Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-conclusive-evidence-that-choksi-was-abducted-antigua-pm/articleshow/83759519.cms||---

While there was no immediate acknowledgement of the seizures from American authorities, it comes amid the wider heightened tensions between the US and Iran.  The Islamic Republic's president-elect, judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, staked out a hard-line position Monday in his first news conference since his election victory. He said he would would not meet with president Joe Biden and ruled out any further negotiations with the West over Tehran's ballistic missile program and support for regional militias.  Iran's state-run IRNA news agency identified a series of websites taken offline, saying they were seized by the Department of Justice.  The Iranian state-linked websites that abruptly went offline with what appeared to be US seizure notices include state television's English-language arm Press TV, as well as the Yemeni Houthi rebels' Al-Masirah satellite news channel and Iranian state TV's Arabic-language channel, Al-Alam.  The notice said that the websites were seized "as part of law enforcement action" by the Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Marzieh Hashemi, a prominent American-born anchorwoman for Press TV, told The Associated Press that the channel was aware of the seizure but had no further information.  "We are just trying to figure out what this means," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/iran-says-state-linked-sites-seized-by-us-reasons-unclear/articleshow/83759851.cms||---
---||World||Prosecutors: Robber fired 10 shots at wounded Iowa deputy||IOWA CITY: A Chicago man robbed two Iowa gas station employees at gunpoint and confined them in a cooler before he fired 10 shots at a sheriff's deputy who responded to the crime, seriously wounding him, prosecutors said Tuesday. The shots fired by Stanley Donahue injured the left hip and leg of Linn County Deputy William Halverson, who was wearing a protective vest, prosecutors said in a criminal complaint. Donahue then allegedly stole Halverson's service weapon and fled the Casey's General Store in Coggon, a town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of Cedar Rapids. Halverson remained hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. The shooting of Halverson, who has worked for the county for seven years, was the first of an on-duty Linn County deputy since 1973. Authorities captured Donahue, 36, on Monday afternoon near Coggon after a 14-hour manhunt that involved a drone, an airplane, search dogs, and dozens of officers. He was arrested without incident after being spotted by a television news crew, who called the police. Linn County prosecutors allege in the criminal complaint that Donahue robbed two Casey's employees at gunpoint after 10 pm Sunday, stealing cash from the register and a safe, cigarettes, and their personal belongings. He then confined them in a store cooler. Halverson was the first to respond to a store alarm signifying a robbery in progress and was met by Donahue after he entered through the front door. Donahue repeatedly shot at Halverson and wounded him before he took the deputy's gun and fled in a minivan, the complaint states. Another deputy tried to pull him over, but Donahue sped away before crashing into concrete barriers on a bridge that was under construction, the complaint says. He then fled on foot and managed to evade authorities for 14 hours. In the minivan, investigators say they found the handgun Donahue used to shoot Halverson. They also recovered the deputy's service weapon and merchandise stolen during the robbery. Donahue has been charged with 10 counts, including attempting to murder an officer, disarming an officer, first-degree robbery, false imprisonment, trafficking stolen weapons, and possessing a gun as a felon. The most serious carry sentences of up to 50 years in prison. If convicted of attempting to murder an officer, he would be required to serve 100 percent of the prison sentence imposed and not be eligible for parole. During a brief court appearance Tuesday, a judge set Donahue's bond at USD 2.5 million and appointed the public defender's office to represent him. No attorney has made an appearance on his behalf. Authorities say, Donahue, who is in custody at the Linn County jail, was previously convicted of felonies in Illinois and Oklahoma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/prosecutors-robber-fired-10-shots-at-wounded-iowa-deputy/articleshow/83759600.cms||---
---||Business||Covid vaccines: EU ignores India, S Africa’s patent waiver plea at WTO||MUMBAI: The European Union has submitted a draft declaration at the World Trade Organization (WTO), “ignoring” the objectives of intellectual property (IP) waiver jointly sought by India and South Africa on Covid drugs and vaccines. While the waiver proposal is backed by over 100 countries, the EU has resisted it for eight months now. The EU declaration, which reiterates its position of using existing provisions under the WTO’s TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement during the pandemic, is being perceived by public health experts as a diversionary tactic. This could delay the progress of reaching a consensus on the waiver, which is critical to address the stark inequities in access to Covid vaccines globally. If adopted, the waiver is expected to provide countries with critical policy space to address IP barriers to increase collaboration in research and development, manufacturing and scale-up, and hence boost supply of Covid medicines and vaccines. The declaration comes ahead of an informal meeting of a small group of countries at the TRIPS Council on June 24, where it is expected to be discussed. Hopes had risen among WTO members that the negotiations will be fast-tracked, and a possible consensus may emerge soon. In its position made public earlier this month, the EU reaffirmed the content of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, and asked governments to “facilitate the use of compulsory licensing”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/covid-vaccines-eu-ignores-india-s-africas-patent-waiver-plea-at-wto/articleshow/83760149.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||World||Weather service: Suburban Chicago tornado had 140 mph winds||CHICAGO: A tornado that swept through Chicago's western suburbs, damaging more than 100 homes and injuring several people, was packing 140 mph (225 kph) winds when it hit the heavily populated area, the National Weather Service said. A weather service team that surveyed the aftermath of Sunday night's storm found that, based on Monday's preliminary findings, the tornado was an EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita scale when it cut a path through parts of Naperville, Woodridge, Darien and Burr Ridge, and that it launched debris to a height of nearly 20,000 feet (6,096 meters). The weather service planned to continue surveying that area to determine the precise path, width and length of the storm's trail of destruction, said Jake Petr, a meteorologist at the service's Romeoville office. "So overall, we're still solidifying the findings for the whole event of this tornado," he said Tuesday. Woodridge Mayor Gina Cunningham said Tuesday that the tornado dealt significant damage to more than 100 homes and lesser damage to hundreds of others in her village of roughly 33,000 people. She said building inspectors were going street by street to produce damage estimates for a possible request for a state disaster declaration and that a decision on that would be made soon. Cunningham said crews were busy Tuesday clearing storm debris, including fallen trees and branches. "Chain saws are pretty much on every street," she said during a news conference as chain saws roared in the distance. State Sen. John Curran, a Republican from Woodridge, said the community faces a long recovery but that he's heartened by the number of residents helping their neighbors during the cleanup, calling their spirit ``remarkable.`` The weather service said Monday that an EF0 tornado with peak winds of 85 mph (137 kph) hit another area of suburban Chicago on Sunday, causing damage that stretched about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from Plainfield to Romeoville and mostly damaging trees. Petr said the weather service planned to visit northwestern Indiana on Tuesday to determine if damage in the Hobart and South Haven areas was also caused by a tornado. The weather service determined Monday that two EF1 tornadoes packing winds up to 100 mph (161 kph) struck northern Indiana's St. Joseph and Steuben counties Sunday, damaging some barns and trees and destroying other exterior structures. In southeastern Michigan, an EF1 tornado was confirmed in Lenawee County's in Riga Township.

The two-time MP spoke to TOI about his plans and BJP’s silence.You are taking out an Ashirvaad Yatra next month, something similar to what Jaganmohan Reddy did. There are three more years for the next Lok Sabha and more than four years for the Bihar Assembly election. How will you sustain this campaign for 3-4 years?I am not doing this yatra for the election. I am starting this journey on my father’s birth anniversary. We got more than 25 lakh votes in the last assembly election. This was about 6% of all votes even when we put candidates only in 135 seats. If we had contested from all seats, we would have got over 10% votes. I should have gone to people to thank them and seek their blessings. But because of Covid-19 and due to my bad health, I could not do that. Now I need to seek the blessings of people when my own family members, my uncle, have gone against me and backstabbed me when I was ill. But how will you sustain this journey for 3-4 years?What else is my job, except building and strengthening the party? I will take out several tours to be with our people and supporters. We had taken a conscious decision to go all alone in the assembly polls to spread our presence across the state. Earlier our party had presence only in patches. Now we need to build it and take it to every part of Bihar. Your uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras has said he would be happy to participate in the yatra, if you invite him. Will you send him an invitation?How can I ask anything from those who have betrayed the faith and ideals of my father soon after his death? They did not even wait for the first death anniversary when everyone in the family came together to observe that day. My father’s soul will not be in peace to see the manner in which they backstabbed the family. I tried to speak to my uncle several times and even a day after he led a delegation to Lok Sabha Speaker to stake claim for the party leadership in the House. But he did not meet me. If he wanted to become the party leader of Lok Sabha or Central minister, I would have written to the Speaker and PM happily for him. I would have made him party president, if he had mentioned it to me once. They have told the Election Commission that the party president’s post was lying vacant after my father’s death. But they know I was elected as national president in 2019 and my uncle had himself proposed my name. When they have betrayed me now, how can I believe or expect anything from them? Had your father ever alerted you about your uncle and about his ambition?No, my father never shared any such thing with me. He always treated his younger brothers as his sons and always taught me to keep everyone together. My uncle was always unhappy with me since I started playing an active role in the party and he had some issue or the other with me. But I always regarded him as my father. That’s what we learnt in the family. Several times I did not go to Patna feeling he may not like it. When I made my brother (Prince Raj) Bihar party president, my father was very happy. But my uncle was not happy. My father was visionary and had said he wanted to pass the baton of the party to the next generation. He made me national president and my aim was that Prince as state president would learn from Parasji. But your uncle has alleged you replaced him as state LJP president. What was the reason?The need was felt before the Bihar election in 2020. We needed a state president who could travel across the state, touring all districts, blocks and constituencies. We could not spread the party’s base sitting in Patna. With due respect, my uncle had hardly travelled during his 15-year tenure as president. He had not even gone campaigning in assembly constituencies citing some reason or other. He was not happy with the party's decision to go with NDA in 2014. He wanted us to go with the UPA. In 2020, in an online meeting he had stood by the party’s decision to go solo in the assembly election. I don’t know and can’t understand why he changes his heart in hours. There were big leaders in LJP when your father was alive. Some have left the party. How do you see the challenge ahead?A political party is not about MLAs and MPs. It applies to all parties. They come and go. The organization and its structure are important. Out of 75 national executive committee members, only nine have left including the five MPs. That faction held a national executive committee meeting, but they had no legitimacy to call such a meeting. The meeting was unconstitutional. Please see the past attendance of attendees in the national executive committee meeting and compare them with the list we put out after our meeting. The issue of who represents the real LJP has gone to the Election Commission. What is your sense, will you win this battle?We have placed all the details before the EC. They have all the details of the executive committee members and our party constitution. Since I was elected in 2019, I remain party president till 2024. We had informed the 2019 decision to the EC. Our constitution specifies who can call a meeting. The party is governed by its constitution. You raised an objection to the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to recognise Paras as party leader in the House. How confident are you about the Speaker reviewing the decision?I am 100% confident that I will get justice. I have submitted all details to the Speaker. Our party constitution says the central parliamentary board can decide about the leader of the House in parliament or assembly. During our discussion, the Speaker said the chief whip acts as the communicator between his office and the. But the role of chief whip comes to play when the House is in session. The parliamentary provisions also specify that the party can choose its leader and inform the Speaker. The Speaker might not be aware of the LJP’s constitution. But since I was the party president and I am also a sitting MP, he should have spoken to me before taking any decision. If I don’t get justice, I will go to court. I feel it should not take more than one hearing to get a decision in my favour. I am clear about the legal provisions. Amid all these claims and counter-claims your uncle says he had told your mother that he won’t visit your house till your advisor Saurabh Pandey is there. What’s your reaction?If he had any issue like this, he should have told me. In politics we need to take different types of people together and there can be differences of opinion. I have a difference of opinion with many who are close to my uncle. But how can he justify taking a drastic decision against me, whom he treated as a son simply because he is unhappy with one person? How could he try to remove me from the party president’s post for this reason? How could he stop talking to us for months? Would he have done this to his own son, if he was unhappy? Would he have gone to the Speaker with MPs, if his son was in my place? There are talks that a section of BJP leaders are also behind the coup in LJP. What’s your view?When my own have betrayed me, how can I blame others. My uncle has not only betrayed me but also my father and his ideology. On September 18, just two days before my father was put on ventilator, he had told me not to go with Nitish Kumar in my life. The manner in which he humiliated my father for the Rajya Sabha seat is known to all. My father always fought for Dalits and Maha Dalits. The Bihar CM divided Dalit and Mahadalit only to finish Ram Vilas Paswan. He ensured Paswans remain as Dalits in Bihar only to finish my father's political life. When my uncle praises Nitish Kumar and goes with him, he betrays my father’s ideology. There are talks that you may ally with RJD in Bihar. But you maintain you are in NDA in Centre. What’s your position?Now I am with the BJP. In the last assembly polls I had said I have full faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and I am his Hanuman. But if Hanuman is getting killed and Ram is only watching this, then what’s the significance of Hanuman and Ram? If he doesn’t protect me when I need him, then what can I say. We have always stood by the PM and BJP since 2014 when every ally was deserting him. Nitish Kumar had pulled out over the issue of Modi’s leadership. We supported the BJP and the PM whether it was abrogation of Article 370, Ram Mandir, CAA, NRC and Triple Talaq without compromising our ideology. Will Nitish Kumar implement CAA and NRC which the Union minister wants to roll out. When we have stood by them in tough times, now they need to decide whether they are with us or not. If they are not ready to stand by me now, then I am free and independent to take any decision. Has anyone from the opposition front talked to you in recent days?A: Leaders from almost all opposition parties and even some from BJP have talked to me since my father passed away. Leaders from opposition parties have maintained that some of our own leaders have ditched us and they say people in the state are fully with us.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/if-pm-bjp-doesnt-stand-by-me-now-in-crisis-then-i-am-independent-to-take-any-decision-chirag-paswan/articleshow/83760891.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Goa||‘FC Goa on the hunt for striker who can score 15 goals or more in ISL’||Panaji: FC Goa are close to securing the signature of a striker who the club believes will be a combination of Ferran Corominas and Igor Angulo, two of their strikers who have won Golden Boots in the past. Known for their free-flowing game, Goa have been the most consistent team in the Indian Super League, making it to the semifinals a record six times in seven seasons. For the last four years, Goa strikers have won the Golden Boot three times. For two successive years, it was Coro who finished among the top, and while his replacement – Angulo – also scored regularly and won the top award last season, Goa are looking at a new striker. “We are looking at someone with different characteristics,” said Ravi Puskur, the club’s director of football. “It’s undeniable that Coro is the best striker the league has seen and replacing a player of his quality was never easy. He is known for his all-round game and not just the goals. Igor is the best finisher I’ve seen in the league. “Now we will find someone who is best of both worlds, who can stylishly fit into what we are looking from a striker and what we want him to contribute. We want a striker who can score 15 goals minimum. That is what will take us to the top,” said Puskur. Angulo scored 14 goals last season to win the Golden Boot, while Coro scored 18, 16 and 14 during his three years in ISL. It is no secret that Goa’s first-choice striker for next season was Dioni Villalba. According to sources, the Spanish striker had agreed personal terms but later changed his mind due to the raging Covid-19 pandemic in India. Instead, he joined Atletico Baleares, stepping into the boots of Coro, who left the Segunda B club after just a year. “We are not too far away (from confirming the striker). Hopefully, by the end of this month, we will have pen to paper,” said Puskur. The next edition of ISL will be played inside a bio-secure bubble, so convincing players to come to India won’t be easy. Puskur, however, remains confident that they will find a good enough replacement for Angulo, who was not surprisingly angered by his exclusion from the AFC Champions League squad. “It’s well-publicised that we missed out on a player (Dioni) due to the pandemic. Our efforts are ongoing. We do have a couple of profiles in mind, but we will put pen to paper only when we know it’s worth it. “We have been a little stubborn from our end in terms of who we want. We have not lowered our expectations. If we get the name who is on our table at the moment, he will be a very good stylistic fit and contribute with the goals as well,” said Puskur. Goa’s preference for a Spanish striker needs no reminding. But whether the new signing remains as sharp as Coro and Angulo remains to be seen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-on-the-hunt-for-striker-who-can-score-15-goals-or-more-in-isl/articleshow/83761376.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The Airport Metro Connector will connect with an automated people mover train being built to carry people to and from the airport's terminals. A ceremony was held on Monday to mark the start of construction.  "This groundbreaking is a pivotal milestone in our effort to give residents and visitors alike real alternatives to sitting in traffic," said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Bonin, who is also on the board of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  The station will have platforms to access Metro light rail trains, a bus plaza, a drop-off zone for travelers, a bicycle hub and commercial space.  The airport is in the midst of a massive multibillion-dollar makeover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/construction-starts-on-899m-station-at-los-angeles-airport/articleshow/83762319.cms||---
---||India||Gupkar alliance agrees to attend PM’s meet with all parties on J&K||SRINAGAR: The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) on Tuesday accepted the Union home ministry's invitation to an all-party dialogue on J&K with PM Narendra Modi in Delhi on Thursday, saying it would use the opportunity to pitch hard for restoration of “what was ours and what can remain ours”. “There will be no compromise on Articles 370 and 35A,” The decision also ended speculation about whether ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti, whose PDP is part of the alliance, would join the talks or depute someone to represent the party. In a joint presser following a meet at NC chief Farooq Abdullah’s residence, the constituents of the alliance said they would also seek the release of all political detainees and the return of J&K prisoners lodged in different jails. "Our stand is clear, and all of you know what our stand is. Since New Delhi has invited the leaders individually, we have decided that all those invited will attend the meeting and put forth their points on J&K,” Farooq said. He claimed there was no fixed agenda for the meeting. “We can talk on any issue.” PDP chief Mehbooba said “there was a suggestion that only Farooq Abdullah would represent PAGD in the June 24 meeting, but now there is a consensus that all those who have been invited will go.” “We are not against dialogue,” she said. “My late father Mufti Muhammad Sayeed always advocated dialogue for resolution of issues. I believe New Delhi should have released all political prisoners to create an atmosphere for talks, but it didn’t.” Amid initial reports about Mehbooba being reluctant to attend the meeting with the PM, the J&K administration on Sunday freed two senior PDP functionaries — her uncle Sartaj Madni and former minister Naeem Akhtar — from long periods of detention and house arrest respectively. “Now, we will demand the release of all political prisoners as there are many who have taken ill in jails,” Mehbooba said. CPM’s Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said the Gupkar alliance’s focus was on representing the aspirations of the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. “We are not going there to ask for the stars. Whatever is possible within the Indian Constitution is what we are going to seek,” the alliance’s new chief spokesperson said. Awami National Conference vice-president Muzaffar Shah said the delegation wouldn't shy away from broaching the topic of restoration of J&K's special status, which was the alliance's primary goal when it was formed last year. “There will be no compromise on Articles 370 and 35A,” he said.

---||World||Covid-19: Delta variant represents 20% of US infections||The so-called Covid-19 delta variant which was first detected in India now represents more than 20% of coronavirus infections in the US in the last two weeks, or double what it was when the Centers for Disease Control last reported on the variant's prevalence. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned that the US could be following the United Kingdom's course, where the variant has become the dominant strain due to rapid spread among youth. Fauci says indications are that the Covid-19 vaccines remain effective against the variant. The variant is accounting for half of new infections in the regions that include Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. HONOLULU:Uncertainty remains about when Hawaii will drop its requirement for vaccinated arriving travelers to have a negative coronavirus test to avoid quarantine. Hawaii lieutenant governor Josh Green wants the state to drop the testing requirement for fully vaccinated travelers ahead of the July 4 holiday, but governor David Ige is reluctant.Ige would not commit to dropping the travel test during a Monday news conference. The governor said earlier this month that testing requirements for vaccinated domestic travelers would end once 60% of Hawaii residents are fully vaccinated. Green said there could be confusion and conflict if the state does not drop the requirements soon. BERLIN:The German government says chancellor Angela Merkel has received her second dose of vaccine against Covid-19. The government said Tuesday that Merkel was vaccinated a few days ago. The 66-year-old received a first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine on April 16. For the second shot, she received the Moderna vaccine. Germany recommended in April that younger people who have received a first dose of AstraZeneca should switch to a different vaccine for the second shot. JERUSALEM:Israel's prime minister says the country is in the grip of a "new outbreak" of the coronavirus after a spike in cases in the past week, most of them minors with the highly infectious Delta variant of Covid-19. Naftali Bennett says the country is in the grip of a "new outbreak" of the coronavirus after a spike in cases in the past week, most of them minors with the highly infectious Delta variant of Covid-19. (Reuters)Naftali Bennett said Tuesday after touring Israel's main international airport that masks would be mandatory in Ben Gurion Airport and there would be more stringent testing of incoming travelers. "We made an initial decision to treat this like a new outbreak, and our aim is to sever it," he said. Bennett called on Israelis to avoid all non-essential summer travel abroad. Israel's health ministry reported 125 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, the highest daily number since late April. Over 55% of the country's 9.3 million citizens have received two vaccine doses, but Bennett said several of the new cases reported were in vaccinated individuals. MOSCOW:The mayor of Moscow announced new coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday, saying that "the situation with the coronavirus remains very difficult" in the Russian capital. The country's state coronavirus task force reported 6,555 new Covid-19 cases in Moscow on Tuesday and 16,715 new infections across Russia, both tallies twice as high as a month ago. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin banned all entertainment and sports events at which more than 500 people are present. Starting next Monday, all restaurants, cafes and bars in Moscow will only allow in customers who have been vaccinated against Covid-19, recovered from the virus within the past six months or can provide a negative coronavirus test carried out within 72 hours prior to the visit. To prove their eligibility, customers will need to obtain a QR code at one of several government websites. Coronavirus infections surged in the Russian capital two weeks ago, prompting the city authorities to order mandatory vaccinations for workers in retail, education and some other service sectors. Russians have been widely resistant to vaccinations and only less than 13% of the population has received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine. KALAMAZOO:Western Michigan University said it will hold a series of drawings, from August to December, to give away more than $100,000 to students who have been vaccinated against Covid-19. There will be 60 winners. The biggest prizes are five worth $10,000 each. The money can be used for tuition, fees, campus housing and campus dining. "Students need help with the cost of college, and so we felt like those would really be incentives that would speak to students," said Diane Anderson, vice president of student affairs. "Students of course need to show proof of vaccination. ..." LONDON:Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she is aiming to lift most remaining coronavirus restrictions in Scotland on August 9. She also told Scottish lawmakers that changes to current restrictions will be postponed by three weeks to July 19 as a result of a sharp spike in new infections that are largely due to the delta variant. Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon receives her second dose of Oxford/AstraZenica Covid-19 vaccine. (AFP)2,167 cases have been recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours, the highest level since January 8 when the UK as a whole was in the midst of a catastrophic second wave of the pandemic. The UK as a whole recorded 11,625 new cases on Tuesday, the highest daily figure since February 19. Sturgeon said her government will make a final assessment closer to the time to see whether this could include the lifting of social distancing rules both indoors and outdoors. The other nations of the UK - England, Wales and Northern Ireland - are moving out of lockdown at different speeds. ISTANBUL:Turkey's president has announced the country's first local vaccine in development against Covid-19 would be called TURKOVAC. The first dose of the vaccine's third phase trial was administered to a male volunteer Tuesday in a videoconference by the health minister, professors and Turkey's president. The health minister said phase 1 and 2 trials showed the vaccine's safety and immune response. TURKOVAC is using an "inactivated virus" technology and was developed at Erciyes University. Other vaccine developments continue in Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said it is imperative to have a local vaccine that Turkey would use in the country and export to others. Turkey is currently using vaccines from China's Sinovac and Pfizer-BioNTech. Russia's Sputnik V will also be used. Health minister Fahrettin Koca said the vaccine is the "pride of the nation." PORTLAND, Maine:A program to help the US' bus companies survive the coronavirus pandemic that was championed by a Maine senator is now accepting applications. Republic senator Susan Collins co-wrote the Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services grant program and said this week that the program is now open. The program is slated to provide $2 billion in coronavirus relief to bus, motorcoach and other passenger vessel companies. The pandemic has hit the nation's approximately 3,000 private bus lines hard. Nearly all of them were shut down in the early stages of the pandemic and many have struggled to recover since. "Bus and motorcoach companies, ferries, and tour boats sustain good-paying jobs and provide critical transportation services. The Covid-19 pandemic took an enormous toll on these businesses, many of which are small and family owned," Collins said. Collins co-authored the proposal with Democratic senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. The senators said that every bus and vessel company that meets eligibility criteria and submits a completed application will receive a grant. AMSTERDAM:The European Union's medicines regulator has approved two new manufacturing sites for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. The move announced Tuesday by the European Medicines Agency will help increase production of the vaccine that has formed the backbone of many European nations' vaccination programs. The European Union's medicines regulator has approved two new manufacturing sites for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. (AFP)The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control says that 242.6 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have been distributed to European nations and nearly 223 million shots have been administered. The EMA says its human medicines committee approved a site in Reinbek, Germany, that is operated by Allergopharma and another in the Swiss town of Stein that is operated by Novartis Pharma. Last month, the EMA recommended expanding the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to children aged 12-15. MERIDIAN TOWNSHIP, Michigan:Michigan is fully open again. After facing 15 months of capacity restrictions and being hit by the country's worst surge of coronavirus infections this spring, restaurants, entertainment businesses and other venues can operate at 100% occupancy starting Tuesday. Limits on indoor gatherings like weddings and funerals are gone. So is a broad requirement that the unvaccinated be masked indoors. Michigan is among the last states to lift capacity caps, which has frustrated the business community. Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer and public health officials say the restrictions were needed until enough residents could be vaccinated. MANILA, Philippines:The Philippine president has threatened to order the arrest of Filipinos who refuse Covid-19 vaccination and told them to leave the country if they would not cooperate with the efforts to contain the pandemic. President Rodrigo Duterte, who is known for his public outbursts and brash rhetoric, said in televised remarks Monday night that he has become exasperated with people who refuse to get immunized then help spread the coronavirus. "Don't get me wrong. There is a crisis being faced in this country. There is a national emergency. If you don't want to get vaccinated, I'll have you arrested and I'll inject the vaccine in your butt," Duterte said. "If you will not agree to be vaccinated, leave the Philippines. Go to India if you want or somewhere, to America," he said, adding he would order village leaders to compile a list of defiant residents. A human rights lawyer, Edre Olalia, raised concerns over Duterte's threat, saying the president could not order the arrest of anybody who has not clearly committed any crime. WELLINGTON, New Zealand:A coronavirus outbreak in Fiji is rapidly growing, with 180 new cases reported on Tuesday. The current outbreak began in April and has resulted in seven deaths and numerous restrictions, although so far the island nation has resisted a nationwide lockdown. New Zealand foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta said this week it was providing an additional 10 million New Zealand dollars ($7 million) for Covid-19 operations and food supplies in Fiji. New Zealand and Australia have also sent medical teams. Located north of New Zealand, Fiji is home to 940,000 people. Its tourism-dependent economy had already been hard-hit by the pandemic before the latest outbreak. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Fiji has reported more than 2,200 cases and nine deaths. HAVANA:Cuba's government announced on Monday that its three-shot Abdala vaccine has proven to be 92% effective against the coronavirus. It provided no details of the clinical testing. The Abdala is one of the vaccines Cuba is testing. It recently said its Soberana 2 vaccine has shown a 62% efficacy. The announcement came as Cuba faces its worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic with record new infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-19-delta-variant-represents-20-of-u-s-infections/articleshow/83760617.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden to 'bring every resource' to manage busy storm season||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said Tuesday that his administration needs to “bring every resource to bear" to deal with natural disasters as huge swaths of the country have already endured extreme weather with the summer season just starting. The president said he plans to meet next week with western governors to discuss preparation for heat, drought and wildfires. “I insist on being ready for whatever comes our way," Biden told reporters ahead of an emergency preparedness briefing from Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, the White House homeland security adviser. The White House was spotlighting preparedness as the Western US has experienced extreme heat and wildfires and the Atlantic Ocean has already seen three named storms, including Tropical Storm Claudette. The storm killed at least 14 people in Alabama. A tornado swept through communities in heavily populated suburban Chicago late Sunday, damaging more than 100 homes, toppling trees, knocking out power and causing multiple injuries. Biden announced in May that he's doubling US emergency spending to help communities prepare for hurricanes and other extreme weather events, while launching a new effort at NASA to better understand and track the impact of climate change. The USD 1 billion in spending is a small fraction of what the weather-related disasters cost the US Last year alone, the nation endured 22 weather and climate-related disasters with losses greater than USD 1 billion each. The disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms, had a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. This year has already had significant winter storms that caused a deadly blackout in Texas and other states, and officials expect that an ongoing severe drought in the West will fuel another destructive summer of wildfires following one of the worst fire years on record in 2020. Forecasters predict a busy hurricane season along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, but perhaps not as severe as 2020's record-shattering year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-to-bring-every-resource-to-manage-busy-storm-season/articleshow/83763085.cms||---
---||India||Rashtra Manch meet: Opposition parties talk of need for ‘credible alternative’||NEW DELHI: A discussion among leaders from several anti-BJP parties and like-minded activists on Tuesday concluded that there is a need to thrash out a “credible alternative vision” to attract people even as they emphasised that they were not speaking of a new “front” just yet. The meeting at the residence of NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar turned out to be a free-wheeling discussion on challenges facing the country, ranging from economy to geopolitics to Covid to social harmony. Participants included figures like economist Arun Kumar, former diplomat K C Singh and poet and public figure Javed Akhtar among others. But after the leaders from TMC, SP, AAP, RLD and the Left besides NCP emerged from the session, the organisers stressed two issues — that this was not a meeting of any “third front” or “anti-BJP front”, but a gathering of like-minded leaders and parties. Also, that it was not a restrictive gathering that sought to exclude Congress. The denial was emphatic as organisers said that five Congress MPs were invited though they did not turn up for some reason or the other. The invites, it was said, were to individual leaders in various parties. After poll strategist Prashant Kishor met Pawar on Monday, headlines ran on television and social media that a process had been put in motion to create a “third front” against BJP. There was discomfiture over the hype which appeared premature given that many political parties were not yet contacted directly and the meeting saw a somewhat low-key participation in terms of senior party leaders barring Pawar. Sources said Trinamool vice-president Yashwant Sinha, who convened the meeting at Pawar’s residence under the banner of his “non-political” forum Rashtra Manch, said right at the start of the session that more efforts would be made in future to ensure that the forum became bigger and more inclusive. Briefing reporters, Majeed Memon of NCP said, “Rashtra Manch is not an anti-BJP front. Chatter that this is a political front is incorrect. We called all those people who subscribe to our ideas, including at least five leaders from the Congress. There was no attempt to discriminate against any political party, nor to boycott Congress.” However, there was an acknowledgement, as Ghanshyam Tiwari of SP put it, that brainstorming by leaders of political parties and thinkers on issues facing the country would result in an “alternative”. The meeting lasted more than two hours and was attended by Omar Abdullah of National Conference, RLD President Jayant Chaudhary, Sushil Gupta of AAP, Binoy Viswam from CPI and Nilotpal Basu from CPM among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rashtra-manch-meet-opposition-meet-talks-of-need-for-credible-alternative/articleshow/83763416.cms||---
---||India||After record high of 88 lakh, Tuesday vaccination numbers at 53 lakh||A day after India saw a record single-day Covid-19 vaccination of over 88 lakh doses, Tuesday’s figure stood at 52.8 lakh at 10 pm. The Centre said Monday’s increase wasn’t a sudden development but the result of coordinated planning with states and improved supplies of vaccines. The Centre expressed confidence that with increased vaccine production and states being given a better advance schedule of supplies, the numbers will remain high. It said a further increase in private sector participation would help improve vaccination rates. The average daily vaccination in June stood at 34.6 lakh shots a day, the Centre said, adding the ability to administer 88 lakh shots a day and CoWin’s robustness lent confidence vaccination can be ramped up. "What happened on Monday was not sudden. It was a result of coordinated planning in which state governments and the Centre collaborated and worked very hard. Even what happened on Tuesday is part of that planning,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. However, the state-wise vaccinations remained uneven. Maharashtra did well with over 5.5 lakh shots and UP retained its performance of more than 7 lakh vaccinations. Some of the more populous states like Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh, however, were under 1 lakh shots or just a little over. States like Kerala and Assam recorded good numbers. “The jump from 34 lakh to 88 lakh when vaccines are available and when capacity is available is possible,” Bhushan said. Almost 64% of doses were administered in rural areas on Monday, indicating a wider coverage of people who might have limited access to health services. However, women received 46% doses, whereas 53% of the doses were given to men, underlining a gender imbalance which needs to be addressed, officials said. “More than half of the doses administered over the last few weeks were inoculated in rural areas, which makes it clear that rural outreach is possible. We are fully hopeful and confident that it’s completely possible for us to cover rural areas,” Niti Aayog member (health) V K Paul said. The new vaccination norms kicked in from Monday. Private hospitals are still allowed to access 25% of vaccines under an aggregation scheme to be finalised by the respective states and UTs. Under the new guidelines, free vaccination will be available for all those above 18 years of age in all public health facilities. People will have to pay for doses along with Rs 150 service charge at private centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-record-high-of-88-lakh-tuesday-vaccination-numbers-at-53-lakh/articleshow/83763996.cms||---

It said the administration is poised to meet the target for those 27 and older but will fall short of Biden's goal for adults 18 and older.  White House Covid-19 senior adviser Jeffrey Zients is expected to announce the United States already has vaccinated 70% of adults age 30 and older, NBC said, citing a copy of his remarks. Zients and other top White House health officials are expected to hold a news conference at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT).  Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Fifteen of the 50 states and Washington, DC, have delivered at least one shot to 70% of adults 18 and older.  The rate of US vaccinations has increased by less than one percentage point over the past two weeks and would have to more than double over the next two weeks for the United States to hit Biden's target.  Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other top officials have deployed a campaign-style push encouraging more Americans to get shots in order to protect public health as well as reopen the economy and return the country to a path of normalcy.  Ongoing racial imbalances in vaccination rates, the new Delta virus variant and the challenge of convincing young American adults that they should protect themselves with the vaccine remain roadblocks.  In his remarks Tuesday, Zients will acknowledge it will take a few more weeks to get those ages 18-26 on board, NBC said.  "The reality is, many younger Americans have felt like Covid-19 is not something that impacts them and has been less eager to get the shot," he will say, according to NBC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-to-concede-us-likely-to-miss-july-4-covid-19-vaccine-target/articleshow/83764337.cms||---

At least four other officers were missing after Monday's attack near the town of Barsalogho in the volatile country's center-north region, Burkina Faso's security ministry confirmed in a press release Tuesday. Only seven police officers are known to have survived the ambush, authorities from the security ministry said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, though suspicion immediately fell on Islamic extremists who have unleashed unprecedented violence in recent months. Earlier this month, jihadists carried out the deadliest attack on civilians in Burkina Faso since the insurgency here began, killing at least 132 people in Solhan village in the country's Sahel region. "This clearly shows that the militant threat is not abating despite the ongoing major military operations," said Heni Nsaibia, senior researcher at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. Violence linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State has devastated Burkina Faso, killing thousands and displacing more than 1 million people. Fighting has further intensified in recent months, and more than 50 people were killed in one week alone in April, including two Spanish journalists and an Irish conservationist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/gunmen-kill-11-police-officers-in-burkina-faso-4-missing/articleshow/83764031.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden pushes effort to combat rising tide of violent crime||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden plans to lay out new steps to stem a rising national tide of violent crime, with a particular focus on gun violence, as administration officials brace for what they fear could be an especially turbulent summer.  The worry over crime is real: It has created economic hardship, displacement and anxiety. But there are also tricky politics at play. The spike in crime has become a Republican talking point and has been a frequent topic of conversation on conservative media. White House aides believe that Biden, with his long legislative record on crime as a former senator, is not easy to paint as soft on the issue, and the president has been clear that he is opposed to the "defund the police" movement, which has been effectively used against other Democrats to paint them as anti-law enforcement. But Biden also is trying to boost progressives' efforts to reform policing. And while combating crime and reforming the police don't have to be at odds with each other, the two efforts are increasingly billed that way.  In a speech on Wednesday, Biden is to unveil a series of executive orders aimed at reducing violence, and he will renew his calls for Congress to pass gun legislation, aides said. Ahead of the speech, the Justice Department announced new strike forces aimed at tackling gun trafficking in five cities.  The White House also planned to convene a meeting Wednesday of a bipartisan group of mayors, members of the law enforcement community, experts and community activists. White House staff members have also been in touch with legislators and congressional staff.  "Yes, there need to be reforms of police systems across the country. The president is a firm believer in that," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. "But there are also steps he can take as president of the United States to help address and hopefully reduce that crime. A big part of that, in his view, is putting in place gun safety measures ... using the bully pulpit but also using levers at his disposal as president."  In April, Biden announced a half-dozen executive actions on gun control, including cracking down on "ghost guns," homemade firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and that are often purchased without a background check.  There is also new federal funding from the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package directed toward municipal governments, allowing them to keep more police officers on the street. Aides said Biden would also urge a swift confirmation of his choice to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  But Biden is limited in his power to act alone. The House passed two bills requiring background checks on all firearms sales and transfers and allowing an expanded 10-day review for gun purchases. But that legislation faces strong headwinds in the Senate, where some Republican support would be needed for passage.  Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Tuesday that she has seen double-digit increases in murder and violent crime nationwide.  "It is staggering. It is sobering," she said at a violent-crime forum held by the Washington-based Police Executive Research Forum. "And it's something that DOJ is committed to do all we can to reverse what are profoundly troubling trends."  Monaco said the Justice Department would launch strike forces in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., to help reduce violent crime by addressing illegal gun trafficking, building on an initiative begun last month.  If the federal effort sounds familiar, it is. Federal operations have often been launched to help cities facing spiking crime. President Donald Trump announced something similar last year when he and then-Attorney General William Barr launched Operation Legend, named for a boy who was shot to death in Kansas City, Missouri. In that effort, hundreds of investigators were deployed to nine cities with rising crime, prioritizing the arrest of violent criminals.  Trump, though, laid blame for the spike in crime on protesters who demonstrated against police brutality following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He claimed that Democrats were allowing crime to run amok in their cities. But despite pockets of violence in both Democratic- and Republican-run cities, the protests were mostly peaceful. A Harvard Radcliffe Institute study found there were no injuries reported in 97% of the events. Still, Republican leaders continue to echo Trump's claims.  And while crime is rising - homicides and shootings are up from the same period last year in Chicago; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; Portland, Oregon; Baltimore; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Houston - violent crime overall remains lower than it was a decade ago or even five years ago. And most violent crimes plummeted during the first six months of the pandemic, as people stayed indoors and away from others.  Crime started creeping up last summer, a trend criminologists say is hard to define and is likely due to a variety of factors such as historic unemployment, fear over the virus and mass anger over stay-at-home orders. Public mass shootings have also made an alarming return.  "Many of us - if not most of us - are seeing a rise in crime, while at the same time, we're hearing calls for reform," Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said of cities in remarks at the police forum. "And some of those calls are to the extreme of dismantle and defund ... while all of the same time we're sworn to protect the people."  Interest in guns, too, is on the rise. The number of people stopped from buying guns through the U.S. background check system hit an all-time high of more than 300,000 last year amid a surge of firearm sales. And several states have passed laws barring federal gun control laws from taking effect.  Louisville Metro Police Chief Erika Shields said lax gun laws and the presence of illegal guns on the streets are compounding the violence.  "When everyone can have a gun, they tend to," she said. "And it just leads to more illegal guns on the street."  The Justice Department recently announced a sweeping investigation into the Louisville police over the March 2020 death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot to death by police during a raid at her home. A similar investigation was launched into the Minneapolis police force.  The rise in violence comes against the backdrop of a national debate on policing and as a police reform bill is being crafted in Congress. Psaki on Tuesday dismissed suggestions that a presidential event focused on cracking down on crime would undermine that legislative effort.  As a senator, Biden wrote several major anti-crime packages, including a 1994 bill that contained provisions now viewed by some as an overreaction to the crime spikes in the 1980s and 1990s. Critics say those bills helped lead to mass incarceration of Black Americans, and Biden's involvement became a flashpoint in his 2020 campaign.  Biden has expressed second thoughts about some aspects of the legislation, and he has acknowledged its harmful impact on many Black Americans. But he and his allies still hold out the law's provisions to address domestic violence, ban assault weapons and finance community policing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-pushes-effort-to-combat-rising-tide-of-violent-crime/articleshow/83764428.cms||---
---||India||China has realised its troops on LAC need better training: CDS General Bipin Rawat||NEW DELHI: China has realised its soldiers need to be better trained to be deployed in the mountainous terrain along the Line of Actual Control, said Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on Tuesday, amidst reports the People's Liberation Army has stepped-up efforts to recruit Tibetans in militias along the frontier. "Chinese deployments on the border with India have undergone a change, especially after incidents that happened in Galwan and other areas last year. Thereafter, they realised that they need to be better trained and better prepared," said Gen Rawat. "Their soldiers mainly come from the civilian street. They are enlisted for a short duration. They don't have much experience of fighting in these kinds of areas and operating in this kind of terrain," he told a news agency. The comments come amidst intelligence reports that the PLA has raised a new set of militias in the Chumbi valley, opposite Sikkim, under the Yatung County in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. "Reports say one of these militias is known as 'Mimang Cheton' (MC), which means 'for the public' in the Tibetan language, and consists of local Tibetan youths," said an official. "The MC is imparted training by the PLA. It is learnt that at least two batches of MC, with around 100 youths in one batch, have already undergone training. Some of them are currently deployed at various locations in Chumbi Valley in areas like Yutung, Cheema, Rinchengang, PB Thang and Phari," he added. The MC, whose personnel neither have uniforms or ranks as of now, has been raised with the aim of deploying it in the local bordering areas "to exploit their knowledge of the local terrain, language, demography and weather conditions", the official said. Since the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh erupted in April-May last year, the PLA has been conducting special recruitment drives to induct Tibetan youth in militias as well as a Special Tibetan Army Unit (STAU). "There are also inputs that STAU recruits are being taken to Tibetan monks for blessings after completion of their training," said another official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-has-realised-its-troops-on-lac-need-better-training/articleshow/83764710.cms||---

The Iranian remarks, by outgoing President Hassan Rouhani's chief of staff, echoed previous assertions by officials in Rouhani's pragmatist camp that Washington is prepared to make major concessions at the talks, underway since April in Vienna. The talks adjourned on Sunday for consultations in capitals, two days after Iran held a presidential election won by hardliner Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian judiciary chief who is on a US blacklist. Raisi is due to replace Rouhani in August. "An agreement has been reached to remove all insurance, oil and shipping sanctions that were imposed by (former US President Donald) Trump," Rouhani's chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi was quoted as saying by Iranian state media. Like other Western and Iranian negotiators who have said the talks remain a long way from the conclusion, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Wednesday that Tehran and the powers still had to overcome significant hurdles. "We are making progress but there are still some nuts to crack," Maas told a joint news conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Maas said a deal was possible even after the election of Raisi, an implacable critic of the West. Difficult decisionsFrench Junior Foreign Minister Franck Riester told lawmakers that time was running out to reach a deal and he opened the door to the idea that a deal might not be reached quickly. "Difficult decisions will need to be made in the coming days or weeks if these negotiations were not to move forward." U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday there was still “a fair distance to travel”, including on sanctions and on the nuclear commitments that Iran has to make to salvage the tattered deal. Iran agreed in 2015 to curbs its uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear weapons, in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Trump abandoned the agreement three years later, calling it flawed to Iran's advantage, and reimposed harsh sanctions that hammered Iran's economy. Tehran responded by violating some enrichment limits while continuing to insist that it has no nuclear arms ambitions. Iranian and Western officials alike say Raisi’s ascendancy is unlikely to alter the Islamic Republic’s negotiating position, as clerical Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei already has the final say on all major policy. Vaezi said the United States had agreed to take some senior Iranian figures off a blacklist. "About 1,040 Trump-era sanctions will be lifted under the agreement. It was also agreed to lift some sanctions on individuals and members of the supreme leader's inner circle." US President Joe Biden's administration aims to restore the deal, but the sides disagree on which steps need to be taken and when to defuse mutual suspicions and ensure full compliance. But some Iranian officials have suggested Tehran may prefer an agreement before Raisi takes office to give the new president a clean slate and avoid blame if problems subsequently arise||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/iran-says-us-to-lift-oil-sanctions-germany-france-cautious-on-matter/articleshow/83764783.cms||---

---||World||Chinese media faces backlash for backing Foreign Ministry's call to seek Nobel for Wuhan lab||BEIJING: Chinese state media has faced backlash for eagerly amplifying its Foreign Ministry's call for seeking a Nobel Prize for the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) even as it faces mounting scrutiny as the potential origin of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. According to Global Times, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijiang said that scientists working in the institute should be awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine, rather than being blamed for being the first to discover the gene sequence of the novel coronavirus. This came after Shi Zhengli, known as the "Bat Lady" virologist in China, angrily denied her lab was the source of the virus in an interview with the New York Times last week. "I don't know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist," she wrote in a text message. Commenting on Shi's response, Zhao said that Chinese scientists in Wuhan were the earliest to discover the gene sequence of novel coronavirus but it does not mean that Wuhan was the source of coronavirus, nor can it be inferred that the virus was manufactured by Chinese scientists. "If the first publication of a high-quality virus sequence is blamed for the source of the novel coronavirus, then professor Luc Antoine Montagnier, who first who discovered HIV, should be the cause of the global AIDS pandemic, not the winner of the Nobel Prize for medicine," Global Times quoted the foreign ministry spokesperson. Fox News quoted National Review's Jim Geraght as saying: "Snark aside, the fact that the Chinese government insists the Wuhan Institute of Virology deserves celebration is another indicator that it intends to change nothing in the aftermath of the pandemic." HotAir writer Jazz Shaw said he first thought the report was a "bad joke". "The ongoing research into the original source of the virus has made it so obvious that the original explanation was flawed that even the NIH, the WHO, and Dr. Fauci have been forced to admit that the laboratory origin theory is at least worth studying. Add to that the fact that no one has yet found a single bat carrying a virus that's a match for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. China's protestations in this matter are looking increasingly pathetic," he wrote. China has been facing mounting pressure from many countries over calls for a fresh probe into the origins of the deadly virus. Earlier this month, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) called for a "timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened" investigation into the origins of Covid-19, including, as recommended by the experts' report, in China. In the Carbis Bay communique, the G7 leaders said, "Strengthening transparency and accountability, including reiterating our commitment to the full implementation of, and improved compliance with, the International Health Regulations 2005. This includes investigating, reporting and responding to outbreaks of unknown origin. We also call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 Covid-19 Origins study including, as recommended by the experts' report, in China." After the conclusion of the G7 meeting in the UK, US President Joe Biden on Sunday called on China to act more responsibly in terms of international norms on human rights and transparency concerning the origins of Covid-19. Speaking to reporters, Biden said: "I think China has to start to act more responsibly in terms of international norms on human rights and transparency. Transparency matters across the board." The lab leak theory has recently become the subject of renewed public debate after several prominent scientists called for a full investigation into the origins of the virus. The hypothesis that the virus was accidentally leaked from the lab was largely disregarded by scientists in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. China has repeatedly denied that the lab was responsible for the outbreak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/chinese-media-faces-backlash-for-backing-foreign-ministrys-call-to-seek-nobel-for-wuhan-lab/articleshow/83764534.cms||---
---||India||2nd SC judge, also with Bengal ties, recuses from state case||NEW DELHI: Within four days, two Supreme Court Judges have recused themselves from hearing cases relating to West Bengal - the post-poll violence and Narada scam - forcing CJI N V Ramana to assign the cases to other benches. On June 18, Justice Indira Banerjee, who started her career as a Judge in the Calcutta high court in February 2002, recused from hearing petitions which had sought a probe by court-monitored SIT/CBI into the widespread post-poll violence in the state, allegedly against BJP workers. Several women have also petitioned the SC alleging gangrape by TMC workers after the May 2 declaration of results giving TMC landslide victory. On Tuesday, a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and Justice Aniruddha Bose was assigned to hear petitions by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and state law minister Moloy Ghatak, both who have challenged the Calcutta HC's refusal to take their affidavits rebutting CBI's claim that both had held dharnas with TMC workers at CBI office and trial court respectively, to impede production of TMC leaders, arrested in connection with Narada scam, before the trial court and prejudice the trial judge. The arrested accused were produced through virtual hearing and were granted on May 17. Like Justice Banerjee, Justice Bose too had started his career as a Judge from the Calcutta HC in January 2004. Though the petitions were listed at item no.21, the bench announced, before commencing judicial work, that Justice Bose "has some difficulty" in hearing the petitions filed by Banerjee and Ghatak and that these would be assigned to some other bench, preferably today itself. The registry took instructions from CJI Ramana and hours later got the petitions listed before another vacation bench comprising Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari. But, Justices Saran and Maheshwari adjourned the hearing to Friday saying they could not go through the petitions. Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi requested that the ongoing hearing on Narada case before a five-judge bench of the Calcutta HC, which was earlier deferred at the request of SC, should be further deferred till the SC decided the pleas by Banerjee and Ghatak. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the CBI and the accused persons have completed their arguments before the HC and that the SC could hear the matter on Wednesday. However, the bench posted the matters for hearing on Friday and requested the HC not to proceed with the hearing till then. Both Dwivedi and Mehta said SC could complete the hearing on Friday itself. The Calcutta HC had refused to accept Banerjee's affidavit on the ground that it was filed after a delay and that it could not be taken on record after the arguments have reached an advanced stage in the matter relating to CBI's challenge to the bail granted by trial court to the Narada scam accused. I went to CBI office on May 17 as a citizen, not as CM: BanerjeeBanerjee said, "There is no evidence of her holding a dharna or gherao or siege outside the CBI office, and are thus false allegations...she did not visit the CBI office, situated at MSO II Building, Nizam Palace Complex, in her capacity as a chief minister, but as a citizen and as a person acquainted with some of accused persons and family of the accused persons, especially respondent no. 4 (before the Hon’ble High Court) who is the senior-most and longest-serving member of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, and with whom she has been associated since her student years." "The Petitioner at no point made a forcible entry at the office of the CBI, rather she cleared a three-tier system of central paramilitary security, as applicable to all persons entering the CBI office premises which are situated on the 13th to 15th floor of the building in Nizam Palace. The Petitioner on May 17, 2021, at the time when she was present at the CBI office abided by all directions issued by officers of the CBI, and any allegation to the contrary is contrived," she said. The CM said that the CBI has no evidence to show that the trial Judge was aware of her presence in the CBI office on May 17 to get prejudiced and grant bail to the arrested persons. "It is not even the case of the CBI, that the Special Judge was aware of her presence in the CBI office or in any manner intimidated or daunted by such alleged presence of her, which is being made a ground by the CBI for seeking transfer of the case for an ulterior motive and to malign the image of the chief minister," Banerjee said. Banerjee said that the CBI's defective letter petition was accepted by the HC and allowed the agency to improve its case by allowing filing of the transfer petition and additional affidavits, but when it came to accepting her affidavit, the HC refused it saying it was delayed. Training her guns on CBI, the WB chief minister said that the CBI has produced "no material evidence or documentary proof, photographs or videos to substantiate the bald and vague allegations" against her. She said, "The HC failed to consider that the exclusion of her affidavit at this stage, may have a huge substantive adversative and prejudicial effect of adverse inference of unrebutted allegations, against her, as having been accepted on the face of it, in disregard to the principles of natural justice." Banerjee said, "Lastly, the HC has lost sight of the fact that what is good for the goose is good for the gander, and if the CBI was permitted to fill lacunae in its pleadings and improve its case by filing two additional affidavits dated May 24 and June 2 without the leave of the HC, it is surprising that the CBI is today opposing her affidavit (dated June 9), and the HC is perpetuating the illegality by imposing different standards for parties in the same case, in an arbitrary manner, and in utter disregard to the principles of equity and natural justice."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2nd-sc-judge-also-with-bengal-ties-recuses-from-state-case/articleshow/83765069.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Speaking in a webinar on Monday, Mutlaq bin Majed al-Qahtani, who is special envoy to the Qatari foreign minister, said he believed India was engaging the Taliban not because they might take over Afghanistan but that they are an important part of the new power/political setup there. "I understand that there has been a quiet visit by Indian officials... to speak with the Taliban... because Taliban is a key component of, or should be or is going to be a key component of the future of Afghanistan," Al-Qahtani reportedly said during the webinar. The effort should be, he said, to urge all sides to arrive at a peaceful resolution.

Behind closed doors, the India-PakThe engagement from the Indian side, it is learnt, is being driven by national security adviser Ajit Doval. It is still at an informal level and yet to be crystallised into any formal engagement. There have been intermittent contacts at different levels in the past few years. While there is no official sanction to the Taliban yet, since the Indian government has preferred to deal with the government in Kabul, if conditions on the ground change as they might, India, sources say, will deal with the Taliban. Questioned, MEA spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi said, "We are in touch with various stakeholders, as I said, in pursuance of our long term commitments towards development and reconstruction of Afghanistan."

Now that a final departure is in sight, questions about clarity have shifted toHowever, there is growing concern about the crumbling of the state in Afghanistan. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla pointed out that the "targeted assassinations" and "territorial aggression" by the Taliban in recent weeks have added to the uncertainty. "I think the levels of violence and the fact that despite talks going on in Qatar and other places, their relentless pursuit of power through violence has made it an uncertain environment in any sense," Shringla said. "Many of those talks are on but as I said the situation is fluid and uncertain and at this point of time, it's very difficult to say how things would work out," he said. Foreign minister S Jaishankar was in Qatar twice over the past couple of weeks where he not only met the Qatari leadership, including the national security adviser, but also spent time with the US special envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad who was also in Doha at the time. "During these transits, he met his Qatari counterpart as well as senior members of the Qatari leadership. As Qatar is involved in the Afghan peace process, the issue of Afghanistan was also discussed during the external affairs minister's conversations," Bagchi said.

The party's Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat told reporters that Sidhu has tremendous potential and also a following. However, on being asked, he said he was angry with the timing of Sidhu's outburst. He also urged Sidhu to exercise patience. The CM is learnt to have expressed displeasure over Sidhu's comments in his meeting with the Mallikarjun Kharge panel. However, Congress sources said the discussions with Singh were not limited to dissidence but were now focused on the party strategy for polls, election promises still to be fulfilled and reorganisation of the party and the government in the state. What seems to have confounded Congress leaders is Sidhu's acerbic attack on Singh coinciding with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's visit to Punjab and his announcement that AAP will "project a popular Sikh face" as its chief minister candidate. Even leaders close to Rahul are perplexed over Sidhu's timing, with more than one of them wondering if "the party was being set up" by the outbursts of Sidhu and some associates. As Sidhu enjoys close proximity to Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, there is uncertainty over how the issue will pan out. Now that the Kharge panel has held two marathon discussions with Amarinder Singh, it is being said that either the leadership will broach the subject with Sidhu or wait for him to spell out his stand. Singh, as also other state leaders, are against Sidhu being elevated as state president which is his key demand. As Singh wound up his discussions with the Kharge panel, he surprised many in the party by paying a visit to Congress veteran Ambika Soni. The two are not said to be on cordial terms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amarinder-meets-panel-mlas-call-on-rahul-amid-crisis/articleshow/83765429.cms||---

BAU’s vice- chancellor Sohane said: “We can make happen the socio-economic changes in the lives of tribal population and the extremely poor of Banka district through multidimensional approach towards rearing, promoting and providing healthcare to bovine and other livestock.”He said Banka has a sizeable tribal population of around 3,38,290, that comes to 16.6% of the total population in the district. “The steps have been initiated to enhance their skills and provide practical training to the local tribals for rearing better breed livestock through AHACs and TSPP model," Sohane said.The VC said the AHACs and TSPP model have been launched in several remote villages like Khirkitari, Budhava Baithan, Logain where the tribal populace have to travel for 20-30km for every need, including seeking help from veterinary doctors for their livestocks.Three interested youths are selected from each village for training about animal health, breed and nutrition management, including artificial insemination, first-aid, de-worming, vaccination, diarrhoea, fever, anorexia etc as a part of capacity building component, the VC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/baus-plan-to-help-banka-tribals-in-rearing-livestock/articleshow/83754390.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Business||EU ignores India, S Africa’s patent waiver plea at WTO||Mumbai: The European Union has submitted a draft declaration at the World Trade Organization (WTO), “ignoring” the objectives of intellectual property (IP) waiver jointly sought by India and South Africa on Covid drugs and vaccines. While the waiver proposal is backed by over 100 countries, the EU has resisted it for eight months now. The EU declaration, which reiterates its position of using existing provisions under the WTO’s TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement during the pandemic, is being perceived by public health experts as a diversionary tactic. This could delay the progress of reaching a consensus on the waiver, which is critical to address the stark inequities in access to Covid vaccines globally, they added. If adopted, the IP waiver is expected to provide countries with critical policy space to address IP barriers to increase collaboration in research and development, manufacturing and scale-up, and hence boost supply of Covid medicines and vaccines. The declaration comes ahead of an informal meeting of a small group of countries at the TRIPS Council on June 24, where it is expected to be discussed. Hopes had risen among WTO members that the negotiations will be fast-tracked, and a possible consensus may emerge soon. In its position made public earlier this month, the EU reaffirmed the content of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, and asked governments to “facilitate the use of compulsory licensing”. It said, “The agreement already provides this flexibility, which is a legitimate tool during the pandemic that can be used swiftly where needed.” K M Gopakumar, legal adviser of international health and development non-governmental organisation Third World Network, told TOI, “Of the three proposals in the draft text, two are already existing in the TRIPS agreement. There is no need for any legal clarifications with regard to the right of a WTO member state to declare a national health emergency. Similarly, there is enough policy space in the TRIPS agreement to determine compensation in case of government use or compulsory licence. Adoption of a waiver will take care of even the third proposal, that is, the waiver of notification requirements (under Article 31bis). This is a desperate attempt to divert attention and delay the text-based negotiations. Further, the proposal is silent on other IP barriers like trade secrets on the scaling up of production of vaccines, diagnostics and biotherapeutics required for the Covid response.” Further, the EU declaration says, “In the circumstances of a pandemic, the exporting member may provide in one single notification a list of all countries to which vaccines and medicines are to be supplied by the exporting member directly or through indirect means, including international joint initiatives that aim to ensure equitable access to the vaccines or medicines covered by the compulsory licence.” Finally, compulsory licenses come with unnecessary delays and complications when it comes to exporting medical tools, such as strict requirements for the packaging and colour of the products, experts added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/eu-ignores-india-s-africas-patent-waiver-plea-at-wto/articleshow/83759926.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Business||Rural growth to be resilient: HUL||Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) CMD Sanjiv Mehta expects market growth to be resilient in rural areas even as Covid spreads to there. While addressing shareholders at the company’s 88th annual general meeting held virtually on Tuesday, Mehta said it will take a few more weeks to assess the impact in rural areas. However, with factors such as the IMD predicting a normal monsoon and an increase in minimum support price (MSP) on certain key crops, Mehta said the company is confident rural would remain resilient. In his address to shareholders, Mehta said the effects of the pandemic are just a pause in India’s consumption and growth story. Mehta said, with a growing middle class, one of the youngest populations in the world and rising internet penetration, India is poised for unprecedented growth. On the highly inflationary scenario where raw material prices have risen in an unprecedented way, Mehta said the company takes price increases in a calibrated and judicious way to ensure that the entire cost is not passed on to the consumer. Talking upon the company’s future readiness, Mehta said HUL is building an ‘intelligent enterprise’ and the HUL of the future will be a web of intelligent ecosystems — the consumer ecosystem, customer ecosystem, operations ecosystem with data, technology, and analytics at the core. “In the last 10 years, we have significantly improved our profitability, strengthened our portfolio, embraced emerging trends, organised ourselves to be nimbler, built distinctive capabilities, pursued our social and environmental agenda with passion and vigour and, in doing so, built a strong foundation for the future,” said Mehta. He said the ‘Reimagine HUL’ agenda redefined the company’s engagement with consumers, customers and the way it operates. “Today, over 500,000 stores in India use ‘Shikhar’ — HUL’s eB2B app, which helped the company receive orders even when the salesmen could not reach the outlets during lockdowns,” he said. As regards a future-ready workplace, Mehta said, “The new levels of uncertainty and volatility that we see around us require a fundamental shift in the way we work and the way we help our talent develop to face the challenges of the future.” In the new decade, Mehta said HUL will rely on three drivers to propel its ‘4G’ agenda of consistent, competitive, profitable, and responsible growth: First, the Unilever Compass, which is its sustainable business strategy. Second, building an ‘Intelligent Enterprise’ that will further embed data, technology and analytics in all aspects, and the third is building ‘Leaders of the Future’.“Our core business will become smarter and efficient by becoming data-led and machine-augmented while we create customised platforms and ecosystems for differentiated consumer and customer value. This will build a value chain that delivers for scale and efficiency of the large while building nimbleness of smalls,” Mehta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rural-growth-to-be-resilient-hul/articleshow/83759831.cms||---

The booking office is in the Danapur main station building. Danapur senior divisional commercial manager (DCM) Aadhar Raj said there was not much damage to the booking office as the fire was tamed timely by the fire brigade team. “The computerized passenger reservation system (PRS) counters located on the second floor in the same building were, however, safe. The burnt ticket booking counters, which used to issue unreserved tickets for short distance journey, are still under repair and efforts are on to make them functional soon,” Raj said, adding prima facie short-circuit was said to be the cause behind the fire breakout. Meanwhile, railways installed ‘Hot RO Alkaline Water’ booths at 25 major railway stations in the division to benefit frontline employees in the Covid-19 pandemic period. “This facility was also provided to passengers at major stations, including Patna Junction and Rajendra Nagar Terminal,” Raj said. Besides, railways is also in consultation with reputed companies to provide ‘sauna steam machine’ to enable passengers and frontline railway employees to benefit on station premises. “Initially, railways will install 10 nozzle-fitted steam tap booths at major stations of the division. The purpose is to ensure that frontline employees and valued passengers can inhale steam either before boarding the trains or alighting at the stations. Railways is likely to provide this rare facility in about 1000 sqft glass covered area at all major stations in the division,” the DCM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fire-damages-danapur-railway-ticket-booking-office/articleshow/83756463.cms||---

Opposition leader V D Satheesan met Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on Tuesday and had discussions in this regard. Gandhi invited KPCC president K Sudhkaran, former chief minister Oommen Chandy and former KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran to New Delhi for talks. In the coming days Ramesh Chennithala and other senior leaders will also be called to the national capital for discussions. After the discussion with Gandhi, Satheesan said he has urged the party leadership not to delay the revamping of the organization. He said he was not there to end the groups in the party but has the opinion that the groups should not swallow the party as a whole. He said he was of the opinion that deserving leaders should not be sidelined while deciding party positions. Meanwhile, Sudhakaran has convened the first political affairs committee meeting of the KPCC on Wednesday since he took over the president post. Even though the meeting is convened to discuss the present political situation, it is learnt that the preliminary discussion on revamping the party will also be held here. Sudhakaran has already come out against the jumbo committees at the KPCC and also in the district Congress committees. He has made it clear that all such committees will be revamped and a small committee will be constituted to replace the existing ones. Sudhakaran will be seeking the support of leaders for this at the meeting. All leaders are likely to extend support to him as the party high command has already given enough hints that it will not entertain the demands of group managers anymore. After the political affairs committee meeting, in the coming days, the leaders will be leaving for New Delhi to give final shape to the new committees. The AICC has decided to talk to both senior leaders, Chandy and Chennithala, before giving Sudhakaran a free hand to reorganize the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/talks-for-rejig-in-congress-begins/articleshow/83760760.cms||---

The police identified the accused as Kamlesh Shinde. He had been allegedly stalking and making advances on car washer, Aditya Jain’s wife, for the past several years. Jain had resisted the accused after which an angry Shinde hired gunmen to bump him off. “Our team is returning to Jaipur with Shinde. We had sought help from local police in Maharashtra in apprehending the accused,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (West), Pradeep Mohan Sharma. The incident had taken place on June 16 when Jain was washing cars outside an apartment near the GandhiPath area under the limits of Karni Vihar police station. The two bike-borne assailants fired at least three rounds of shots at Jain; he sustained bullet wounds on his hand before he was ferried to the SMS hospital. The police had spoken to Jain after he recovered from the trauma in the hospital. Jain confided to cops that he was threatened multiple times by one Kamlesh Shinde. “The injured (Adity Jain) ran a shop in Dombivali east about four years ago, Shinde too worked at a construction company nearby. The accused began visiting the shop where he made advances at Jain’s wife. The couple scolded him but he did not mend his ways and grew even more brazen,” an official told TOI. Jain claimed he lived in a mortal fear of the accused who, on more than one occasion,had threatened to eliminate the entire family. In October last year, Jain moved to Jaipur with his wife and two kids. “He (Jain) set-up a small business that included washing cars in the morning and delivering tiffin boxes in the evening,” said an official. Jain and his wife had also changed their sim numbers but the accused kept chasing them. After some time, the couple believed their harrowing nightmare was finally over. But little did they know that Shinde had already located them. In December last year,the accused came knocking at Jain’s rented apartment in Jaipur. Jain feared for his life and began taking multiple precautions. Meanwhile, Shinde organised a gangland style hit on Jain. On June 16, the two accused fired at Jain when he was busy washing cars. A profusely bleeding Jain darted across the street and into a shop where he narrowly escaped the assailants after hastly rolling down the shutters. He was taken to the SMS hospital where doctors told police that Jain had sustained injuries on his hand but his condition was out of danger. The Karni Vihar police filed a case andspoke to Jain who revealed that he suspected Kamlesh Shinde behind the attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-who-stalked-car-washers-wife-and-hired-gunmen-to-kill-him-held/articleshow/83763124.cms||---

In the 100 plus auto component companies listed on the Smergers platform from India, for example, average deal sizes have come down to Rs 20-Rs 25 crore compared to upwards of Rs 30 crore earlier. “We have seen a sharp increase in traffic and in the past couple of months the number of businesses signing up to sell out or bring in an investor has gone up from 10 a day to 20 a day. We also have a huge backlog of pending deals. Meanwhile the buyer traffic has also gone up sharply since April and we are approving 60-70 a day,” said Vishal Devanath, founder, Smergers. Part of the reason for the sharp rise are the attractive valuations. “Overall across industries valuations have fallen by around 25% which is attracting a lot of senior executives in top management positions looking to invest in these businesses,” he added. Out of 5,300 buyers on the Smergers website, 4,400 are individuals and 900 are companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/professionals-pick-bargain-investments-in-covid-hit-msmes/articleshow/83759034.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

EFCC minister Neeraj Kumar Singh and health minister Mangal Pandey, who launched the new eco-friendly scheme at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here, planted saplings of neem on the campus. Neeraj said all medical colleges have been asked to identify the area available for plantation within a week to get saplings from the forest department. “The government intends to create a neem corridor in the state,” he said, adding private hospitals and nursing homes with sufficient space may also join the scheme. Though other fruit plants would also be grown on the hospital campuses, neem, scientifically known azadirachta indica and having medicinal and insecticidal properties, would count 50% of the total plantation there, the minister said. The health minister said his department was actively cooperating with district and subdivisional hospitals to make the initiative a success. He said neem was useful for both the health of human beings and the environment. Pandey later inspected the work on construction of a new building at IGIMS with 500-bed capacity and directed the engineers there to expedite the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-govt-hospitals-and-medical-colleges-asked-to-plant-neem-saplings/articleshow/83754335.cms||VK Tripathi

Kunj Bihari Singh, a famed pink enamellist, crafted a 12-inch-tall statue, made of pure silver with fascinating colours, in a yoga pose, drawing the attention of connoisseurs and officials alike. “Since the International Day of Yoga is promoted by our MP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi vigorously, I have tried to express my gratitude to him by making this craft on yoga theme,” said the national awardee Kunj Bihari, a resident of Lalghat area in the district. “It is a beautiful piece of local craft giving a purposeful message,” said noted GI expert Dr. Rajni Kant of Human Welfare Association who is instrumental in promoting local crafts and getting GI tag to Gulabi Meenakari of Banaras and many other art forms. According to him, UP’s Varanasi stands next to Rajasthan’s Jaipur in the art of enamelling, and the nature of Banarasi pink is similar to Jaipur red. The pink enamelling is considered as the most alluring and technical art of all metal decorations. “Varanasi’s Gulabi meenakari is an ancient form of art in India that has been praised for the superb designs and combination of colours. It is characterized by pink strokes on white enamel. It is said to have been introduced in Varanasi by Persian enamellists who had come to India in the early 17th century at the peak of Mughal court. National Museum of India, New Delhi and Bharat Kala Bhawan of Banaras Hindu University have collections of this art,” he further informed TOI. Pink enamelling of Varanasi joined the coveted GI club in 2015. Kunj Bihari also has the credit of propelling Banarasi GI-tagged craft out of geographical boundaries. He showcased his art and talent at the Saudi Arabia’s prestigious National Heritage and Culture Festival ‘Janadriyah held at Riyadh in February, 2018. He had also displayed his crafts at the 55th General Assembly of the International Bureau of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva, Switzerland held from October, 2015. One of his masterpieces, an idol of Lord Ganesha, was also included in a gift pack for then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his visit to Varanasi on December 12, 2015. He had received the National Handicraft Award (2015) from then President Pranab Mukherjee in December, 2016. He was also awarded Ram Manohar Lohia Vishisth Pradeshik Puraskar of UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/gulabi-meenakari-silver-idol-in-yoga-pose-draws-attention/articleshow/83757750.cms||---

Speaking at the 76th meeting of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) through videoconferencing, Nitish reminded the bankers that some states had over 100% CD ratio and the money deposited in the banks by the people of Bihar were going to the developed states. He said some Bihar districts had their respective CD ratios less than even the state average. For example, Patna has a lot of economic activities, but its CD ratio is 39.22%. Overall, Nitish asked the bankers to augment loaning activities under the annual credit plan (ACP) in agriculture and agriculture allied activities (like fishery, dairy, poultry) in view of the new policies announced by the Centre, as well as in the micro small medium enterprises (MSME) and the self-help groups (SHGs) under the Jeevika programme, which had a lot of scope for investment. The CM also took note of the bankers’ concerns with regard to the security and asked the state chief secretary and DGP to hold meeting with them to decide an action plan in this regard. He mentioned that of the Rs1.19 crore looted from the HDFC branch at Hajipur in Vaishali, Rs 1.02 crore had been recovered and some of the culprits had also been arrested. Nitish said since his government came to power in 2005, notable transformation had occurred in the state’s infrastructure development. However, investments in the industries sector were less than expectations. He said trading activities in the state had expanded significantly and there was huge scope for investment in the MSME sector with new areas opening up like ethanol production. Given the backdrop, Nitish asked the bankers to fulfil the target of Rs1.61 crore fixed for loaning activities under the ACP during 2021-22 and also asked them to meet the target of Rs51,500 crore fixed for the agriculture sector, and another Rs 15,000 crore fixed for the agriculture allied activities like fishery, dairy, poultry, etc. Similarly, the target for the MSME sector pertaining to 2021-22 was Rs35,000 crore. However, in view of the 87.86% achievements made against the target of Rs1.54 lakh crore under ACP during 2020-21, Nitish asked the bankers to take required steps to accelerate the loaning activities during the current fiscal. Of the total investments of Rs1.27 lakh crore made by way of loan under the ACP in the last fiscal, Rs47,778 crore was loaned in the agriculture sector and merely Rs917 crore for agriculture allied activities. The CM said the bankers should open at least one branch in every panchayat with an average population of 11,000. He reiterated that they would be provided space on premises of the Panchayat Sarkar Bhavans. At present, the banks have one branch for every 16,000 persons. Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, State Bank of India CGM Surendra Kumar Rana, RBI GM Brij Raj, CGM of NABARD Sunil Kumar and others also spoke in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-to-bankers-increase-states-cd-ratio-to-national-avg-of-76-6/articleshow/83754638.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Allahabad||Now, Near Home Vaccination campaign to cover rural crowd in six blocks of dist||Prayagraj: In an attempt to cover maximum number of recipients in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna pockets, officials of the health department have taken up “Near Home Vaccination” campaign in six blocks of the district from June 21 to 26. The campaign is a part of a cluster project, and a total of 92 vaccination teams were roped in to administer the Covid vaccine dose to over 9,000 recipients of all age groups per day. The six blocks where the Near Home Vaccination campaign is being carried out include Kaurihar, Holagarh and Soraon in trans-Ganga, and Chaka, Kutwa and Jasra in trans-Yamuna. As many as 90 villages will be covered under this campaign which will be conducted at primary schools and gram sabha/panchayat bhawans. These special measures are being taken to ramp up vaccination drive in rural areas after witnessing a low turnout of recipients at rural vaccination centres (CHCs and PHCs). Additional chief medical officer and nodal officer (National Health Mission), Dr Satyendra Rai told TOI, “The six-day special drive, Near Home Vaccination, was launched to cover rural beneficiaries and medical teams are administering vaccine shots to the recipients at primary schools, gram sabha bhawans and aganwadi centres.” He further added, “We have set a target to cover 9,000 beneficiaries per day. Mobilization teams are visiting every house in the selected 92 villages, apprising them about the vaccination sites and other details, and convincing them to get vaccinated.” Moreover, senior health officials are monitoring the Near Home Vaccination campaign. Chief medical officer (Prayagraj) Dr Prabhakar Rai has inspected Kaurihar and Holagarh community health centres asking health officials concerned to speed up vaccination and engage more and more mobilization teams to cover maximum rural recipients. The health department will launch the ‘cluster plan’ in all 23 blocks of the district from July 1, and 10-12 medical teams will cover a cluster of villages in rural areas and slums in urban areas, administering vaccines to the recipients. To make the cluster plan a mega success, the health department has already roped in mobilization teams, including ANM/ASHA workers, pradhans, anganwadi workers and teachers who will promote the vaccination drive in the villages concerned. The ACMO said all 23 blocks and slums had been divided into clusters, and cluster vaccination groups would be asked to cover the assigned cluster within stipulated time. The department aims to cover all clusters in July itself. Till June 21, as many as 7,49,592 shots were administered to recipients of all age groups in the district. While 6,21,296 beneficiaries have taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,28,296 recipients have also received the second dose. In the last 24 hours, a total of 12,569 vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, which included 12,229 recipients of the first dose and 340 of the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-near-home-vaccination-campaign-to-cover-rural-crowd-in-six-blocks-of-dist/articleshow/83757985.cms||---

The last time IHCL raised equity was in 2017 in the form of a rights issuance. While IHCL didn’t specify the type of equity raise it would opt for, chairman N Chandrasekaran said capital infusion in some form in the company is important. It will not only help to navigate the immediate months but also prepare for the future, he told IHCL shareholders at its 120th annual general meeting held on Tuesday. If IHCL finalises the plan, it will join a list of hospitality and aviation companies that have raised or are raising money via equity to ride out the coronavirus crisis. Two months ago, IHCL had decided to draw down a Rs 275-crore loan, increasing its Rs 3,633-crore gross debt. In 2017, when IHCL closed a Rs 1,500-crore rights offering, the move also resulted in promoter Tata Group tightening its grip over the Taj chain. Currently, the Tata Group holds 41% in IHCL, which plunged into a Rs 720-crore loss in fiscal 2021 on account of the public health crisis that devastated travel and restricted hotel operations. In fiscal 2020, IHCL posted a profit of Rs 354 crore, its highest in a decade. The company has lost 33 employees to Covid, Chandrasekaran said. “The virus is one step ahead of all of us. We (IHCL) need to be prepared & guarded and stay in a state of agility.” He also said the company created new revenue opportunities from the adversities brought on by the pandemic. IHCL launched Qmin food delivery service, Ama Resorts (though launched in 2019, it was scaled up during the lockdown) and 7Rivers Brewpub during the pandemic. These generated a revenue of about Rs 250 crore in fiscal 2021. On resumption of economic activities, Chandrasekaran said he is confident that it would happen with accelerated vaccination. “While international travel will continue to remain uncertain for the rest of the year, domestic tourism will gain momentum,” Chandrasekaran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-hit-ihcl-may-raise-equity/articleshow/83759901.cms||Reeba Zachariah

And now, in my strategic advisory life, I have many clients who reach out for help for almost the same reason — to help simplify their organisation. Indeed, the need for agility, speed, talent development and morale has possible solutions in the transformative power of simplification of organisations. Excessive incrementalism, the tendency to fight shy of recognising the elephant in the room, egoistic defence of past practices, the aggrandising tendencies of leaders and absence of management resolve have all contributed to making organisations complex, both structurally and culturally. In the new world, there is a huge business case for review and demolition of this complexity. Excessive complexity to me has become a huge enterprise risk in many firms, endangering the ability to respond effectively to the ever-changing contextual risks and opportunities. Here are some fundamental ways to look at simplifying any organisation. All these need brutal first principle questions and honest answers. And, finally, resolved actioning: * Organisation’s design & processes: Over time, a bloat in the organisation’s design becomes inevitable. Horizontal and vertical expansion is the creeping complexity curse for many. While there may be the business compulsion of expansion, creating multiplicative units or levels is often not needed. Hardwired organisational structures must stay lean and allow for quick decisions closest to the point of intervention. Most structures tend to build walls rather than remove them. Checks and balances are needed, but not turf wars. The concomitant chaos is surely complex. Simplifying your organisation’s design, collapsing administrative overhang, broad-banding jobs, drastically pushing down decision rights and eliminating the many meaningless interplays of unnecessary units is a good place to start. * Ossified culture: Many organisations feel proud of the culture they have. It may feel warm and cuddly, even very protective, but often it is at the expense of speed and agility. Firms need to dramatically overhaul their cultural archetypes, howsoever disruptive and difficult it may seem. The way people think, behave and do in organisations drives a lot of what they become. Passing the buck, low collaboration, poor accountability, loyalty rather than merit norms — all make cultures complex. Culture is not just about vanilla moral behaviour. It is hardcore strategy. Shake it up. It will mean new education, a different reward-reprimand linkage, maybe a different mix of leaders and leadership thinking. But if you don’t make simplicity a core part of your cultural fabric, it is quite unlikely you will move away from the complexity and indolence of your current reality. * Check your entire policy regime: Some policies and regulations are needed to run an organisation. But a little more, and we make them a noose. There are just too many policies in most companies. In my CXO life, I just crashed the number of policies that existed for years. Most made no sense in the new world except that no one had ever questioned them. Run a ‘Stupid Rules Contest’ and you will be surprised at how many howlers exist in your firm. Excessive policies add to complexity. They create a culture of low accountability. They often encourage alibis. They create unnecessary time-wasters. Try instead to minimise them. You will have better engagement, more agility and smarter accountability growing in your eco-system. Policy complexity and organisational design complexity often feed off each other. Kill one to improve the other. * Shake up your leadership: Often, the leadership is the source of complexity in many organisations. To think simple and keep it simple is not a virtue of many leaders. Many leaders have grown through years of survival and self-preservation. Many are guilty of having made their organisations labyrinthine and slow. To expect them to dramatically unwind is a tall order. Make smart leadership shifts. Get more pro-changers to leadership roles, either from within or without. Restate your leadership essentials. Review your promotion norms. This is a tough bullet to bite, but you just cannot wish the scourge away. The more you persevere with a set of crew, the more they will row the same way. Many clients I speak to admit this, in hindsight, was the biggest reason they failed to simplify their companies in time. * Enable ‘simplifying’ norms: You can smell a complex company the first time you interact with it. The way you are made to clear protocol to meet someone in the office. Or the way you go through meaningless documentation as a candidate or a vendor. The number of people who troop into a meeting. The meandering conversations in leadership reviews. The number of people who get copied on unnecessary emails. The endless power points that get flashed. The things that bosses want to be cleared with them. The metaphors of complexity cannot be missed. Just destroy them. No one will miss them. Just simplify every norm in everything that you do. Build more self-ownership. It is not that difficult. But your metaphors just need to change if you want to simplify your setup. People respond to stimuli. Build the appropriate stimuli. Building complexity and clutter is easy. Building minimalism is tough. Success does not need complexity. Success is essentially simple. So should be everything that secures it. The job of leadership is just that — minimise complexity, maximise impact. Just simplify. It helps build healthier workplaces and smarter corporations.

Police said that Satpal and his son attacked the former’s elder brother Mahendra (48) and his wife, and the couple’s two children with a spade-like weapon.Mahendra succumbed to his injuries on the way to GIMS hospital, while his wife Seema remains in a critical condition. Their daughter Neha and son Tanishq too have suffered injuries, but are said to be out of danger.Police said the dispute revolves around Satpal’s son Shekhar’s estranged relationship with his wife. “Shekhar’s wife wanted a divorce. On Monday, a panchayat was held between both the families and Shekhar’s parents-in-law demanded that he give them Rs 60,000 in exchange for the belongings given in dowry,” Surajpur SHO Ajay Kumar told TOI.“Mahendra had sided with the family of Shekhar’s estranged wife, which did not go down well with the accused father-son duo,” the SHO added.The father-son duo has been booked under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder).

But, don’t forget to submit a certificate from the architect or licensed building surveyor or the structural engineer as the case may be to the commissioner’s office with drawings, incorporating the deviations, stating the nature and purpose of such deviations. But, such changes from the original sanctioned plan should be restricted within the ‘sanctioned’ covered space. According to a KMC building department official, the relaxations in building rules are being offered to the citizens after half a decade. In 2014, prodded by a court ruling, the KMC was forced to withdraw the system of regularizing minor deviations from original plans. According to a KMC buildings department official, the civic body has decided to relax some parameters of the building rules to give citizens relief. “If an applicant wants to make some internal changes according to his/her convenience which were not part of the original building plan, we will allow the applicant to do so if these don’t infringe upon the provisions of the building rules. All we need is a communication from the applicant and a certificate from the engineer who had drawn the original plan and now wants to make changes,” a KMC official said. According to him, the applicant can be allowed to do internal changes that include alteration in size of rooms or carving out additional space for kitchen, prayer room within the sanctioned covered space. If during execution of construction work, any external deviation beyond the sanctioned covered space becomes necessary, the KMC may allow it (if it doesn’t violate the basic tenets of building rules) provided the applicant submits a revised plan incorporating the deviations intended to be made. According to an official, the scope for external deviation will make room for even change of alignment of the construction space and may benefit an applicant. “A citizen or a promoter who takes up construction of flats after demolishing an old building often fails to foresee space to be used for determining covered space of the project before the demolition. Hence after demolition of the old building, if any external deviations are allowed it will benefit the applicant,” the official said. The KMC has come up with such relaxations for citizens who either construct their own houses or buy flats and need to make some changes either internally or externally to cope with changing needs. According to an official, the department was getting flooded with requests from citizens across the city to allow minor deviations from the original sanctioned plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-cuts-red-tape-allows-minor-changes-to-bldg-sanction-plans/articleshow/83758635.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat, Maharashtra shared 43% ROCM-black fungus burden: Study||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat and Maharashtra – the two states reporting the highest cases of mucormycosis (MM) after the second wave of Covid-19 – also reported the highest cases of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM), claimed a national study encompassing 2,826 patients from 22 states and Union territories. The findings suggested 22% of India’s total ROCM recorded from Gujarat, followed closely by Maharashtra with 21%. The study, ‘Epidemiology, clinical profile, management, and outcome of Covid‑19‑associated rhino‑orbital‑cerebral mucormycosis in 2,826 patients in India – Collaborative OPAI‑IJO Study on Mucormycosis in Covid‑19 (COSMIC)’ was recently published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology. The study focused on the fungal infection spread in sinuses, space behind the eyes and below the brain. The study added that ROCM was primarily manifested by facial or eye pain (23%), swelling (edema) on face or near eyes (21%), and loss of vision (19%). The study includes doctors from Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot. Dr Anuja Desai, an ophthalmologist with KD Hospital and one of the authors of the study, said that the patient profile indicated older patients (average age of 52 years), more males (71%) than females, and 78% having diabetes as an existing comorbidity. “Out of diabetics, 41% reported uncontrolled diabetes. Moreover, 25% also reported having high blood pressure (hypertension),” she said. Other major findings pointed at 57% of the total patients requiring oxygen support, and 87% of the patients treated with corticosteroids. Most of the cases (56%) showed onset of ROCM between day 10 and 15 from the start of Covid-19 infection. Mortality was found to be 14% among these patients, mentioned in the paper. Dr Bela Prajapati, head of the ENT department at Civil Hospital and member of the state committee on mucormycosis, said that Covid-19 infection remains the major factor for phenomenal increase in MM cases, and ROCM form a bulk of total cases, followed by infection in oral cavity. “At our hospital, there were two male patients for every one female patient treated. Majority of the patients were 40 years or above,” she said. The route studied by the experts is the most common one for the spread of infection, said Dr Neeraj Suri, ENT surgeon with Gandhinagar GMERS Hospital. “The mucus having moisture gave the opportunistic fungus to grow, which then would spread upwards towards the eyes and later to the brain. Majority of the patients that we treated at our facility had diabetes as the prominent comorbidity,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/study-guj-maha-shared-43-rocm-black-fungus-burden/articleshow/83759564.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Patna||Chirag accuses Nitish of causing split in LJP, writes letter to party workers||PATNA: Jamui MP Chirag Paswan on Tuesday wrote an emotional letter to LJP workers, elaborating how his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras stabbed him in the back at the behest of JD(U) when he needed his cooperation and guidance the most. The son of LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan stated in his letter uploaded to his Twitter handle that had Paras asked, he would have certainly proposed his name for a berth in Union cabinet. Hajipur MP Paras was recognised as the LJP parliamentary party leader by Lok Sabha Speaker last week when four of the six other LJP MPs pledged their support to him. Both Chirag and Paras factions claim to be the original LJP and they being its national president. Chirag also accused JD(U) and CM Nitish Kumar of causing a split in the LJP recently as the latter had also tried earlier to settle his score with his father and engineered a split in LJP in 2005. They poached the LJP MLA and MLC after the 2020 assembly elections and now made the five party MPs to part ways. “He (Nitish) has been trying to sabotage the LJP since my father’s days. This is why he created a division between Dalits and Mahadalits in the state,” Chirag alleged. Nitish, who reached Delhi on Tuesday, told mediapersons that some people take his name as it gives them publicity. “I don’t react over such statements. Whatever is happening in the their party (read LJP) is their internal matter. We have nothing to do with it,” Nitish said. Chirag also did not spare the BJP and explained why his party contested the Bihar assembly elections alone last year. “We were offered 15 seats only to contest. And that, too, with a party whose principles were always also opposed by my father,” he wrote. JD(U) state president Umesh Kushwaha said Chirag has set his own hut ablaze and now he is passing the buck on others. Meanwhile, the stage is set for a ‘mahabharata’ in the LJP on July 5 when Chirag will launch his ‘ashirvad yatra’ from Hajipur, the home turf of his late father and now the parliamentary constituency of uncle Paras. Chirag said he was prepared to face the ‘mahabharata’ like battle to stake his claim over the party founded by his father with sweat and blood. “Obviously, it hurts me when I think of fighting against my own kin. But I have no option. I will fight for the symbol of the party at all levels,” he told this newspaper over phone from New Delhi. On Tuesday, Chirag’s supporters put up posters in Patna targeting Paras and CM Nitish and showing Chirag as ‘Abhimanyu’, who is seen trapped in the ‘chkravyuha’ created by the rebel party MPs with the support of JD(U). In another poster, CM Nitish has been portrayed as the director of a Bihari film and JD(U) MP Rajeev Ranjan alias Lalan Singh his informer, Surajbhan Singh as a villain, Paras a pawn and Chirag the hero. Contrary to Chirag’s allegations, Paras on Tuesday said the five MPs are like ‘pandavs’, who will fight for their share in the party come what may. Paras compared Chirag's ‘huth’ (stubbornness) with that of ‘Duryodhana’, who never paid heed to the advice of the senior party leaders. He, however, hastened to add that he would extend his support to Chirag’s ‘yatra' from Hajipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-accuses-nitish-of-causing-split-in-ljp-writes-letter-to-party-workers/articleshow/83754031.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||‘Govt analysed things and worked to a plan during 2nd wave of Cov’||PATNA: Like other parts of the country, Bihar has also been badly hit during the second wave of Covid-19. During the two months of April and May, the state registered 4.42 lakh Covid-19 cases, which is over 60% of the total number of cases registered in Bihar so far. Deaths, scarcity of oxygen and hospital beds, high demand for Remdesivir and other drugs created panic. Chief minister Nitish Kumar and state health minister Mangal Pandey lauded the efforts of the health department for managing the crisis well. Nitish on Monday said appreciated the department officials as Bihar even being the third most populous state was on the 21st position in terms of active Covid-19 cases. State health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said quick decision, policy and morale of his team played an important role. Amrit said decisions like converting all the medical college and hospitals into dedicated Covid hospitals, preplanning of increasing the beds as per requirement, control on black marketing of important drugs, giving free hands to all the districts to deploy manpower as per requirements for three months, real time war room for oxygen, recruitment of 700 additional doctors on the basis of walk-in-interview, daily meetings, interaction with private hospitals, field visit and community kitchen proved to be the game changers. “It was a tough time. We were getting calls every day for beds and medicines. But we had done our analysis and were working accordingly. We were even watching the national trend,” said Amrit. He said during the second wave, doctors in the field were not much affected. The IMA figures state the number of deaths of doctors were higher in the second wave, but most of them were retired ones. “The morale of the team was pretty much high. One has to be mentally strong and we knew after sunset there will definitely be sunrise. The only thing which rattled me was deaths of people working with me, colleagues and others. It was like I was in the battle, firing bullets, and person next to me was dead. I lost my additional secretary Choudhary ji, post master general Anil ji, some of our DIOs, 1989-batch IAS officer Guru Prasad Mahapatra who was managing the oxygen crisis across the country.” When asked about the criticism which the government and his department had received, Amrit replied, “It is a part of occupational hazard.” He even lauded the decision to go for the audit of Covid-19 deaths saying several private hospitals informed them that they had not given their data and decided to include all the Covid deaths so that the next of their kin could get the benefit of the government’s scheme of payment of Rs4 lakh. Amrit said the support from CM Nitish and minister Pandey also played an important role. “The CM held meetings everyday and health minister was always there with me in the office. I am thankful to seniors and all officials for being there. Many were down with Covid, but were still working.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-analysed-things-and-worked-to-a-plan-during-2nd-wave-of-cov/articleshow/83754424.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Universities asked to put up posters thanking PM for free Covid vaccines||PATNA: Educational institutions in the state are gearing up to put up posters and banners on their campuses thanking Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi for providing free vaccination to the people above the age of 18 years. They have reportedly been instructed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to put up banners with approved designs carrying the message ‘Thank you PM Modi’ both in English and Hindi along with his photograph. Central University of South Bihar on Tuesday put up two big hoardings written in Hindi and English at its headquarters in Gaya. Registrar Col Rajiv Kumar Singh told this reporter, “We fully endorse the PM’s vaccination drive and are planning to hold a free camp for the people above the age of 18 years.” Patna University, on the other hand, has not put up banners or posters thanking the PM yet. Vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary claimed that he had not received any e-mail or WhatsApp message from the UGC in this regard. “Necessary action will be taken only after receipt of instructions from the authorities concerned,” he added. Meanwhile, the UGC move has evoked mixed reactions from the academics. While the heads of most academic institutions have welcomed the step, several others have criticized it. Dr Dineshwar Prasad, the principal of Government Ayurvedic College in Patna, said, “The PM certainly deserves to be thanked for providing free vaccines to all the people of the country. There is no harm in putting up banners bearing his photograph.” The dean of the School of health and medicine in Aryabhatta Knowledge University also justified the UGC’s move. However, the general secretary of Patna University Teachers’ Association, Abhay Kumar, observed that people would automatically thank the government and the PM if the country got rid of the pandemic. “How can the people, who have lost their kin due to Covid and shortage of essential health facilities, thank the PM?” he asked. Bihar Public Service Commission’s former member, Shiv Jatan Thakur, pointed out, “The credit should be given to the apex court which, in its 32-page interim order, ruled that free vaccination was the constitutional obligation of the government. After the court’s order, the government launched a free vaccination drive in the country.” N K Chaudhary, the former principal of Patna College, said the UGC move would certainly create a bad precedence for any democratic society. The former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, Y D Prasad, also ridiculed the idea of putting up banners and posters in educational institutions in praise of the PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/universities-asked-to-put-up-posters-thanking-pm-for-free-covid-vaccines/articleshow/83755672.cms||B K Mishra
---||Business||Group health covers’ cost up 40%||Chennai: Rising Covid claims are pushing up the cost of group health insurance for employers by 25%-40% in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. This, even as new demand for employee health cover is coming from smaller employers like small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and MNCs with less than 50 employees.Small business owners are realising that the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) programme under which they are covered is inadequate and are opting for commercial group cover. Both Star Health & Allied Insurance MD S Prakash and SBI General Insurance head (product development) Subramanyam Brahmajosyula said that they are seeing 40%-50% growth in SME business compared to last year. Companies that have adopted the full work-from-home model get a relatively lower hike on premium as risk exposure is lower as well as the claims raised. “On an average, we have recorded a 30% rise in the premium price of group health policies as compared to the previous year. On requests, we provide add-on covers where tele-medical consultations and elderly care are covered, against an additional premium. This also includes consultations for mental illnesses,” said Future Generali India Insurance chief operating officer Shreeraj Deshpande.Insurtech company Vital’s co-founder Jayan Mathews said, “Since the pandemic outbreak, employees expect an inclusive and cost-effective group health policy which covers post-Covid effects — including counselling for mental health and wellness. There is an added pressure on employers to provide inclusive wellness care for employees who work from home.” Vital co-develops the insurance cover with Care Health Insurance and integrates with healthcare platforms for wellness benefits. The rise in premium is because the second wave has made health insurance less profitable. The loss claim ratio for group health business stands above 100%, that is, 104-110% in June 2021, as against 90%-95% in June 2020. The fresh demand is cushioning the price rise. “A high demand could lead to a minimum price revision of 12%-17%, where it could go up to 30%-40% if there is not much pickup in demand,” said Nilanjan Roy, who heads group business at ManipalCigna Health Insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/group-health-covers-cost-up-40/articleshow/83759754.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Beware of ‘sundar’ sextortionists, warn cyber cops||AHMEDABAD: If you receive a friend’s request on social media from a gorgeous face, pause a moment before hitting accept. The person offering you online intimacy in these times of safe distancing might just be leading you into a cyber extortion trap. From government officers to businessmen, political leaders to private firm employees, many have fallen victim to the lure of phone sex and nude video calls. So much so that the epidemic of sextortion cases has forced the cybercrime cell of the CID to issue an advisory: ‘Be alert to beautiful faces sending Facebook requests’. Recently, a government official, who is responsible for public food distribution, fell victim to a sextortion con. “He received a Facebook request on June 6 from an unknown woman. They became friends and she offered to have phone sex with him. However, once the deed was done, she demanded Rs 5 lakh from him,” said the senior officer of the CID (crime) Gujarat. The government official approached the cybercrime police, who inquired into the matter, and blocked the woman’s phone number after sending a loud and clear message that no money would be given. The government official, however, did not file a complaint fearing embarrassment at the very thought of his ‘sexcapade’ going public. There were two other government officials who were targeted by such fraudsters. An officer of the cybercrime police said that most of the calls were made from West Bengal, while few of the calls were traced to Bharatpur in Rajasthan. In Ahmedabad alone, the cybercrime cell has received over 500 complaints in the past six months. “We receive 5-7 complaints of sextortion where criminals use fake identities to befriend victims online through social media, persuade them to perform sexual acts on video calls, then record the images and threaten to share them with the victim’s friends and family unless they agree to fulfill their demands for payment,” said a police officer. He added, “Looking at the rising number of cases, an advisory was issued last week and forwarded to cybercrime police stations and cyber range police stations across the state.” The advisory reads, “Do not appear nude on video calls either on WhatsApp or on Facebook messenger with unknown people. This is a new trend of blackmailing people. If an unknown man or woman seeks money after such video calls, then approach the nearest cyber crime police station so that you can protect yourself from blackmailers.” Cops say people need to approach the police to blunt the `sextortion' racket. “This trend has been on the rise for the past 6-8 months. Usually, people feel ashamed of approaching cops, and the blackmailers bank on this emotion. People should understand that if they give money once, the extortionists will make repeated demands. The blackmailers ask for anything between a few thousands to lakhs of rupees,” said a police officer. In case of sextortion, the police can lodge a complaint under IPC section 500 for defamation along with charges under the Information and Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/beware-of-sundar-sextortionists-warn-cyber-cops/articleshow/83759379.cms||Ashish Chauhan

PCMC officials said that testing centres will focus on conducting rapid antigen tests but some of them will conduct RT-PCR tests as well. The fever clinics will help identify people displaying Covid-like symptoms at an early stage so that appropriate medical treatment can be started. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI, “The purpose of setting up these testing centres and fever clinics is to facilitate early detection of Covid cases at the ward level. If the cases can be detected in the initial stage, it will help us control the spread of the infection to other areas within the civic limits.” Patil said that the PCMC has initiated an awareness drive against Covid-19 across the city through public address systems. Mobile testing drives are being carried out by the health department, with a special focus on crowded markets. Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 and former director general of health services (Maharashtra), said, “Setting up the testing centres at the ward level should remain the highest priority and we have advised the same to the district administration as well as the state government. We cannot deny the possibility of the third wave. Stressing on testing and contact tracing can prove to be a useful tool in the fight against Covid.” Meanwhile, the commissioner said that PCMC has been identifying places to set up the Ward Covid Centres (WCCs) to isolated mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-sets-up-over-20-fever-clinics-and-testing-centres/articleshow/83760716.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Business||Kalrock-Jalan gets NCLT nod to fly Jet Airways||MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday approved a plan to revive the defunct Jet Airways submitted by UK’s Kalrock Capital and the UAE-based entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan. The bankrupt airline has been grounded since April 2019. The NCLT made it clear that the airline would not have any historic rights over time slots in airports and that the issue will be handled by the government or the appropriate authority. While government sources said that Jet would need to negotiate afresh for slots, the extremely low-capacity utilisation at airports due to the pandemic throws up opportunities. The Mumbai bench of NCLT, presided by Janab Mohammed Ajmal and V Nallasenapathy, allowed the resolution plan and directed the applicant to get the required approval and licences from relevant authorities within 90 days. Jalan-Kalrock said in a statement the next steps will be announced after examining the written order. “The intent to start the airline by the end of this year was expressed in the court,” said Ashish Chhawchharia of Grant Thornton Advisory, appointed by the consortium. Sources said that the consortium will soon apply for a Scheduled Operator’s Permit and other approvals for the airline. The airline is targeting to start with 20 aircraft with domestic slots for the winter session. However, there is no certainty that it will get its historic slots in airports with high traffic like Heathrow or Mumbai. The airline owed Rs 7,453 crore to financial creditors, of which Rs 5,770 crore was to local banks. In addition, it faced Rs 6,658-crore claims from operational creditors, Rs 360 crore from employees, and Rs 894 crore from workmen’s representatives. Lenders do not expect to gain anything significant from this deal as the successful bidders propose to invest only Rs 600 crore to repay creditors to acquire about 90% stake in the carrier. For employees, however, there is hope. “This is the first airline to get approval to restart operations under India’s Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,” said Amit Kelkar, a Jet Airways engineer. Udayan Shah and Ashish Mehta, appearing for the government, sought to stay the implementation of the order for eight weeks on the ground that they wish to appeal. Their plea was rejected by the court. In March, the civil aviation ministry expressed in its submission to the NCLT its unwillingness to hand over Jet’s airport time slots for arrival/departure to the new entity. The bankrupt airline had about 700 slots in congested airports like Mumbai and Delhi. These slots, one of the major assets of Jet Airways, were temporarily reallocated to other airlines after Jet suspended operations. The ministry said that Jet will need to apply afresh for these slots and they may or may not be granted to the airline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kalrock-jalan-gets-nclt-nod-to-fly-jet/articleshow/83759939.cms||---

The three had also asked Kumar, who owns the hotel at Akshay Nagar under Ramkrishna Nagar police station, to pay them Rs 10,000 as “protection money” on the first day every month. The brawl had taken place at the hotel on June 18. Sources said SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma Sharma, City SP (east) Jitendra Kumar and other senior officers suddenly reached the Ramkrishna police station for an inquiry on Monday night.

The new auxiliary buildings, multi-level car parking and residential quarters are being constructed at a snail’s pace. The Airports Authority of India-Patna had earlier targeted to complete infrastructure development work at the airport by June-end and set 2023 deadline to make the new terminal building ready. Patna airport director Bhupesh C H Negi said the outer structure of the multi-level car parking was ready. “The other auxiliary buildings like ATC tower, fire station, cargo unit and technical block are still under construction. Due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown restrictions, the work got delayed. We will set a new deadline for the completion of these buildings after a review. The new terminal building will be ready by March 2023,” he said. Binod Yadav, director of the private firm executing the project, said 70% work had been done on auxiliary buildings and three structures were ready, including fire station (G+1), technical block (G+3) and ATC tower. “Only finishing touches are to be given to these structures. The G+2 cargo building is still under construction due to some unavoidable problems,” he said, adding the building would be ready by November this year. The city airport is being modernised with an expenditure of Rs 1,216 crore. The two-storey terminal building will have the departure lounge on the first floor and arrival area on the ground floor. It will handle up to 80 lakh passengers per year. According to airport sources, the new ATC tower will be 24m high, almost 8m higher than the existing building. It will be equipped with communication, surveillance and navigation equipment. A G+5 multi-level car parking building in 3-lakh square feet area is being built to accommodate 750 passenger vehicles. The parking will be connected with the departure level of the new terminal building through a link bridge for pedestrian movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-leads-to-delay-in-city-airport-expansion-project/articleshow/83754376.cms||Faryal Rumi

However, he even lost that income during the Covid-19 induced pandemic. Jobless, Shankar returned to his ‘family business’ and today, earns Rs 32,000 a month as a camel herder!Shankar is one of the several young ‘maldharis’ in Kutch who have retraced their steps to their homestead to eke a living from camel dairying. The rising popularity of camel milk and its products, thanks to its medical benefits especially for diabetic issues, over the past couple of years has not only given the animals a hope for survival, but also a shot in the arm for its young rearers, particularly the pandemic-hit jobless lot. A survey carried out by Sahjeevan Trust, a non-profit organisation working towards camel conservation in Gujarat, has revealed that number of milk-giving camels has steadily increased in the arid region. With the scale of camel milk procurement increasing in the last five years by dairy giant like Amul and also startups like Aadvik Foods, camel herders who used to sell milk for a paltry Rs 15 a litre to local tea stalls have now started fetching Rs 50 a litre. “Our survey has revealed that number of camels rose to 9,898 in 2020 in Kutch against 8,439 in 2019. These are camels reared by the herders with whom we work,” said Ramesh Bhatti, anchor, breeding programme at Sahjeevan’s Centre for Pastoralism. “During the lockdown, many youngsters lost their jobs, but are now earning anywhere from Rs 14,000 to over Rs 1 lakh a month through camel dairying. In fact, just in Rapar, Nakhatrana, Abdasa, Bhuj, Mundra and Mandvi, 18 youngsters have returned to their villages and joined camel herding. They are currently pouring 16,556 litres milk through 504 camels for which they have received Rs 8.27 lakh payment,” Bhatti said. Sarhad Dairy or the Kutch District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited, a member of Amul, has seen 121 % growth in milk procurement since it started procuring milk from the region. “Initially, we had started with fresh camel milk which was procured in very small quantity and test marketed in Ahmedabad. But later, with long-life camel milk, we could penetrate deeper. The camel herders were the major beneficiaries of this exercise as they started getting stable price for their camel milk and an additional source of earning livelihood,” said RS Sodhi, MD, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets brand Amul. Aadvik Foods, which started procuring camel milk from Gujarat in 2016, has procured more than 8 lakh litres of camel milk from more than 220 camel herders of the region till now. “Earlier, no other brand was procuring camel milk from Gujarat,” said Hitesh Rathi, founder of Aadvik whose products include milk powder, ghee, chocolates, skincare range and colostrum made from camel milk. Amul, which has even introduced camel milk ice-cream, procures nearly one lakh litre milk a month for its range of products. “Taste-wise camel milk is slightly saltier as compared to cow or buffalo milk, but it has immense benefits. It has started gaining popularity, especially in the diabetic segment,” said Sodhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ship-of-desert-helps-the-jobless-stay-afloat/articleshow/83755694.cms||Prashant Rupera

Many attribute the price increase to supply side constraints due to the lockdown as mandis did not operate full time. While others said despite the increase, prices in Jaipur are meaningfully lower compared to metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Ilyas Qureshi, president of Ajmer District Meat Association said, “Because of lockdown prohibitions many people were not bringing animals to the mandi. That’s why the supply was not enough to meet the demand which resulted in some price rise.” Retail prices of meat has gone up by around Rs 100 per 1 kg. The rise has also impacted the chicken and fish prices by 10-20%. But Sabbir Querishi Muhammad, president of Jaipur Meat Merchants Association, said, “In Jaipur, the prices are still cheaper compared to other metro citifies. Barring a few places in the city, meat prices are about Rs 600 per 1 kg compared to Rs 700-800 in Delhi and Mumbai.” With meat becoming costlier, broiler chicken prices have also seen some increases of about 15-20%. Chicken is sold at Rs 220 per kg which used to be around Rs 180 around three months back. Rajasthan Poultry Farmers Society president Rajkumar Jaipal said, “The rise in chicken prices is a result of costlier meat. Poultry farming in summer season is tough and birds die because of heat. So both the factors have contributed to the price increase.” In the past couple of months, the consumers are shelling out a little eggs. From Rs 5 to the prices have gone up to Rs 6.50-7 at the retail shops. Jaipal cited the same reason of farmers losing birds to extreme heat conditions which has resulted in the price hike. However, some meat traders said that they are getting better prices for exports. “Large quantities of meat is exported to Gulf countries and the demand has been pretty good in the past 4-5 months for meat. That is another reason for the rise in prices.” The rise in diesel and petrol prices and the animal feed is another reason behind the price spike, the other poultry farmers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/meat-poultry-prices-rise-as-corona-curbs-hit-supply/articleshow/83763148.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: ‘Expert’ thief argues his own cases in court||JAIPUR: A 26-year-old thief arrested by the Jawahar Circle on Monday is well-versed in law to argue his cases in courts to avoid paying for lawyers, a city police officer claimed. Salim Sheikh, a native of the Meerut district in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested by Jaipur police on Monday evening. “He represented himself before the court in several cases. He is a habitual offender and had been involved in several criminal cases,” Jawahar Circle SHO Nemi Chand said. Sheikh was arrested along with three of his close aides identified as Milan Khan, Suraj Joshi, alias Badshah, and Gulshan, alias Gullu. Police said the accused was a skilled thief and had learnt the art of breaking into houses from his relatives. “His entire family including his parents have criminal records. We have found his other relatives were also involved in criminal acts,” an official involved in the investigation told TOI, adding that one of the accused relatives had advised Shiekh that as per law, he could represent himself in the court. “He is very skilled at theft and burglaries. He has about a dozen cases of burglary and theft filed against him. He could decamp with anything from a random LPG cylinder to a laptop or LED TV,” the official informed TOI. “Apart from learning the art of arguing in the court, he also knows how much to speak during interrogation. Whenever we asked him about previous criminal antecedents, his response was always measured, never revealing anything. He is a tough nut to crack because he understands a little bit of law,” another official claimed, adding that the accused had started out in the world of crime very early on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/expert-thief-argues-his-own-cases-in-court/articleshow/83763182.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Mutilated body of man run over by vehicles found on Jaipur-Delhi highway||JAIPUR: The mutilated body of an unidentified man was found along a busy stretch on the Jaipur-New Delhi highway after several vehicles suspected to have run over the corpse multiple times on Tuesday. The accident took place near a bus stand in Kotputli’s Paota area around in the wee hours of Tuesday. A team from Paragpura police station, which arrived at the scene claimed they found the corpse completely mutilated and torn apart. Authorities claimed that no one stopped at the site to alert an ambulance or police about the accident. “We received information around 5.51 am and dispatched a team to the area which reached the spot immediately. We found that the body was completely disfigured on the road and the face was crushed beyond recognition,” said an official from Paragpura police station. Jaipur rural police told TOI that they covered the body with a cloth and moved it from the highway to the mortuary of a local hospital in Kotputli area. DSP (Kotputli) Dinesh Kumar Yadav said that efforts were made to identify the victim. “The police team had arrived at the spot swiftly because Paragpura police station is not far from the place where the accident had taken place. The body was moved to the mortuary,” he told TOI, adding that CCTV camera footage of the nearby area was retrieved to zero in on the victim’s moments before the accident. Jaipur rural police suspect the accident may have occurred early in the morning. Vehicles passing through the area could not spot the body in the dark. “He may have died after hit by a speeding vehicle near Paota. It is also likely that instead of multiple vehicles, an overloaded multi-axle truck may have plowed into him,” an official informed TOI. Located at about 160 km away from the city, the area near the Paota bus stand is usually teeming with people round the clock. But no one called to inform us of the accident. An official claimed that the victim’s clothes were also torn apart due to which no identification proof was found on him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mutilated-body-of-man-run-over-by-vehicles-found-on-jaipur-delhi-highway/articleshow/83763176.cms||---

Sundara, who had earlier alleged that BJP leaders had threatened and abducted him and later given him Rs 2.5 lakh and a smartphone to withdraw his nomination, said on Tuesday that former Yuva Morcha state treasurer Sunil Naik and local BJP leader Suresh Naik along with two others were present at the Uduppi Garden hotel when he signed the withdrawal papers. Sundara told media on Tuesday that he had spent around 45 minutes at the hotel on March 22. Sundara had earlier in his statement told police that local BJP leaders came to his house at Vaninagar, took him to its office at Jodkkal where he was threatened to withdraw his nomination in March. He had reiterated before police that he was promised money and a wine shop at Manjeswaram if Surendran won the election. He added that Surendran called him and gave an assurance. Though police have registered a case only against Surendran under 171 B (bribery involving giving a gratification to any person with the object of inducing him or any other person to exercise any electoral right or of rewarding any person for having exercised any such right) and 171 E sections, it is learnt that more persons would be included and IPC sections dealing with abduction, wrongful confinement and threatening will be added on the basis of the statement of Sundara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/sundara-taken-to-kgod-hotel-for-collecting-evidence/articleshow/83760810.cms||---

Police have formed four special teams to nab the accused. One of the teams has left for Rameswaram to prevent him from escaping to Sri Lanka. The Saravanampatti police said 49-year-old Lavendran alias Kumar, who is engaged in demolishing old buildings, had beaten his 32-year-old wife L Kavitha to death with a cricket bat around 10pm on Monday at their rental house at Gandhima Nagar.

She also had a son with Lavendran, who used to scold her over excessive use of mobile phone. The officer said Kavitha’s relative S Nagarajan, 27, an ambulance driver, had gone to see her on June 19, but she wasn’t home. “When inquired, Lavendran told him that she had left the house a week ago and was staying at one of her friends’ house after he scolded her for speaking to other people often over phone. He also told Nagarajan that he would finish her off if she were to return home.” When Nagarajan went to meet one of his friends at Gandhima Nagar on Monday night, he heard Kavitha crying for help from her house. “He rushed to the house and found Lavendran assaulting her with a cricket bat. She died on the spot and Lavendran managed to escape from the place,” the officer said. Nagarajan alerted the Saravanampatti police, who sent the dead body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem. Police have registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and formed four special teams to nab Lavendran. “We have also alerted the Q branch police at Mandapam in Ramanathapuram to prevent Lavendran from escaping to Sri Lanka,” the officer said. The officer said Lavendran hadn’t separated from his first wife and used to visit her often.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sri-lankan-refugee-beats-second-wife-to-death-on-the-run/articleshow/83760788.cms||---

According to the initial report, the video is genuine, but the agency is waiting for the final report which will give a green light to authenticity of the video, audio and rule out tampering. The ACB is expecting to get the full report by Monday. ACB senior officers on Tuesday said in such videos there are lot of things, which are needed to be verified from the FSL. “First, we have to see if the video is genuine, second it would be seen if the voices in the video are genuine or dubbed and also if there are some cuts in the video or anything concocted. So, far among our all the queries related to the video, we have got a partial report, but it is inconclusive,” said ACB DGP BL Soni Soni has also written to the FSL and asked them to handle the case with priority. “One video was in public domain but there are actually three videos so everything needs to be examined. I have also written a covering letter in which I have requested the FSL to take this video examination in priority,” said Soni.ACB ASP Bajrang Singh said, “After the full report of the FSL comes and if the videos are found fully genuine, we will certainly registered a case under section 7A and other appropriate sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.”It may be recalled that ACB had initiated a probe against suspended JMC-Greater mayor Somya Gurjar’s husband Rajaram Gurjar and BVG India Limited.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Hit by pandemic, many citizens sell their vehicles to stay afloat||PUNE: Santosh Thorat gets at least seven-eight calls each day from people desperate to sell their cars, some of which were bought in the recent past. “There has even been an instance of a customer, who bought a car from me barely a few months ago and is now desperately looking for a buyer. The primary reason behind the trend is people’s inability to pay monthly instalments due to job losses or businesses not doing well due to the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown,” said Thorat, owner of Baner-based Goodwill Motors that deals with sale and purchase of pre-used four-wheelers. “Those who are walking in to buy cars are unwilling to spend more than Rs2 lakh, even on the latest model of a vehicle. They prefer to buy a 2014 or 2015 model,” he said. Rahul Dixit, owner of Dixit Motors on Sinhgad Road, said the number of buyers of pre-used cars was significantly higher than sellers before the pandemic hit. “On an average, I used to get two sellers a day as opposed to 10-15 prospective numbers. Earlier, people wanted to sell cars to buy the latest models,” he said. “The situation has now reversed. More people are willing to sell their cars. We cannot take a risk of buying a second-hand car unless we have customers. When it comes to vehicle registration, the numbers are down (see graphic), ” Dixit added. Fahim Sheikh, owner of Alfa Motors located on NIBM road, said, “I have a few customers willing to buy used cars. But it will take time for the market to pick up. People are giving it a second thought before investing in cars due to the pandemic. I have a few high-end models lined up for sale, which gives an idea of the situation. At the same time, I am getting 15-16 calls a day from people willing to sell their cars.” A middle-aged man, who worked at a private firm, said that he could no longer afford the sports utility vehicle (SUV) he had bought early last year.  “It barely has travelled 1,000km. I have lost my job and haven’t managed to pay a Rs22,00 instalment for the past four months. I am in touch with a dealer and intend to show him the car next week to sell it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hit-by-pandemic-many-citizens-sell-their-vehicles-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/83760783.cms||Joy Sengupta

The All-India Organization of Chemists’ and Druggists’ Association (AIOCDA) and manufacturers reported an 85% drop in sales, mainly after the second wave of Covid-19 started receding in most states from early May. “Across the country, data shows around a 85% drop in sales during the last 15 days,” said Jagannath Shinde, president, AlOCDA, an association of nationwide network of drug retailers and wholesalers. Chemists’ Association of Pune district said the drop was 90% in Pune. Remdesivir became popular during the harrowing second wave that hit India in April. The anti-viral injection that sent people scouting for it was recently included in the Oxford dictionary following extensive demand which, however, has taken a nosedive now. “As per an industry trade report, over 85 lakh vials of Remdesivir are stockpiled with 16 manufacturers. There is a looming fear that a substantial number of the vials will cross their expiry date as demand has significantly gone down across the country,” Shinde said. Drug production was ramped up 10 times from 33,000 vials per day to 3.5 lakh between April 11 and May 29. To meet domestic requirements, export of Remdesivir was also prohibited on April 11. From the third week of April, the Centre started allocating Remdesivir to states. Medical experts TOI spoke to made it clear that the drug has not fallen out of favour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-demand-for-remdesivir-drops-by-85-in-country/articleshow/83760842.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Sources said that for the administration got only four days to prepare for the mega drive. Trainings were held in massive numbers, the entire machinery was mobilised, in tribal areas, ‘Khatla Baitak’ (meeting on charpais) was organised, village level crisis management teams that were already in existence were mobilised, public representatives came out in streets in large numbers, social leaders, people across party lines, social organisations, everyone played their part in the drive, added sources. Even the logistics teams performed excellently, delivering vaccine on time at several places like Singrauli, which is 1000 kilometres from Bhopal, there also vaccines were delivered on time, said sources. The outcome was each and every district of the state achieved more than the target given to the district, said sources. Not even a single serious AEFI (adverse event following immunisation) was reported, this was possible due to the appropriate trained staff that knew the type of people who should come under exclusion criteria of the vaccine, said sources. In several places, like Gwalior teams reached in the night itself and vaccination started at 6 am like the elections, monitoring was throughout, staff engaged in vaccination worked continuously for more than 24 hours, said sources.

The workshop sessions will be conducted by subject experts, including IIT professors who would directly train the ITI principals. Commenting on the initiative, the minister said, “The initiative comes at an opportune moment when the education systems are transforming rapidly. We believe that this interdisciplinary program would lead to confidence building of ITI staff which will further strengthen the educational outcomes of students in these institutions.” Alok Kumar congratulated the team for the initiative and envisioned a stronger association with IIT-Kanpur for similar future endeavours. He added, “We aim to bring novel opportunities to the esteemed principals of ITIs that can bring value-addition to their efforts.” Prof Abhay Karandikar said, “Education and training are strengths of educational institutes like IIT and we would feel honoured to assist in capability building of ITIs and envisioned to scale the process in the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/siic-iit-k-sign-mou-to-train-itis-on-innovative-tech/articleshow/83757926.cms||---

People in Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts are welcoming the water flowing in the canal, also known as Kallanai canal, by offering prayers and showering flowers. Cauvery water was released from Mettur dam on June 12, which subsequently reached Mukkombu and Kallanai dams. Water released in the GA canal will help the ongoing kuruvai cultivation in major parts of Thanjavur district including Papanasam, Pattukoittai and Peraurani regions. While flowing in the Pudukottai district, the canal will help fill up many tanks and lakes which will help in samba cultivation that begins in August. “Water flowing in the canal is symbol of prosperity as it helps in taking up the kuruvai cultivation. Farmers in Thanjavur and a part of Pudukottai have started working for kuruvai cultivation,” said A Ganesan, a farmer from Pattukottai. About 500 cusecs of water was released on June 16, which has now been increased to 1,121 cusecs as per the public works department (PWD) data. Water is likely to reach till the end of the canal in the next few days as the volume of water released to GA canal has been gradually increased, says farmers. “The work on Kallanai restoration could not be completed. While water may reach the tail-end areas but it may not reach the required volume to facilitate diversion of water through shutters in the branch canals,” said V Veerasenan, a farmer from Pattukottai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cauvery-water-reaches-tail-end-areas-in-delta/articleshow/83760862.cms||---

A relative of Rajappan said that since the bank was not operating on Tuesday, the account can be checked only on Wednesday. The relative also said that the receipt was send to them by the accused. Rajappan is in no mood to go ahead with the complaint if the amount was remitted to his account, added the relative. Meanwhile, Kumarakom station house officer said that they have almost completed the investigation and only needs to arrest the accused as part of the procedure. “However, if the complainant and the accused settles the issue, there won’t be any problem in closing the case. But the police need to inform the court with the statements of both parties that the complaint was settled,” said the officer. He also said that since the charges were for cheating and criminal breach of trust, police have nothing against the settlement of the case between the close relatives. Raju had filed a complaint with the police that the financial assistance and boats he received was looted by his sister Vilasini, husband and son. In the complaint he says that Rs 5 lakh was withdrawn from his account without his knowledge on February 12 and another Rs 8,000 on March 17.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rajappan-likely-to-withdraw-cheating-plaint-against-sister/articleshow/83760864.cms||---

Using the Susceptible Infected Removed (SIR) model, professors Rajesh Ranjan and Mahendra Verma have constructed three scenarios of a possible third wave while using the epidemic parameters of the second wave. “The third wave of Covid-19 could be delayed untill November if all protocols are followed. Also, if 60% of the population in the country is vaccinated, the impact of the third wave could be mitigated. Not only this, the third wave could even be prevented from occurring if appropriate steps are taken in time,” the study has concluded. The two experts analysed the data from the second wave of the pandemic to make predictions for the third wave, which has now become a topic of discussions. They stated that to break the chain of coronavirus transmission and to avert the wave of the pandemic completely, it is most important to vaccinate the maximum number of people in the country against Covid-19 and that too at the earliest. However, they have issued a warning, too. “The third wave could hit the country early and could turn out to be highly contagious or infectious if Covid protocols like wearing of face masks and following social distancing norms are not followed rigorously,” the study has observed. In view of the significant anxiety among policy-makers and the public about the possibility of a third wave, the experts — using the Susceptible Infected Removed (SIR) model — constructed three scenarios of a possible third wave using the epidemic parameters of the second wave. The three scenarios have been assumed considering that India is fully unlocked by July 15. According to the first scenario, the third wave is expected in October but with a lower peak height than the second wave. In the second, the peak could be higher than the second wave and may appear early around September, while in the third case the peak of the third wave could be delayed until late October with strict adherence to social distancing norms. In this scenario, the peak will be much lower than the second wave. “The main presumption we took is that the unlocking date is July 15. We presume that by July 15 the entire country is unlocked. We also presume that as on July 15 the situation in the country is what it was like in the month of January this year. Now, if we consider the pandemic parameters from the second wave, we find that the peak will happen in and around October,” Prof Ranjan told TOI. He added, “Now, we simulate a second situation where we increase the reproduction number — basic reproduction number (RO) suggests the average number of people that can contract the virus from one infected person. In this case, the virus mutates and becomes more infectious and we find that the peak comes early and the peak height is much higher than the second wave.” “Then we simulate a third scenario where people strictly comply with the Covid protocols and maximum country population stands vaccinated. We find that the third wave can be delayed till November and also peak height will be much smaller than the second wave. We can utilise this time untill November and vaccinate the maximum number of people. This will help us in lowering the peak,” he further stated. “In a nutshell, we can say that there are chances of a third wave to happen as we don’t know whether herd immunity — this could be ascertained using sero survey data — has been achieved or not. If we follow Covid-19 protocols strictly, the peak would be happening in November but its height will remain low,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/mass-vaccination-adherence-to-covid-norms-can-blunt-3rd-wave/articleshow/83757885.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

Some workers who got inoculated on Monday, took a day off. Government data did not reflect any adverse reaction following immunization (AEFI). It has not been reported in Bhopal since June 7. Percentage of AEFI in Bhopal is very low at 0.018%, MP average is 0.004%. The national average is 0.009%, according to government data. “I have three workers in my store, only one has reported for work. The vaccination camp was held in the market. Vaccination for workers could be divided so work does not get affected,” said a businessman in Chowk Bazaar area of Bhopal. Some educational institutions too reported that some of the staff did not turn up for duty, according to sources. “Most of traders and workers got inoculated before opening of the markets after lockdown. Only a few got remain to be vaccinated. Some have recently recovered from COVID-19. It requires a gap of three weeks before getting a jab,” said a trader in New Market. Police and district administration along with BMC and traders association have been actively tracing the non-vaccination. Public transport passengers are being randomly checked for vaccination. In many instances on Monday, entire bus or magic van was stopped and many of the passengers were told to get vaccinated. Tuesday was a non COVID-19 day. Five vaccination sites were operational in Bhopal. 460 people got the administered the vaccine on Tuesday.

Recently the asbestos sheets of the vegetable and fish market got blown off due to strong winds. The portion where the vegetable vendors sit is half open and rain water floods the entire market from the open roof. The sellers fear that the remaining covering sheets might also get blown away. A fish vendor said, “ We share the same complex and it is a small structure. We pay rent to the municipality for sitting inside the market and do business legally. Though the vendors illegally sitting on roads make more business than us. Despite paying money, the condition of the market is pathetic.” Vegetable vendors have set up their stalls just outside the market door while stocking vegetables inside the complex. Fish vendors have also started selling near the entrance due to the roof. When it rains the vendors find it difficult to sit inside the market and the leaky roof makes it even more difficult. Ward councillor Deepak Naik said, “ The sheets were blown during the recent cyclone. We have received complaints and have asked for estimates for the repair work. The municipality will take up the repairs soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/portion-of-roof-at-baina-market-blows-off-vendors-face-risk/articleshow/83760938.cms||---

Currently, the medical oxygen requirement is only 125 metric tonnes in the district as against the generated 375 metric tonnes due to steep fall in Covid cases. The extra medical oxygen is being diverted to Kolhapur, Solapur and Satara districts, district health officials said. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said while 15 plants were ready, another 39 would be readied by July-end. “Among the 15 plants that are ready, five are in the PMC limits, two in the PCMC limits and eight in the rural areas. These are already helping with the additional supply of 7,729 litres per minute (LPM) of oxygen, while the additional plants will help with around 23,243 LPM of the gas,” he said. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a Covid review meeting on Monday where he urged all collectors to ensure that the plants were ready ahead of the possible third wave as warned by experts. Joint commissioner of Food and Drug Administration SB Patil told TOI that three companies into oxygen generation were supplying 355 metric tonnes, while three air separation units were adding an additional 20 metric tonnes. “During the pre-Covid times, Pune district’s requirement was 75 metric tonnes. At present, we are needing125 metric tonnes, an additional of 50 metric tonnes. However, we are ensuring that we are ready with the supply and speeding up the setting up of PSA plants in the district,” he said. Besides, the PSA plants, which will generate around 30 metric tonnes supply, three additional liquid oxygen plants will generate 9 metric tonnes of supply. “Ahead of the third wave, we do want to be caught off guard. We will ensure that the entire supply is ready by July-end,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-daily-oxygen-output-to-rise-to-410-metric-tonnes-from-july-end/articleshow/83760890.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Hearing a petition filed by Ramit Basu, Harshwardhan Melanta and Pankaj Kumar, the division bench of Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice V K Shukla sought a reply from the respondents within four weeks, when the matter will come up for hearing again. The petition contended that 382 hectare land has been given to the company in question for 50 years on lease and during mining, 2.5 lakh trees of the rainforest will be felled. Besides, the land is adjacent to Panna National Park and is part of the tiger corridor. Still, permission of the NTCA and MP Wildlife Board was not sought before allotment of land to the company. They further said that cutting of trees would create ecological balance in the region, wildlife in the Buxwah forests would be jeopardised and the environment would be damaged beyond repair. Counsel for the state government sought to convince the court that prior permission of the NTCA or MP Wildlife Board was not a prerequisite for allotment of land but the judges were not convinced and ordered that notices be issued to all the respondents seeking their response to the petition. Secretary, ministry of forest and environment, principal secretary, mining, principal secretary, forest, PCCF of the state government, Chhtarpur collector, NTCA, managing director of M/s Essel Mining & Industry Lid. have been made a party in the case.

Every year, new guidelines are issued for the purchase and sale of property in the state from April 1, but due to coronavirus pandemic, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan decided to keep them unchanged till June 30, to ease the woes of property buyers. With just a week left for June to end, if the guideline rates are revised, the cost of real estate would further go up in the state. The builders association has, however, demanded to keep the rates unchanged for the entire year. Builders point out that due to pandemic, the real estate sector has suffered a major jolt - possibly second biggest after the demonetisation in 2016. The sector perked up a bit in the period between Diwali and January last year, but the second wave of Covid and ensuing restrictions again hit the sector hard. Spokesman of Madhya Pradesh Real Estate Developers' Associations of India, Manoj Singh Meek, said the association is demanding to keep the guideline rates unrevised for the whole year. A majority of states in the country have done the same considering the situation due to the pandemic, he said. The rate of registration of properties in MP is highest in the country. “The guideline rates are also increased every year irrationally with the sole objective to meet the yearly revenue collection target,” Meek added. In MP the registry charges are 12.50 per cent in urban areas while in rural MP, the registration charges are 10.50 per cent. In the first week of April, CM announced to reduce the registry rate by two percent on property purchased in the name of women. Government on Tuesday also announced not to charge registration fee from women contractors; these were issued by the public works department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/new-guidelines-post-june-30-may-give-steep-push-to-real-estate-prices/articleshow/83758857.cms||Ankur Sirothia

Corporation officials, however, said the scuffles were politically motivated and they had administered all the 100 doses in each of the vaccination centres. At the corporation primary school at Vellakinar, a group of women and men were seen shouting at a sanitation supervisor and police constable, who was posted there to control the crowd, around 7.15am for distributing only 64 tokens. Viji, a resident of Thudiyalur, said they were waiting in the queue since 4.30am to get tokens for the jab. “At 6.30am, the police constable asked the men and women to stand in separate queues of 45 people each, as 10 tokens were already issued to the corporation health department staff. At 7am, the sanitation supervisor distributed just 64 tokens and tried to leave the spot.” Immediately, the crowd surrounded him and the police constable, asking what happened to 26 of the 90 tokens that they said were available. “Many people had taken leave from work to get inoculated on the day. So, it was not appropriate from the part of the city corporation to turn away people without distributing all the 100 tokens,” said Azhar, who didn’t get the token, despite being the 34th member in the queue. Things weren’t any different at the corporation schools at KK Pudur and Cheranmanagar, where gates were closed at 6.45am, asking people to come after two to three days even for the second shot of Covishield. “Some DMK men allowed only people with local addresses to get the tokens,” said a photographer, who visited the school at Cheranmanagar. Tokens had exhausted at KK Pudur too by 7am. City corporation officials said all the 100 doses allotted per school were administered on the day. The vaccination drive is being held at 43 schools. Dr S Raja, city health officer, said they were not reserving any doses for the health staffers, as they were all already inoculated. Corporation officials said the scuffles, which mainly occurred at extended parts of north and east zones, were politically motivated.

The fire service department suspected that people set fire waste piles in the two accidents that were reported in the city last week. They have insisted people not to park vehicles next to the garbage mounds. “The distress calls to extinguish piled up waste set on fire is increasing. Our response time to attend to other serious distress incidents is getting delayed as we are occupied in extinguishing fire at waste mounds,” Melchio Raja, station officer of Cantonment fire station, said. Such incidents were also reported on national highways. The city fire service station in Cantonment is receiving six-seven distress calls every day, of which at least two-to-three calls were made to report burning of garbage. The door-to-door waste collection practice in the city has become not effective, and residents dump waste on roads as the public garbage bins were removed by the city corporation. Over the days, unidentified people and sanitation workers were suspected to have set the garbage piles on fire. Throwing used coal, cigarette buds and inflammable products also cause the garbage to burn spontaneously in the hot summer. Since wind flow is high during June and July, burning of waste is considered dangerous. A truck parked near a garbage mound on E Pudur Road near Crawford RoB was partially gutted on Tuesday. Similarly, in Ariyamangalam, a fire accident reported at a private property last week was also suspected to be caused by a burning waste mound. As a huge quantity of water and workforce is spent in dousing such fire incidents, the fire service department has planned to talk to the civic body to streamline the city’s waste management. “We will convey certain guidelines to the civic body to avoid fire accidents due to waste mounds,” the officer added. Meanwhile, the civic body sources maintained that the sanitation workers were warned not to burn waste mounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/waste-mounds-turn-a-burning-issue-in-trichy/articleshow/83760988.cms||Deepak Karthik

The election department stated that a total of 80,095 voters were enrolled in Trichy district in the special summary revision of electoral rolls of Election Commission of India (ECI) between November 16, 2020 and December 15, 2020. Of the total newly-enrolled voters, 53,116 registered their mobile numbers with the ECI during the summary revision. Such new voters will be able to download their e-EPIC from the website – www.nvsp.in and voter helpline mobile application. e-EPIC is a secure portable document format (PDF) version of the EPIC, which can be downloaded on mobile phone or in a self-printable form on the computer, said the ECI website. It states that a voter can store the card on his/her mobile, upload it as a PDF on Digi Locker or print it and self-laminate it, which is in addition to PVC EPIC being issued currently. Trichy collector S Sivarasu mentioned that 3,103 voters only downloaded their e-EPIC till Monday, while 500,13 voters were yet to download the e-EPIC. The collector raised concern over the low patronage from the young voters.

The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said the issue was important, and the state and BMC should give details on how many such persons have been vaccinated, and what steps were being taken as they would be unable to give an informed consent. The PIL, filed by T J Bhanu and argued by counsel Sarosh Bharucha, sought to ensure a special ease of convenience and access to vaccination for those who may not be able to make their own decisions, like the homeless and the mentally challenged. “Show us how you will identify them and vaccinate them. They cannot be denied a vaccine. We should all work towards a solution,’’ said the bench, saying the PIL had raised a very “comprehensive cause’’. It said, “People are wandering around. We don’t see any government agency is helping them. Civic corporations and state are not taking any steps.’’ The state said they can be taken to homeless shelters, and said it would try and get details, and the petitioner said BMC would be made a party too. The HC said to the state, “This is a larger issue. Come back with a proper affidavit,’’ and adjourned the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-state-whats-your-vax-policy-on-mentally-ill-homeless/articleshow/83760969.cms||---

---||Pune||‘Many Delta+ patients in Maharashtra recovered fully’||PUNE: Many of the Covid patients infected with the Delta-plus variant in Maharashtra did not have severe illness and went on to recover completely, state disease surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said on Tuesday. Studies are going on to determine if the new variant is more transmissible and virulent, but Dr Awate said a preliminary analysis of the 21 cases in the state shows most of them did not develop severe Covid and were able to recover. The 21 Delta-plus cases were found among 7,500 samples the state had collected for sequencing. “The disease in these 21 cases was not that severe. Many of these cases have competed their 14-day recovery period. Their samples were sent for genome sequencing around May-end,” Awate said. He said the emergence of a variant should not cause panic and the precautions like masking and sanitizing remain the same. Awate said, “When a variant is detected, the precautions people have to adopt are the same — masking, sanitizing and social distancing. The study of a variant is, however, of relevance to the administration, which may have to make suitable policy decisions for its containment and to test vaccine efficacy further.” Awate added that so far there had been no evidence to show the Delta-plus variant was more virulent. The health department is now focusing on identifying breakthrough infections (Covid after vaccination) in regions that have reported new variants, like Delta-plus. Tracking breakthroughs is key as some reports recently indicated that the Delta variant showed signs of vaccine resistance. “The information on breakthrough cases is being compiled, with deeper analysis of infections with newer variants,” Dr Awate said. The breakthrough investigation is one part of the surveillance the state has launched to track variants. State health minister Rajesh Tope said Maharashtra would now collect information on index patients infected by Delta-plus. He said state will check if they were re-infected and a detailed report would be sent to ICMR and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for analysis. “We don’t know yet if the Delta variants are bypassing the current vaccines. Studies are on,” Tope said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-delta-patients-in-state-recovered-fully/articleshow/83760997.cms||Neha Madaan

The court was hearing the petition filed by A Pavanasam, father of P Muthu Mano, 27, seeking a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of HC and seeking the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 2 crore. This is the second petition filed by the petitioner. During the past two hearings, this court had observed that unless the petitioner complies with an earlier order of the court and receives the body, the court is not inclined to pass any orders. When the case was taken up for hearing on Tuesday, Pavanasam appeared before the court through video conference. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the present stand taken by the petitioner, gives an impression that he does not have any regard or respect to the orders passed by the court. Pavanasam’s counsel submitted that the petitioner has highest regard for the court and the order passed by it and sought for a reasonable time to think over the matter and take a decision as there is a lot of pressure on him by the other villagers. The senior counsel appearing for the state submitted that a direction may be issued at the earliest because there is deployment of police force at the village to maintain law and order. Hence, the judges granted reasonable time to the petitioner to think over what they have observed. If there is no positive response from the petitioner in complying with the earlier order, the court will issue appropriate directions to the authorities to cremate or bury the body as per customary rights followed by the family, said the judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-gives-another-chance-to-man-to-receive-murdered-sons-body/articleshow/83761023.cms||---

Sources in BJP said that during his two-day stay in the state capital, Scindia is likely to meet some senior leaders including cabinet ministers and his loyalists. He is likely to attend a dinner hosted by cabinet minister Arvind Bhadoria at his official residence. This is Scindia's second visit during last fortnight and he has been regularly meeting party leaders and ministers seeking appointments of his supporters in the boards and corporations. However, Scindia has never reacted on the party's political plans, sources disclosed that a few former ministers namely Imarti Devi, Giriraj Dandotia and Aidel Singh Kansana, who lost previous assembly by-polls and were seeking appointment in a position equivalent to the status of a cabinet minister, were eagerly waiting for the party's decision on the public sector units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/scindia-reviews-hosp-preparedness-in-shivpuri-may-visit-bhopal-today/articleshow/83758940.cms||---

The letter from Swith ON Foundation that has been actively promoting cycling for the past decade and has been questioning the restrictions imposed on the environment-friendly mode of transport on several city roads, suggested Kolkata Police introduce a campaign similar to the ‘Safe Drive, Save Lives’ initiative that promotes safe driving behaviour among motorists. “We have in our way carried out a campaign to educate cyclists about traffic rules and discipline. Till now, pedestrians and cyclists have not been a priority and feel they don’t belong to the system. A campaign that addresses them can change that perception and lead to traffic compliance,” said SwithON Foundation managing director Vinay Jaju. Reiterating its appeal to remove cycle restrictions from city roads and integrate cycle-safe infrastructure into the current transport system of the city, Jaju cited studies that have already been submitted to the police that shows cycling to be a safe mode of transport when compared to motorcycles and cars with average speeds than can either match or exceed the latter to debunk old notions and adopt fresh ideas. “It is our strong belief that integrating cycling in our current transport fleet along with strict rules and measures and including them in sensitization campaigns can benefit Kolkata’s transport system greatly. We have already started such sensitization campaigns and will be happy to work under your leadership to successfully reach and sensitize all cyclists,” he reasoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/green-group-plans-cycle-campaign/articleshow/83758946.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Madurai||Necessary changes must be made in fraudulent property transaction: Madras high court||MADURAI: Madras high court observed that once an order is passed by the authority declaring the property transaction to be fraudulent, the same has to be recorded in the relevant register and must be reflected in the encumbrance certificate, instead of making the owner of the property approach the civil courts for cancellation of documents. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that the Registration Act, 1908, provides for a mechanism to the concerned authority to deal with a complaint pertaining to a fraudulent transaction. Once an authority exercises such a power and conducts an inquiry and ultimately, finds that the entire transaction is fraudulent, such an order passed by the authority should get reflected in the records. “Declaring a transaction to be a fraudulent one, virtually makes that document void in the eye of law. Once a document is void in the eye of law, there is no necessity for a party to unnecessarily spend his time in a civil court seeking for cancellation of such a document,” observed the judge. The judge observed that it is clear from the circular issued by the inspector general of registration in 2018, that when the order passed by the competent authority declaring a transaction to be a fraudulent one, necessary entry has to be made in index. Hence, the judge directed the inspector general of registration to refer to this order and issue a note to all the sub-registrar offices across and direct them to strictly follow the directions issued in the earlier circular. The court passed the order while hearing a petition filed by S R M Packiri Rajan from Dindigul district who sought to make entries in the encumbrance certificate of his property as the authorities had declared that a document in favour of a woman R Deepa was a fraudulent one. Quashing the order passed by the authorities who rejected the representation of the petitioner to make entries in the document, the judge directed them to make relevant changes in the property records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/necessary-changes-must-be-made-in-fraudulent-property-transaction-hc/articleshow/83761035.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Mishra said the Congress was missing from action during the pandemic and it should have issued a `white paper' on Emergency and 1984 Sikh riots in the country. “Surprisingly, the Congress and its leaders were not seen in action during the crisis in the country and are now releasing a `white paper' on the pandemic. It would have been better if Rahul Gandhi would have issued a `white paper' on the Emergency, Delhi Sikh riots of 1984, Bhopal gas tragedy and exodus of Kashmiri Pandits.They should tell the country what they have done to help the people," Mishra said. Criticising Rahul Gandhi, Mishra said that he has been misleading the public during the crisis. "Congress leaders, who called Corona an Indian variant, termed the vaccine as BJP vaccine. He did not leave his house during the crisis and is now releasing `white paper' on Corona. If Rahul had gone to a hospital during the Corona disaster, attended a relief camp, if he was seen distributing food grains, medicines, then he would have the moral authority to issue a `white paper' on pandemic," said Mishra. The BJP leader said that Madhya Pradesh has topped the country by providing vaccines to 16.73 lakh people in a day. "We all have to maintain this pace of vaccination to defeat corona. Even the world is giving answers to those questioning India's vaccination drive. India will share the success story of the CoWIN portal to the world. More than 20 countries including Vietnam, Peru, Mexico, Iraq have shown interest in the Indian platform," said MP home minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-slams-cong-white-paper-on-pandemic/articleshow/83758968.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Rana had produced over 100-yr-old documents’||New Delhi: Amravati MP Navneet Rana, who was elected from the reserved seat on the basis of her caste certificate, has got interim relief from the Supreme Court. While ‘Mochis’ are part of Scheduled Castes and eligible to contest from a reserved seat in some states, a ‘Sikh Chamar’ is not included in the list of reserved category in Maharashtra. The Bombay high court had held that ‘Chamar’ and ‘Mochi’ were not synonymous as claimed by the MP to contest from a ‘reserved’ seat. Challenging the HC order, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari that the high court’s findings were completely wrong. He said ‘Chamar’ and ‘Mochi’ were same and people prefer the term ‘Mochi’ as ‘Chamar’ is deemed derogatory. Rohatgi said his client had produced many documents, some of them more than 100 years old, to substantiate her claim, but the HC refused to consider the documentary evidence. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for a social worker on whose plea the HC had cancelled the caste certificate of Kaur, told the bench that the politician had also indulged in fabrication of documents to get the caste certificate and pleaded with the bench to take a serious view of it. He said the HC had noted in its judgment that the MP had produced fabricated documents. The SC bench said the matter needed to be examined, but granted interim stay on the HC order. With Sibal seeking an early hearing, before the commencement of the Parliament session, the bench posted the case for final hearing on July 27. While cancelling the caste certificate, the HC has asked Rana to surrender the certificate within six weeks and directed her to pay Rs 2 lakh to the Maharashtra Legal Services Authority and held that “all the consequences in law provided upon cancellation of such a fraudulently obtained certificate shall follow”. It had also pulled up the District Caste Scrutiny Committee, Mumbai, which validated the certificate in November 2017, saying it “did its job rather sloppily and shirked the obligations imposed on it”. “The committee had not rendered any finding on the basis of those two documents that the respondent No.3 (Rana) had proved her caste claim in respect of the caste ‘Mochi’. The committee has directly or indirectly amended the said entry No.11 in Part 10 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 by inserting the term ‘Sikh Chamar’ in the said entry and has exceeded its jurisdiction. The new entry could be inserted only by the Parliament by enacting law or amendment and not by Scrutiny Committee. Also, it is well settled by the judgments of the Supreme Court that the entries in the Presidential Order cannot be added to by synonym,” the HC had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rana-had-produced-over-100-yr-old-documents/articleshow/83763491.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Executives share cars with colleagues to help them tide over transport crisis||KOLKATA: For years, Prithwiraj Basak has been driving his car from his residence at Belgachhia to his New Town office every day. When offices reopened on June 16, the IT executive was approached by two of his colleagues, Puneet Jhawar, an MIS executive, and Bappaditya Roychowdhury, a marketing manager, in his organisation, with a request that they share a ride in his vehicle since they live on the route that Basak takes to reach office. He readily agreed. Now the three are travelling together every day to and from work. Jhawar also owns a car and once in a while he drives from his residence on Jessore Road to pick Basak from Belgachhia and then Roychowdhury from Lake Town. This is being repeated in many offices across the city since officegoers are finding it difficult to get public transport and it is not possible to spend on app cabs every day. People with cars are helping to ferry two to three colleagues daily. Those hitching a ride are trying to return the obligation by offering to fill fuel, which is being politely refused by most car owners who say that they were hardly making a detour for their colleagues. They say that the journey becomes more enjoyable with colleagues. Take the case of Sutirtha Bhattacharya, business head of an outdoor publicity company, who drives from Picnic Garden to Esplanade. He picks up his colleague Asit Roy on the way. “He lives on the way and I am so happy to drive him to work and drop him back at home. This virus has taught us all a very important lesson in togetherness,” Bhattacharya said. Neha Sharma, head of marketing in an advertising company, lives in Dum Dum and goes to her workplace at Kasba in a chauffeur-driven car. All these years, she would travel alone but when her office reopened she got a request from Amlan Mukhopadhyay, a colleague in the finance department who lives in Keshtopur, for a ride in her car. “He walks for 15 minutes to reach Dum Dum Park and waits for my car to arrive. Then we share the ride together. It is convenient for both of us and we come all the way chatting,” Sharma said. Colleagues say that slight adjustments in timings are having to be made to accommodate others but that is no trouble in this Covid situation. Most offices have also relaxed timings a bit and work can be carried home. “I hitch a ride with an IT and an MIS executive, whose timings and work commitments are different from mine since I am a marketing manager. They both have cars and share the load but never forget to pick me up. How grateful I am to have such colleagues,” said Bappaditya Roychowdhury, who lives in Lake Town and shifted here from Raipur with his family when he got transferred to this city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/execs-share-cars-with-colleagues-to-help-them-tide-over-transport-crisis/articleshow/83759039.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

After receiving the report, meanwhile, police have added section 376AB (rape on woman under 12 years of age) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act to the FIR. SSP Vijay Dhull told TOI, “The autopsy report ascertains asphyxia as a result of antemortem strangulation as the reason of her death.” “The doctors also found injuries around her private parts, which indicate that the accused had made sexually assault bid on the girl and failing which, he killed her to conceal his identity. We have added relevant sections (rape and Pocso Act) to the existing FIR. We have, meanwhile, detained a few suspects for questioning and deployed multiple teams in the area. Besides, police are also scanning the crime history of suspected villagers for a clue. A breakthrough is highly likely,” added the SSP. The girl — her father was a contractual farm labourer in Punjab and had returned home on Monday — had gone missing while on her way home after grazing goats on Sunday afternoon and her body was recovered from a sugarcane field late in the night, said police. Her trousers were removed and used to strangle her, said police, who had initially registered an FIR for the murder despite the victim’s kin insisted that she was sexually assaulted. Later, the autopsy — conducted by a panel of three doctors, including a woman doctor — confirmed a failed sexual assault bid on the girl by the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/missing-girl-8-killed-after-failed-rape-bid-confirms-postmortem/articleshow/83754535.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Workers in small eateries, daily wage workers, autorickshaw drivers and other blue collar workers in the Koregaon Park ward are being vaccinated by local corporator Umesh Gaikwad. “Many restaurants and bars in the area have made arrangements for their staff to get vaccinated, but employees in smaller businesses have been left to fend for themselves. Some of them are uneducated and intimidated by the process of registering for a slot and filling the forms. So we have arranged vaccination drives for them,” he said. In Vimannagar, resident Shagufta Khalil Nathani said, “I work with another volunteer who is an autorickshaw driver. He provides free pick-up and drop facility to the benefaciaries and also helps them fill the forms at the vaccination centre. We have also partnered with an NGO that helps us book the slots and take help of some corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. I get 40 calls on a daily basis from such blue collar workers who want to get vaccinated,” said Nathani. Local corporator Nanda Lonkar has also organised similar drives for blue collar workers in the NIBM Road area. “We get 100 doses daily out of which 20% are reserved for domestic helps, drivers, construction workers and so on. I have tied up with three hospitals in the area where we send them to get free vaccination. Till now we have vaccinated around 250-300 such workers and the drive is still continuing,” she said. Yogesh Sasane, corporator of Hadapsar, said, “We are taking efforts to ensure that all get vaccinated at the earliest. We are also working towards demystifying the vaccine and removing prejudice due to which uneducated residents in the area do not want to take it. I have written a letter to the municipal commissioner asking for some help in organizing drives for such workers and their families.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/free-vaccination-drives-arranged-for-blue-collar-workers/articleshow/83761096.cms||---

Although law mandates the victims of child marriages to be produced before the CWC to take appropriate decision to ensure the safety of the children, it is not being followed by the agencies involved in stopping such marriages. Police, Childline, district child protection unit and social welfare department play a major role inprevention and stoppage of child marriages. The children are often sent along with their parents after getting a written undertaking stating that they would not arrange their marriage until they turn legal age. The children do not get a chance to make informed decisions due to pressure from parents, say child rights activists.

But, head constable, V Murugan, 44, has been distributing free food parcels of variety rice and water bottles to people with learning difficulties in Rameswaram. Murugan from Dhanushkodi police station distributed free food parcels to 35 people with learning disabilities for 28 days from May 24. “Sadhus and elderly people approached us. But, they would be able to get food from someone else so we refuse them. Things were really different for people with learning difficulties,” he told TOI. Murugan spent total close to Rs 40,000 with little more than Rs 1,400 a day for his act of charity. He and his friends Pon Sathya, 29, a photographer and Sulthan Bhai, 29, travelled 35 to 40km a day on a bike to feed these people. Murugan, who joined the uniformed service in 1999, is from a financially weaker family that struggled to raise him and his two sisters. He recalled help from various communities during his early days in a village near Sayalkudi. “It is time to give back to the society by helping those in need,” he said. Before stepping out of the house for duty, Murugan provides the vegetables and supplies needed to prepare food for the day. His wife Parvathi, 40, and daughter Darshini Sri, 16, begin preparation around 9.30am at their police quarter in Rameswaram and keep the food packets ready in silver foils by 11am. Murugan and his friends begin the distribution around 12pm. “They cannot be found at one place and are scattered at Thittakudi, Melavasal, Railway station, Vercode and New Road (to Dhanushkodi). We can find one or two people with learning difficulties every 1-2km,” said Sathya. They served lemon rice, tamarind rice, tomato rice and curd rice in turns to the beneficiaries. “One Sunday a friend gave 5kg of chicken and we served chicken biryani,” Murugan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hope-for-35-people-with-learning-difficulties-comes-from-a-cop/articleshow/83761077.cms||M K Ananth

The area is located close to the Periyar Bus Terminal and an important trading hub known for footwear shops. It is also known as Chappal Bazaar. The traders said that the paver block roads were damaged when they were dug up for laying drinking water pipelines a few months ago. Although the work was completed in a few days time, the civic body did not undertake work to repair the damaged parts. The roads in the locality are already narrow. With one side of the road damaged due to the pipeline works, the roads have further contracted, leaving less space for pedestrian and vehicular movement, said a trader. E Liaquat Ali, secretary of Chappal Bazaar Association said that the movement is severely hit whenever there is rain as the road turns slushy. The damaged roads in Chunnambu Street and Katrapalayam areas should be converted into bitumen roads. He said that sewage water overflowing on the roads is also another issued faced by them for long. The root cause of the issue should be found out and officials should come up with a permanent solution. Members of the association said that they have petitioned the finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan highlighting the plight and are hopeful of a permanent solution to the problems. B Anjugam, a pedestrian said that walking through the streets is turning unsafe as the stretches are too narrow. Two-wheelers are parked on one side of the already narrow streets, leaving only a small space,which is enough only for a bike to move freely. “We are suffering due to lack of space. The damaged roads should be repaired to ensure safe passage for pedestrians,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/repair-damaged-roads-in-chappal-bazaar-traders/articleshow/83761121.cms||---

They submitted a petition to the Madurai district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar. President of the Madurai urban district goldsmith workers’ association, A Alagesan, said that there are about 2,000 members in their association in Madurai alone and most of them were working in small 10-feet by 10-feet or slightly bigger shops with about two to three workers. Most of the workers are from traditional goldsmith families, who now work for minimal wages and they make only about Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 per month. Alagesan said that these goldsmiths, who earlier supplied goods to jewellery shops, no longer do so now as big showrooms have employed workers from north India or have been purchasing the jewels from other parts of the country. These workers said that the two installments of Rs 2,000 given for their ration cards have only helped them pay the rent for their workshops in the last two months. S Pandi, a goldsmith, said that it is during the wedding season that they get some money as they make small jewellery for gifts. “Now that has also gone for the past two years,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/allow-us-to-open-shops-goldsmiths/articleshow/83761147.cms||---

The Opposition alleged that the government was avoiding facing it, and threatened to come out on the streets. The state business advisory committee on Tuesday decided to curtail the session. This will be the third session, after the winter and last monsoon held only for two days, while the last budget session was curtailed to 10 days. Minister for parliamentary affairs Anil Parab said after the meeting, “We have decided to hold a session for two days as Covid-19 is not over yet. We are receiving information about a new strain found. We want to ensure it should not spread.” Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis alleged that the government claimed Covid cases were increasing whenever the state legislature session was to be held.

It is said to be the first of its kind centre in the country. The six- storey and 250-bedded centre was to come up on a budget of Rs 469 crore, but authorities have asked that it be scaled down. “We are now waiting for the ministry to approve the budget after it has been revised and some posts have been downsized,” said a faculty. Presently, there are no dedicated beds for the elderly, who have to wait along with younger patients for their turn. For affordable and holistic care, the centre will offer all services, including operation theatres, ICUs and diagnostics for OPD and admissions to the elderly population. The Union cabinet approved the centre in 2019. The geriatric care is presently scattered in different wings, wards and corridors. The centre will consolidate all these under one roof and enhance care. Besides OPD and in-patient department, the centre shall have MRI, CT scan, operation theatres and other infrastructure only for the elderly. India has just three colleges which train geriatrists. These include Amrita School of Medicine, Kochi, Christian Medical College, Vellore and Madras Medical College, Chennai. The centre shall also have research and teaching facilities that will offer MD/DM (postgraduate) courses in geriatric medicine. PGI will be the only public sector hospital to have a larger centre for the elderly. The centre is expected to be operational by mid-2023. The elderly population in the country has increased from 77 million in 2001 to 144 million in 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-earmarks-space-for-geriatric-care-rehab-centre/articleshow/83759113.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||People can stoop so low to play with vaccine beyond imagination: Bombay high court||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday expressed “serious concerns” over recent cases of fake vaccination drives in the western suburbs. It directed the state government and the BMC to formulate a policy to ensure strict monitoring and checks on vaccination camps by housing or other societies to prevent any repeat of what occurred at a Kandivli housing society. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said, “People can stoop so low is beyond our imagination and that they will play even with vaccine. There must be some control of the government to ensure what has been injected is the vaccine and not plain water or a spurious vial. Imagine the plight of a person who is not vaccinated with the original vaccine. What could be the state of his/her mind?” “How did it happen?” HC asked the BMC. It was hearing a PIL filed by Siddharth Chandrashekhar seeking the court’s intervention over the issues faced by citizens in booking vaccination slots on the CoWin portal. His advocate, Anita Castellino, cited media reports on fake Covid vaccination drives in Kandivli, Versova and Khar and said urgent intervention is needed. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted the police had begun the probe and agreed with the HC that “it ought to have never happened” and that a preventive mechamism is needed. The HC said, “Do you have a health official for each ward? He can also monitor and do checks.” The court said the issue was indeed serious wherein some fraudsters had played with the lives of people to make money and asked the government to submit progress reports of the investigations conducted into such incidents and asked it to unearth the racket and find the kingpin indulging in a “novel way” of defrauding people amid the pandemic. “In these kinds of matters of fraud in vaccination, the state should be very much serious and should not delay the investigation. Let the BMC and the state government form a policy on an SOS basis so that no innocent persons suffer. The most unfortunate part is even in current times when the entire humanity is suffering, some people are committing fraud. It is unimaginable. It is indeed a serious issue to play with the lives of people,’’ said the HC. The court also asked the state government and the BMC to inform whether a system can be put in place through state health officials or ward health officers in the city to keep track of the vaccines being released to organisers of camps at schools, residential societies and other places. The court also sought a progress report of the investigations by the next hearing on June 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-people-can-stoop-so-low-to-play-with-vax-beyond-imagination/articleshow/83761225.cms||---

The murdered man has been identified as Sri Saravanan of Kalainagar in Nagercoil. Saravanan, who had joined the police force, was removed from service in May 2019 as he was highly irregular to work. He resided in Nagercoil with his wife Sujatha, 32, and children Sri Vel, 13, and Srisha, 11. Ranjith Kumar, who is a history-sheeter with many cases against him, teased Sujatha six months ago. This infuriated Sri Saravanan. He warned Kumar and the two had not been in good terms since then. The two men had an argument on Monday and attacked each other. Saravanan, who suffered injuries, lodged a police complaint against Kumar. The accused grew furious and attacked Saravanan with a machete when the latter was returning home from police station. Saravanan suffered injuries on his neck, chest and hands and died on the way to Kanyakumari Government Medical College Hospital. The Kottar police registered a murder case and arrested Ranjith Kumar on Monday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ex-cop-murdered-for-lodging-police-complaint/articleshow/83761216.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madurai flower market deserted with no buyers||MADURAI: The Madurai central flower market has been looking lifeless even after it started functioning with lockdown being relaxed as temples continue to remain closed and big functions are not permitted to be conducted. As the market usually deals with flowers that are available in the region, the supply is high. The market has been functioning for the past few weeks following the Covid-19 prevention norms. As it is the jasmine season, the flowers have been arriving in tonnes from the farms in Madurai district, where they are cultivated on thousands of acres — in Thirumangalam, Usilampatti and few other blocks. However, the drop in prices has discouraged the farmers. On Tuesday, a kg of jasmine was being sold for Rs 300, while the other flowers like arali and sampangi, which are used for garlands, were being sold for Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg. The market had a supply of five tonnes of jasmine on Tuesday alone. It was double the amount of the markets operating in full capacity, said S Balamurugan, a trader. Coordinator of the Madurai flower markets’ associations, Pookadai S Ramachandran said that only the reopening of temples would bring respite to the farmers and traders as otherwise coloured flowers used in garlands find no takers. “We are hoping the temples open soon or that the government allows them to be open for devotees with restricted timings,” he said. Ramachandran said that since the lockdown has been in effect for more than a year now, the flower farmers are contemplating migrating to vegetables and paddy. Even now, many of them had to leave flowers unplucked as the low prices had hit them hard, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-flower-market-deserted-with-no-buyers/articleshow/83761192.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid cloud over Puja in Kolkata, Kumartuli banks on overseas idol orders||KOLKATA: With doctors ringing alarm bells over an “inevitable” Covid-19 third wave, majority of artisans in Kumartuli are staring at a bleak future with some organisers either holding back or cancelling pre-booked orders. But, a small section of artisans is trying to make the most of the government relaxations and dip in Covid cases in the US and European nations by starting to ship idols to abroad from this month. “I have already shipped 12 fibreglass idols to USA, Canada, Australia, Germany and Italy. Five more are ready to be shipped to USA, Australia and South Africa. The situation is bad here but it has certainly improved abroad. This has resulted in an increase in orders compared to what it was last year,” said Kaushik Ghosh, who has been shipping Durga idols abroad from the lanes of Kumartuli for the last 16 years. A six-ft fiberglass idol, along with its wooden packing case and accompaniments, weighs anything between 200kg-250kg and is easily transportable. Each idol is now being sanitised, wrapped carefully in bubble sheets and packed in the wooden crates before the courier agency drills holes in them and fumigates the entire consignment ahead of delivery. Artisans say, in other years, fiberglass idols begin their overseas journey during April-May season but this year, with no work in hand, many have readying the overseas consignments in advance and most of them have already been shipped as well. “I have already shipped my consignments to Germany. I also have an idol that was to be sent to Tokyo in Japan but the organisers have put it on hold for sometime as they wait to get the nod from the local authorities,” said Basudeb Pal. However, majority of artisans still rue the fact that very few orders for idols have been placed this year even as the puja is barely 110 days away. “I have already shipped idols to Japan and USA but the extra amount I had to spend on sanitisation and packaging has left me with very little profit. Unless we get local orders, we will never be able to sustain our livelihood in this profession,” said artisan Subol Pal. At the start of the year, Kumartuli artisans were eyeing for a turnaround, banking on a steady stream of order for Saraswati Puja. But the second wave has hit them harder and fear of an impending third wave has left them more anxious with a large number of organisers cancelling pre-booked orders. “Last year, business was bad. But this year, the situation seems worse. Last year, the organisers had still ordered for smaller idols but this year, pre-booked orders are being cancelled and there have been very few fresh orders. Artisans are in fact calling up organisers, for whom they have been making idols for years, but everyone is keeping the orders on hold,” said Babu Pal, secretary of Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskriti Samity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-cloud-over-puja-kumartuli-banks-on-overseas-idol-orders/articleshow/83759112.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Pune||Remdesivir demand down by 85% in India: Druggists’ body||PUNE: The demand for antiviral Remdesivir, widely used and sold for over 10 times its listed price in the black market in April, has reported a significant drop in sales across the country. The All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists Association (AIOCDA), as well as manufacturers, have reported about an 85% drop in sales mainly after the second wave of Covid-19 started receding in most states from early May. “Across the country, data shows about 85% drop in sales during the last 15 days,” said Jagannath Shinde, president, AlOCDA — an association of nationwide network of drug retailers and wholesalers. The Chemists’ Association of Pune district said the drop had been 90% in the local market. Remdesivir became a popular name during the harrowing second wave that hit India in April. The anti-viral injection that sent people scouting for it was recently included in the Oxford dictionary following its extensive demand. “According to the industry trade report, over 85 lakh vials of Remdesivir are currently stockpiled with 16 manufacturers. There is a looming fear that substantial number of these vials will cross their expiry date as the demand has significantly gone down across the country,” Shinde said. The drug production was ramped up 10 times from 33,000 vials per day to 3.5 lakh vials per day between April 11 and May 29. To meet the domestic requirement, the export of Remdesivir was also prohibited on April 11. From the third week of April, the Centre started allocating Remdesivir to states. “According to the latest figures, the per day manufacturing of Remdesivir has gone up to 6 lakh vials in India. Instead of 20 plants, now 60 plants (including third party production) are producing Remdesivir and all of this has contributed to the surplus production of the drug,” Shinde said, adding that every licensed Remdesivir manufacturer in India had four-five production plants. Manufacturers are relying heavily on the Centre’s decision to create a stock of 50 lakh vials of Remdesivir for an emergency. “The country will have an ample stock of Remdesivir if at all the third wave strikes in near future,” said an official of Cipla — one of the major manufacturers of the drug Sushil Shah, the president of the Chemists’ Association of Pune district, said, “There is a 90% drop in the demand for Remdesivir in Pune district. The vials are available, but the demand has reduced drastically following the steep drop in cases.” Medical experts that TOI spoke to made it clear that the drug had not fallen out of favour. “We still use it in Covid patients with early hypoxia. The drastic drop in demand mainly stems from the steep decline in cases,” said critical care expert Subhal Dixit, former national president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine — a pan-India body of intensivists. The overall Covid-19 situation of the country has subsided for more than a month now in most states. From 4.14 lakh cases in a day during the second wave, the daily infections came down to just 50,000 on Monday. Compared to some of the other worst-hit countries, India’s numbers are still high. States like Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu continue to report between 8,000 and 10,000 cases. This is more than the cases being reported from countries such as the US, UK, France and Germany.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/85-drop-in-remdesivir-demand-across-the-country-druggists-association/articleshow/83761222.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Free vaccination for 18-plus group to resume today across PMR||PUNE: Free vaccination for beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group will resume from Wednesday across the Pune Metropolitan Region, excluding the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits, a day after it was restarted in the Pune rural belt on Tuesday. According to the district health office authorities, over 200 vaccination sites will remain open. They stated that 70% of the beneficiaries would be given the vaccine after prior registration on Cowin. The rest 30% would be walk-ins. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) stated that it would conduct the Covishield vaccination drive in 178 vaccination centres across the civic limits. Apart from the 18-44 age group vaccination drive, the PMC would continue with the first and second dose vaccination of the 45-plus age group as well in the civic-run vaccination sites. Covaxin would be administered only to those due for their second dose, it added. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has decided to halt the vaccination drive every Wednesday henceforth and continue the drive on Sunday. According to the municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil, many more citizens are at home on Sunday and so higher vaccination numbers can be achieved. Abhay Tidke, additional district health officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, told TOI that they continued with the 18-44 age group’s vaccination drive on Tuesday, according to the instructions from the state government. The drive would be continued on Wednesday as well with over 100 sites conducting the programme, he said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We are likely to get fresh stock of Covishield and Covaxin doses from the Centre on Wednesday. We are now focussing on rapid vaccination and allotting the doses based on the performance of the unit. So far, Pune rural is getting the highest doses, but if the PMC or the PCMC increases their speed, we would allot them a higher share of doses.” On Tuesday’s vaccination drive, Deshmukh said the Pune district vaccinated around 69,273 beneficiaries. But the number might have combined the figures from Monday as well because of late data entry on the Cowin dashboard, Deshmukh said. The final report from the district health office was awaited at the time of filing this report. But regardless, he said, the district’s vaccination speed would continue to rise.

Much to the relief of the people, the public works department (PWD), which undertook the repair work, managed to complete it just before the onset of the monsoon. This road was rendered unusable during the heavy rain last year as chunks of it had eroded and were washed away. Even the sole KTC bus operating in the village was unable to ferry people to and fro. As a result, villagers of Saljini were disconnected, even with the other wards in the panchayat. However, now that the repair work is completed, the question most villagers are asking is why it took the state so long to respond, this despite representations made to authorities concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/road-to-saljini-opens-after-repairs-completed/articleshow/83761228.cms||---

According to the members, this is essential for those who actively work in organising Durga Puja every year for their respective clubs or committees. The day-long vaccination drive at a hall in south Kolkata was organised by the forum in association with the Government of West Bengal. “We could vaccinate only a handful of people but it is a good start. We intend to vaccinate more in the coming weeks. There might be some vaccination camps in the districts too for our member committees,” said Saswata Basu, secretary of the forum. “We had requested the government and they helped us in organising the camp.” According to Basu, there is still no clarity on organising the puja this year but it’s essential to start vaccinating those who are on the frontline. “The devastation done by the second wave has made the scale and form of festival a bit uncertain this year. We have not had any time to think on how to go about it. But it is important that the committee members are vaccinated before any decision is taken,” said Basu. The forum and its member committees are also working during the second wave, from creating awareness in the community markets and sanitising public spaces to providing oxygen and other assistance in their respective neighbourhoods. “Many members have been working on the frontline with Covid patients. It is important that they are vaccinated so that they can continue to serve others,” said Tushar Saha, assistant secretary of the forum for east Kolkata, Dum Dum and Salt Lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/durga-puja-forum-vaccinates-550-members/articleshow/83759152.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The corporation was earlier issuing handwritten certificates. The change in stance came on June 21 after three students from Ahmedabad planning to travel to Canada and US for further studies made representations before AMC to issue QR code certificate as handwritten certificates were not acceptable internationally. Harbhajankaur Sandhu from LJ Institute of Engineering, Tirth Kapadia from Ahmedabad University and Dhirenkumar Prajapati from Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), all residents of Ahmedabad, are looking to travel to US and Canada for further studies. They raised the issue of ‘handwritten’ certificates with AMC health officer (West Zone) Daxaben Maitrak on June 21 and the issue was resolved quickly after a few hours of discussion. For students travelling abroad and who have taken first dose of Covishield vaccine, the corporation administers the second dose under special cases despite the 84-day wait period not being complete. After giving the second dose, the corporation issues a certificate based on which the students can avail travel permissions. These certificates are issued to travellers who have taken the second jab of Covishield after 28 days of first dose. “Handwritten certificates are not acceptable in countries like Canada and the USA. They can easily deport us from their country or ask us to get quarantined if we could not generate digital proof of being fully vaccinated," said Kaur, who has enrolled for higher studies at a college in Canada. After four hours of meeting, AMC decided to update the CoWin portal and started issuing QR code certificate to foreign travellers. “AMC is first corporation in India which has started facility of issuing digital certificates to students travelling abroad,” said Prajapati who is travelling to Canada in August. The corporation has ensured that the students travelling abroad get their fully vaccinated certificate at the click of the button on the mobile. The students were given handwritten stamped certificates, but this was not valid and accepted by the consulates, said sources in AMC. “We were earlier giving them a handwritten certificate with the Gujarat government logo and duly signed but this was not accepted in some cases. Now we are giving them the certificate with a QR code which is universally accepted,” the official added. “I am travelling to US in August where they ask for digital proof of Covid vaccine certificates. I am so thankful that our combined efforts with AMC solved this issue for me and for many others who are resident of Ahmedabad city,” said Tirth Kapadia, who plans to travel to US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/students-red-flag-vaccine-certificates-written-by-hand/articleshow/83761561.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Pune||Collector lifts control over centralized allocation||Pune: The district collector recently discontinued the central allocation of remdesivir to the hospitals giving Covid-19 treatment in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). The patients’ relatives would now be able to get the drug directly from the hospitals’ pharmacies against medical prescriptions. The drug had come under the district collector’s — Rajesh Deshmukh — control on April 11 after there was severe shortage of it and blackmarketing had skyrocketed its price. “Remdesivir has been made available in the Pune district’s open market from June 19. The drug is mainly available at hospital-attached pharmacies and with licensed retailers and stockists. Patients or their relatives can purchase the drug against medical prescription,” Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drug) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune branch, said. Ample stock of the drug was available in the market and the demand had also dropped to around 90% in Pune district, he said. “Hence, the district collectorate lifted the control on the drug's distribution on June 18. The office can decide to bring the control in force in future if the situation arises,” Pratapwar said. Around 600 hospitals were treating Covid patients in Pune district during the second wave in April-May. The number was 300 in March. The surge in Covid cases had resulted in a sharp rise in the demand for remdesivir. The district’s daily requirement had gone up to 18,000 vials during this period. “At present, the demand has reduced to approximately 500 vials in Pune district, following the steep decline in cases,” Sushil Shah, president of the Chemists’ Association of Pune district, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/collector-lifts-control-over-centralized-allocation/articleshow/83761263.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctor seeks pre-arrest bail in Kandivli’s fake vax drive case||MUMBAI: A doctor accused in the fraudulent vaccination drive at Kandivali's Hiranandani Heritage on Tuesday filed an anticipatory bail plea before Dindoshi sessions court. Dr Manish Tripathi claimed that he had been made a "scapegoat" and that the police were protecting the "rich and influential owner" of a private hospital in Charkop. Meanwhile, BMC officials said they have approached the Borivali police for lodging an FIR in a similar fraudulent vaccination camp conducted at Aditya College earlier this month. Tripathi is the director of KCEP Group that offers training and placements in various industries including healthcare. The police have accused him of sourcing vaccine vials for the bogus camps and roping in students from his institute for administering shots. One of his students, Kareem Ali, has been arrested for transporting the vials. Tripathi said, in his plea, that he had visited the Kandivali police station on June 15, between 8pm and 10.30pm, on being summoned by the cops. He claimed that he was "tortured and assaulted" when he asked an officer to give him a copy of his statement. Tripathi also stated that one of the key accused in the vaccine fraud, Mahendra Singh, had convinced students from KCEP Group to join him and the Charkop hospital in their activities, without any approval of the institute. Tripathi also presented a copy of text messages exchanged between him and one of his students for substantiating his claim that he was opposed to students being recruited before their education was complete. Tripathi claimed in his plea that he was neither aware nor was he physically present during the Hiranandani vaccination camp. "There has been no communication between the complainant (Hiranandani resident who lodged the police complaint) and me. Singh misguided the complainant that I'm associated with the Charkop hospital," Tripathi said in his plea. Giving details of how the CoWin portal works, Tripathi stated that a session has to be created online for vaccination after receiving an OTP and he did not have the authorisation to create such a session, while the Charkop hospital did. He added that the CoWin portal also records the latitude and longitude of the camp and back-dated sessions cannot be created. The BMC had written to Serum Institute of India (SII) last week, sending batch numbers of vaccines that were administered at the fake vaccination camp so that civic officials could find out which hospital provided the vaccines for the camp. “We are yet to hear from SII as they will have to search the entire database. We gave them the batch numbers mentioned in the forged vaccine certificates. Each batch has 1000 vials which is 1 lakh doses. Either the police or the SII have to tell us the details of the source of the vaccines. Unless we know that, we will not be able to say if the vaccines were fake or real,” said Deputy Municipal Commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar. Response from SII is expected in a day or two. "Unless the police find any collusion on the part of Hiranandani Heritage society, we are not planning to take action against them. But if there is any involvement of any society member, we will lodge a complaint against them with the police,” said Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner (Health).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doctor-seeks-pre-arrest-bail-in-kandivlis-fake-vax-drive-case/articleshow/83761287.cms||Nitasha Natu

When their mothers went looking for them, they found them still tied to the tree and unconscious. They informed police but the FIR was registered after pictures of the children were shared on social media. The main accused, Kailash Verma, was arrested and sent to jail on Tuesday. Police said he was inebriated at the time when the children were beaten up. In their complaint, the families of the two boys alleged that they had plucked a few jamun from a tree on a private school campus and were eating them when the school owner, Kailash, 25, happened to catch them. He allegedly went berserk, tied them to the tree and thrashed them even as the minors cried and repeatedly begged for mercy. Pawan’s mother Sarita Devi said some children who had gone to drink water at the school saw Kailash beating up the boys and informed her. She and Dheeraj’s mother rushed to the spot and found the two boys unconscious while Kailash was consuming liquor. “We had a heated argument with Kailash and the police were informed.

---||Madurai||Madurai private schools demand full fee, activists seek action||MADURAI: Schools in Madurai have sent communications to the parents demanding them to pay full fee for this academic year stating that their children will be allowed to attend online classes only after paying the specified amount. The decision by the school managements comes even as the government has mandated them to collect only up to 75% of the total fee as children are learning from through online medium due to the Covid-19 infection.  Activists have demanded that action be taken against such schools. “The school had demanded 100% fee for last academic year, but could not pay the full fee as my livelihood was affected due to the pandemic. The school quietly accepted the fee then. Now, they are asking us to pay the remaining money in order to allow my child to attend online classes, which have already started,” P Selvaraj, a parent from Yagappa Nagar said. S Vel Deva, Madurai district secretary of Students Federation of India said apart from private schools, aided schools are also forcing the parents to pay full fee. Forcing the parents to pay full fee only exposes the greedy face of the schools. “The running cost of the schools have come down by a big margin with the buildings closed. The teachers not even paid half their salaries, but the schools want full fees to be paid in two installments,” he said. Deva said that they gave a petition to the school education minister during his visit to Madurai recently. The school education department will take action if the affected parents file a complaint, he added. Deva said that parents would not come out to lodge a complaint openly fearing the future of their wards. School education department should put forth a mechanism where such complaints are received secretly and disposed of without affecting the children. Members of SFI demanded the district administration to act strictly against at least one or two schools to send a warning to other schools. They said that they are ready to come out with a list of erring schools if the district administration and the education department are ready to take action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pvt-schools-demand-full-fee-activists-seek-action/articleshow/83761248.cms||V Devanathan

As many as 76 special camps were conducted at various parts of Madurai district on Tuesday targeting more than 12,900 people. On Monday, the deputy director of health services, Dr K V Arjun Kumar, inspected the vaccination camp conducted at Boothakudi village under the Kulamangalam PHC, where 650 beneficiaries, including lactating mothers, their spouses, people above the age of 45 and people with disabilities took the vaccines. Fever camps were also conducted simultaneously in the village as the department aims at bringing down the Covid-19 cases in the district to zero. More than 100 people were screened at the camp. As many as 225 people were vaccinated at the camps conducted at Chekkanoorani and T Pudupatti on Tuesday, and 100 people were screened at the fever camps. As the district received large doses of vaccines, camps were conducted in 76 places, including Usilampatti, Kallikudi, Kallupatti, Chekkanoorani, Ezhumalai, Chellampatti, Thottappanaickanur, Alanganallur, Katchaikatti, Karungalakudi, Valayankulam, Kallanthiri, Melur and Thirumangalam in the rural areas. The camps were also conducted at the urban PHCs. Meanwhile, though the urban areas continue to have more than 50 of these special camps in their limits, the long queues that were seen a few weeks ago, were not seen on Tuesday. Many workplaces started functioning after easing of lockdown was stated to be a reason. It was predominantly women who had come to take the vaccines. S Kalavathy, a resident of K K Nagar, said that her husband started going to work, and though they had tried to take a vaccine last week they could not get a slot. Now, she alone could get the vaccine on Tuesday. “We will have to try again on the weekend for him,” she said.

Residents complained that they have been subjected to intermittent power cuts ranging from two hours to four hours daily for the past 72 hours. Nevertheless, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has been boasting of installing new power grids in Dhakoli and Bhabat. Intermittent power cuts have kept residents awake at night for the past 72 hours in many parts of Lohgarh, Dhakoli, Ghazipur, Baltana, Bhabat, VIP road and Chhat village. Raj Rani of Lohgarh said, “We have been sustaining power cuts ranging between two hours to four hours daily for the past three days. With power cuts, water supply also stops. We are having sleepless nights and Powercom officials have no reason to give.” Charanjit Singh, a resident of Dhakoli said, “It felt like electricity was playing hide and seek with us. Power supply snaps five to six times at night every day. Then we do not get water supply also. Today, we had no water in the morning to even take a bath.” Similar reports were received from other parts of Zirakpur. Jasdev Singh, a resident of Ghazipur said, “It was like sleeping for 30 minutes, then waking up due to power failure for one hour, then again sleeping for 30 minutes and again waking up. No reason was given.” Residents criticised the Zirakpur power department for failing to foresee the annual problem and prevent it. Powercom officials attributed intermittent power cuts to frequent tripping of power grids or burning of fuses at transformers due to overloading. PSPCL linemen were out on the roads all night, repairing faults wherever and whenever they occurred, they said. PSPCL executive engineer (Xen) Khushinder Singh did not respond to calls. Linemen ill-equipped Residents said that the linemen who came at night were ill-equipped to carry out repair work. First they went to find one ladder and then they waited till morning to get new overhead power cable to replace the cable which was burnt, they claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-outages-cause-restless-nights-in-zirakpur/articleshow/83759202.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

It turned out to be a hoax. The accused Shailesh Shinde, who runs a hotel in Pune’s Ghorpadi area, told the police that he was upset that his twin sons did not get admission in class X. TimesViewThis man was obviously disturbed when he made the hoax call and should be sent for counselling. But the laws are stringent, and the police cannot take such threats, albeit fake, lightly. They have applied non-bailable sections of the IPC which carry imprisonment of 7 years if convicted. There should be zero tolerance for hoax calls.The incident comes 22 days after Nagpur resident Sagar Mandhare was booked for a bomb hoax call at Mantralaya. After receiving the threat email on Monday, Mantralaya officials alerted Marine Drive police. Teams of bomb detection and disposal squad, dog squad and quick response team commandos searched the premises, but found nothing. By then, the police traced the internet protocol address of the email to Shinde’s phone and got his Pune address. Mumbai Police informed their counterparts in Mundhwa who detained Shinde on Monday night. He was brought to Mumbai and arrested. Shinde told the police that after his twin sons failed in class IX last year, he filed an application seeking an inquiry into their results. They were failed by the inquiry team too. Shinde said he has been trying to get his sons admitted to class X and wrote several emails to the education department complaining about the school, but in vain. Shinde was booked under IPC sections 506(ii) (criminal intimidation), 501 (1) (b) (whoever makes, publishes or circulates statement, rumour or report which is likely to cause, fear or alarm...whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against public tranquility), and 182 (false information, with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pune-hotelier-sends-bomb-hoax-email-to-mantralaya-held/articleshow/83761375.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami, COO & CFO named in 3rd TRP chargesheet||MUMBAI: The city crime branch probing the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation scam has named Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami, four employees of the channel and two others in its second supplementary chargesheet submitted in the 37th metropolitan magistrate court on Tuesday. The police have named COO of ARG Outlier (that runs Republic TV), Priya Mukherjee, chief financial officer, Shiva Sundaram, and two other officials, Shivendra Mundherkar and Ranjit Walter, along with two directors of Maha Movies, Amit Dave and Sanjay Verma, in the chargesheet. The police said their investigation has shown that TRPs were manipulated in three ways. “Inducing panel homes where bar-o-meters are installed by the way of paying money to watch certain TV Channels for a specific time. Dual LCN - Placing one TV Channel on two different frequencies by the Multi System Operators/Cable Operators for one TV channel and by Manipulating TV Channel viewership data (Metarule) received at BARC.” Further they conspired with the arrested BARC officials to rig the TRPs of their channel,” the crime branch press release stated. While the first chargsheet had mentioned 15 accused, the second supplementary chargesheet, over 1,912 pages long, has enlisted seven more persons as accused. This case was probed by the crime intelligence unit (CIU) headed by assistant police inspector Sachin Waze and Riyazuddin Kazi, both arrested in the planting of gelatin sticks in a vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the subsequent murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran. The case was registered on October 6 last year after the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) lodged a complaint that certain TV channels were rigging TRPs through illegal means. BARC has installed 2,000 barometers in Mumbai to monitor TRPs, which are strictly confidential. BARC, which releases weekly rating points for TV channels in India, had given the contract to Hansa Research, which filed the complaint against some former employees who misused the data on households where TRP monitoring systems are installed. Police during the probe had said that when Goswami launched Republic TV in 2017, he sought former BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta’s help in manipulating TRPs to take the channel to the No. 1 slot. Both have known each other since 2013. Police said they had also stumbled upon certain email exchanges and WhatsApp chats between Dasgupta and Republic channel’s chief operating officer (COO), Romit Ramgarhia, discussing TRP manipulation. There are also WhatsApp chats between Goswami and Dasgupta discussing TRP manipulation, police had said. The crime branch had arrested 15 people, including employees of Hansa, Republic TV, Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema, News Nation, Maha Movies and Wow music channels for inflating viewership figures, a key parameter that media buying houses consider while placing advertisements. The channels are accused of paying money to households (in those houses where barometers are installed) for keeping channels on. Officials said the arrests of Waze and Kazi have not impacted the investigation. The case was subsequently probed by assistant commissioner of police Shashank Sandbhor. Earlier, police had claimed TRP manipulation has caused huge losses to the industry and there was a possibility of involvement of advertisers and investors in the scam. However, the chargesheet has not mentioned these aspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/republics-goswami-coo-cfo-named-in-3rd-trp-chargesheet/articleshow/83763696.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Charging stations key to electric vehicles push’||AHMEDABAD: The FAME2 portal on electric vehicles in India indicates the presence of 1,319 e-vehicles in Gujarat of the total 77,511 in India. Out of the total, the share of two-wheelers and three-wheelers was very high. As the state unveiled the electric vehicle policy on Tuesday, experts pointed to charging stations as a crucial part of converting commuters to e-mobility. According to the state policy, the FAME — Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India — scheme had approved 278 charging stations for Gujarat. That’s among the highest in the country according to the electric vehicle (EV) sector experts. The CM, moreover, announced an increase of 250 more stations and a capital subsidy of 25% up to Rs 10 lakh for setting them up. Charu Lata, lead consultant (electric mobility and clean energy access) of Delhi-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), welcomed the policy. “The policy has taken into consideration all three factors —demand, supply and manufacturing — and has incentivized them,” she said. “Gujarat has a unique opportunity to leverage renewable energy for EVs. Compared to a few other states, Gujarat has the capacity to make EVs truly green by the use of solar and wind power to generate electricity for EVs.” Charu Lata said that people will find EVs viable when they start seeing charging stations around them. “From our experience in Hyderabad, we can say that placing the stations at strategic locations is very important,” she said. “Factors such as concentration of EV owners, comfortable and accessible place for the persons to wait matter a lot.” She went on to say: “Compared to batteries for smaller vehicles, charging of cars and commercial vehicles takes time. But it makes sense to convert commercial vehicles first to recover cost of investment.” Prof Rutul Joshi, a faculty member at Cept University, said the policy is a welcome move. “The need of the hour is to focus on converting more private vehicles into electric vehicles to reduce carbon footprint.” Joshi added: “But we also need to expand public bus fleet. We have recently introduced 650 e-buses. But compared to the population, the number is less.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/charging-stations-key-to-ev-push/articleshow/83761409.cms||Parth Shastri

The family was returning home to Delhi’s Indira Vihar after attending their other daughter’s wedding in Agra. The deceased were identified as Santosh Hans, 57, her son Abhishek, 28, while the injured — Ramesh Hans, 60, and his married daughter Heena Kochar, 26, were admitted to a hospital in Agra in a critical condition. Ramesh Hans is a businessman and runs a retail garment shop in Sant Nagar, in Delhi’s Burari. Heena’s husband Varun Kochar told TOI that his sister-in-law Khushboo’s wedding was held at Radisson Hotel in Agra on June 20 and all of them were returning home after the function. He said, “I left the city with my 6-year-old son two hours before their exit. When I reached home, I was informed about the accident and rushed to Mathura.” “My father-in-law sustained a hip joint fracture. Though my wife recognised me, she did not remember anything about the accident. I am trying to figure out what exactly happened to them,” said Kochar, adding that Khushboo was not informed about the death of her mother and brother as she had just recovered from typhoid. She was told that they met with an accident and are admitted to a hospital. Now, she is on her way to Agra from Jaipur.” Baldeo police station in-charge Narendra Yadav said that it seems that the driver fell asleep and lost control of the vehicle. “After shifting injured persons to the hospital and sending bodies to the postmortem house, we recorded a video of all the jewellery and cash, worth Rs 14 lakh, recovered from the spot. It has been handed over to the family,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mother-son-from-delhi-killed-in-a-road-accident-on-yamuna-expressway-2-others-serious/articleshow/83757062.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Get fresh audits of bldgs done or face 25k fine/mth, says BMC||Mumbai: Close to two weeks after 12 people, including eight children, were killed after an illegal three-storey structure collapsed in Malad’s Malwani locality, the BMC has begun issuing notices to buildings over three decades old located in south and central Mumbai to get fresh structural audits done within 30 days or face a penalty of Rs 25,000 per month.“Every year, we issue notices to buildings that are over 30 years old. If they fail to get the audit done within 30 days of receiving the notice, there is a clause to impose a penalty of Rs 25,000 per month,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner, G-South ward. “Many of these cessed buildings and chawls are regulated by Mhada, so we have asked the authority to get the audits done.” In case of non-payment of fine, the BMC will recover the amount through property tax. The opposition BJP claimed the BMC has “woken up too late”. “It was only after the Malwani building crash that the BMC is now suddenly issuing notices to old buildings. But it can’t evict residents in the middle of the monsoon. Now there will be a tussle between the landlords and tenants on who will carry out the audit. Mhada must get the audit done for cessed buildings regulated by them,” said corporator and BJP leader in the BMC Vinod Mishra. Evicting residents from the over 400 unsafe and dilapidated buildings has become a major challenge for the BMC. The civic body has identified 407 dilapidated buildings and listed them in the C1 category-—it means they are unsafe for occupation and have to be pulled down. While 322 of these ‘dangerous’ structures are privately owned, 59 are BMC-owned and the remaining 26 belong to the state government.As per the civic rules, residents of buildings that are 30 years and above have to get their structural audits done every year through an empanelled structural auditor and submit the report to the BMC. Those buildings that are found to be in the C1 category and can’t be repaired have to be vacated. “However, after receiving notice, many residents move court or appeal before the BMC’s technical advisory committee to get the structural audit reports vetted. On many occasions, the BMC takes an undertaking from residents that they are living in dilapidated buildings at their own risk and cost,” said a civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-get-fresh-audits-of-bldgs-done-or-face-25k-fine/mth-says-bmc/articleshow/83761439.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Goa||Will step up bird diversity conservation: Goa CM||PANAJI: Taking note of a TOI report that the recorded number of bird species in Goa had gone up to 481, constituting 37% of all birds found in India, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said that the government would step up efforts to conserve Goa’s bird diversity. Sawant also said that the state will more proactively promote the state as a destination for birding. “The Goa government is committed to the conservation of unique and rich faunal diversity of Goa. The forest department is taking the required steps for habitat improvement, including protection of snag trees, plantation of fruit-bearing species, etc. For awareness generation, special events like State Bird Festival, bird walks are being organised,” the chief minister said in a post on his official social media account, while sharing TOI report dated June 21 ‘Goa, which has 0.1% of India’s area, has 37% of its listed birds’. Sawant said that popularity of the tate bird festival is on the rise. “And we will attempt to take it to new heights in coming years. 268 local youths have been trained under ABSG Abhiyan to work as nature guides in National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries,” Sawant said in his post. Malabar starling, Chestnut winged cuckoo, Great bittern and White browed fantail are the newest bird presence recorded in Goa, which took the number of birds listed in the state from 477 to 481 this year. The birds found in Goa are now almost 37% of the tally of birds listed across India, though it is the smallest state in terms of geographical area. The recorded bird species in India are between 1,200 and 1,300, of which Goa has nearly 481. Goa’s recorded bird species roughly constitute 5% of the total 10,000 odd bird species listed globally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-will-step-up-bird-diversity-conservation/articleshow/83761411.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court directs state to submit Puppalguda land allotment letter||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday directed the government and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) to furnish the allotment letter given by the state while transferring government land at Puppalguda in Rajendranagar to the HMDA in 2005. Refusing to accept panchanama papers as a sole proof of transfer of land, the court gave six days’ time to furnish the letter. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave this direction while hearing two appeals filed by the HMDA, challenging the survey of its land in survey number 452/1. The land is worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said then government allotted 164 acres in survey number 452/1 to the HMDA in 2004. However, at the instance of some private parties, the high court had ordered a survey of the land, he said. “The survey was done without informing us. Demarcation was also done in such a way that the private parties were eating into HMDA’s areas,” the state counsel said. At this, the bench told the state counsel that panchanama was the final exercise that was done before handing over land to the HMDA. “Prior to that, there would be a formal allotment or notification from the state government conveying its intent to transfer its land to the HMDA. Show us those proceedings,” the bench said. The additional AG said there was a panchanama conducted by the authorities concerned before handing over the land to the HMDA in 2004. Irked by the repeated reliance on the panchanama by the state counsel, the bench asked counsel for HMDA, Y Rama Rao, to furnish some proof. When he said a notification was issued under section 20 of the HMDA Act, the bench directed him to furnish such proof to the court by June 28. The bench also directed the private parties to furnish to the court proof of their purchase from the vendors in 2005 and the rights their vendors had over the land from 1950 onwards. The bench further sought to know from both the HMDA and the private parties the flow of title and the way it came to them. The private parties — Kakatiya Enclaves Private Limited, Kakatiya Landscapes Private Ltd and a few others — claimed an extent of 11 acres in survey number 452/2 as theirs. The state counsel said this was a non-existent survey number. The single judge, in his October 2008 order, however, had recognised the existence of survey No. 452/2 and also the survey on 11 acres done in the presence of an advocate commissioner. The HMDA is now claiming that the private parties have gobbled its land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-court-directs-state-to-submit-puppalguda-land-allotment-letter/articleshow/83759297.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

It took two hours for the forest department officials in coordination with an NGO, Wildlife SOS, to sedate the big cat and take it away. Teenager Sumit Solanki told mediapersons that when he entered his house, he froze on seeing a leopard there. Then, he tried to run away but was attacked. . It took two hours for the forest department officials in coordination with an NGO, Wildlife SOS, to sedate the big cat and take it away.CCTV footage installed in the street outside captured the big cat running out of a house and running helter-skelter in the narrow, crowded streets. The leopard eventually made its way into a fruit storage room and residents managed to lock the animal inside. Someone reported the matter to the forest department and Agra-based NGO, Wildlife SOS. Equipping themselves with safety nets, a trap cage and protective gear to carry out the rescue mission, a nine-member team from Wildlife SOS immediately rushed to the location accompanied by a team of forest officers. Ilayaraja said, “The leopard is 7 or 8 years old. With a huge crowd of over 200 people gathered around, the rescue was extremely challenging.”By the time the rescue team arrived, more than 200 people had gathered outside the store room. The rescuers drilled a hole in the wall to tranquilize the leopard without opening the door and they inserted a camera through the hole to locate it. The forest officers and police personnel implemented crowd control measures while Wildlife SOS veterinary doctor, Dr S Ilayaraja, tranquilized the animal using a sedative dart through the hole. The unconscious leopard was carefully transferred to a transit facility for temporary observation. Ilayaraja said, “The leopard is 7 or 8 years old. With a huge crowd of over 200 people gathered around, the rescue was extremely challenging.” Akhilesh Pande, divisional forest officer, Agra, said, “This is a densely populated area so the leopard sighting caused a panic among the residents. After deploying our team to assess the situation, we contacted the NGO for their assistance in the rescue operation. We were able to provide effective and timely intervention with their help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/leopard-enters-crowded-area-in-agra-injures-teen-rescued/articleshow/83757071.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The diesel generator set distribution board went up in flames and two distribution boxes were gutted. However, a major tragedy was averted. The fire broke out in the distribution boxes on the 11th floor of the B-3 tower at around 10am and which burned for around two hours, said members of Purab Premium Apartment Dwellers Association. “Fire alarm and smoke detectors are fitted but they are dysfunctional. Gmada put lives of residents at risk. Residents used fire extinguishers to douse the fire on their own. Some of the fire extinguishers were also not working properly,” said Parwinder Singh, an area resident. No loss of life or injury was reported. Already under scanner for major anomalies, Purab Premium apartments in Mohali was raided by the vigilance team in December last year. The pet project of Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has received criticism for poor workmanship. A Vigilance team visited Purab Premium Apartments after the residents’ association lodged a complaint with the Punjab chief minister, alleging poor infrastructure of flats by GMADA and use of sub-standard material not matching specifications in the brochure. Members of Purab Premium Apartment Dwellers Association have been fighting for their rights from past several years. Association general secretary Harbhajan Singh said, “The project which was to come up on 117 acres has actually been built on only 37 acres at a prime location, having been sold to a private builder at a hefty price of about Rs 200 crore. GMADA not only failed to complete the project on time but also quality has been compromised." He added that after Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh issued directions to the effect, it was announced that all defects would be removed by end of September 2016, but no action has been taken. In July 2018, a team constituted by General B S Dhaliwal, technical adviser to Punjab chief minister visited Purab Premium apartments. The team was constituted to probe the allegations made by allotees of Purab Premium apartments of poor workmanship in construction of the flats by Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA). Times View Fire alarms that don't work can prove dangerous, especially in a high-rise. In fact, they are meant to give people an early warning so that they can get outside the building on fire quickly. Lot of advance planning and periodic checking of the working condition of firefighting equipment is required as a fire safety measure, which appears to be lacking in this case. It was only the presence of mind of the building’s occupants that kept a bad situation from becoming worse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fire-breaks-out-at-purab-apts-alarms-stay-silent/articleshow/83759333.cms||---

Both jumped off their 12th floor apartment in Chandivali’s Nahar Amrit Shakti complex. Reshma Trenchil (44) is said to have been depressed after the death of her husband, Sarat Mulukutla (49), on May 23. Also, in a suicide note, Trenchil has alleged harassment by her neighbours. “A case of abetment to suicide has been registered against the Khan family who were Trenchil’s neighbours,” said Sakinaka senior inspector Balwant Deshmukh. No arrest had been made till late Tuesday. Police said the Khan family had earlier filed two non-cognizable offences against Trenchil. They had alleged they were getting disturbed due to the noise caused by her son, Garud, while playing in the house. Police had called both families for counselling in early May. The family had moved into the rental apartment at Tulipia building on April 10. Soon after, Trenchil’s husband went to Varanasi to tend to his parents who had tested Covid-positive and later died. However, he too succumbed to the virus. Trenchil had spoken about her loss in a Facebook post on May 30: “I suppose it was inevitable that an almost mythical being like him would meet a heroic if tragic end…Even after contracting Covid, he soldiered on for over a week. He continued the good fight for another three weeks from a hospital bed, struggling to breathe, but determined to return to us in Mumbai. Unfortunately, the evil virus won that particular battle.” Trenchil graduated from the Asian College of Journalism and worked with The Statesman. She later studied at Boston University. Trenchil’s brother will be coming from the US to conduct the last rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-journalist-ends-life-with-son-in-chandivali-neighbours-booked/articleshow/83761481.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Lawyer Bushra Yousif Mayoof filed a petition of appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bahrain against the sentence handed out to Mohammad Khalid (34). The lawyer stepped in after Khalid’s brother Hussain Ahmed, who lives in Hyderabad, made an appeal to external affairs minister S Jaishankar to help his brother. Bushra Al Mayoof Law Office was appointed as official standing counsel for Indian embassy in Bahrain some time back. The lawyer said in the plea that Khalid is the only earning member in his family and a three-year jail term for him would adversely affect his family. It was also pointed out to the court that it was only after he tested Covid-19 negative that Khalid had gone out of his accommodation as he had not eaten food for the entire day. Khalid was staying in an accommodation provided by his company. The lawyer said since he was hungry and no food supply was ensured, Khalid stepped out. A local took a video of Khalid and it became viral prompting the authorities to take immediate action. The electronic wrist band to monitor the movements of Covid-19 positive patients who are supposed to be in quarantine was found on him.

---||Goa||Allow parents to seek verification after Class X result: Goa Board||PANAJI: The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has said that after declaration of the Class X results for the 2021 batch, if any parents ask to verify the marks, the schools should allow the verification. Proper explanation should be provided by the school over the allotment of marks, the Board has said. This year, schools are forming result committees to evaluate students based on their internal assessments, after the Class X public examination was cancelled for 2021 due to the pandemic. The Board has already provided schools with a policy to tabulate Class X marks. On Tuesday, Goa Board provided FAQs to schools to clear any doubts over the marking scheme. “What the schools need to do in case the parents want to view the exam copies or want to verify the marks after the board result declaration? Verification of marks should be allowed and proper explanation should be given by the Head of the committee appointed for the purpose,” the Board has said in the FAQs. Any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allocated will be given an opportunity to appear in the exam to be conducted by Goa Board as and when the conditions are conducive to hold the exams, the Board has stated. “If any candidate has not appeared in any of the assessments conducted by the school, the school may conduct an offline/online or a telephonic one to one assessment and record documentary evidences to certify the recommendations. The student may be assessed objectively on that basis by the school out of maximum marks of each subject,” Goa Board has told schools. The schools will be carrying out the assessments and submitting the marks on Goa Board’s portal. The Board is expected to declare the Class X results by July 13. All teachers appointed to the result committee by the school should necessarily be teachers teaching Class X for the year 2020-21, the Board has clarified. “Can same teacher be co-opted as external member in two different neighbouring schools? No. This may adversely affect the progress of work as well as health of the member. Hence, one member is not allowed in two committees,” Goa Board has told schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/board-allow-parents-to-seek-verification-after-class-x-result/articleshow/83761448.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Day 1: Over 1k patients examined at PGI OPDs||Chandigarh: A total of 1,254 patients were examined in OPDs at PGI on the first day of their resumption on Monday, a mere 13% of the number that used to be seen daily before the pandemic began. As many as 3,743 patients were given online consultation, out of which 1,254 were called for physical evaluation. The patients were allowed only after they showed the SMS sent from PGI for the physical examination. After temperature check, the patients were asked questions regarding Covid symptoms and randomly rapid antigen tests were conducted for OPD entry. All the patients were taken through teleconsultation, although some unaware about the new method had also come. “This is not the usual OPD which was being run by PGI. I came for my follow-up and was not seen” said a patient who had come from Patiala. There is also provision for booking on PGI’s website, where each department has 30 slots. Depending on the availability, pre-registration can be made. While using the tele consultation, one can give a call and the card which is made is directly passed on to the doctor. “If any investigation is required, the caller can inform the same to the numbers provided. There is a call back from the doctor who after speaking with the patient sends a photo of the card with the required investigations. This needs to be shown for the tests to be conducted in the hospital,” said a faculty member. On April 12, the PGI had shut its walk-in OPD services after a spike in Covid cases.

Though renovation of the mosque by the state government was a top priority, the work was stopped due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The government had sanctioned Rs 8 crore for the work. MA Qadeer Siddiqui, superintendent, Mecca Masjid told TOI that there is a lot of work left to be done at the mosque. “Except for a few works, a lot of work has not been carried out yet and the deadline has been extended due to the pandemic,” said Siddiqui. The superintendent further said that lack of manpower and insufficient budget have also caused the delay. “Due to hike in prices of construction materials, contractors are not in a position to take up the work under the previously allocated budget. The issues have been reported to the government and we have urged the government to rope in experts for the renovation,” he said. Meanwhile, locals alleged that the officials are turning a blind eye to the illegal construction activities at the mosque. “Officials have failed to protect monuments in Old City. Their negligence has encouraged some people to carry out illegal constructions. I request the state government to probe the role of officials in the constructions,” said Mohammed Ahmed, TDP GHMC minority cell vice-president. For the past two days, TOI has been trying to get in touch with representatives of the Archaeological Survey of India and GHMC. Several calls made to ASI and GHMC officials, including text messages, went unanswered. “We have been told not to speak to the media on this topic, so I can’t help you,” a GHMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mecca-masjid-facelift-works-in-limbo-officials-worried/articleshow/83759330.cms||Omar bin Taher
---||Goa||CZMP hearings in temporary pandals raises eyebrows||Margao: “Citizens for democracy,” a social group has questioned the motive of the Coastal Zone Management Authority (CZMA) in keeping public hearings under temporarily erected pandals during the peak monsoon period in the region and wondered whether physical access to people would be possible in case of inclement weather. The public hearings are scheduled to be held on July 8 at Panaji and Margao. Speaking for the group, Sidharth Karapurkar of the group said that the state government itself has come out with a circular that all government departments should avoid physical meetings and that even the inauguration of Maina Curtorim police station was done without physical presence of key dignitaries. Referring to reports that have predicted a third wave of Covid-19 to hit Maharashtra state within two weeks followed by Goa, as also “the harrowing experience” people of Goa went through during the second wave, Karapurkar demanded that CZMA desist from rushing through the public hearings “which will be rendered meaningless under threat of these two factors.” Former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes, representing the group, said that public skepticism of the process of hearing was rising. He said that aided by the government, the CZMPs would be rushed through for approvals by bulldozing public sentiment. “This is part of a larger scheme. With Port Authorities Act coming into force, CZMPs were set to become symbols of corporate greed at the expense of the cultural attachment of the Goan people to their land and rivers,” Gomes said, and demanded postponement of the hearings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/czmp-hearings-in-temporary-pandals-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/83761477.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: White peafowl spotted for first time in Corbett's 85-yr history||DEHRADUN: During a routine patrol near Kothi Rau in the Jhirna range of Corbett Tiger Reserve on Sunday, a group of forest staff thought they saw a bird with brilliant white plumage flash past them. They weren’t sure what they saw. The following day, they went over the camera trap images from the area to find out what had crossed their paths. It was a lone white peafowl, never seen before in the reserve in its 85-year history. “Corbett is home to a range of peafowls, from blue to green. But a white one had never been seen here before. It is the first sighting of the white peafowl here,” said director of the reserve, Rahul, who goes by his first name. The reserve staff will now keep track of the white peafowl. “We have asked frontline staff in the zone to be more vigilant so we can keep an eye on its movement and see if there are any more peafowl,” Rahul added. Recently, Corbett officials spotted an albino sambar deer in the Pakhro zone and an albino catfish in the Jhirna zone. Rahul has asked patrol staff to see if the number of albino birds and animals is on the rise. The white peafowl is not a separate species but a genetic variant of the Indian Blue Peafowl. “The white peafowl has a genetic mutation called leucism, which causes a lack of pigmentation in the plumage. While some peafowls are albino, in this case, we are yet to identify the exact form,” Rahul said. Peafowls with leucism have dark eyes and could, sometimes, have some scattered pigmentation in the plumage, unlike in birds with albinism. Scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, said it was a rare sighting. “I have never seen a white peafowl in the wild. This is the first time,” said R Suresh Kumar, senior scientist at WII and animal ecology expert. He, like Rahul, believed the bird is leucistic. “It is a rare condition … It is not often that it is passed on to younger ones. The white peafowl is just a variant of the peacock we see, but with low pigmentation. The case is just the opposite of the black panther, which is the common leopard with high melanin content.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/white-peafowl-spotted-for-first-time-in-corbetts-85-yr-history/articleshow/83757153.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Hyderabad||Villager from Bhadradri Kothagudem district threatens officials, Telangana high court seeks clarification||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday asked a villager of Bhadradri Kothagudem district to reply to charges that he was intimidating officials after they served a notice to demolish his house. The court gave one week’s time to V Gopal Rao of Chunchupalle’s Vidyanagar Colony. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a writ plea filed by Gopal Rao, who challenged the demolition notice issued by the gram panchayat to pull down his house. Officials said the house was built without the panchayat’s permission. The bench asked Gopal Rao to first clarify on the allegations that he was threatening officials thanks to his ‘connections’ in higher circles and also about going to the extent of manhandling the advocate who argued the case against him. “Give us replies to these allegations first,” the bench told Gopal Rao. “You look powerful. Officials are scared of you. You need to be monitored,” the bench said, in a note of warning to Gopal Rao. The bench posted the case to June 29. Gopal Rao’s counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana, however, said his client applied to the panchayat for permission to raise the house. “Since the permission did not come within the stipulated time, we are eligible to raise the structure under deemed permission provision. When we raised the structure, the panchayat is now threatening us with demolition. A single judge earlier had dismissed our plea. Hence, we are before this court with an appeal,” he said. The bench told Ramana that it’s not as simple as it looked. “The single judge order narrated how this person (Rao) was using his connections to intimidate and transfer officials who were not listening to his diktats. He even went to the extent of ransacking the office of an advocate who was arguing the case against him,” the bench said. It added, “Another counsel who took up the case too wanted to withdraw the case. The single judge did not allow the case to be withdrawn and ordered a probe by the SP, collector and district panchayat officer. All of them have given reports to the court narrating the intimidating ways of Gopal Rao.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/villager-threatens-officials-t-hc-seeks-clarification/articleshow/83759373.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After society calls off redevelopment deal, builder seeks Rs 1,600 crore||MUMBAI: The builder whose agreement was terminated by Worli’s Shiv Shahi housing society for failing to complete the redevelopment project has now sought Rs 1,600 crore from the society. Last month, TOI had reported that the 192 members of Shiv Shahi society decided to appoint Oberoi Realty, after the earlier builder, HBS Realtors, left them high and dry. TimesViewThe builder’s counterclaim of Rs 1,600 crore is odd because society members are largely middle-income people, who are without a house and are struggling to pay rent. Though the arbitration panel will decide on the counterclaim, the case of Shiv Shahi society highlights the perils of redevelopment in Mumbai.HBS Realtors (Wondervalue Realty) said the termination of its development agreement was “illegal” and made a counter claim of Rs 1,600 crore in the ongoing arbitration tribunal case filed by the developer against the society. “The illegal termination of the development agreements by the respondent (society) has resulted in the claimant (developer) not being able to complete the project. If the project had been proceeded with and if the claimant had been permitted to complete the construction as per the development agreements, claimant would have made a profit from the said project. The claimant claims damages by way of loss on future profits in a sum of Rs863 crore,” said Wondervalue Realty’s counterclaim. The society, located on a prime three-acre plot, had signed the agreement with Wondervalue in 2009. The 12 buildings were demolished in 2014. But in 2019, the builder stopped paying their rents--displacement hardship allowance-- (Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 a month), leaving the families in the lurch. Early this year, the society approached Oberoi Realty, which agreed to take over the project. Justifying its counterclaim, Wondervalue said that over the years it had incurred costs of Rs 747 crore on the project and it would lose Rs 863 crore on future profits. Some members blamed the society’s managing committee for “misguiding” them. They alleged the developer’s non-performance was overlooked and he was allowed to raise amounts on the plot without construction of the society tower. Bank guarantees too were not insisted upon by the committee. A committee member refused to comment on the builder’s counterclaim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-soc-calls-off-redevpt-deal-bldr-seeks-rs-1600-crore/articleshow/83761535.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

The SP leaders had allegedly encroached upon a land of Chilasani gram sabha to construct a market complex and a farmhouse. The former MLA had been living in the farmhouse along with his family for the past 20 years. The SP had recently declared Jogendra Yadav’s wife Rekha its candidate for the post of district council president. Additional district magistrate Vivek Mishra said, “After receiving several complaints, an investigation was conducted and it was found that the duo had encroached upon a government land to construct a market complex and a farmhouse. The illegal properties have been demolished and based on an FIR registered, police will take further action.” Terming the demolition “unlawful and politically motivated”, SP district president of advocate wing Akash Yadav said, “The matter is sub judice and the court had ordered a stay on the owners’ plea. We will take legal action against the district administration. SP workers will not bow down to the dictatorship of the state government.” In the past week, police had registered FIRs in four different cases of alleged land grabs and illegal constructions. Meanwhile, targeting the state government and the district administration, Rajya Sabha MP Ramgopal Yadav said, “BJP had managed to win only two of the total 30 seats of the Etah district council. Thus, taking offensive action, the BJP government got the administration to demolish the market of the former MLA and cases were registered against his entire family. Today, his 20-year-old residence was demolished. Besides, we have information that police are going to register a fake rape case against Jogendra.” The senior SP leader also alleged that the state government had planned to get Rekha Yadav’s nomination cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/illegal-properties-of-sp-leaders-demolished-in-etah/articleshow/83757169.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Surge in electric vehicle sales||AHMEDABAD: Electric vehicle registration in the state has already registered an increase of 27% in little less than six months as compared to 2020. According to data available on Parivahan, registration in the state has been increasing since 2017. In the past 5 years, it has risen eight-fold. The state only had 176 electric vehicles in 2017 but the number has increased to 1,423 in 2021. The officials said that the increase is not only in urban areas but even in rurban areas like Bavla. The officials said that in Ahmedabad, till June 21 this year, the city (RTO Ahmedabad and Vastral) registered 398 vehicles compared to total 427 vehicles registered in 12 months of 2020. The Ahmedabad RTO officials said that in July, they expect the number to cross 2020 numbers. “Rise in petrol and diesel prices will definitely improve sales in coming months. However, those purchasing electric vehicles are people who travel within the city or to nearby areas. This is more economical compared to petrol, diesel, or even CNG vehicles,” said a senior RTO officer. He said that the state road transport department began issuing green registration number plates to electric vehicles about two months ago. The officer said that on June 16, the number of electric vehicles was 1,390 which rose to 33 in just five days in the state. Officials said that electric cars on a single charge can last for 300-odd km and the charging time is about 60 minutes. An officer said that for a mid-segment car, the running cost of an electric vehicle comes to Re 1 per km, while it is Rs 9 for petrol, Rs 6 for diesel and Rs 2.5 per km on CNG. The officer said that with increasing fuel price and the running costs even lower than CNG, people are opting for electric vehicles. He addded that so far, registration of electric cars has only been observed in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara and the trend is yet to pick up in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/surge-in-electric-vehicle-sales/articleshow/83761541.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The site is located at Kandur village in Addakal mandal of Mahbubnagar district. Expressing serious concern, archaeologists said a great legacy would be wiped out once and for all if remedial steps are not taken immediately. Known as ‘Rakasigulla Chalka,’ the site has more than 100 megalithic burials. But, only four structures exist now. E Siva Nagi Reddy, archaeologist and consultant on Buddhavanam Project of Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation, said the burials along with funerary (grave) goods dating back to1000 BC are in great danger. Nagi Reddy, who surveyed the Iron Age burials, said the uniqueness of the burials lies in its two circles, a rare phenomenon against the usual practice of erecting such burials in single circles of huge boulders. “They are located in the fields of Sankararaja, a farmer of the village. The burial in its circular form with a distance of five metres consists of 20-25 natural boulders measuring one metre in diameter and with a gap of one metre in between the two circles,” he explained. He said profuse quantity of polished black ware, red ware and black and red ware (pottery) surfaced during the removal of the structures by farmers in the past. While urging the government officials and locals to preserve the Iron Age burials of historical significance, archaeologists said they found potsherds (broken pieces) of the Satavahana period, hero stones (memorial commemorating the honorable death of a hero in battle), Ganesha, Garuda and Mahishasura Mardhini sculptures. “They were found scattered in and around Kandur, which once served as capital of Cholas. They ruled between 1025-1248 AD as subordinates of Chalukyas and Kakatiyas,” an archaeologist said. A sculpture of Chennakesava idol of Kalyani Chalukya period (12th century AD) was unearthed recently. It was lying uncared for on the roadside, he bemoaned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3500-yr-old-iron-age-structures-facing-threat-from-agri-activities/articleshow/83759429.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The bench was hearing petitions filed by Y Kamalamma, Nayini Annavva and scores of people from Vemulaghat and Etigadda Kistapur villages in Siddipet district. Mallannasagar reservoir is part of Kaleshwaram Irrigation Project. The bench questioned the state counsel as to why the officials did not pay the compensation despite conceding before the court that senior citizens were entitled and deserved to be paid. The bench also sought particulars of the rehabilitation and resettlement package along with the details of beneficiaries by June 25. “Your officials are acting in an egotistic manner and are refusing to pay the old their dues,” the bench said. “There are some other cases where stay orders were operating, so there is nothing wrong if you wait for some more days,” the bench told the state counsel. “Your previous counter is vague. And, there is no fresh counter filed in the last one-and-a-half years,” it said. Counsel for the petitioners said the officials agree that they deserved to be paid, but will never pay. The bench directed the Siddipet collector to make payments to all such people immediately and not to dispossess them till they were paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-dispossess-seniors-till-aid-is-paid-high-court/articleshow/83759413.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Probe panel imposes Rs 10k cost on Deshmukh, Singh||Mumbai: The one-man commission headed by retired Justice Kailash Chandiwal has imposed a cost of Rs5,000 each on former home minister Anil Deshmukh and former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh for their failure to appear before it. They have been asked to donate the money to the CM’s Covid relief fund. Meanwhile, dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, who is currently in judicial custody, was produced before the commission. In a letter on March 20, Singh had alleged Deshmukh had asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from hotel and restaurant owners in Mumbai. Singh’s letter bomb rocked political circles, following which Deshmukh stepped down. Deshmukh had urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to institute a probe into the allegations. The state government on March 30 set up a commission headed by Justice Chandiwal, a retired Bombay HC judge. On May 10, the state government granted powers of the court to Justice Chandiwal. The commission had served summons to Deshmukh, Singh, Waze, as well as Sanjay Palande, who was private secretary to the then home minister and former assistant commissioner, Sanjay Patil, to remain present before it on June 11. They were also directed to submit an affidavit in support of their allegations. However, neither Deshmukh nor Singh appeared before the commission. On the same day, the commission imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 on Deshmukh, who sought time to make submissions. Initially, Singh expressed his inability to attend on the ground that he was ill. However, when his lawyer sought a fresh adjournment on Tuesday, the commission imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 on him as well and warned that failure to remain present on the next date would invite further costs. It will be a difficult task for Singh to submit on oath that Deshmukh had asked Waze to mobilise Rs 100 crore since he will have to submit documentary evidence. A senior official said the commission official submitted an application to the NIA court, saying Waze’s presence was essential to record his statement. The court granted permission, following which the jail administration presented Waze before the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-panel-imposes-rs-10k-cost-on-deshmukh-singh/articleshow/83763827.cms||---

Fifty-nine cases pertaining to proposals sent by South Goa police recommending externment of criminals are pending before the district collector since 2018. These include 28 in 2018, 8 in 2019, 17 in 2020 and 6 in 2021 so far. Sources said that frequent transfers of district collectors over the last three years has largely contributed to the delay in culmination of the proceedings. South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh said that the latest order only revalidates the earlier one empowering the district magistrate to proceed with the cases already booked under the act earlier and in which proceedings have been already initiated. NSA is a preventive detention law which provides for detainment of a person to keep him/her from committing future crimes and/or from escaping future prosecution. NSA was first invoked in the state in December 2012. Raju alias Tiger Talwar, 27, a resident of Khareband, Margao, was the first to be booked by South Goa police under NSA on February 5, 2013. Soon, on May 9, 2013, chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Margao, P M Shinde, had issued a ‘notice of proclamation’ under provisions contained in the NSA, declaring Basheer Shaikh and his brother Jalil Shaikh, both residents of Moti Dongor, Margao, as proclaimed offenders. Jalil was arrested by the Margao police on June 11, 2013, after he was nabbed at Khareband. His detention was later upheld by the national security advisory board. The home department’s order issued on June 8, was notified in the official gazette on June 17, saying that “in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3(3) of the National Security Act, 1980, the Goa government, having regard to the circumstances prevailing in South Goa district, is satisfied that it is necessary so to do, hereby directs that during a period of three months from the date of commencement of this order, the South Goa magistrate may also exercise the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of said Section 3, within the local limits of his jurisdiction, if he is satisfied as provided in said sub-section (2)”. SP Singh, however, said, that the order does not pertain to emergence of any new circumstances in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/10-nsa-cases-in-s-goa-court-since-2018-reveals-data/articleshow/83761517.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hundreds of satisfied faces keep YMCA volunteers going||Hyderabad: With the pandemic hitting the poor hard, some members of YMCA Narayanguda decided to do their bit and serve the needy. Since May 21, while the lockdown was on, YMCA members have been serving free breakfast to more than 550 people daily at the Niloufer Hospital and other places. “We did this during the Covid-19 lockdown in April last year," said Priestly Gius Masihcharan, general secretary, YMCA, Hyderabad. "But the situation was different then. Because of the the intensity of the pandemic this time, we were in two minds. However, after seeing the plight of the people living on footpaths and other public places, we couldn’t wait to take up the initiative again.” Hundreds queue up at places like Niloufer Hospital, Nampally Railway Station and Public Gardens every morning for a plate of nutritious breakfast -- bread, banana and one boiled egg. "We have been doing this regularly. We have taken up the initiative as part of YMCA’s 177th Foundation Day celebrations. Besides, it also coincides with YMCA Hyderabad’s 109th anniversary celebrations,” Masihcharan said. He thanked YMCA Narayanguda president Dr Jonathan Dharmaraj for the support. Vinay Swaroop, who is among four volunteers taking part in the initiative, said: “At 69 years of age, I was a bit hesitant. But several people have lost their livelihood due to the pandemic. Looking at their suffering, I could not wait to join the initiative.” He said, "Our preparation starts very early. We have tied up with a few people like bakers in Nampally, who supply us bread by 6am every day. Then we boil the eggs and pack them to start off at 7.45am. Each package roughly costs us Rs 50." There are times when people are desparate, and it's a task for the volunteers to handle the rush. "At times, we feel like we are taking a risk, as social distancing goes for a toss, particularly at places like Niloufer Hospital where the patients' attendants rush for the breakfast," Swaroop said. "Thank God, it’s been going on smoothly.” However, for the volunteers, the risk is worth taking when they see the satisfaction on the faces of people who they help. Van driver Ifroz Pasha, who starts off early at 5am, said: “When we see several people waiting eagerly to take the food packets, we forget all our hard work. It’s indeed a great way to start off the day.” Masihcharan added, “We just feel it’s our responsibility to do our bit for society. It gives us immense satisfaction when we provide breakfast to the people who are waiting for our van van daily. That’s what keeps us going.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hundreds-of-satisfied-faces-keep-ymca-volunteers-going/articleshow/83761527.cms||---

Also, the women and child welfare department has set up transit homes in all district headquarters for the children of Covid-19 positive parents HELPLINES: 181 (for women), 1098 (for children); email: telanganastatewomenscommission@gmail.com Q. In the lockdown, harassment at home has increased for many women. In some cases, even children are not spared. But often, these women don’t know what to do or where to go for help. What’s your advice to them? -- Sanjana Charisma A. Unfortunately, violence against women has increased in this emergency. A major increase is found in domestic violence cases with most companies choosing to provide work from home. Such women in distress can call the helpline number 181 and report the issue, while for children they can call 1098. They can also reach out Sakhi centers which are established in all districts in Telangana. These centers can help women by providing counselling, short-term shelter and even emergency kits which consist of basic necessities. If there are family disputes, they can be resolved or compromised through counselling or hearing before the Commission and in case of serious crimes, cases can be filed. The inquiry committee will conduct investigations and ensure that immediate relief and justice is provided to the victims of violence and atrocities. Q. Are people supposed to approach the commission in case of harassment, since the website is still not operational? Please share helpline numbers and physical offices that they can visit. -- Premila K A. As the commission is newly constituted the commission is going to launch the website within a short time. In the meanwhile, aggrieved women can approach the Telangana State Commission for Women directly and report the cases at the commission office at: second floor, Buddha Bhavan, Secunderabad. They can also report cases on email: telanganastatewomenscommission@gmail.com or call 181. The secretary, women commission is the authorised officer. Q. What are the issues that come under the purview of the commission? Not many of us have clarity about it and hence do not know if/when we can approach it. Can you please throw some light on it? -- Kanupriya V A. Telangana State Commission is a statutory body and have judicial powers. The commission looks into matters related to unfair practices/treatment of women, creating awareness on rights and acts of women like domestic violence, dowry harassment, workplace harassment, child marriage, POCSO Act, women trafficking etc. It can recommend the government on effective implementation of Acts and safeguards for improving the conditions of women. The commission supports the petitioner to feel free to discuss her problem and build confidence and strengthen her energy to overcome the problems. Apart from this it also inspects hostels, jails, shelter homes, old-age homes to ensure proper treatment and justice to women. Any women in distress or in need of protection or safety can approach the commission directly or via email or toll-free number. Q. The Covid-19 pandemic has left many women jobless. Many have even lost their only earning member of their family. Is the commission doing something to help/employ them? - Karthik Shanmugham A. I can understand the situation of many women who lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the recruitment/creating employment opportunities do not come under the purview of the commission. But in case of any help women can approach the commission wherein we can guide them on interim arrangements made by the government for sustenance. The women from families affected by the pandemic can get financial support of up to Rs three lakh for establishing new enterprises through SHGs (Self Help Groups). As far as children are concerned, the women and child welfare department is accommodating them in government children's homes. The department has also established transit homes in all district headquarters for the children of Covid-19 positive parents until the parents are tested Covid-19 negative. Q. Women safety is still an issue in the city. Travelling at night (like going to the airport), especially, is a concern as there aren’t enough checks on the way. Are any measures being taken to address this? -- P R Vittal Rao A. Hyderabad is among the cities with highest penetration of CCTV cameras in the world. In addition to this, the Telangana police has a lot of systems in place to address crimes against women. These include but is not limited to: The Hawkeye App (for safe travel), Dial 100 for emergencies, Dial 112 NERS System that automatically triggers if you press the power button of your phone twice in quick succession (android), QR code-based complaints acceptance channel and WhatsApp-based complaints sharing with She Teams etc. Q. The recent Niti Aayog report on SDG showed that crime against women in Telangana has increased. What kind of crimes are getting reported the most? What is being done about it? -- Sheetal Kaur A. The pandemic has substantially changed the way individuals, groups and families connect with each other. It has also brought about financial hardships and mental distress. We have witnessed higher incidents of domestic violence/POCSO/cybercrimes, but this may also be owing to increased awareness of complaints’ channels and trust in the redressal systems for women victims. Q. The women’s commission has come into being after a long gap. What are the top five things that the commission is focusing on fixing first? -- Vidya Reddy L A. Our top five priorities are: Creating awareness on women-related Acts; Organising meetings with commissioners, collectors, SP's and stake holders for effective implementation of women acts and schemes and also conducting visits to the districts; Visiting shelter homes, jails, old-age home for women to ensure that inmates have decent living conditions and better healthcare facilities; Focus on effective implementation on of the POSH Act and recommend the government for better implementation of women acts and schemes. We are also looking at addressing issues of workplace harassment, looking into complaints and taking suo-moto notice of matters relating to deprivation of women’s rights, etc and participating and advising on the planning process of socio-economic development of women in coordination with the government. Q. If a woman of foreign nationality faces harassment in the city, can she approach the commission? What are her other options? -- Geetanjali Rao A. Yes, women of foreign nationality can approach the women’s commission if she is subjected to any kind of violence. She can also, alternatively, approach the nearest police station. Q. A year or so ago, there were reports of women, living in city shelters, being abused. Following that, the government was supposed to put stringent norms in place to keep these shelters in check. Has that happened? -- Kameshwar R K A. As of now, the commission has not received any report regarding such cases. The Telangana government has formed state-level and district-level inspection committees to deal with such cases. If any cases of abuse are reported during the inspection, license of those shelter homes will be cancelled. An FIR will also be registered against the concerned. Q. Are there new laws that women must be made aware of, to protect/fight for their rights? -- Amina Nadaf A. As of now, there are no new laws relating to women. But the Telangana chief minister has initiated a separate ‘Women Safety Wing’ with a woman additional DG as concerned officer which has become a role model in the country. Bharosa and She Teams have also been formed in most of the towns/ districts for women protection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-has-led-to-increase-in-cases-of-domestic-violence/articleshow/83761582.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 9% spike in diesel prices in a month bloats freight costs||AHMEDABAD: The manufacturing industry is feeling the pinch of rising input costs as diesel prices have risen by 9.2% in just 37 days. Diesel prices rose from Rs 86.96 per litre on May 17 to Rs 95.01 on June 22. Prices are climbing to record highs every day and with this both transporters and industry are feeling the heat. Pathik Patwari, secretary, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) on Tuesday said, “The increase in diesel price directly affects the freight component for manufacturers by 9% straightaway. At a time when demand is low and payment cycles are stretched, high fuel prices will further hurt manufacturers’ revenues.” The manufacturing sector is already facing increased raw material costs. “Raw material costs have nearly doubled for most sectors. Real estate is battling steel and cement costs, dyes and intermediates manufacturing is staring at higher basic chemical costs and cotton and yarn prices are affecting textile industry players. This is already increasing overall cost of production,” said Chintan Thaker, chairperson, Assocham Gujarat state council. Transporters are also adversely affected as diesel prices cause a surge in their input costs. Industry players feel that fuel should be brought under the ambit of goods and services tax (GST), so that its prices are be rationalised and they can claim the benefit of input tax credit. Transporters are also fighting rising prices. “Diesel costs are going up every single day and are no more palatable. Despite a slew of representations to the state government, our request has not been heeded. Diesel prices have been going up every day and it is impossible to meet the rising costs as a lot of industrialists are also refusing to renegotiate transportation contracts,” said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association (AGTTA). “Business was already down due to restrictions and lockdowns, especially in Rajasthan and Maharashtra. Now with diesel price going up, most of our vehicles are idle and we’re unable to pay the EMIs on trucks and other vehicles,” Ibrahim Jamadar, vice president, AGTTA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/9-spike-in-diesel-prices-in-a-month-bloats-freight-costs/articleshow/83761580.cms||Niyati Parikh

This has resulted in more water stocks in the dams this year as compared to the dam storage at the same time last year. Radhanagari dam had 65.11 million cubic metre (mcum) water storage last year on this date. This year, it is 90.18 mcum. Most locations in the region have received more rainfall than last year. For instance, Mahabaleshwar had received 662 mm rainfall last year by June 22, while the famous hill station has received 999 mm rainfall since June 1 this year. The same is the case with Gaganbawda hill station in Kolhapur, which had received 1,303 mm rainfall by June 22 last year. This year, it has received 1,451 mm rainfall since June 1. Rohit Bandivdekar, executive engineer with irrigation department, said, “This year, we have received around 100 mm excess rainfall compared to last year’s rainfall till now. Hence, the dam water storage level is also high. We will release the water from the dams by keeping the powerhouse gates open in full capacity. In the last few days, the catchment area and also free catchment area is receiving heavy rainfall and we want to reduce the current water level so that even if a flood situation arises, then the water release from the dams can be kept at minimum.” In the month of July and August, the catchment region receives heavy rainfall and the dam water levels rise again. As of now, IMD has forecast a dry spell till July first week and there is enough water to fulfil irrigation and industrial requirements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/good-start-to-monsoon-fills-up-dams-more-than-last-year/articleshow/83755042.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Goa||Divar roads flooded after bunds breach||Panaji: After the bunds in Divar’s Malar ward were washed away due to heavy rain, locals were left with no option but to wade through flooded roads to reach dry terrain. Videos of a couple of people attempting to cross the flooded road were widely shared on social media platforms on Tuesday. “It is the third day we’re wading in this water to get home, after leaving our vehicles a kilometre away. If this issue is not resolved, the road we wade through will no longer be visible after a few days. When panchs are aware of such a situation arising, they should’ve taken measures to avoid it,” the person filming the video can be heard saying. Divar resident Perpetua Araujo said that due to rain-induced inundation, many farmers have decided to not cultivate their farms in a bid to avoid losses. “Some of them had booked transplanters but had to cancel them due to the incessant rain. The fields have been flooded with salt water, so it is very difficult for the people of certain areas to manage,” she said. Another resident said failure to complete pre-monsoon works, and not the broken bunds alone, are to be blamed for the inundation. “Many drains are not yet cleaned by the panchayat,” the resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/divar-roads-flooded-after-bunds-breach/articleshow/83761590.cms||---
---||Kolkata||As curbs ease, cars on pothole-riddled roads lead to traffic snarls near Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: Vehicles have been crawling on roads around Kolkata airport — since the ease of Covid-induced safety restrictions last week that marked the resumption of private and government offices along with a slew of other relaxations — courtesy a broken and pothole-riddled Belgharia Expressway, Jessore Road and some portions of VIP Road. The vehicles, including two-wheelers, headed to the city from Dakshineswar, Barasat, Madhyamgram and Dum Dum areas — even when no large vehicles like buses and trucks are plying on the road — are getting caught up in regular snarls that are adding extra half an hour to 45 minutes to their travel time. For those who don’t have their own vehicles for commute, the situation is even worse. While large craters have surfaced on Belgharia Expressway after the recent rain, major portions of the road between Madhyamgram and the airport are broken. The situation is worse on the stretch of VIP Road between airport gate No. 1 and Kaikhali as craters and crash barriers are triggering traffic snarls during the morning and evening rush hours. “The condition of the roads was already bad. The continuous rain has added to the damage. Last weekend, the potholes were also filled with rain water, leading to multiple accidents and breakdown of vehicles,” said Rohit Ganguly, a resident of Dakshineswar, who travels along the Belgharia expressway — VIP Road stretch every day to go to his office at Ultadanga. The experience has been similar for Madhyamgram resident Tathagata Basu who had been to a hospital on EM Bypass last week for his Covid vaccination. “The stretch between airport gate No. 3 till Birati is the worst. I am glad that I don’t have to drive to office any more. But even the one-day experience tested my driving skills to the hilt. The stretch has been reduced to a broken village road with small patches of concrete in between,” said Basu who works in an IT firm and has been working from home for more than a year. Cops said they have requested the agencies maintaining VIP Road, Belgharia Expressway and Jessore Road to repair the damaged stretches. “We have done some patchwork repairs by filling the holes with sand and broken bricks by ourselves, but unless the authorities conduct a thorough repair of these roads, commuting is becoming a huge challenge. There are snarls, despite lesser traffic on the road,” said an officer of Airport traffic guard. The NHAI is the custodian of Belgharia Expressway while state PWD is in charge of maintenance of Jessore Road and VIP Road. Officials of both the agencies said they would undertake a complete repair work of the road once the monsoon is over. “We conduct patchwork repairs time and again but the rain has withered them away. Now that the potholes have reappeared, we will again repair the stretches. But a thorough repair will be possible only after the monsoon,” said a PWD official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-curbs-ease-cars-on-pothole-riddled-roads-lead-to-traffic-snarls-near-airport/articleshow/83759455.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

They said the policy will go a long way in making Gujarat the country’s EV hub. Sohinder Gill, director general, Society of Manufacturers of electric vehicles (SMEV), said: “The policy certainly has the potential to make Gujarat an EV hub and will mobilize rapid adoption of electric vehicles in the state.” Gill added: “The policy also gives thrust to the charging infrastructure that will address the range anxiety, especially in people who want to buy an electric four-wheeler.” The manufacturers said that incentivization will help the industry. “We welcome the Gujarat government’s decision to offer incentive support to all categories of electric vehicles,” said Shailesh Chandra, president, passenger vehicle business unit, Tata Motors. “This clearly signals the strong resolve of the government to push for a cleaner environment and a sustainable future for the country.” Startups which develop charging infrastructure said that the policy will aid faster adoption of EVs. Kartikey Hariyani, founder & CEO, CHARGE+ZONE, said: “The policy will aid in the widespread adoption of EVs within the state’s consumer base.” Hariyani added: “Measures such as additional cash subsidy on the purchase of electric vehicles and incentives to build the EV charging infrastructure will go a long way in making EV a formidable sector in Gujarat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-ev-policy-boosts-industrys-power/articleshow/83761626.cms||---

While jail authorities suspect that Shahid took his own life, his family has cried foul and demanded that a murder case be registered. The family claimed that Shahid had been granted bail and would be out of jail within a couple of days. Jail authorities have rubbished the claim. Muzaffarnagar jail superintendent AK Saxena said he is probing the matter himself and has also requested CJM to set up a magisterial investigation of the matter. Saxena said, “Shahid committed suicide by hanging himself. No jail official was present at the spot at that time.” Besides, jail authorities have not received any orders to release him on bail as being alleged on social media, he added. Police said Shahid was arrested from Shiv Chowk in the city on June 26 last year. He was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, (NDPS) Act for having in his possession a large number of narcotic pills. He himself used to take them. Police sources said earlier he was arrested in an attempt to murder case but released on bail. After learning about Shahid’s death, his family members on Tuesday gathered outside the collectorate, demanding a fair investigation of the matter. His mother, Zubaida, alleged, “He was murdered by the jail administration. I want justice.” Deceased's brother, Zahid Ahmed, wondered why would Shahid wanted to end his life when “he was about to be released from jail as his lawyer was working to get him out on bail”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/jail-inmate-found-hanging-family-alleges-murder/articleshow/83757199.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The complainant is Vivek, a resident of Sector 19. In his complaint, he has mentioned that on May 1, 2019, he purchased some general items worth Rs 3,108, including Rs 72 was paid for four bags (Rs 18 per bag). Upon his protest, he was told that he was to first pay for the carry bags and after that the bag amount was to be refunded into future pay app. He told the officials that if the amount is not refunded, he would then approach the consumer court. Then, as advised, he downloaded the app, but the amount of the carry bags was not refunded. He visited the opposite party many times, but they did not refund the same. In its written statement, Big Bazaar pleaded that the amount which they had charged from the complainant for the carry bags was rightly charged as the same was displayed in their store. They further stated that it has been urged that he had consented to be given a carry bag for an additional charge and that they have displayed about the charges of carry bags at prominent locations of their store and also stated that as a part of their environment conscious business policy, consumers are requested to carry their own bags and that a charges will levied in case a consumer wished to obtain a new carry bag. After hearing both the sides, the court in its judgement stated that Big Bazaar sell bags on no profit no loss basis. The court mentioned that they are not impressed with this argument because big stores like Big Bazaar never allowed customers to carry bags in their hands within their store premises knowing very well that if they are allowed then the customers will not easily give their consent on purchasing carry bags. Further, the court stated that store is taking advantage of its dominating position. “It was for gain of the opposite party. By employing unfair trade practice, they are minting a lot of money from the gullible customers,” the court said. Therefore, the court has ordered the store to refund Rs 72 along with Rs 100 towards compensation for harassment and mental agony, Rs 1,100 as litigation expenses. It also has been directed to deposit Rs 5,000 in the consumer legal aid account. Box: Retailer to pay Rs 1,600 The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission-II directed a Japanese-inspired lifestyle product retailer to pay around Rs 1,600 to a Ropar resident for charging Rs 10 for a carry bag. The complainant has been identified as Arshnoor Singh, a resident of Ropar. In his complaint against Miniso, situated in Elante Mall, Chandigarh, he said he purchased goods worth Rs 1,560 on November 9, 2019 and the retailer charged Rs 10 for the carry bag. He added that nowhere was it mentioned that customers would have to pay for carry bags. In its written statement, the retailer said that the customer bought the carry bag willingly and had not raised any objection at the time of billing. The court was not convinced by this argument. The court directed the retailer to refund Rs 10 or the price of the paper carry bag to the complainant along with Rs 500 towards compensation for harassment and mental agony. Also, the retailer has been told to pay Rs 1,100 as litigation expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/charging-for-carry-bags-to-cost-retail-store-rs-6200/articleshow/83759483.cms||---
---||Nashik||Potholes develop on Nashik-Kasara stretch of highway||Nashik: With the onset of monsoon, the stretch of Mumbai-Agra highway from Nashik to Kasara has started developing potholes, making commuting difficult for the motorists. Senior officials of the highway police said they would soon communicate with the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials to take up the work of filling the potholes. Harish Chaube, fire officer with a company in Igatpuri, said a large number of potholes have developed on the highway at Ghoti, Igatpuri and Kasara since they receive heavy rainfall during monsoon. Chaube said, “The work of filling the potholes has been taken up right from Kasara and most of the potholes are being filled.” The Mumbai-Agra highway witnesses huge flow of traffic round-the-clock. Hence, the presence of potholes on the highway becomes a concern for the motorists as they may lead to accidents. Though the company that collects the toll takes up pre-monsoon repairs, every year soon after a couple of heavy showers the road starts to develop potholes. API Amol Valzade of Ghoti Traffic Aid Post (TAP) said they write and inform the NHAI about the potholes on the highway and asked them to get it repaired.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/potholes-develop-on-nashik-kasara-stretch-of-highway/articleshow/83755092.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Now, the water is receding but swift currents are still causing a lot of soil erosion. Villagers have been warned to stay away from rivers and canals. Besides, revenue and police personnel have been deployed in flood-affected areas to keep a close watch on the situation. Bijnor district magistrate Umesh Mishra and superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh visited flood-affected areas on Tuesday. Mishra held a public meeting in the village and invited their suggestions. Villagers have asked the visiting DM to get embankments constructed to stop the menace. According to junior engineer of the irrigation department, Piyush Baliyan, “Ganga water is receding day by day. Earlier, the Ganga was flowing above danger level because of incessant rainfall in hill areas in Uttarakhand. The neighbouring state has released more than 3.50 lakh cusec water in the Ganga. But now, Ganga is flowing with 75,000 cusec water here at Chaudhary Charan Singh Madhya Ganga barrage in Bijnor. At present, there is no flood-like situation here. However, now land erosion has emerged as a big menace along the river banks.” A resident of Gauspur village said, “Monsoon has not even started here and we are already facing huge problems. Constructing embankments is a proactive action that the administration should have taken but nothing has been done and as a result, we are facing land erosion now. Besides, there is no water management in the Ganga. Uttarakhand often releases water without prior information." District magistrate Mishra assured the villagers that the administration would pay heed to their years-old grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/as-ganga-recedes-villagers-face-soil-erosion-in-bijnor/articleshow/83757203.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Mumbai||Lenders get back Rs 5,8000 crore from Vijay Mallya’s UB share sale||MUMBAI: The Debt Recovery Tribunal, on behalf of a SBI-led consortium of lenders, sold United Breweries shares worth Rs 5,824.5 crore of fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Wednesday. The shares, representing a 15% stake in Kingfisher Beer-maker UB, were bought by shareholder Heineken, which now has control. For banks, the recovery covers up their principal claims and a substantial part of the total claims of Rs 9,900 crore from Mallya. As the loans to Kingfisher were completely written off, the recovery could boost their Q1 profits. The recovery was made possible because the Enforcement Directorate (ED), in a money laundering case, confiscated the shares which were Mallya’s assets. These shares were owned through seven companies, some of which were ‘paper companies’ controlled by the liquor baron, according to authorities. Banks had earlier recovered Rs 1,357 crore, with assistance from the DRT, by selling Mallya’s shares in UB and United Spirits Ltd (USL). They are now in the process of selling Rs 800 crore worth shares in United Spirits and aim to conclude the sale before June 25. The block deal was executed through a special arrangement between the ED, the SBI-led consortium of 17 banks and Heineken, current owner of UB. The block deal was executed before the opening of the stock exchange to prevent an impact on the share price. Post-confiscation, the ED was recorded as the owner of these shares by the stock exchanges. Recently, with court permission, the ED transferred ownership of these shares to SBI after ensuring that Heineken, in principle, agreed to purchase these shares. In all, the ED has transferred attached assets worth Rs 8,442 crore to public sector banks in investigations pertaining to the triumvirate of fugitive economic offenders—Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. The trio had caused a collective loss of Rs 22,586 crore to banks. Using the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ED had attached assets worth a total of Rs 18,170 crore linked to the trio in India and abroad, which is around 80 % of the total loss caused to the banks. Mallya is in the UK and the government of India is trying to extradite him in the case. He has been denied permission to appeal against his extradition by the UK Supreme Court. Under the law, once the court declares an accused fugitive economic offender, the government agency can confiscate all his properties—even those not associated with the crime—and after court confirmation, it becomes government property that can be auctioned to recover the loss. Mallya took bank loans on his personal guarantee, a corporate guarantee of UB Holdings and an inflated brand guarantee of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. The loan was taken for operating expenses of Kingfisher Airlines but was used for other purposes, including procuring a luxury aircraft for Mallya’s personal use and properties. Following defaults in loan repayments, the loan to Kingfisher Airlines was classified as a non-performing asset almost a decade ago. The ED probed two separate money laundering cases against Mallya under the PMLA and filed a chargesheet in both. During the investigation, the agency attached his properties (including shares) worth Rs 12,500 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/lenders-get-back-rs-5-8k-cr-from-mallyas-ub-share-sale/articleshow/83795292.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Hyderabad||Used my creativity to build apps, games||We are going through a worldwide pandemic for the past year and it has been filled with mixed feelings. While on the one hand, it gave me the opportunity to spend quality time with my family, which I won’t ever forget; on the other hand, I cut me off from the rest of the world. I haven't attended school in over a year now and have not met my friends in ages. Though shortly after the pandemic, online school started, it is only for four hours. During the initial period of lockdown, I got addicted to video games. I spent over eight hours in front of the screen. I started feeling fatigued and it began to impact my health. My parents tried to limit my screen time and advised me to divert myself attention towards other creative things. While playing online games , I realised that I had gained so many insights but never noticed them. Some of them were teamwork and hand-eye coordination. A few months later, I was introduced to scratch programming and started developing interest in it. I created a few apps and games and started to make good use of my time igniting my creativity. The games turned out be amazing and my parents were very impressed. I also started writing a blog on ‘My Dream vacation - Japan’, because I was mesmerised by the beautiful country. As 2021 began, I also renovated my new room with my family. I truly enjoyed and won’t forget all these memories. I have now started yoga and exercises to keep fit. After going through these tough times, as my family stayed safe and healthy, I have come to be really grateful for everything that I have. I truly cherished all the time that I spent with my family during this period. I grew as an individual in many different aspects and learnt that we should all find positives, even amid unpleasant situations like these, to stay happy. (The writer is a class 10 student at Chirec International School) .............................. I’m now a chef, just like my mom By P V Manognya With this pandemic upon us, instead of being in school and indulging in various activities with our teachers, classmates and friends, we have been confined to our homes, to keep ourselves safe and healthy. But, in some ways, it has also been a blessing in disguise. Thanks to the pandemic, my lifestyle has changed for the better and I have found time to develop my interest in picking up various recipes from my mother – by far the best cook in this world. While assisting her in the kitchen, I learnt to make coco cake, Italian porridge with oats and cheese, dum biryani, prawns curry and many other things. I even watched my mother make pizzas and picked up some tricks from her. Now I am planning on making some pizzas, in my style, and having a pizza party for my family, for my 13th birthday next month. Apart from spending time in the kitchen, I also used this opportunity to indulge in my other hobbies -- drawing, painting, watering plants, etc – after attending my online classes. I spent my evenings exercising -- cycling mostly – and helping my grandpa around, including assisting him in wearing his hearing aid. Amid all this, it was really disheartening to hear about so many children becoming orphans and left without homes. I also came to know about a young girl who had asked her dad to break her piggy bank and give away all that money to the children who lost their parents to Covid-19. I was so moved by it that decided to do something similar. I picked out all my unused dresses – as my sister’s -- for them and asked my father to distribute them on his way to the office, since I cannot step out of my house. Thus, I’m proud to say that I am changed person, post this pandemic, and feel that I have become more mature. Realising the ill effects of the pandemic with wave after wave, I’m now a better girl indeed to my parents, friends, and everybody else around me.

---||Goa||As new Delta plus strain lurks, delays in genome sequencing keep Goa in dark||PANAJI: Even as the Delta-plus variant of Covid-19 has been detected in the neighboring Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, Goa continues to be in the dark about whether it has entered the state. Results of 89 samples sent for genome sequencing to a laboratory in Pune are still awaited. “Delta-plus has not been diagnosed in Goa yet, though reports of the samples sent over the last one-and-a-half month are awaited,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI on Monday. Over the last few months, 122 samples were sent for genome sequencing, and 33 test results have been received so far, of which 26 were detected as being of the Delta variant. Kappa, another Maharashtra strain, was detected in six samples, and alpha was found in a single sample, Betodkar said. Looking at the results so far, 79% were delta variants. The spike seen in Goa over the last two months was largely caused by the Delta variant. “Scientific data available shows that it is significantly more transferable. It spread from Maharashtra to other states, Goa included, expeditiously,” he said. “That’s the capacity of a respiratory virus. If it was any other virus, maybe a gastro virus, it would not have spread as fast as a respiratory virus. Now that we know that the Delta variant was responsible for the second wave, a lot of our population is immune to that variant. The Delta variant will possibly not cause another wave in Goa. Or even if it gives rise to another wave, it will be small,” he said. The problem, Betodkar said, would arise if there’s a new mutant strain. “Nothing much is known about the Delta-plus so far, and it is still under study. A lot will depend upon the character of the delta-plus strain. If it is completely different from Delta, there will be a problem. But if it is more like Delta, we have less to worry about. If that’s the case, then we probably will have a small wave. But we need to wait for some time to understand what exactly it is.” As per the strategy of the government of India, he said that the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, has been designated as the regional genomic sequencing laboratory. “Every 15 days, we have to send 15 samples from every institute for genome sequencing. Very soon, samples from the South Goa district hospital as well as the sub-district hospital, Ponda, will be sent,” he said. Currently, samples for sequencing are sent from GMC, North Goa district hospital and a private hospital in South Goa that conducts conventional RT-PCR tests for the past two months. Earlier, samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, but stopped due to the inordinate delays in receiving results. Dr Eugene D’Souza, a senior consultant pathologist, said that when test results of samples of genome sequencing are received a month later, it is of less relevance to strategise effective public health measures. However, efforts are underway to increase the percentage of samples tested for genome sequencing. “Goa needs to consider setting up its own genomic sequencing lab to increase the percentage of positive cases screened, with faster results to detect new mutants as Goa is a tourist hub. News of a third wave with emerging variants like Delta+ with evidence of higher transmissibility and immune escape, demands (us to) re-strategise responses,” said D’Souza. The proposed independent virology laboratory at GMC will take another month to become functional, a health official said. In April, health minister Vishwajit Rane had announced that since the NIV did not return sample results in time, the state would have its own facility. “Civil work of the proposed laboratory has been completed. Once we complete the biosafety process, which might take a month or a little more, we will be able to make it functional,” a GMC official said. He disclosed that GMC recently tied up with a laboratory in Hyderabad, where alumnus Dr Ashwin Dalal works, and has offered to do free genome sequencing for the premier healthcare facility. “We will send samples there shortly,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-new-delta-strain-lurks-delays-in-genome-sequencing-keep-goa-in-dark/articleshow/83761631.cms||Bindiya Chari

In Goa over 80% produce of the fruit is wasted - indicating a continuing failure to tap the nutrition-rich resource. In a bid to reduce wastage and develop a workable model for replication, Goa state biodiversity board (GSBB) has set up a multi-processing centre at Pale-Kothambi employing 13 women from the locality to tap the local produce. “The first multi-processing unit in Goa is aimed at some value addition to sustainably utilize bioresources such as jackfruits, kokum, jamun and mango which could encourage their conservation,” Pradip Sarmokadam, member secretary, GSBB said. At the recently-started centre, a host of products are rolled out from jackfruit, anvlam, karmalam, mangoes and other produce. “From tender jackfruits to completely ripened ones, nothing is wasted and our workers prepare nine products from jackfruit, besides, anvlam, karmalam and bimlam squash and anvlam candy,” Samiksha Chari, GSBB programme officer said. Jackfruits are mainly sourced from government farms in Kalem, Chinchinim, Old Goa and from nearby villages, while the end products are marketed through local entrepreneurs and associates like Sunrajas India pvt ltd. Though jackfruit’s health benefits are well-known the produce ends up rotting on trees in Goa. “It has immense potential and 70 to 80 items can be made from jackfruit but sadly very little income is generated,” nutritionist and subject matter specialist (home science) at ICAR’s Krishi Vigyan kendra, Old Goa said. Around 25 women were trained on GSBB’s behalf as well as 40 self-help groups (SHGs) in processing the fruit. “Many of these groups are making chips and other products, but utilization can be improved,” Talaulikar said. While the centre’s activities have been funded entirely by Goa Shipyard Limited, GSBB is planning ten more in the mining belt of both districts. “After a year or two we are expecting to use the revenue generated for conservation of local unique varieties of jackfruit, kokum, jamun and other species,” Sarmokadam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biodiversity-board-steps-in-to-develop-jackfruits-potential/articleshow/83761661.cms||Paul Fernandes

The vaccination turnout slightly increased in the capital with 84,539 people getting the jabs on June 22. “Of 9.76 lakh vaccine doses available, 9.1 lakh doses of Covishield and 66,000 doses of Covaxin are available in Delhi. It means that 2 days stock of Covaxin and 13 days of Covishield are available in the capital,” Atishi said, adding that among 84,539 who were given vaccine doses on Tuesday, 55,000 people who received the first dose were youth. So far, 66,87,438 people have been vaccinated in Delhi and more than 16 lakh people have received both doses. “We’ve been saying from the start, that when vaccines are available for the youth, the speed of vaccination increases. Even if we look at yesterday’s statistics, out of all the vaccinations that were done, a major chunk of beneficiaries was of the youth, who got themselves vaccinated. This is the only way to remove people’s hesitancy, in Delhi and the country, that we make the vaccines for youth available in adequate numbers,” Atishi stated. Since the government has combined the two doses available for the two categories, vaccines are now also available for the youth. “It is our request to the central government that as quickly and in as much quantity they make the vaccines available, Delhi’s people will come forward and get themselves vaccinated. They’ll be safe themselves and keep the entire Delhi safe,” Atishi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-stock-of-both-age-categories-clubbed-delhi-has-9-8l-doses/articleshow/83793464.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Will fight assembly polls, BJP can’t deny me ticket: Ex-Goa CM Laxmikant Parsekar||PANAJI: Former Goa chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar has thrown his hat in the ring for the assembly elections scheduled early next year and exuded confidence that BJP wouldn’t deny him a ticket. “I have informed party national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh that I wish to contest the next assembly . There is no question of BJP denying me the ticket to contest from Mandrem,” Parsekar told TOI on Tuesday. Parsekar, the then chief minister, had lost the last assembly election by over 7,000 votes to Dayanand Sopte of Congress, who later joined BJP in 2018 and is the sitting MLA from Mandrem. Parsekar is the second senior state BJP functionary after former state president and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar to have expressed his desire to contest the assembly elections. Tendulkar had recently told TOI that he was even willing to resign his Rajya Sabha seat if assured a ticket. Parsekar said he wants to contest to complete the projects taken up during his tenure like electronic city, water treatment plant, Mopa airport, etc. “Over the past four-and-a-half years, not a single project has been completed in Mandrem constituency. “I am active in my constituency and my social work continues even after I lost the assembly election. I can challenge all 40 MLAs, including Sopte, to compare their social work with mine,” Parsekar said, adding that even when he was an MLA, minister and chief minister, he continued his social work. Parsekar, an RSS member, joined BJP in 1988 and contested his first election in 1989, but lost his deposit. Hailing from a family of strong MGP supporters, Parsekar had had a confrontation with his family to contest his first election on a BJP ticket. In 1994, Parsekar could not contest the assembly election after BJP forged an alliance with Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and the Mandrem seat was allotted to MGP. In 1999, Parsekar again lost, but this time, he was able to secure his deposit. The first election he won was in 2002, followed by victories in the 2007 and 2012 elections. In November 2014, he became the chief minister after Manohar Parrikar moved to Delhi as the Union defence minister—only the second partyman to hold that post after Parrikar. Parsekar continued as the chief minister till 2017. “I have won thrice when it was a triangular or four-corner fight, but I lost in 2017 when it was a one-on-one fight,” he said. The former chief minister said the party gives tickets to winning candidates, and since he has witnessed the growth of the party, it cannot deny him a ticket. “After I lost in 2017, the electorate realised what a mistake they have made,” he said. Earlier, Parsekar had occupied various positions in the party, including state president, general secretary and secretary. Parsekar first became BJP state president in 1999 and then again in 2010. In 2012, under his presidency, BJP for the first time got a simple majority in the assembly by winning 21 of the 40 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-fight-assembly-polls-bjp-cant-deny-me-ticket-parsekar/articleshow/83761692.cms||Murari Shetye

Shaikh Shahed Shaikh Nizam, civic animal husbandry officer, on Tuesday said it is mandatory to have a valid licence for having a dog as pet. “Any violation can invoke fine worth Rs 500 and seizure of the animal. The process of getting a licence involves two latest photos of the dog, certificate of vaccination against rabies and Rs 500 as fee. The renewal fees for the licence is Rs 250,” he said. Highlighting the need of having a valid pet dog licence, Shaikh said such formality protects the citizens at large against the deadly rabies disease that occurs due to dog bite. Rabies is a preventable viral disease usually transmitted through the bite of an infected dog and other animal and it can infect the central nervous system in absence of proper medical intervention, including a regime of vaccine schedule. As per official data, the local civic body has collected Rs 7.55 lakh towards issuing of pet dog licences in the past 10 years. During the current financial year, only 125 citizens have secured the necessary licence helping the AMC with revenue of Rs 62,250.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/get-licence-for-pet-dogs-or-face-action-amc-to-citizens/articleshow/83755128.cms||---

The deceased was identified as Ajay Kumar Bose (52) who owned the house and used to stay on its ground floor for several years. Although the room was locked from inside and cops have ruled out the chance of any foul play, they have still sent the body for post-mortem examination to know the exact cause and time of his death. Cops have started an unnatural death case. “We have learnt that the man was ill and became very weak. The domestic help alerted his uncle as well as other neighbours who in turn called us. Foul smell was coming from the room. Since his uncle is bedridden, we called one of his distant relatives and in his presence, we broke open the door to find him dead,” said an officer of Bidhannagar North police station. He didn’t have fever or any other symptoms of Covid-19, the officer added. Bose was unemployed, unmarried and didn’t have any surviving member in his family other than the uncle. Cops have come to know that Bose was last seen on Sunday morning when he had opened the door to the domestic help. Since then, the entrance to the main door was kept ajar and his room was locked. “The domestic help who also looks after the house had knocked on Bose’s room on Monday as well but he hadn’t opened it. On Tuesday, she smelt the odour coming from the room. When Bose didn’t open the door despite her repeated knocks, she alerted the neighbours,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-found-dead-at-salt-lake-home/articleshow/83759533.cms||---

He lost vision to a blast while setting up a smoke bomb during the 1965 war with Pakistan. He was 30 then. But it didn’t deter him from giving a good life to his two sons back home. Over 55 years later, the two back-to-back waves of Covid-19 claimed both his sons. One was unmarried while the other left behind two children -- their mother had left them a few years ago. On Monday, Chahi Ram’s two grandchildren -- six-year-old Dhanakshi Malik and 12-year-old Anshul Malik-- guided him through the corridors of district magistrate’s office in UP’s Shamli. They had an appointment with the DM. Chahi Ram, now 85, has “one last wish”, just to ensure that the children get a good life, including good education. “My elder son was unmarried. And the younger one’s wife had left him, and the two children too. Now both sons are dead due to Covid-19. What will happen to these children when I die, no one is there to look after them. I desperately need sustained financial assistance for them,” said Chahi, whose monthly pension is keeping the small family afloat. Deshpal Singh, a neighbour of Chahi in Lisadh village of Shamli, said, “Two quick deaths in the family have shattered Chahi Ram. He does not even own any agricultural land. He is worried for his grandchildren and hence we have come to meet the district magistrate.” The DM, Jasjeet Kaur, didn’t disappoint them. “I have asked the district probation officer to visit the house of this family and get all documents related to the deaths. They will be provided help under the welfare schemes,” Kaur said. The boy, Anshul, wants to become a police officer. “I am a student of Class VI and wish to become a police officer. My grandfather is taking good care of us after the death of father and uncle. But he looks worried all the time.” The old man snapped, “I cannot sleep during the night thinking about them."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/1965-war-veteran-wants-government-help-for-grandkids-after-losing-2-sons-to-covid-19/articleshow/83757212.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kolkata||Plaint against fake social media post on adoption||Kolkata: Cops at Bowbazar police station have registered an FIR against fake child adoption posts on social media under the stringent IT Act, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and the Disaster Management Act. A special team has been formed to probe the case. According to the complaint, a Phears Lane resident had allegedly posted misleading and fake content and did not follow the prescribed provisions or procedures as provided in Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act for adoption of orphan children. Cops said that the contents were in violation of Section 2 (13) of the Adoption Regulation, 2017 that compromised the “privacy of the surrendering parents and the surrendered child by the authorities and agencies involved in the process.” The child mentioned in the post was not an orphan and hence posting about the child was a direct infringement on the rights of both the parents and the child. Cops have invoked six sections of three different acts in this regard. Cops said they are planning to send a notice to the accused and seek an explanation. The offending post has been deleted by the accused. It will be part of the larger probe launched into social media posts appealing for adoption of kids orphaned during Covid, some of whose origins have been traced to be outside the state. The probe was ordered by joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma after a Twitter user lodged a complaint. West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Ananya Chakraborti said most of the news on orphans doing the rounds on social media were fake. She warned that any attempt to adopt a child without following the due process is a criminal offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plaint-against-fake-social-media-post-on-adoption/articleshow/83759565.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Government against calls to include petrol products under GST: Kerala FM K N Balagopal||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State finance minister K N Balagopal has said the government was not in favour of including petroleum productions under GST regime. “Those who demand the inclusion of petroleum products under the GST cover would only be endorsing the same at the expense of the autonomy of the state government,” he said. “Public awareness should be created against this by exposing the dangers lurking under such demands. We have already said a firm no to the demand. We would continue to stick to our stand,” the minister told reporters at a meet the press programme here on Tuesday. The minister reiterated the government’s stand that only 30% of the proceedings from the petroleum tax goes to the state government and there was no merit in the arguments that the petroleum price would come down if petroleum products are brought under GST. “With the abolition of the old form of fuel pool account, the Union government is the sole beneficiary of the additional tax revenue coming out of the price difference of petroleum products in the national and international market. If the petroleum products too come under GST, the state’s tax revenue would further plummet and the impact of the same would be almost impossible to manage,” he said. Balagopal said the state government wanted the Union government to extend the GST compensation to states for another five years. According to the minister, the dire condition of the state economy was of serious concern and the government would soon start pursuing options to improve the tax collection. “Government is not asking traders and business men to pay extra tax. We only appeal to them to pay to the government the tax they collect from consumers. There is a need to generate a new consciousness on the need to stop tax evasion. We are finalizing some plans for effective tax collection,” Balagopal said. The minister said the tax proceedings from several business sectors, including gold sales, did indicate significant tax evasion. “Even a section of gold jewellers themselves are of the opinion that the government should take certain steps to ensure a fair tax compliance,” he said. The minister said the government was not willing to roll back or curtail the benefits to government employees or compromise in providing social security pensions even if it cannot pull on for long without controlling its expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-against-calls-to-include-petro-products-under-gst-fm/articleshow/83759608.cms||---

The trial was also meant for training the drivers and cleaners, help them get acquainted with the routes and bus stops and to check whether the buses can ply on time. After a delay of around one year due to the pandemic, the civic administration has started the process to launch the city bus service. As part of this, it has started the technical trials of the buses. A total of 10 buses, five CNG and five diesel, were deployed and each bus plied for around 100 km. The trial runs will continue on Wednesday as well. In the second phase of the trial, beginning from June 28, passengers will also be allowed to board the buses. The NMC has plans to start the city bus service from the first week of July and the exact date of launching the city bus service will be declared in the last week of June. The NMC has hired two private agencies to operate the city bus service to procure, operate, manage and maintain the city buses. Both the agencies have bought 250 buses — 200 CNG and remaining 50 diesel. The agencies will be paid by the civic body on per km basis. When contacted, an official from one of the private agencies said they successfully conducted the trials of 10 buses. “We faced traffic issues on some routes and that delayed the buses by a few minutes. Otherwise, the trials were successful,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-starts-trial-run-of-city-bus-service/articleshow/83755160.cms||Tushar Pawar

He was responding to the union ministers’ attack on the AAP government on vaccination turnout in Delhi on Monday when over 86 lakh individuals were jabbed across the country under a massive vaccination campaign. In response to Dr Harsh Vardhan’s charges that AAP government’s statements regarding vaccination stock and requirement were false, Sisodia asked the health minister on Twitter whether the Centre was going to give any additional vaccine supply to Delhi post June 21 or will it get only the vaccines Delhi government bought. Sisodia has stated that only 15 lakh vaccines that the Centre is going to give to Delhi for the month of July will slow down the process and it will then take 15-16 months for Delhi to inoculate all eligible citizens. AAP MLA Atishi hit back at the Centre and BJP and said instead of politicising the issue and making caustic remarks against Kejriwal, BJP should focus on mass vaccination. According to the vaccination bulletin, 76,062 people were vaccinated in the capital on Monday out of which the first dose was given to 58,490 and 17,572 got the second dose. Delhi has so far vaccinated over 66 lakh individuals out of which nearly 16 lakh have received both the doses. “BJP’s leaders and ministers have only one job and that is abusing Arvind Kejriwal and the Delhi government. It is my request to Hardeep Singh Puri, that instead of tweeting and holding press conferences, work on improving the country’s vaccination policy. Since the time India’s vaccination policy has started, in every phase, it has been failure after failure after failure,” Atishi stated. In the 45+ age group, Delhi has already vaccinated more than 50 per cent of the population. “For 18-44, even after repeatedly asking for it, very minimal doses of vaccine were provided. We kept on requesting the Centre to let us use the vaccines stipulated for the 45+ category for 18+ but it kept on saying no,” Atishi said, adding that “now the Centre via a press release is telling us to use the 45+ stock for everyone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-to-blame-for-vax-crisis-sisodia/articleshow/83761804.cms||AlokKNMishra

Mission Rabies, which has been instrumental in eradicating the virus by vaccinating and sterilising dogs since 2015, said that this landmark status makes Goa the first state in India to beat the disease. In 2014, Goa had reported 17 deaths caused by rabies. There has also been a sharp decline in the number of dog mediated rabies cases over the years. “The risk of canine rabies has decreased dramatically in Goa since the state-wide mass dog vaccination drive was initiated since 2015 onwards. It was out of hard work for the past seven years by doing over five lakh vaccinations and educating over nine lakh children in awareness programmes that this was accomplished,” Mission Rabies said. They said that locals and the tourists visiting Goa must be made aware about this to help maintain the status of India’s first rabies-controlled state and by continuing vaccinations and awareness on the avoidance and management of dog bites. They further stated that this status shall “improve animal welfare, reduce the fear of dogs within Goa and promote national and international tourism”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-rabies-deaths-in-3-yrs-goa-is-first-state-to-beat-the-virus/articleshow/83761747.cms||Nida Sayed

According to police, the whole racket was being run under the garb of service preparation institutes. The suspects had also given forged appointment letters from various central and state government departments to the candidates. It all started with a complaint filed by Pandit Thole hailing from Vasmat of Hingoli district. The unemployed youth was duped by a member of this racket in the year 2018. The suspect had offered him a permanent job in the railways and allegedly took Rs 10 lakh, before handing him a forged appointment letter. Based on his complaint lodged on May 13, Hingoli police laid a trap in Nanded and arrested two accused — Ravindra alias Rabindra Sankua and Narendra Prasad (55). Nanded range’s special IGP Nisar Tamboli said, “During probe, these duo revealed they are part of a pan-India racket that has duped number of youths from across the country by handing them forged appointment letters.” This was followed by the arrest of Satish Hankare (26), Anand Kamble (24), Gautam Phanse (56) and Abhay Redkar alias Rane (48). Hingoli superintendent of police Rakesh Kalasagar said, “After arresting these accused, our teams finally managed to nab the kingpin, Santoshkumar Saroj (29).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hingoli-police-bust-cheating-racket-nab-7/articleshow/83755200.cms||---

Led by youth wing state president of LIP Sunny Kainth, several youngsters marched from Bharat Nagar Chowk towards mini secretariat with chain and lock. On Monday, the LIP had given a call that it would lock Deputy Commissioer’s office in protest against the decision of state government. But the attempt of LIP was thwarted due to heavy presence of the police force outside and inside mini secretariat. A tussle took place between LIP workers and police and the several of them including Kainth were detained by the police. Meanwhile addressing his supporters before being detained, Kainth said, “After sensing that his political career is finished due to the factionalism in the congress, Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh is now openly engaged into horse trading to save his government. That is why after making false promises with the lakhs of youth of Punjab to give them employment, Captain was only able to give jobs to three youths and all of them are either sons of congress MLAs or brother of Congress MP. So the only qualification for getting a job in Punjab is that you should be relative of a rich congress legislator and nothing else is required” Kainth also added, “As a mark of our protest against this injustice we have come with youth from all over Punjab to lock the office of the deputy commissioner as a symbolic gesture of collapse of the governance in the state. Even if we are unsuccessful in our attempts today or as expected police tried to silence our voice, we will not leave any stone unturned to ensure that the decision to give job to the sons of congress MLAs is reversed by the congress government”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/lip-protesters-detained-following-protest-over-jobs-to-kin-by-cong-govt-with-pic/articleshow/83761776.cms||---

The explosion in the closed quarry had claimed the life of a 45-year-old man and had injured five others on Monday evening. “We couldn’t question any of the injured today,” said city police commissioner R Aaditya. Officials of the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) and forensic experts on Tuesday visited the quarry. “We are awaiting their report to know about the material that had exploded and what had triggered the explosion,” the commissioner said Investigators are trying to find out how the explosives reached the quarry which had been remaining closed for over two years. They have dismissed the argument that the explosives were lying there and had accidentally ignited, considering that they must have got wet in the rains. The argument that explosives were meant for making ‘thotta’ for fishing, also looks unsustainable considering that the explosion was of very high intensity. District collector S Shanawas who visited the spot on Tuesday said a magisterial enquiry would be ordered into the explosion. Thrissur range DIG A Akbar, who visited the spot, said a special investigating team has been constituted under district crime branch DSP Sasidharan to probe the explosion. Meanwhile the BJP state secretary A Nagesh and the DCC president M P Vincent have demanded a thorough probe into the explosion. The quarry belongs to Abdul Azeez who is the brother of Abdul Salam, the former president of the Mullurkara panchayat and CPM leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/quarry-explosion-no-progress-yet-in-probe/articleshow/83759742.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Dehradun||BJP won’t need to change CM again, Congress allegations baseless, says Uttarakhand BJP chief||DEHRADUN: Reacting to Congress’s allegation that state is on the verge of “constitutional crisis” as chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat needs to win an assembly seat before the elections, likely to be held last year, and he cannot contest a bypoll when the assembly election is less than a year away, BJP state president Madan Kaushik said that the Opposition “is simply spreading confusion”. There is no technical or constitutional issue in the appointment of chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat as the governor appoints the CM under article 164 and appointment of ministers is done on the suggestion of the CM, Kaushik asserted. “It is clear in para four of article 164 of the Constitution that a minister who is not a member of the state legislature party for a period of six months shall contest the election within six months, failing which he/she shall cease to be a member. The day the chief minister took oath, more than a year was left for the elections, so we are out of the (purview of) category of 151. According to Nav Prabhat, who was transport minister in the Harish Rawat government, provisions of section 151A of the Representation of the People Act mandate that a bypoll cannot be held in a situation where only a year is left for state polls. “The state is heading towards a constitutional crisis. CM Tirath Singh Rawat’s six-month tenure ends on September 10, BJP will have no option but to name a new chief minister,” Prabhat had told TOI. However, Kaushik brushed aside the contention. The BJP state president said that it is the responsibility of the Election Commission to conduct elections and his party is all set to contest one, “even if the polls are announced tomorrow.” At present, two assembly seats – Gangotri and Haldwani — are lying vacant. Gangotri seat fell vacant on April 22 after the demise of MLA Gopal Rawat while Haldwani MLA Indira Hridayesh passed away this month, resulting in the seat becoming vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-wont-need-to-change-cm-again-cong-allegations-baseless-uttarakhand-bjp-chief/articleshow/83757373.cms||Ishita Mishra

Jaswinder Singh Thukral, president of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JSMA), who is spearheading this campaign said, “If any PSPCL officials thinks that we have forgotten about UUE cases and penalties, he is highly mistaken. Because the protest which we conducted last week was just a small trailer of to what extent we can go for justice. After long discussions with the business associations who supported the protest against PSPCL, we have decided that every Monday we will gherao different divisional office of the department against the atrocities committed by department on the businessmen by slapping such heavy penalties on us” Thukral also added, “Our agitation will start from June 28 at Janta Nagar Power Division office. After this during next weeks we will conduct dharnas the at Estate Division , Focal Point Division, Model Town Division, CMC Division, City West Division, Aggar Nagar Division, Sundar Nagar Division and finally on August 23rd at City centre Division.

---||Goa||With Goa enforcing NEP, no nursery admission before 3 years||PANAJI: The state directorate of education (DoE), which has begun implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP), on Tuesday said a child would now necessarily have to be three years of age at the time of admission to the nursery level. The criterion, which is part of the NEP, will be in force from the current academic year and will ensure that by the time the nursery batch of 2021-22 enters Class I, they will be six years old, which is another requirement under the new policy. Presently, children in Goa are admitted to Class I if they have completed five-and-a-half years of age. Many nursery schools, also known as playschools, admit students at two-and-a-half years or even earlier. “It has been decided, in terms of the NEP 2020, to inform all heads of institutions having nursery classes that the age for admission of the child from academic year 2021-22 onwards for first year of nursery class shall be three years on or before May 31,” director of education D R Bhagat said in a circular to schools. Independent playschools have mushroomed around the state over the past few years and often double up as creches, catering to families where both parents have to report to work. With little monitoring of such independent playschools, some even admit infants. Now, such facilities will no longer be able to double up as nursery schools. “The age of entry at the nursery level will now be three years, which has been done to make it uniform across institutes. As these children go to the higher classes, the entry age to Class I will automatically go up to six years,” said Bhagat. As most schools carry out their admissions much before the academic year begins in June and many may have already admitted students to nursery for 2021-22, the director said schools will have to fall in line and adhere to the latest instructions. “They have to follow this circular,” Bhagat said. Under the NEP, the first five years of education will be known as the foundational stage. This stage of education starts with the nursery year at age three and will include the present KG-1, KG-2, Class I and Class II. After the foundational stage, the child will enter the preparatory stage of education in Class III. Preparatory stage will end at Class V and will be followed by three years of middle school up to Class VIII. Class IX to XII will be known as secondary schooling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-state-enforcing-nep-no-nursery-admission-before-3-yrs/articleshow/83761816.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Delhi||Govt gives Rs 10k each to 1,825 labourers||New Delhi: Delhi government granted Covid relief disbursement of Rs 10,000 each to 1,825 construction workers on Wednesday. Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board gave out the amount under the directions of deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. Delhi government also said that it had already disbursed Rs 5,000 each to 2,17,039 construction workers as Covid relief this year. A government statement said that Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board disburse the relief to construction workers registered with the board as on September 30, 2018. Sisodia said, “I urge all construction workers who were members of the board before September 30, 2018, to renew their membership to be eligible for the benefit.” Sisodia said that when the first lockdown was imposed in 2020, Delhi government was one of the first governments to grant relief in March last year to all the 39,600 workers registered with the board. He said that after taking charge of the labour department in November 2020, he had carried out inspections and mass registration drives in Delhi’s labour offices. “On the basis of these inspections and registration drives, a series of reforms has been carried out in the labour department. As a result of this, within six months, the number of construction workers registered with the Construction Board increased to 2.4 lakh,” he said. Sisodia also pointed out that as part of the registration process, the entire verification process had been shifted online. He said that earlier workers had to stand in long queues for hours to submit registration applications, but now had become quicker and more convenient after going online. The government said that more than 10,000 construction workers will also receive the relief amount in the coming weeks.

---||Aurangabad||AMC token system at vaccination sites||Aurangabad: Amid growing rush at vaccination centres, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided to follow a token system at these sites to ensure social distancing, among other benefits. A day after registering a record 12,293 vaccinations, the local civic body on Tuesday achieved further high of 13,230 vaccinations in a single day. AMC health officer Dr. Neeta Padalkar said that each vaccination site would give 200 doses to citizens above 18-years of age, besides carrying out vaccination of other beneficiaries. “The expanded vaccination drive that covers all citizens above 18 year is causing huge footfall of beneficiaries at the vaccination sites.

Meanwhile, municipal limits of Aurangabad on Tuesday registered only 13 fresh cases of Covid-19 which is also a record low. Aurangabad city now has only 114 active cases, including 52 patients in home isolation and 35 in private hospitals, among others.

Bhullar and his associate Jassi Kharar were killed in an encounter in West Bengal on June 9. Both were wanted in the killings of two ASIs in Jagraon. Kharar was a friend of Baljeet’s nephew Hardeep Singh, a budding artist. On the pretext of sending Hardeep abroad, Kharar had got Baljeet’s documents and bank details from him. The police found during investigation that Bhullar had purchased the village land to run an illicit liquor trade. A labeling machine for liquor bottles too was recovered from the spot. They planned to build a house there as their safe haven. Additional deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “Kharar was a friend of Hardeep, who is an aspiring lyricist. Hardeep wanted to go abroad and Kharar had promised to help him. Therefore, Kharar asked Hardeep to provide ID proofs and bank details. After the death of Hardeep’s father, he had been living with his father’s brother Baljeet Singh. Hardeep provided Bajeet’s bank details and ID proofs to Kharar. These documents were used in purchasing the land in Bhutta village. Baljeet did not know about it and Hardeep was not aware of Kharar’s criminal background.” “In Khanna, when Bhullar had snatched a service weapon from a cop, his wallet had fallen down. It had Bhullar’s fake ID card and some cheques of Baljeet’s account. Bhullar knew police would reach Hardeep and so, he called him to Bhutta village on the pretext of overseeing the construction work. There, Hardeep met Bhullar for the first time. Hardeep was asked to live in Bhutta village so that police could not reach him and Bhullar and his aides could leave Punjab.” During interrogation, police did not find Hardeep and Baljeet’s intentional involvement in any case, said the official. Aides brought on production warrant DCP (crime) SPS Dhindsa said the Ludhiana police have brought Bhullar’s aides Darshan Singh and Baljinder Singh Babbi on production warrant to investigate a Dehlon carjacking case of April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/gangster-bhullar-bought-land-in-village-on-asr-mans-id-proof/articleshow/83757400.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Live-in couple killed child for insurance money||LUDHIANA: A day after a woman and her live-in partner were arrested for killing her nine-year-old daughter, police said the duo committed the murder for insurance money. They tried to make it look like a natural death to get Rs 2.50 lakh claim to repay a loan they took for a plot, but their employer called the police. Victim Bharti’s mother Pinki, 27, and her live-in partner Narinderpal Singh, 31, were produced before a court that remanded them in three days’ police custody on Tuesday. Humbran police post in-charge ASI Harpal Singh said, “In 2010, Pinki, who hails from Faridkot, had got married in Moga. She gave birth to Bharti in 2012. Due to her strained relations with her husband, she left his house when Bharti was eight months old and came to Ludhiana. She started working at a cattle feed factory in Humbran and also got accommodation on its premises. There, she met Narinderpal, the factory owner’s driver. Since 2014, they have been living together and also have a six years old son.” As Narinderpal did not like Bharti, Pinki tried convincing her relatives, including her brother, to adopt her, but nobody agreed. The couple had also sent Bharti to a house to work as a domestic help, but they sent her back after some time, he added.  “In the wee hours of June 20, Narinderpal came back home after his night duty in the factory. Around 2.30am, Pinki gagged Bharti with a dupatta while she was sleeping and Narinderpal strangled her to death. He then went back to duty. When he returned home in the morning, the two took Bharti to a private hospital, where doctors declared her dead,” he said. The couple told everyone that Bharti had suffered a heart attack. When they were planning to cremate the body, the factory owner called the police. The police sent the body for autopsy and the report confirmed she was murdered by strangulation. “During interrogation, the accused revealed that they had bought an insurance policy for Bharti in 2018. In 2019, they had bought a plot for Rs 3 lakh on installments. They had already paid Rs 1.49 lakh to a bank, but were facing problems to repay the remaining installments. Therefore, they made a plan to murder Bharti to get Rs 2.50 lakh insurance money. They decided to repay the loan with the amount and keep the rest of the money with them,” the ASI added. Pinki and Narinderpal have been charged with murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/live-in-couple-killed-child-for-insurance-money/articleshow/83757379.cms||---

Another body surfaced from the bed of the canal 55 km away. The body of Dilshad Ansari, 27, found in a highly decomposed state, was identified with the help of driving licence found in Ansari's pocket. He was a resident of Baghra area of Muzaffarnagar. According to sources, Ansari, a taxi driver, had borrowed the car from a friend on January 17 and was en route to Delhi Airport on the same day when he went missing. Later, his brother Wajid Ansari had filed a missing complaint at the New Mandi police station. Police have now launched a murder probe. Ansari’s father Yunus suspected one of his friends to be behind the murder. “My son and one of his friends used to work together. His friend had sent my son to the Delhi airport to pick up some passengers but he never returned. I want justice,” he said. The other body, also in a car, was found in Sikheda area, 55 km away, from the spot where Ansari’s body was found. It was identified as that of one Harendra Dutt Atre, 61, who went missing in February when he was en route to Meerapur in Muzaffarnagar. According to deputy superintendent of police Himanshu Gaurav, “The family has been informed after identifying the body. Further investigation is being conducted and action will be taken accordingly.” Police sources said Atrey had left home on February 4 and later when the family tried to call him up, his phone was unavailable.

Union health minister Dr Vardhan said Delhi had a pathetic model of governance. Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted: “On a day India vaccinated more than 84 lakh people, Delhi administered only 76,259 out of more than 11 lakh doses available. Why? Instead of focusing on the health and welfare of people of Delhi, Kejriwal Ji is busy in Punjab searching for a Sikh CM face for his party.” Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and general secretary Kuljeet Singh Chahal addressed a press conference at Delhi BJP headquarters on Tuesday where they questioned AAP government’s intentions of vaccination. “Kejriwal’s only aim is to somehow blame the Centre to hide his own shortcomings,” Gupta claimed. Bidhuri urged the LG to hand over the task of vaccination to all the three municipal corporations. “Around 1.8 lakh doses have got wasted so far in the capital, which shows the negligence and laxity on part of the AAP government,” said Bidhuri. Delhi BJP functionary Kuljeet Singh Chahal demanded an audit of the vaccination drive. “It is unfortunate that despite having more than 11 lakh vaccines in stock, deputy CM Manish Sisodia is alleging that the Centre is not providing enough vaccines to Delhi,” Chahal stated. “Only 73 per cent of health workers in Delhi have been vaccinated so far as against the national average of 82 per cent,” Gupta claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-slams-aap-govt-over-lax-vaccination/articleshow/83761879.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The directives were issued after the crime review meeting at the police commissionerate on Tuesday. Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta expressed his displeasure over the poor detection rate in property offences, especially in vehiculral theft and house break-in cases. He sought the reasons for the poor conviction rate. Gupta said the conviction rate in Aurangabad city had dropped to 23%. He asked the officials to raise it to 80%. Between January and May this year, 364 vehicle theft have been reported. Of them, 317 are still undetected. Out of 16 chain-snatchings reported, nine are undetected. While of the 47 house break-ins and thefts reported, only 16 have been detected. This year, 31 mobile theft cases have been lodged, but only 11 detected. Gupta also issued directives for initiating action against cops failing to wear masks in public, riding bikes without helmets or triple-riding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-citys-top-cop-seeks-better-detection-conviction-rates/articleshow/83755294.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Aurangabad||Agents promise appearance as dummy candidate to get learner’s license||Aurangabad: While the new system of issuing learner’s driving license was aimed at doing away with the role of agents besides introducing other citizen-centric reforms, middlemen have now devised a new role for themselves in the delivery of key documents. Authorities concerned have come across social media posts wherein agents are openly reaching out to clients with assurance that they would appear for the necessary online test and deliver license within a day. As per the Facebook posts concerned, agents are attracting applicants seeking Aadhaar-based authentication for generation of learner’ license having mobile number linked that do not require visit to Regional Transport Office (RTO). Appealing applicants not to fall prey to such elements, Regional Transport Officer Aurangabad Sanjay Metrewar said that middlemen would face charges of impersonation if any dummy appearance is attempted during the process of issuing of learner’s license. “The online test before issuing learner’s license is based on basic knowledge about road-safety and traffic rules. Appearing for such test with due preparation is in the best interest of applicants,” he said. The authorities have also said that new system concerned hosted on Parivahan portal (parivahan.gov.in) of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, is undergoing further reforms. “The National Informatics Centre (NIC) is constantly receiving feedback from different RTOs across Maharashtra and other parts of the country on scope of improvement of the new system of issuing learner’s license. In the near future, reforms such as permitting only one test from one IP address and use of face-recognition system using webcam are likely to get incorporated into the system to make it foolproof,” Metrewar said. Besides action against errant agents through multiple authorities, RTO authorities said that applicants taking help of such middlemen and skipping online test would be permanently debarred from getting vehicle driving license. As per the new system, applicant who has Aadhaar card can register for driving license online and get it even without visiting RTO by appearing for the necessary test in online manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/agents-promise-appearance-as-dummy-candidate-to-get-learners-license/articleshow/83755272.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Nashik||All 7 Jalgaon Delta-plus patients were asymptomatic, had not got vax jab||NASHIK: All seven patients from Jalgaon district found infected with the Delta-plus variant of Covid-19 were asymptomatic and recovered after treatment at home. Interestingly, none of them had taken the Covid vaccine, Jalgaon district collector Abhijit Raut told TOI. The seven patients were identified from 100 samples randomly collected from Jalgaon and sent for genome sequencing in the second half of May. Raut said the seven patients are from four different families living in a cluster of villages in one taluka of Jalgaon. They are aged between 20 and 52. None of them had a travel history but a close contact of one of these patients had travelled to a neighbouring state. “As soon as we were informed that these patients have been detected with the Delta-plus variant, we identified and conducted tests of 165 high-risk contacts. Only two of them tested positive for Covid-19. They too were asymptomatic and their samples have been sent for genome sequencing to ascertain if they had the same strain of the virus,” added Raut. District civil surgeon N S Chavan said these seven patients were identified during a contact tracing exercise in their villages. “They did not have any health complications and were advised home isolation. Our teams kept a constant tab on their health,” he added. In the second wave of the pandemic, Jalgaon was the first district in North Maharashtra to register a surge in Covid cases in March this year. During the peak period around first week of May, Jalgaon had 12,000 active cases. This was 4,000 more than the cases at the peak of the first wave last year. Currently, there are only 1,300 active cases and 90% of them are getting treatment at home. “Although Covid cases have declined drastically in Jalgaon, we are continuing to carry out surveillance to test people with Covid-like symptoms. We immediately start their treatment in case they test positive,” said Raut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/all-7-jalgaon-delta-plus-patients-were-asymptomatic-had-not-got-vax-jab/articleshow/83755346.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Nashik||Malegaon power loom units cease operations, 2.5 lakh workers to be affected||NASHIK: The power loom units in Malegaon have ceased operations for an indefinite period starting Tuesday. The decision would adversely affect more than 2.5 lakh workers engaged in these units as they would not be getting their salaries. The 15,000 power loom units in Malegaon — the second-largest textile town after Bhiwandi in the state — produce grey cloth worth over Rs 45 crore daily. This cloth is sold in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu etc. Sajid Ansari, the president of the Malegaon Powerloom Udyog Vikas Samiti, told TOI that various power loom associations that are active in Malegaon have unanimously decided to stop operations indefinitely since their businesses have taken a major hit. “The power loom owners have been bleeding financially as the two Covid waves have taken a heavy toll. On one hand, our finished product remains unsold due to weak demand and on the other, the cost of yarn has skyrocketed. Given this bleak scenario, the power loom owners are unable to sustain the operations,” said Ansari. He added that roughly 90% of the power looms have shut operations from Tuesday and the remaining would do so from Wednesday onwards. The power loom owners have demanded that the Centre immediately start the mills operated by the National Textile Corporation, which will enable them to get yarn at a cheaper rate. This is because the private parties have been selling yarn at a premium which many of the power loom owners cannot afford. “Moreover, there is the smuggling of grey cloth from Bangladesh via West Bengal. Such cloth is sold at a price lower than what we can offer. The Union government must curb this illegal activity,” added Ansari. The power loom owners also want the state government to provide them subsidies to tide over the crisis and waive the energy bills for the past six months. Ansari said the members of the various power loom associations in Malegaon would have a meeting on Monday to chart out the future course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/malegaon-power-loom-units-cease-operations-2-5l-workers-to-be-affected/articleshow/83755332.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Residents in a tizzy to get passport number entered on vax certificates||LUDHIANA: Already jittery over non-resumption of direct international flights and countries not recognising Covaxin, prospective travellers are also facing another problem: getting their passport numbers entered into their vaccination certificates. The doctors and staff at government and private hospitals daily get a lot of visitors who have got themselves vaccinated and want their passport numbers entered in their certificates. A lot of people still do not know that they can do the correction themselves online. According to Dr Harman Sidhu, in charge of a government dispensary, “Many people turn up at the dispensary with a common query that is it possible to get their passport numbers entered in the vaccination certificate if Aadhaar number is already mentioned in it. There is a very simple method for it. Either they can go to any vaccination centre and get the entry corrected or themselves change the ID in the certificate by visiting Co-Win portal and logging into their account.” Pulkit, a resident of College Road, said, “I am planning to fly to Dubai soon, requirements for which are vaccination certificate and a resident card. I came to know that some people are facing issues during entry into some countries in case vaccination certificates do not mention their passport number. Though there is no such instruction from the UAE, I don’t want to take any chances, so I also decided to get my passport number entered into the certificate which had my Aadhaar number mentioned. The procedure is very simple and it took me a few minutes to get it corrected from the centre where I got the vaccine.” Explaining the procedure to enter the passport number in the certificate, Abhinav Sehgal, joint secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, said, “First the person needs to visit https://www.cowin.gov.in/ and sign in with the mobile number which was given by him at the time of getting vaccinated. After this, an OTP will be sent to that number and then the person needs to click on the link of ‘Raise an issue’ and then select the ‘Certificate correction’ option. After this, in the photo ID number option enter the passport number. One has to be very careful while entering the information as the change is allowed only once.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/residents-in-a-tizzy-to-get-passport-number-entered-on-vax-certificates/articleshow/83757445.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Ahmedabad||Caste certificate not needed, rules Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: In an important order, the Gujarat high court has ruled that a candidate who has applied for a government job in reserved category but secures higher marks and opts for general category, is not required to produce a caste certificate. The case involved one Narendra Junawa, who was an applicant under the Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBC) category for the post of staff nurse in the state health department. The recruiting agency was the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). Junawa cleared his written examination with higher marks than the cut-off for the general category in March 2020. He opted for a vacancy in the general category. When he was called for document verification, he produced a caste certificate issued in Rajasthan showing him to be an OBC. He could not produce an SEBC certificate issued by the Gujarat government. He was not selected. Junawa approached the HC and argued that he belongs to the Jat community which is on the central OBC list. However, Gujarat has not notified the community in its SEBC list and therefore he could not produce a caste certificate issued by Gujarat. However, since he opted for the post in the general category, the authorities should not insist on his caste certificate. The VMC insisted that production of the caste certificate was a mandatory condition and an important provision of the recruitment because the candidate had applied for a reserved category. After hearing the case, Jutice A Y Kogje referred to various judgments and concluded that the VMC ought to have treated Junawa’s candidature as an open category candidate looking at his score in the examination. The judge further observed, “As the petitioner is to be treated as a candidate of the general category as a necessary corollary, the requirement of caste certificate of the petitioner being a candidate of the reserved category from an appropriate government, which is the condition prescribed in the advertisement, such requirement will fall into insignificance.” The court ordered VMC to complete Junawa’s recruitment process expeditiously without insisting on production of his caste certificate. After pronouncing the verdict, the HC stayed the order for three weeks at the VMC’s request considering the nature of the dispute pertaining to the recruitment process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/caste-certificate-not-needed-rules-hc/articleshow/83759745.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Visitors at women’s cells wait in open, sit on floor||LUDHIANA: At the women’s cells of Ludhiana police commissionerate, there is not enough room to swing a cat. The space shortage in all four women cells causes inconvenience not only to the police personnel, but also to the visitors, especially those who have to wait with elderly and children. Earlier there was only one women's cell near Lakkar Bridge, besides one women’s police station, but about two years ago three more cells were set up. Now, all four zones of the commissionerate have one women’s cell each to deal with the complaints of their respective zones. The zone-1 cell is being run in an old building near Lakkar Bridge. The condition of the office is such that the visitors have to sit on the floor to wait for their turns. Earlier, the women’s police station was also being run from the building, but then it was temporarily shifted to the office of ACP (Civil Lines). When the TOI team visited the zone-1 cell building, it was in an untidy state. The visitors were standing in an open area under the sun for their turns, while some were sitting on the floor. The washrooms were unhygienic. The furniture seized by the cops in different cases was also kept in the open. Due to rain and the sun, the case properties have been completely damaged. A woman, who had come there with her six-year-old daughter, said, “The investigations take quite a long time. We have to come with children and it is uncomfortable here as there is no waiting room. Some women come with toddlers and wait in the open in harsh weather conditions. There should be at least a waiting area for visitors.” A panellist, who counsels couples, said, “The counselling goes on for hours and one cannot even use the washroom as it is in a pathetic condition. Some complainants come with their elderly parents and some with their children. They suffer due to lack of basic infrastructure.” Sub-inspector Kiran Lata, in charge of the women's cell of zone-1, said they have about 13 cops and somehow they manage work from the building. “The visitors face more problems as there is no waiting space for them. However, the new building is almost complete and soon all women’s cells will be shifted there,” she said. Sub-inspector Kulwant Kaur, in charge of the women's cell of zone-4, said, “We have eight staffers, including five investigating officers. We have got one room in the building of NRI police station. However, due to space crunch, some staffers are accommodated in Division 7 police station.” Zone-2 cell is being run from the Dugri police station. The in-charge has been given one room, and two more staffers operate from the building of zone-1 women’s cell and one investigating officer sits in the building of Sanjh Kendra in Dugri. In zone-3 cell being run in Sarabha Nagar police station, the in-charge and two more investigating officers are given a room, besides two staffers are accommodated in Sanjh Kendra. According to officials, the new building in Rishi Nagar was almost ready and it has a waiting area and a separate room for children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-space-visitors-at-womens-cells-wait-in-open-sit-on-floor/articleshow/83757439.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Dehradun||My government began probing Kumbh test scam a month ago, it came out in the media later, says Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat, who completed 100 days in office a few days ago, spoke to Atul Sethi & Kautilya Singh at his camp office in Dehradun. Looking at the major milestones and challenges in his tenure, he defended the decision to hold Kumbh amidst the Covid pandemic, countering his predecessor Trivendra Rawat’s claims of the event turning into a super-spreader. The CM also spoke about having uncovered the fake Covid testing scam much before it gained media attention and elaborated on his plans for tackling the third wave of Covid and bringing the state’s economy back on track. Excerpts: Uttarakhand has faced a lot of flak for holding the Kumbh when the second Covid wave had started. Looking back, do you think you could have organised the festival differently? I took over as CM just a day before the first major shahi snan of Mahashivaratri was to take place. There were doubts in many people’s minds whether the Kumbh will be held or not. Preparations had been done for months for the festival which comes once in 12 years. The seer community’s faith is deeply connected to the event. Therefore, I announced that we will have a grand and divine Kumbh. Of course, we were aware of the threat of Covid but at that time, it was not at its peak. We said we will follow all guidelines and hold the festival which we did. I think we were quite successful. How do you react to your predecessor Trivendra Rawat’s recent statement that he was in favour of limiting the number of attendees and his worst fears of the Kumbh becoming a super-spreader came true? For people who are saying that the Kumbh Mela was a super-spreader event, I would like to ask them that how come other states then had more Covid cases than Uttarakhand? Did Maharashtra have a Kumbh Mela? Did Delhi-NCR or Punjab have such a festival? Then, how come they recorded so many Covid cases? Even when Covid was at its peak, Haridwar did not have many cases. Other districts like Dehradun, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar were far ahead of Haridwar in terms of the number of cases. You say that Haridwar’s Covid numbers were less than other districts but it has now come to light that this was because of the fake testing scam that was busted recently. Around 1 lakh fake tests were conducted and many of them were shown as negative results. We followed all guidelines during the Kumbh. As far as the irregularities in testing that have come up, they are being probed. Also, I want to reiterate that the moment we spotted the irregularities, a probe was ordered. There was no hiding anything. It has been almost a month since this matter is being investigated by us even though it has come out in the media only recently. Also, the MoUs with the firms who are involved in the fake testing were done much before I took over – in December last year, in fact. We are committed to having a fair probe and punishing the guilty. Are you satisfied with the work that you have done during the first 100 days in office? I have had many plans of vikas (development) for the state but the first 100 days have been spent mainly in dealing with Covid. Nobody had anticipated the scale of the second wave. Even I got infected with Covid, but I utilised the time during quarantine to hold e-chaupals and review work through video-conferencing. We ramped up our facilities to meet the Covid challenge. From a total of 3 oxygen plants that we had, I ensured that there is an oxygen plant in each of the district hospitals and tried to make sure that we also get down to equipping all the community health centres for the third wave. We have appointed 348 doctors and sent them to interior areas – today, there is no block in the state which doesn’t have doctors. I have asked CMOs in each district to recruit nurses and ward boys from the local population and also sanctioned budgets in advance to them. Around 200 dental professionals have been deployed to meet the requirements of qualified health professionals in medical facilities. Final year students of medical colleges have been put on Covid duty. Another big initiative has been regarding children orphaned by Covid. The Vatsalya Yojana initiated by us is different from the schemes started by other states. We have decided to sponsor the complete education of the children who have been orphaned due to Covid – not just higher education but also technical education. Plus we have made provision for a monthly stipend of Rs 3,000 to each child. Even if one parent has passed away, we are considering such children as being eligible for this scheme, and helping them. No other state is doing this. So, is the state fully prepared now for meeting the challenge of the third wave? I am praying there is no third wave but having said that, our preparations are complete. We have strengthened health services on the ground and paid special attention to child healthcare facilities since children are said to be vulnerable during the third wave. We have also reserved hotels to meet the need for beds. I have toured all the 13 districts to check the arrangements myself. The Covid Curfew has had a crushing impact on Uttarakhand’s economy. How are you planning to revive it? We are going to make a big announcement regarding employment generation in the coming days. All I can disclose presently is that we are planning a big recruitment drive in government departments. There will be no department where recruitment does not happen. What about business owners? Traders are facing huge losses; hoteliers and tourism professionals are lamenting about losing two peak tourist seasons due to Covid. I empathise with the losses suffered by businesses but the situation was such that everybody got affected – in every sector, not just in our state but across the country. We have already announced a scheme worth Rs 29 crore for providing help to people of the tourism industry. In addition, we are planning another scheme through which we plan to give an amount every month to personnel associated with the hotel and tourism industry who are facing difficulties. An announcement regarding this will be made soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/my-government-began-probing-kumbh-test-scam-a-month-ago-it-came-out-in-the-media-later/articleshow/83757474.cms||Atul Sethi
---||Delhi||13.2L people without cards get free ration||New Delhi: Over 13.2 lakh beneficiaries who do not have ration cards have been provided foodgrains for free by Delhi government. The AAP government came up with the scheme during the lockdown to help the poor who did not have enough livelihood options and had to go hungry at times. Tens of thousands of unorganised workers, migrant labourers, building and construction workers and domestic helpers continue to face a livelihood crisis. Most of them do not have Public Distribution System (PDS) cards to obtain rations under National Food Security Act. Despite easing of lockdown curbs in the capital, many of them still haven’t found employment. An official said the poor do not need to register themselves to avail of the scheme. They can simply walk into the designated locations or schools where their details, including name, parentage, mobile number, Aadhaar, etc, is taken and an SMS is sent on their mobile numbers. Those without cellphones are provided a code (token) generated in the system to receive the rations. Foodgrains are being distributed at 281 centres across the city. The staff of directorate of education, municipal corporations and other government departments in coordination with the respective district magistrates is carrying out this task. The government has designated one school in every municipal ward for distribution of rations. The distribution of ration among non-PDS cardholders started from June 5. Within just seven days, 4.5 lakh beneficiaries received rations. In the last 10 days, the rush has grown with nearly 8.7 lakh beneficiaries getting free rations. Food minister Imran Hussain said more people than anticipated had turned up at the distribution centres, which led to reports of shortage of grains. “Delhi government has placed an additional order of 5000 metric tonnes of foodgrains with Food Corporation of India. Initially, 5000 MT had been ordered. The second order is being supplied in a staggered manner,” he added. Under the free ration scheme, Delhi government has been providing a kit of 4kg wheat and 1kg rice to each beneficiary. The ration can be availed of at schools and designated centres from 10am to 4pm on all working days. The centres remain closed on Sundays and gazetted holidays. A person who doesn’t have any ID proof or mobile phone can also get ration for himself. If a person has an Aadhaar card, his entire family is entitled to receive rations, the government said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/13-2l-people-without-cards-get-free-ration/articleshow/83761962.cms||AlokKNMishra

The incident occurred in Mala Bhainsoda village when one Dinesh Chandra had gone to relieve himself in the forest on Tuesday morning. When he didn’t return for a long time, his family members started a search operation. Barely a few metres away from his home, Chandra’s body was spotted in the bushes in a mutilated form. The incident has shaken the Pauri district administration as it is the second human death within a fortnight due to leopard attack. Earlier on June 10, a 55-year-old woman was killed by a leopard in the western Ameli forest range of Dabra village.

Drug inspector Jeevan Jadhav said that the seized hypnotic drug is used for inducing sleep and is to be given under medical supervision only. He said that nitrazepam tablets belong to a class of medicines called benzodiazepines. The accused has been handed over to the Vedantnagar police station, where a case under sections of the NDPS Act has been booked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-held-with-banned-drugs-booked/articleshow/83755367.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||C R Paatil wants Paresh Dhanani fined over PIL||AHMEDABAD: The state BJP president C R Paatil has opposed the PIL seeking action for the distribution of remdesivir injections and requested the Gujarat high court to impose a fine on the petitioner, the Congress’s Paresh Dhanani. Paatil said that Dhanani has filed the petition with an ulterior motive. Dhanani, the leader of the opposition in the assembly, filed a PIL seeking action over the distribution of 5,000 remdesivir injections in April from the BJP office in Surat when the drug was in short supply. At the time, there was a sudden surge in Covid cases. In response to the PIL, the state Food and Drugs Control Administration has given a clean chit to Paatil and Surat’s MLA Harsh Sanghavi. In his affidavit filed in the HC on Monday, the BJP’s state chief also maintained that the allegation of hoarding of remdesivir injections was “baseless”. He said the distribution was meant to help Covid patients in the hour of need. “…Availability and facilitation of the injections was done strictly in accordance with the statutory provisions and guidelines issued by competent authorities,” the affidavit said. Paatil urged the HC to reject Dhanani’s PIL with “exemplary cost since the petitioner has not approached the court with clean hands and also not with a view to subserve the public interest”. The injections were distributed to help people and no public injury is caused and therefore the petition is misconceived, the state BJP chief said. Paatil has claimed that Dhanani has not followed the PIL rules laid down by the HC and approached the court without any verification of the news reports on the issue. Dhanani’s petition does not mention what steps he has taken to verify facts, Paatil said. Dhanani in his official capacity could have approached statutory authorities to find out the truth but instead rushed to the court, Paatil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/paatil-wants-dhanani-fined-over-pil/articleshow/83759757.cms||---

The forest officials tried to unite the cubs with their mother twice, but were unsuccessful due to the rains. They have decided to give it another try on Tuesday night. “The villagers had found three leopard cubs at the farm in Shivade village near Pandhurli on Friday. Due to tumult of the villagers, the mother leopard ran away leaving the cubs behind,” senior forest official Pravin Sonawane said. “One of the three cubs died while we picked the two other cubs. They were just five-day-old when we found them and their eyes were also not open. We tried unite them with their mother on the weekend, but could not do it due to the rains. The health of both the cubs is good and we are planning to reunite them with their mother later tonight (Tuesday),” he added. This is the second time the forest department has found the leopard cubs in the last four weeks. Last month, the forest department had found two cubs and successfully reunited with their mother near Deolaligaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/two-leopard-cubs-found-in-nashik-farm/articleshow/83755393.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||Pune: Private hospital slots free up as 18+ wait for free jabs||PUNE: The announcement of free vaccines for the 18-plus at civic-run centres has freed up hundreds of slots across private hospital sites, where beneficiaries have to pay for the shots. In the PMR, the PMC is set to start the free drive for the 18-plus from Wednesday. On Tuesday, citizens tracking vaccine availability across Pune said slots at private hospitals were now taking hours to be booked, instead of seconds, which was the trend some days ago. A search on CoWin showed that out of the 51 paid vaccination sites in Pune district, 14 had several slots open for bookings on Tuesday. Some sites even had a few hundred vacant slots. Suchdeep Juneja, who started mhVaccineTracker for Maharashtra, said, “The number of slots at private sites significantly increased after June 21 night. It seems people in the 18-plus group seem to be waiting for the free drive at civic-run sites across the state.” Juneja said a private site in Pune city on Monday opened 2,000 paid slots for June 22 at 8:19pm. “Till 11am on Tuesday, that site still had 1,600 vacant slots. That was not the case until recently when those slots would get booked in seconds,” he said. Sources from the central government said the availability of more slots, for longer, also indicated improved vaccine supply to the district. But a senior health ministry official said, “This is because we have also made a minimum 50% online capacity (those booking via CoWin) mandatory for government sites in urban areas. Slot availability at private sites has also improved because some are turning to government centres for their vaccines.” Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said: “People who can afford paid shots should take them from private hospitals for two reasons: government is still allowing vaccine manufacturers to sell doses to private sites. Two, the cost of vaccination in private sites is minimal, so, free doses should be left for people from lower income groups and those in economic difficulty.” Sanil Mahajan, a city-based working professional who has been helping friends with CoWin appointments, said bookings have become easier to make. “Recently, I struggled to get my domestic help a vaccine slot. It took me at least three days to get an appointment. But in the last 48 hours, hundreds of slots have opened up at private sites. And they continue to show as available even after 6pm.” A 19-year-old Kondhwa resident said, “On Monday, I immediately found slots at nearly 20 private hospitals. I had been trying to get an appointment for days.” Berty Thomas, a programmer who developed ‘under45.in’, a vaccine slot-tracking website said, “In Bengaluru too, ever since the Centre announced free vaccines for everyone over 18, there has been a drop in demand for jabs at private centres.” Ankita Garg, co-founder of Questrack app, which lets users filter alerts by vaccine price and pin code, said, “Our latest app usage data, on how users from metros are filtering their alerts, has shown that about 43% of people are not interested in paid vaccination slots anymore.” In Mumbai too, Lilavati Hospital, which opened 600 slots at 6pm on Tuesday, had around 450 available even after an hour. On Monday, when a private centre in Borivli opened 2,000 slots for Tuesday, as many as 1,500 slots were available 24 hours later. On the contrary, government centres for the 30+ category in Mumbai went red within minutes of opening.

State minister for social welfare Vijay Wadettiwar had on Monday said they would not let local body elections in Maharashtra until the OBC political quota issue was sorted out. The state election commission on Tuesday announced the programme in five zilla parishads and 33 panchayat samitis.

---||Hyderabad||Commercial rollout of Sputnik V delayed||HYDERABAD: The full-fledged commercial rollout of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V has been pushed back by at least two weeks due to supply-related issues and mandatory clearances from the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) at Kasauli. Even as Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, the Indian partner of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), is awaiting clearance from CDL Kasauli for the 3 million doses that arrived from Russia earlier this month, the arrival of the second dose component is delayed, top officials at Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said. The biggest tranche of 3 million doses of the first dose component (vector Ad26) landed in Hyderabad on June 1 but second tranche of the second dose component (Ad5) is yet to arrive and is expected to arrive by the end of the month, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories CEO API & services Deepak Sapra told TOI. Sapra also indicated that clearances from CDL Kasauli for the first tranche of 3 million doses are expected any day now. Dr Reddy’s Labs had indicated that a full-fledged rollout would happen in mid-June but the limited pilot soft launch continues well after a month after it began in Hyderabad on May 14. Dr Reddy’s has since scaled up the limited pilot to Vizag, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Baddi, Chennai, Miryalaguda, Kolhapur and now Vijayawada, Nagpur, Raipur and Chandigarh. However, the company had said it would be vaccinating only its own employees as part of the pilot that is aimed at testing the cold chain as Sputnik V requires storage temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius. Dr Reddy’s received 1.5 lakh doses of the first dose on May 1, followed by 60,000 doses of the second dose on May 16, which were deployed in the pilot rollout. Sputnik V is the third vaccine to be granted emergency use nod by the Indian drug regulator and could have helped ease the vaccine shortages that the country is facing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/commercial-rollout-of-sputnik-v-delayed/articleshow/83762197.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The second wave also peaked and ended much quicker as compared to the first wave. The first case of Covid-19 was detected on March 20 last year when a Spain-based NRI tested positive at the SSG Hospital (SSGH). This was ahead of the nationwide lockdown clamped the central government. The cases continued to rise gradually and reached the peak of the first wave on September 19, 2020, when 135 new cases were registered in Vadodara city. Sources said that the first wave was slow to catch up with the city and district due to the lockdown. If the lockdown delayed the peak, festivities ensured that the wave did not end early. The number of new cases registered every day were coming down gradually, but the Diwali festivities gave a spike and cases started to rise for over two weeks from November 12, 2020. The spike continued till November 19 when 113 cases were registered. After hitting a low of 41 cases in February this year, the numbers started increasing steadily from February 23 and peaked on May 7. It is believed that the graph did not go down below 41 due to the local body polls in the state. The sharp downward slope after May 7 has brought much needed respite to the health officials. “We are now able to focus on vaccination and other aspects. The monsoon has started and needs attention,” said an official. VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that usually such epidemics increased and decreased at the same rate. “But vaccination and the high number of infections in the second wave may have ensured that the numbers went down sharply,” he said. When asked if the trend would continue, Patel said that this would depend on public behaviour when restrictions were eased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sharp-rise-sharper-decline-marks-vadodaras-second-wave/articleshow/83755725.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Congress again politicising SIT probe into Kotkapura firing incident, says Akali Dal||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has alleged that the Congress government in Punjab was again politicising the state police SIT probe into the Kotkapura police firing incident by deputing an unauthorised person to question five-times chief minister Parkash Singh Badal at his residence on Tuesday. Akali Dal’s Prem Singh Chandumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Daljit Singh Cheema said the entire run up to the questioning of the SAD patron by SIT as well as making a former director (prosecution) part of the team indicated that the Congress government was bent upon politicising the entire issue. Addressing the mediapersons, they said that the retired officer Vijay Singla, who did not hold any official position, was made part of the SIT team after one member – DIG Surjit Singh was left out. “The prosecution steps in only when the challan is presented in the court. How can the former director prosecution be made part of the SIT team,” asked the Akalis. They alleged that the SIT was working on the directions of “the chief minister’s kitchen cabinet, including advisor B I S Chahal”. Grewal said though Badal had cooperated with the SIT as committed by the party despite not being well, it was strange that a former chief minister was being questioned in an attempt to murder case registered under section 307 IPC. He said it was a matter of fact that the Kotkapura firing incident, in which one person was injured, took place on the orders of the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) who first ordered a lathicharge and use of water cannons before giving orders to open fire. “Instead of questioning the then chief minister in the case, the concerned SDM should be questioned,” he added. The Congress government was also indulging in contempt of court by questioning Badal on the issue of phone calls made by him to the Faridkot deputy commissioner a night prior to the firing incident at Kotkapura, he said, adding the high court had ruled in the case that the CM was well within his rights to ring the deputy commissioner. The SAD leader also questioned the manner in which the new SIT chief – L K Yadav had been “promoted overnight” as ADGP to enable him to head the SIT even though 32 ADGPs were available to hold the inquiry. Chandumajra and Cheema said it was unfortunate that the chief minister and his coterie were misusing the police in the same manner they had done by using former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap to attack SAD. They said the high court had exposed the former police officer by holding him responsible for conducting a politically motivated and malicious inquiry into the Kotkapura firing issue. “The very fact that the Congress government allowed Kunwar to take premature retirement instead of registering a case against him after he was indicted by the high court proves that AAP and the Congress both were part of the conspiracy to defame the SAD,” they said, adding the party would protest against any probe which sought to politicise the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-again-politicising-sit-probe-into-kotkapura-firing-incident-akali-dal/articleshow/83762000.cms||---

Among doctors too, there is yet to be consensus over administration of flu shots as some believe they do work against Covid-19 while others are of the opinion they are only effective against the flu. Another group is of the opinion that these shots are unnecessary as children already have several vaccines administered to them in their early years. However, in the wake of the pandemic, the lack of a common stance over the issue has resulted in concern among several parents. “I had consulted two different paediatricians and got conflicting views. One doctor said that there are some studies which show that flu vaccine might prevent Covid-19, another said that it won’t but it will at least prevent flu which is very common during this time of the year. Also, since flu and Covid-19 have similar symptoms, in case of the kid being given flu vaccine, identifying Covid will be easier,” said Sushma Jain, mother to a five year old. Another reason doctors are advocating flu shots is that with more children being protected from flu, the requirement for hospital beds in case of a third wave will be reduced as lesser number of kids will fall ill due to flu. “Flu vaccine giving protection against Covid-19 is just a hypothesis, it is not proven. It is being recommended that all children take flu vaccines for the next two to three years. On one hand it makes diagnosis easier and on the other it cuts down the need for hospitalisation for flu. That way, our healthcare system can cater more effectively to children affected by Covid-19. However, there is no need to frantically rush for the vaccine thinking it will protect from Covid-19 and it (the flu vaccine) can be taken later in July or August too. The flu vaccine will only protect from flu,” informed Dr Sharmila K, senior consultant paediatrician at Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-need-to-rush-over-flu-vaccines-to-kids-say-doctors/articleshow/83761859.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Delhi||No shortcuts: Exercise of mind, body key when Covid casts long shadow||NEW DELHI: For Covid-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms, the fight against disease doesn’t end with a discharge from the hospital. In 30-40% of these cases, doctors say the fight continues even at home. The World Health Organization suggests that one can manage the post-Covid complications oneself with guidance from the treating physician. A policy document issued by the United Nations health body on self-management after Covid states that it is common to experience breathlessness after the illness. “Feeling breathless can make you feel anxious, which can make breathlessness worse,” it says. The World Health Organization advisory says staying calm and learning the best way to manage breathlessness, for example by leaning forward or standing with back support, will help. Exercise is an important part of recovery after a severe Covid-19 bout, says World Health Organization. Dr Neeraj Nischal, assistant professor, department of medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, agreed. He said. “Many people think they must rest completely for a week or more for faster recovery. This is not required. In my opinion, a person should resume physical activity and exercise in a graded manner for better recovery.” According to Dr Sanjeev Sinha, professor of medicine, AIIMS, the most common post-Covid complications are recurrent fever, breathlessness, fatigue and lack of sleep. “Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are also common. We refer such patients for counselling,” Sinha said. Many hospitals in NCR are running post-Covid care programmes that include consultations with a pulmonologist, physiotherapist, dietician and psychological counselling. “Long Covid symptoms like fatigue, cough, breathlessness on exertion, fever, palpitations, brain fog, anxiety and insomnia are the commonest signs,” informed Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket. “Very few patients have cardiac and neurological complications. Secondary infections like Urinary tract infection (UTI) are also common. Adequate sleep, good nutrition, yoga, meditation and pulmonary rehabilitation aid quicker recovery.” Tickoo added that the need for hospitalisation was rare in recovered patients. However, he said people needed to be watchful of warning signs such as severe breathing difficulty, irregular heartbeat and loss of consciousness that may warrant urgent medical attention. Post-Covid complications are categorised into three phases depending on the persistence of symptoms. In acute Covid, symptoms can persist for up to four weeks. In symptomatic Covid, the symptoms can persist for four to 12 weeks. But there are also patients who continue to have symptoms, residual effects of the infection, for over 12 weeks and this phenomenon is being described as ‘Long Covid’. It is a patient-coined term. Long Covid, experts say, was initially talked about by support groups started by patients who described the constellation of symptoms that continued to affect the infected individual weeks after the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-shortcuts-exercise-of-mind-body-key-when-covid-casts-long-shadow/articleshow/83759768.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

In a survey conducted by LocalCircles, which received little over 1,600 responses, 31% of respondents said that they will wait for one to three months and then consider whether or not to get their children vaccinated based on data/findings. 49% said that they will get their children vaccinated if the vaccine is made available by September 2021. Around 14 per cent said that they will not get their children vaccinated in 2021 and 6% opted for the ‘can’t say’ option. To another question on whether they will be willing to send their children to schools if physical classes are resumed, 26% of the total 1,789 respondents said that they will send whenever schools reopen. 15% of them said that they will send their children to schools only if there are no Covid-19 cases in their district, 24% said that they send if there are no cases in their district and nearby districts as well. A majority, 33%, of respondents said that they are not ready to send their children to school until they are vaccinated and 2% opted for the ‘can’t say’ option. When it comes to parents across the country, 76% of 10,826 Indian parents who were part of the survey said they are not ready to send their children to school till cases in their district go down to zero or children get vaccinated. In the last four months, the percentage of parents willing to send their kids to schools has reduced from 69% to 20%. Likewise, 65% of parents of 8,452 parents approve of their children receiving the Covid-19 vaccine if it is made available by September 2021. Telangana is the only state that is planning to start physical classes from July 1. However, parents and managements of several schools are against the move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/49-parents-in-t-ready-to-send-kids-to-school-once-vaccinated/articleshow/83762247.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The deceased has been identified as Vinayak Ganpat Nagare, a farmer from Chadegaon. Upnagar police have booked the driver of the tanker for causing death due to negligence. “The accident took place at around 11 am. The speeding tanker ran over Nagare when he was riding towards Nashik Road after crossing the Datta Mandir junction,” a police officer said. According to eye-witnesses, the tanker was at such a speed that it dragged the bike of the victim for at least 100 feet away before coming to a halt. The traffic on the already busy Pune road was also affected due to the accident. Senior officers and personnel of the Upnagar police station rushed to the spot and cleared the vehicular traffic along with detaining the accused driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/biker-dies-in-accident-on-nashik-pune-highway/articleshow/83755423.cms||---

Khader, an engineer by education, was a soulful poet who stirred the poetic sensibilities of Malayalalis for decades and yet lived an unassuming life. The light music songs of Khader were roaring hits in the late 1970s and ’80s. As Khader teamed up with ace music composer M G Radhakrishnan, a generation of music lovers used to patiently wait for their songs to be broadcast on Akashvani radio at 7:30 every morning. The songs ‘Jayadeva Kaviyude Geethikal Kettente Radhe Urakkamayo’ and ‘Ramayanakkili Sarikappainkili Rajeevanethrane Kando’ have assumed the envious proportion of classics as they have turned out to be evergreen light-music songs in Malayalam. “Perhaps, these two light-music songs were the most preferred ones for students who participated in school, college youth festivals for decades. They still exude a refreshing charm,” said poet-lyricist Prabha Varma, who had a pretty long association with Khader. Khader was undoubtedly one of the most prolific lyricists ever in Malayalam cinema. He penned around 1,400 songs for about 400 films. For over a decade, Khader was an inevitable ingredient in the new formulaic cinema of the ’80s that came into being with the rise of new stars and star directors like I V Sasi. “Poovachal Khader was an ingenious person and a prolific poet-lyricist. His songs such as ‘Nadha Neevarum Kalocha Kelkkuvan’ and ‘Adya Samagama Lajayiladhyamay’ marked the first-rate poet in Khader. The fact that Khader, despite being a very busy lyricist, could still maintain the link with poetry underscored his genius,” says poet-lyricist Rafeeq Ahamed. Though major awards never came his way, Khader was not a person to feel a let-down about it. He was happy for the popularity of his songs and never ever nursed any grouse against anybody for denying him an award. Still, at least a few think that Khader had misspent significant time and talent by choosing to swim along with the commercial interests of cinema, which many times did restrict his poetic talent to match with cinema’s mediocrity. But a writer is known for his good works only. The fact that he produced scores of evergreen songs like ‘Sararanthal Thiri Thazhum Mukilin Kudilil’ and ‘Adyasamagama Lajjayiladyamay, Mouname Nirayum Mouname’ stand testimony to his poetic genius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cinema-loses-poetic-soul-with-khaders-demise/articleshow/83759791.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government set to call for school fee concessions||HYDERABAD: The state government is said to have schools managements to offer fee concessions for the academic year 2021-22. This will come as a relief to parents of school students who have been fighting for over a year to get fee concessions in the wake of the pandemic. However, while the state has reportedly called for a 30 per cent fee concessions, managements of private budget schools are considering a fee concession between 10 and 15 per cent. “During the last academic year, there was no fee hike. The same is the case with this academic year as well as many schools have decided against increasing the fee amid the pandemic. This means that parents have already received about 20% to 30% concession. As the state has asked to give some concession, we are contemplating to give another 10% to 15%,” said Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) president Y Shekhar Rao. The TRSMA president said that a final decision will be taken on Wednesday during the meeting with state education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy. Meanwhile, members of the Independent Schools Management Association (ISMA) said that they will decide on concessions after meeting the minister. The ISMA said that instead of announcing blanket relief to all parents, schools should be asked to deal on a case to-case basis. “If genuine requests for fee concession are not entertained by managements, the state can ask district-level officials to intervene and ensure that they get concession,” said ISMA president, KV Praveen Raju. He said that several schools are already providing concessions to parents who are facing financial constraints due to the pandemic. During the academic year 2020-21, the government had released GO-46 on fee regulations directing schools to not hike the fee and collect only tuition fees on monthly basis. However, many schools have clubbed the entire fee into the tuition fee and collected the same from parents. Ever since, parents have been demanding the state to direct schools to provide at least 50 per cent concession on annual fees as schools are conducting only online classes. GO-46 will most likely be implemented this year as well. “When we are buying gadgets, providing internet access, and acting as teachers at home, it is only fair that schools reduce the fee by 40 to 50 per cent. They are saving a lot as classes are being conducted in online mode and the same should be extended to parents,” said Uma V, whose son is studying in class 10 at a private school in Kukatpally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-set-to-call-for-fee-concessions/articleshow/83761926.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The Centre, however, will provide only 65 lakh doses for the whole month. Taking up the issue, health minister Raghu Sharma has written to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan highlighting the shortage of vaccines in the state. “If we vaccinate all beneficiaries eligible for the second dose in July, we will not have any left for those requiring the first dose," Sharma said. Out of the 65 lakh doses allocated for July, over 16 lakh will be given to private hospitals. After that, the state will be left with around 49 lakh doses in July. A health department official said that Sharma has requested the Centre to increase the allocation of vaccine from 65 lakh to 1.5 crore next month. Sharma also pointed out that 3.34 crore eligible people have not yet received the first dose of vaccine. While over two crore doses were available across the country on Tuesday morning, Rajasthan has only around two lakh doses with it. According to the Centre, over 2.14 crore (2,14,90,297) Covid vaccine doses were still available with states and UTs on Tuesday morning. The health department has chalked out a strategy to scale up vaccination by organising worksite camps and also by conducting drives offline in rural areas. Since the third wave of Covid is expected soon, the government has decided to ramp up the drive by providing doses to people across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-to-face-acute-shortage-of-covid-vax-in-july-health-min/articleshow/83762035.cms||---

However, with its carrying capacity drastically reduced to ensure strict Covid norms, queues outside its stations now crawl at rush hours. Metro commuters have to wait for anything between 25 to 40 minutes before they can even enter Metro stations, the doors of which are intermittently closed during peak hours to ensure adequate social distancing. Delhi Metro resumed services on June 7, four weeks after operations were completely suspended to contain the spread of Covid-19 and 48 days after its doors were closed to passengers not engaged in essential services. However, with only 50% seating capacity and no standing passengers allowed, the carrying capacity has reduced by more than 80%. The stringent Covid norms have led to people trying to stagger their travel times as much as possible and the ridership, as a result, increased in the fortnight since metro reopened. When Delhi Metro reopened for the public on June 7, a Monday, it witnessed 6.4 lakh passenger journeys, which increased to 10.3 lakh by Friday, June 11. With more relaxations allowed as part of the Unlock process, Metro’s ridership increased to 13.1 lakh passenger journeys on Monday, June 14, which further went up to 13.2 lakh last Friday. Before the lockdown, Delhi Metro was witnessing around 20 lakh passenger journeys a day, but passengers were allowed to stand within one feet of distance back then. “Trains are now available at 2 to 5 minute intervals during peak hours,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. “In case the waiting time is more than 20 minutes, we are informing people about it through social media.” A large number of commuters can now be seen at bus stops as well. However, as buses have to follow the same restrictions as the Metro, handling the rush is proving difficult. While most of Delhi Transport Corporation and Cluster Scheme buses are also operating at optimum frequency, officials said till the time restrictions are relaxed, the present fleet of public transport buses can’t cope with the increased rush. As autorickshaws, taxis and cabs also not allowed to ply with more than two people, Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters Association has also requested chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to allow more passengers in para-transit vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/number-of-commuters-up-public-transport-cant-cope-due-to-curbs/articleshow/83762053.cms||Sidharatha Roy

They will be part of consultations over the reopening of schools, fee concessions, and plans for the academic year. Managements said the minister had sought the meeting as the state plans to reopen schools from July 1. “It would be better if schools are reopened in a phase-wise manner instead of resuming physical classes for all students from July 1,” said TRSMA president Y Shekhar Rao. He said the association, which has 10,000 schools as its members, has collected views from management across the state and will be putting those forth for the government’s consideration. The association said the state should not ask schools to conduct both online and offline classes. They were of the view that physical classes should only be conducted for students of classes 8 to 10. “For the time being, it would be better if online classes are continued for students of classes 1 to 7,” said Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/school-mgmts-bat-for-phased-reopening/articleshow/83778235.cms||---

The minister also expressed his unhappiness at the “improper implementation” of the Rs 105 crore relief package for fishermen announced by the state government after Cyclone Tauktae ravaged coastal areas last month. “It is true the BJP is in power. But, let me tell you very frankly. Fishermen do not get much under BJP rule. No one (in the government) has bothered to address their issues. Although I am also part of the government, I can’t do much about it. This is also a fact,” Solanki told reporters in Gandhinagar. The Bhavnagar (Rural) MLA belongs to the Koli community which is one of the three major communities engaged in fishing in Gujarat along with Kharvas and Muslims. “Though the relief package was announced after the cyclone, it has not been implemented properly. Moreover, the package is not enough for those living on the coastline. I believe the government should increase the amount,” Solanki said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-has-not-bothered-to-help-fisherfolk-solanki/articleshow/83759796.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Fewer kids got Covid than estimated, says Telangana government||HYDERABAD: Contrary to popular belief that impact of Covid-19 on children increased substantially during the second wave, the state health department figures reveal otherwise. In fact, less number of kids (0-10 years) were affected during the second wave. As compared to the agegroup accounting for 4.2% of total Covid-19 cases during the first wave, the group accounted for 2.7% cases in the second wave. The percentage in the 11-20 year age-group has, however, seen an increase from 9% to 10.5%, showing a marginal decline overall in percentage of kids hit by Covid-19. Experts, meanwhile, predict no drastic change in the percentage even in future waves, if any. The reason kids were less impacted was because of low ACE-2 receptors. The spike protein in coronavirus basically attaches itself to ACE-2 receptors to infect the body. “Children have less number of ACE-2 receptors when compared to adults, which is why we see less infections in them. Even among children, the younger ones 0-10 years have far less number of ACE-2 proteins which explains why the younger ones were affected less,” said Dr Satish Ghanta, neonatologist and paediatric intensivist, Little Stars Children’s Hospital. Although, the percentage has remained largely similar, the number of kids affected was more due to overall number of cases being more, he added. However, of the total number, only 2-3% kids had to be hospitalised and this is also not likely to increase beyond 5% in the future. “What parents need to do instead of panicking is to empower themselves with the right knowledge about first aid for fever, seizures, vomiting and diarrhoea. They need to be thorough with the symptoms of Covid-19 and MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children) , which we have seen in kids in the second wave. Also, parents need to be proactive in testing for the virus, and in reaching out to the paediatrician at the earliest,” said Dr Sivaranjani Santosh, chief paediatrician, Magna Centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fewer-kids-got-covid-than-estimated-govt/articleshow/83761839.cms||Amrita Didyala

After a gap of 15 months, the government has granted permission to all educational institutions to commence in-person classes. Though many schools had conducted mass vaccination drives on their premises so far, several have now taken the same approach. Methodist College of Engineering and Technology and Aurora Degree and PG College will hold a drive on June 23. “We are conducting a mega vaccination drive, where many of our staff and students are set to get vaccinated. We are offering Covishield at a cost of Rs 800 and the drive is open for all individuals above 18,” said Arjuna Rao, associate professor, department of computer science, Aurora Degree and PG College. Colleges have tied up with private hospitals to conduct vaccination drives. Similar drives were being planned by many colleges and state universities. Some were even guiding students on enrolling themselves on CoWIN app to schedule their vaccination. Some engineering colleges have sent out messages stating vaccination for students, teachers and non-teaching staff was mandatory before commencement of physical classes. “All faculty, supporting staff and students must be vaccinated before coming to college (July 1) except in the case of Covid-19 positive in last two to three months. They need to show the vaccination certificate/Covid-19 positive certificate on demand,” an autonomous engineering college said in a message to stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/colleges-hold-vax-drives-to-inoculate-students-and-staff/articleshow/83761987.cms||---

The accused, T Nagendra Babu, was recently arrested by Cyberabad police in similar cases. According to deputy commissioner of police (DCP), West Zone, A R Srinivas, a complaint was lodged by Vamsi, manager of film producer Suresh Babu, with Jubilee Hills police on Monday alleging that a fraudster called them a few weeks ago promising to provide 500 doses of vaccine to the staff. The fraudster demanded Rs 1 lakh as advance to set up vaccination programme and Vamsi transferred the amount to a bank account given by the accused. As the accused did not get back, a police complaint was lodged on Monday and a cheating case was registered. Meanwhile, Jubilee Hills police came to know that the fraudster was arrested by Cyberabad cyber crime police for committing similar frauds. Five days ago, Cyberabad police had arrested T Nagendra Babu, 27, a chef at a hotel in Chennai, for duping a TV channel manager of Rs 1.5 lakh and Tollywood actor Ali of Rs 1 lakh by promising to arrange Covid-19 vaccination for staff and co-workers. Babu had also duped a garments store owner in Jubilee Hills of Rs 1 lakh by promising to provide vaccination. Police also realised that Babu had duped another film actor for about Rs 1 lakh by promising to ensure an award, and he also duped three others from the city and Vijayawada in the guise of providing fancy phone numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fraudster-cons-film-bigwigs-with-vax-promise/articleshow/83762062.cms||---

Some sections of the community are unhappy with the silent protest led by Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati and ironically they have decided to take to streets to make their point. On Monday, Sambhajiraje had announced to defer the silent sit-in-protests for a month and expected the government to resolve all demands of the community. The activists said they will hit the streets again on June 26. Baba Indulkar, Maratha activist and a lawyer, said, “We will be satisfied only if we get the reservation. The demands put up before the government will give temporary relief to the community. We want a reservation that will stand the legal test. For reservation to stand legal test, granting reservation under OBC is the only way.” Several local BJP leaders, including district president Samarjeetsinha Ghatge, were also seen attending the protest. He had earlier declared that he will be participating as a member of the Maratha community. Most of the prominent activists participating in the protest on Tuesday had stayed away from the silent sit-in-protest led by Sambhajiraje at Kolhapur’s Shahu Samadhi Sthal last week. “The Maratha community is free to decide the mode of agitation as the ultimate aim will remain the same, to get reservation,” Ghatge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/maratha-activists-block-tararani-chowk-demand-obc-quota/articleshow/83755452.cms||---

Virendra Tiwari, chief of mangrove conservation cell, said that since 2005, when the Bombay high court first declared mangroves as protected forests, the state government had settled all rights and claims for 1,700 hectares, while in just one year, it managed to complete the entire process for final declaration of mangrove land as reserved forest for 9,800 hectares. The fast-tracking of the process was taken up by environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who set timelines and held review meetings every month. “We only ensured that all relevant departments, districts and agencies sat together, picked up responsibilities and timelines for measuring mangrove land, settling claims and disputes, checking on exclusion requests and handover to the forest department,” Thackeray said. All these mangrove lands were owned by various government agencies. “The claims were normally for right of way and water. No monetary compensation has been paid,” Tiwari said. Apte added that lands reserved for crematoria, private land were excluded in this round. The state has identified 17,000 hectares of mangrove land across the state. The process begins with the government announcing its intention to declare a certain plot as reserved forest. This is followed by the revenue department appointing a sub-divisional officer to settle all claims and rights, to hear grievances and decide on whether the request for exclusion is genuine. Once this process is completed, a final notification is issued under Section 20 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. “The completion of the process helps the forest department and the mangrove conservation cell take physical possession of the land and secure it against any kind of encroachment. Once declared as a reserved forest, it is very difficult to divert it for any development work and the proposal needs to go right up to the Centre. Even to cut mangroves requires permission from the high court,” said Apte. Environmentalist Debi Goenka, who had filed the PIL for protection of mangroves, said while this was good news, valuable chunks of mangrove land, within Mumbai Metropolitan Region, especially in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai were still to be handed over to the mangrove conservation cell. “It is surprising that though Thackeray is personally supervising the entire exercise, these agencies are still holding on to the mangrove lands,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-notifies-9800ha-mangrove-land-as-reserved-forest-in-1-year/articleshow/83764203.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Dehradun||Haridwar resident seeks CBI probe in Covid test scam at Kumbh||NAINITAL: A Haridwar resident on Tuesday filed an urgent relief application in the Uttarakhand high court (HC), seeking a CBI inquiry into the Covid-19 testing scam during Kumbh in Haridwar. The petitioner, Sachdanand Dabral, claimed that fraud on such a large scale could not have been achieved without connivance of Mela or health officials and demanded that the 1,600-page report by the health department on the scam be submitted to the court. Dabral’s application has been moved into a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on the general Covid situation in Uttarakhand already pending before the court. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said the PIL will be heard on Wednesday. Citing TOI’s reports which highlighted that over 1 lakh Covid tests had been faked by one of the nine agencies hired by the Mela administration, the petitioner, Dabral, said that the issue is a matter pertaining to “national prestige” and should be probed in entirety. “One lakh fake tests cannot be done without the help of Mela or health officials. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) accredited agencies and laboratories were supposed to be given contracts but all rules were flouted by the mela officials. To unearth the (possible) large-scale conspiracy, a fair and impartial enquiry should be done by CBI,” read the petition. The application adds that there may be pressure on police and district officials to “give a clean chit to the real co-conspirators and government officials” involved in the scam and therefore, in the larger public interest, the court should hand over the probe to the CBI. As reported by TOI, many people who had never been to Haridwar had received their “Covid test reports” and even shown as “sample collectors” at Kumbh. Hundreds of test reports were made with a single address or a single phone number. On June 17, an FIR was filed against Max Corporate Services, the agency accused of doing the fake tests, and the two labs deployed under it: Nalwa Laboratories Private Limited and Dr Lal Chandani Labs Limited, both accredited by ICMR. A special investigation team (SIT) has been formed by Haridwar Police to probe the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-resident-seeks-cbi-probe-in-covid-test-scam-at-kumbh/articleshow/83757644.cms||Prashant Jha

Joshi has been asked to appear before the crime branch at 11am on June 24. Joshi has been called for questioning at Prashant Vihar office of the Delhi crime branch in Rohini. The notice has been issued by inspector Satish Malik. When contacted, Joshi said, “I am out of Jaipur. I came to know about it through social media. I will respond to it after reaching Jaipur." He also added that he "was not aware of any FIR" registered against him in Delhi. “You are hereby informed to appear before the undersigned on June 24 at 11am at SOS-I crime branch, Prashant Vihar, Rohini Sec 14, New Delhi,” said the notice. Shekhawat had lodged an FIR also against chief minister Ashok Gehlot's OSD Lokesh Sharma and others in the phone tapping case. Sharma had approached the Delhi High Court to quash the FIR lodged by the crime branch against him. The court had asked the crime branch not to take any action against him and posted it for next hearing on August 6. Last year, Mahesh Joshi had lodged an FIR with SOG and ACB against Shekhawat and others on the basis of leaked audio clips of phone calls in which Shekhawat is allegedly heard talking to a middleman and MLAs of the Sachin Pilot camp in the conspiracy to topple the Congress government in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-summon-joshi-to-delhi-in-phone-tapping-case/articleshow/83762085.cms||---

In support, the KMC has submitted a report by the state pollution control board that contains findings of studies conducted at the two hot mix plants in Goragacha and Palmer Bazar but has no concluding remarks. Also missing are the quantities of two main pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx). In a letter to West Bengal PCB secretary Roshni Sen, Datta wrote: “There is no mention of this effect by the PCB in the report. Nor has the PCB stated the permissible limits of the parameters that have been measured. No conclusion can, therefore, be drawn on the basis of the analysis report.” He wondered how the KMC claimed the two plants weren’t polluting when the SOx and NOx data were yet to be submitted by a recognised lab. A copy of the letter has also been sent to the KMC commissioner Binod Kumar. A KMC roads department official said: “We had to either upgrade our existing plants or relocate the plants elsewhere. We have dismantled one of our old plants and set up a new one in its place.”  A KMC civil engineering department official said they would cooperate with the pollution control board if the latter came forward and suggest steps. PCB officials refused to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/activist-questions-kmc-affidavit/articleshow/83759803.cms||Subhro Niyogi

North Delhi Municipal Corporation had, in a circular issued by the CMO on June 19, stated: “All OPDs, which were closed due to Hindu Rao Hospital being a dedicated Covid hospital, will now start running from June 22. All concerned officials are directed to make necessary agreements.” “The north civic body as decided to resume OPD facilities here considering only a few Covid patients are left in the 250-bed facility,” a senior north corporation official said. With major hospitals in the city being declared as dedicated Covid facilities earlier this year, patients were having a tough time in getting consultation and treatment and were forced to visit other polyclinics or dispensaries. “On day one of opening of the hospital, 413 new patients visited the OPDs at medicine, ortho, surgical, gynae, dermatology, ENT and other departments in morning, and 45 patients in evening OPDs. The footfall shows that people were desperately waiting for service to resume,” the civic official added. Meanwhile, East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which had started OPDs at Swami Dayanand Hospital sometime back, also resumed services at its 24-bed paediatrics ward. “As far as allowing indoor admissions in other sections are concerned, we will wait for a joint meeting with higher authorities and take decisions accordingly. Considering we are already making preparations for the third wave of Covid, chances of admission in other sections are unlikely now,” said a senior EDMC official. South Delhi Municipal Corporation has also resumed OPDs at both Tilak Nagar Colony Hospital and Purnima Sethi Hospital. “We resumed OPDs 15 days back but the Covid ward has been kept intact and it can’t be removed unless we get permission from DDMA,”’ an official claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hindu-rao-hosp-finally-opens-all-opd-services/articleshow/83759801.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Mumbai||Examine CBSE formula to assess HSC students in Mumbai: CM||Mumbai: Indicating that the state may go the CBSE way in evaluating its Class XII students, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday asked the state education department to study if a similar methodology could be worked out. The CM also suggested that the department examine the possibility of physical schools for class 10 and 12 in villages that are Covid-free.  Thackeray held a meeting with education department officials and directed them to submit a proposal soon. The chief minister asked the department to carry out a comparative study of the assessment methodology adopted for Class X students of the state with that of CBSE’s marking scheme. CBSE is assessing students on a 30:30:40 formula that gives equal weightage to Class X and XI marks and 40% weightage to Class XII scores. At a meeting between state education minister, Varsha Gaikwad, and principals on Sunday, many were in favour of a CBSE-like assessment methodology. Meanwhile, the CM’s suggestion to start offline classes in villages that are Covid-free is significant as teachers in rural areas where Internet connectivity is an issue have been pressing for the same. The academic year began on June 15 with all schools in the state allowed online teaching only. The state is conducting a survey on how many students have access to online education. Thackeray said villages will have to ensure that they continue to remain Covid-free even if they open their schools.  In another development, Gaikwad informed the chief minister about the education department’s proposal to bear the cost of educating children who have lost both parents due to Covid. Thackeray responded positively and asked the department to submit a proposal, including the expenses required for the purpose, to the cabinet for approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/examine-cbse-formula-to-assess-hsc-students-in-mumbai-cm/articleshow/83762152.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Delhi||Delhi education dept, corporations to bring civic & govt schools on same page||NEW DELHI: The education department of Delhi government and the three municipal corporations will work jointly to ensure that every student passing out of a civic school is admitted to Class VI in Delhi government schools. The corporations will also implement Mission Buniyaad in their schools from Class III to improve foundational learning skills of the children. A combined parents-teachers meeting (PTM) for the students joining Class VI will be held in July. Upon completion of Class V in the civic schools, students move to Delhi government schools in Class VI. The decisions were taken in a meeting chaired by education minister Manish Sisodia and attended by municipal commissioners of the north, south and east corporations on Tuesday. Pointing out the steps needed to be taken for the students’ transition to the directorate of education (DoE) schools, especially during the current pandemic situation, Sisodia said, “We need correct contact details of the students joining Delhi government schools from municipal schools so that their Class VI teachers can reach out to them quickly. Last year, at the beginning of the session, only about 30-35% students’ phone numbers were correct. As a result, a large number of students could not be engaged right from the beginning and could not get worksheets or participate in semi-online classes.” The deputy chief minister also highlighted that despite special efforts made by Delhi government school teachers, only 76% of the children could be enrolled. It has been suggested that the Class V teachers of feeder civic schools partner with Class VI teachers of Delhi government schools to admit all the students. “Our students and teachers have faced a lot of mental and physical challenges due to the Covid crisis and closure of schools. We should ensure that the students transitioning from the corporation to DoE schools should get the same emotional and learning support from their teachers as students in other classes of DoE schools,” said Sisodia. Joint efforts, he added, “will help tremendously in getting the correct contact details of such students and strengthening the bond between teachers and their students”. The corporation teachers may also share details about students like their special circumstances, if any, so that their DoE school counterparts are better prepared to support these children, the minister said. Sisodia also visited schools where construction work is going on and called for a review meeting with PWD minister Satyendar Jain and officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bringing-civic-govt-schools-on-same-page/articleshow/83759816.cms||---

Additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi granted bail to Sunil Kumar and said, “The accused has clean antecedents. The nature of the evidence is primarily documentary, which has been collected. In such circumstances, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, it will be appropriate if the accused be released on bail.” The complainant alleged that six Covid-19 samples of Rs 1,500 each were collected from his home, but when he contacted the lab, he was told that the reports were not generated from their system and were fake. The prosecutor contended that Kumar, who worked as a receptionist and billing manager at the lab, was one of the conspirators in preparing false reports as he did not upload the QR Code on the system of the laboratory. It was further argued on behalf of police that the two other accused had been arrested. According to the case, Sunny Singh collected samples from the house of the complainant on April 21, while Jitender Sahu prepared the fake reports, which were then given to Kumar. Kumar’s counsel argued that he had no concern with the collection, testing, and preparation of the samples as he was only a receptionist who prepared the bills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/path-lab-staffer-who-made-fake-reports-gets-bail/articleshow/83762088.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The team might be briefed on dos and don’ts for media interaction given its significant role in the run up to the 2022 assembly elections. The media team’s strength has been raised from 11 to 15 — seven members retained from the previous team and eight are first-timers. The media team has a key role ahead: from defending party’s ideology to promoting the works of the state government while countering the attack from the Opposition, which have become fiercer in the recent months amid the pandemic. “The party spokespersons have a very important role to play in elections by projecting the right image of BJP and countering the attack from other parties,” said BJP spokesman Rakesh Tripathi, who has retained his position in the media team. “Har baar media team talwaar ki tarah kaam karti thi, iss baar party ki dhaal hogi,” added a team member. The media team might get its responsibilities more defined and divided this time as was done with the Delhi media team, where not only the strength of the team was increased but roles were also divided. One of the roles of the team is to tell party workers the right content to share with voters about the government work and to update them on the party’s programmes. As the number of newspapers, magazines and portals have increased, BJP has also put in place a stronger team this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-new-media-team-to-play-major-role-in-poll-yr/articleshow/83762132.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Delhi||Delhi: Golden Temple replica dismantled after row||NEW DELHI: The Golden Temple replica at a park being developed by South Delhi Municipal Corporation in Punjabi Bagh was dismantled on Tuesday after Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) members had protested against it on Monday for “disrespect shown to the sanctum sanctorum”. Mayor Mukesh Suryan said on Tuesday that a committee would be set up to consult Sikh community leaders to develop a consensus. He claimed that politics was being played over the issue due to the upcoming elections and similar replicas of Golden Temple existed at the Amritsar airport and railway stations. “The project showcases and gives respect to our heritage sites. There is no question of disrespect,” he added. Calling the dismantling a victory for DSGMC, its president, S Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, tweeted, “We have succeeded in getting the replica of Sri Darbar Sahib dismantled from the Punjabi Bagh park. This replica was against Sikh maryada because Darbar Sahib is not a tourist place, which can be replicated.” At Rs 1.1 crore, the 22ft-high replica was touted to be the most expensive one among the 17 replicas of well known Indian heritage structures being made of scrap metal at Bharat Darshan Park. “The committee made by the deliberative wing will take the decision about the replica to be build,” a civic official said. With an overall estimated cost of Rs 18-20 crore, the park is being set up after the success of Waste to Wonder Park that has replicas of seven Wonders of the World recreated from scrap. The theme of Bharat Darshan Park is “unity in diversity”, which will be displayed through iconic monuments of India such as Charminar, Gateway of India, Konark Temple, Nalanda ruins, Mysore Palace, Golden Temple, Meenakshi Temple, Hawa Mahal, Hampi ruins, Victoria Memorial, Sanchi Stupa, Gol Gumbaz, Ajanta-Ellora Caves and Junagarh Fort. Officials said the 17 replicas were almost complete and the Golden Temple replica was built out of 12 tonnes of scrap. The mayor said the structure had been dismantled, but could be rebuilt by reassembling the components. The park was expected to be completed in March-April, but Covid-19 has delayed the work by three months. Civic officials are now worried that the recent development may encourage some other groups to demand removal of certain structures. With the matter assuming political overtones, officials remain tightlipped about the wastage of public funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/golden-temple-replica-dismantled-after-row/articleshow/83759824.cms||Paras Singh
---||Chennai||India levies highest import duty on Covid-19 related medical devices||Chennai: India levies highest import duty in the world on all Covid-19 goods, including test kits, swab and viral transport medium set, sterilisation products, disinfectants, protective gears, infrared thermometers and inputs for vaccine production which is making both the Covid-19 treatment and vaccine costlier. A study by researchers from Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research in Mumbai shows that the import duty on all Covid-19 related goods is 15.2% which is twice compared to China and seven times more compared to the US and 60% more compared to low income countries such as Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The tariff on Covid-19 test kits, inputs for vaccine production, disinfectants and protective garments are also significantly higher than other countries and for some products the import duty is higher by several folds. The researchers who compared the tariff rates based on data provided by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) published a paper on Ideas for India (I4I) economics and policy portal. The portal publishes evidence-based analysis and peer-reviewed research articles on issues pertaining to growth and development in India. India’s imports of essential and life-saving products such as infrared thermometers (670%), protective garments (142%), ventilators (117%), flowmeter and thorpe tube for oxygen (72%), gas cylinders for oxygen (70%), and test kits (66%), recorded the fastest growth during April 2020-February 2021 compared to the same period last year. In April 2021, at the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government waived off the basic customs duty on the import of oxygen, Covid-19 vaccines, and oxygen-related equipment. However, tariffs are still being levied for a range of Covid-19 products and vaccine inputs. Further, the applicable tariff waiver is only for a period of three months. “If the tariffs are levied for vaccine inputs, our domestic production cost will go up. Then the prices of vaccines will also go up. If they remove the import tariff for vaccine inputs, then the vaccine prices will go down,” said C Veeramani, professor from Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research in Mumbai and one of the authors of the paper. A typical vaccine manufacturing plant will use in the region of 9,000 different materials sourced from some 300 suppliers across approximately 30 different countries. “Covid-19 treatment cost would be higher if tariff rates are remaining high. When you reduce the tariff rate, the cost of medicine and cost of equipment will go down and treatment also would be affordable for all,” he added. “Tariff reduction has two purposes. One is to integrate the Covid-19 related Indian production with the global value chain and second is to make the Covid-19 treatment and vaccine cheaper. For both, the tariff reduction is important,” Veeramani said. The urgent need of the hour is to strengthen India’s participation in global supply chains of Covid-19 products, including vaccines. This can be done by abolishing import tariffs and by streamlining trade-related processes at and within the border, authors C Veeramani, Anwesha Basu said in the article.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/india-levies-highest-import-duty-on-covid-19-related-medical-devices/articleshow/83759832.cms||A Ragu Raman

Two weeks ago, 45 local bodies in the district had recorded TPR of above 20%. In the last one week, the highest weekly TPR was recorded for Pallichal (24.4%). Since May, weekly TPR of many local bodies in the district went as high as 50% and mostly it remained at 30% and above. At present, three local bodies in Chirayinkeezhu taluk have recorded TPR above 20% Azhoor, Mudakkal and Karavaram. Mudakkal has shown a significant number of cases right through the second wave of Covid-19. The outbreak was first reported in a colony at Mudakkal panchayat and authorities had a hard time containing the spread. Chemmaruthy is another panchayat which has shown a high TPR throughout the week. As many as 1,348 samples were tested at Chemmaruthy between June 15 and June 21 and it yielded 308 positive cases. Kallikadu and Nanniyode are two panchayats where a rise in TPR has been noted. Nanniyode panchayat, which recorded a weekly TPR of 6.66% on June 14, saw an increase to 10.11%. Now, it has slightly come down to 9.9%. The authorities here came across some unexpected cases in Navodaya ward where not a single case was reported until two months ago. The health authorities reported asymptomatic cases from random testing; especially the elderly persons who stayed at home; two women and a man. There was also a case of breakthrough infection in a ward where a person who was earlier tested positive and vaccinated twice again tested positive. The panchayat had to call off deployment of employees under MGNREGA scheme after the spread was reported in many wards in the panchayat after a lull. Kurupuzha ward in the panchayat where many cases were reported also threw up more cases, upping the TPR of the panchayat. The medical authorities said that it was mainly home clusters which led to a slight spike in cases in the panchayat. Manickal panchayat, which was one of the first local bodies in the district to bring down the TPR to below 10%, is also witnessing a fresh spurt in cases. As many as 457 samples were tested in the last one week and 62 cases were confirmed at Manickal panchayat. Till the first week of June, the panchayat had tested over 1,000 samples and still managed to maintain a good TPR. The health authorities said that there was a need to maintain constant vigil especially when the state is going for an unlock phase. Earlier, prior to localized restrictions came into effect, the review meeting convened at the collectorate had stressed the need to conduct a minimum of 100 tests daily in the panchayats where high TPR was reported. A meeting of medical officers of panchayats with TPR above 25% was convened. It was also decided that medical officers shall coordinate more with the local bodies. Review meetings on preventive measures shall be held every two days and that 15 teams shall be constituted in the district to ensure the availability of staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/only-five-local-bodies-in-dist-have-weekly-tpr-above-20/articleshow/83757716.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The heist took place on Sunday afternoon, when the bank was shut, and was discovered on Monday morning when the staff returned to work after the weekend break. A police team that reached the crime spot detected a hole in the wall of the bank’s strong room and it seemed the thieves had accessed the vault from the adjacent under-construction building. Police have arrested two men, the main accused being Hari Ram, a 34-year-old resident of Vishwas Nagar, who is a construction worker, and his abettor being Kalicharan, 39. The cops have also recovered Rs 54,97,930 of the total looted amount of Rs 55,03,330. R Sathiyasundaram, DCP (Shahdara), said on Tuesday that during the initial probe, the cops noticed that the CCTV cameras inside the bank had been turned off by the thieves. “Our teams scanned footage from hundreds of CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity of the bank. During this exercise, we spotted a suspicious camera, installed in the building adjacent to the bank, that was facing upwards. It looked like the camera had been tampered with,” said Sathiyasundaram. “While probing this, we established that only three men could have bad access to the building. Further, a technical probe revealed that of those three suspects, Hari Ram was present in the building at the time of the theft.” While the cops were investigating the heist, the bank hired some people to repair the wall of the strong room. Surprisingly, police discovered that Hari Ram was among the labourers working to get the broken wall back in shape. This meant that even as the police teams were inspecting the scene of crime, Hari Ram was there all the while repairing the wall that he and Kalicharan had breached. The DCP said Hari Ram told his interrogators that around six months ago he had been called for the renovation of the strong room. He confessed that during this work, he recced the place and gathered all the information about the cash stored therein and the entry and exit routes. “Hari Ram further revealed that he had hatched the plan three months ago but could not pull it off due to the lockdown. He also admitted to gaining access into the under-construction building by replacing the padlock put by the owner,” said Sathiyasundaram. “After getting in, he drilled a hole into the wall to enter the bank’s strong room. He and Kalicharan then used a gas cutter to open the vault and made away with the cash. He claimed that he needed the money for gambling.” The DCP said that at Hari Ram’s instance, police recovered the money that was remaining after he and Kalicharan had spent Rs 5,400. While Rs 49,200 was recovered from Kalicharan’s possession, the rest was found in Hari Ram’s house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/day-after-heist-labourer-back-at-bank-to-fix-wall-under-cops-nose/articleshow/83759841.cms||---

She contended that the accused persons, including Vav MLA Geniben Thakor, got the FIR quashed by the HC by keeping her in the dark. Parvati Thakore from Thara village in Banaskantha district filed the petition through advocate R J Goswami for recalling the HC order. Justice A G Uraizee issued notice to the state government and all the accused persons and sought their replies by July 9. In this case, a head constable serving at Bhabhar police station, Nagji Thakore, committed suicide in 2016 leaving behind a suicide note. The police lodged an FIR against eight persons including the Vav MLA for abetment of suicide. According to the petitioner, the accused persons approached the HC for quashing of the FIR and made Nagji’s elder brother party respondent, who consented to the quashing of the FIR. The HC in February 2020 quashed the FIR. The widow claimed that the accused settled the issue with her husband’s brother and got his consent to quash the case. It was submitted that being the victim in the case, the widow should have been made party respondent in the quashing petitions, but she was kept at the bay by the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/widow-moves-hc-after-it-quashes-fir-for-her-husbands-suicide/articleshow/83759835.cms||---
---||Delhi||Split wide open? Growth shadow on floodplain in Delhi||NEW DELHI: In a move that may give ownership rights to the residents of at least 71 unauthorised colonies located along the Yamuna, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has proposed to delineate Zone O, which encompasses the floodplain, into two zones.As per Master Plan for Delhi 2021, Zone O comprises the entire floodplain along the 22km stretch of the Yamuna that falls in Delhi, from Wazirabad to Palla. As no construction is allowed in this zone, residents of these 71 colonies are unable to get ownership rights for their properties under Pradhan Mantri — Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY).More than 40 lakh people living in 1,797 unauthorised colonies are eligible to get ownership rights under PM-UDAY, but not those living in the areas, such as Jaitpur, Badarpur, Okhla and Sonia Vihar, that come fully or partially under Zone O.TimesViewThe Yamuna O Zone is extremely environmentally sensitive. The proposed bifurcation needs to be carefully looked into before arriving at a decision. It should not end up with an ecologically sensitive area becoming a casualty of political expediency.However, in the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041, which has been recently put in the public domain for suggestions and objections, Zone O has been rezoned into two parts — Zone O-I and O-II. Zone O-I is the “river zone” with the active floodplain, spread over 6,295 hectare, and no construction would be allowed here. Zone O-II, covering 3,638.4 hectare, has been rezoned as “riverfront” with regulated development.According to the draft MPD, in compliance with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order dated January 13, 2015, it was directed that the floodplain be identified for a flood in 25 years in the interest of ecology, biodiversity and the river flow.The draft states that IIT Delhi has conveyed the flood of 2011 as once in 25 years during which the maximum gauge recorded at Old Railway Bridge was 205.72 in respect of the maximum discharge of 6,41,462 cusec from Tajewala. The floodplain maps based on the maximum water levels observed in 2011 at various locations have been used for the physical demarcation.DDA sources said that after the physical demarcation, bollards were put to identify the floodplain and, out of the 76 unauthorised colonies, five fell under this area. This means that residents of the rest of the 71 unauthorised colonies can apply for ownership rights if the delineation is allowed.In 2012-13, DDA had tried to bring these colonies out of Zone O and get these added to adjacent zones like E or F and the demarcated floodplain, which was not falling under the active floodplain with no risk of flooding, was divided into three parcels. However, the move was objected to by some environmentalists and the process was stayed by NGT.DDA has been preparing a detailed report, to be presented before NGT’s principal committee, for removing these colonies from Zone O. Legal experts have told DDA officials that they can earmark the floodplain and ensure no work is carried out there and make separate norms for other areas that have not seen flooding once in 25 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/split-wide-open-growth-shadow-on-floodplain/articleshow/83762148.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Ponnammal, 96, had many firsts to her credit in her lengthy musical career. Born as the daugher of Bhagavathy Ammalu and Mahadeva Ayyar at Parassala near here in 1924, she took the traditional music world by storm with her charismatic rendition, at a time when the conservative society of that age considered public music performance by women as something beneath one’s dignity. Ponnammal was the first girl student to be admitted at Music Academy (Swathi Thirunal Sangeetha College) here. She caught the attention of the who’s who of the Carnatic music world at a very young age. At the age of 13, she won a gold medal in a music competition for children organized in connection with the birth anniversary of erstwhile Travancore king Chithira Thirunal. This extraordinary feat opened the doors of the music college to Ponnammal who later went on to become the first women teacher of the same college. Ponnammal was also the first woman to perform at Navarathri Mandapam at the famed Navaratri Music Festival in 2006. The nation honoured her with Padmasree in 2017. Ponnammal started learning music and Sanskrit under the guidance of Ramaswamy Bhagavathar. At the Music Academy, her teachers were the legendary ones such as Harikesanallur Muthayya Bhagavathar, Semmangudi, K R Kumaraswamy Iyer, M A Kalyanakrishna Bhagavathar, etc. Ponnammal was an A-grade artist at All India Radio. She had won several coveted titles including Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi Award (1976), Acharya Kalabharathi Award and Gayakaratnam Award. Some of her outstanding classical renditions include ‘Guruvayur Puresa Suprabhatham’, ‘Thrissivaperur Suprabhatham’, ‘Ulsava Prabandham’, ‘Navaratri krithi’, Meenambika Stothram, compositions of Irayimman Thampi and Padmanabha Sathakam of Swathi Thirunal. Ponnammal is survived by sons D Mahadevan and D Subramanian. Her husband Devanayakam Iyer and two other children — D Ramaswamy and D Kamala — predeceased her. Her funeral is planned at Bharmana Grama Samajam crematorium, Valiyasala on Wednesday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/carnatic-music-legend-passes-away/articleshow/83759867.cms||---

Her worst fears as a parent came true when she discovered her son was missing. He had fled the house for the eleventh time in almost eight years.Years after the ordeal that felt like decades to the family, Tuesday was like a new beginning. On Monday, Ruby’s son Tony* was rescued from Kozhikode in Kerala by NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan.However, the happy moment doesn’t come without its share of pain. Tony’s father says that the 16-year-old boy struggles with mental health issues, but his mother refuses to accept it. Her constant state of denial eggs the child on to do whatever he wants, the father laments.Tony was five-years-old when Ruby and her husband first got to know about his mental condition. His father says they went from pillar to post to get treatment for his son, but was turned away from everywhere. “He ran away several times but was always found. We got his name and address tattooed on his arm that helped locate him from Bihar, Rajasthan, Noida, etc,” he says. “We had lost all hope this time, but thanks to the NGO’s help, we have our child back.”As the parents work as an auto driver and household help, he claimed that no one took their plight seriously. “People make us feel like terrible parents. Even the police turn me away every time I try to lodge a complaint,” he said. He also claimed that the doctors they could consult for Tony’s mental health told them nothing is wrong with him. “But we know we need institutional help to take care of our son, where we can periodically visit him to know that he is fine. You have to understand how dire a situation is, for a father to think like this,” he said.Rakesh Senger, executive director at Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation (KSCF) said that his team was alerted one week ago about a boy who had his name and address tattooed on his arm. “Our state coordinators managed to track him down and managed to verify Tony’s identity,” Senger added.(*Names changed)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/boy-missing-for-three-years-finally-reunited-with-family/articleshow/83759849.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Lucknow||For greener Lucknow, plantation drive to add over 3 crore trees this year||LUCKNOW: Lucknow division will be greener than other districts after the plantation drive this year. As part of Vriksharopan Janandolan 2021, this year’s massive plantation exercise encompasses planting 30 crore trees across the state. The forest department alone would plant more than a crore trees in the division, while other departments could plant another 2.3 crore. Overall, around 3.4 crore trees would be planted in the division. Following the state capital would be Kanpur, which would get around 2.5 crore trees. Of these, the forest department would plant at least 1.2 crore while the remaining would be by other government departments. Chief conservator of forests Mukesh Kumar said, “The targets have been fixed for all departments, districts and divisions. The forest department would supply saplings accordingly.” Chitrakoot and Ayodhya divisions would get around 1.2 crore trees and Devipatan at least 1.9 crore. Prayagraj, Varanasi, Bareilly, Mirzapur, Moradabad, Agra, Jhansi and Meerut divisions would each get more than a crore of trees in the drive. According to an assessment by the forest department, based on the fact that a healthy tree produces 225.8 litres of oxygen every day and a person consumes 550 litres in a day, 30 crore trees (if all survive) would generate enough oxygen to meet the daily requirement of around 12.3 crore people. Another environmental benefit of these trees would be carbon sequestration (carbon stored by trees). A single tree sequesters 5.8kg carbon on an average in a year. The 30 crore trees would sequester at least 175 crore kg of carbon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/for-greener-lucknow-plantation-drive-to-add-over-3cr-trees-this-yr/articleshow/83762169.cms||Neha Shukla

According to the figures of Ahmedabad city police figures, 6.46 lakh people paid Rs 51.62 crore fine for not wearing mask between June 1, 2020 and June 21, 2021. The highest number of 1.20 lakh people were fined in July 2020 when the Covid situation was improving in the city but as hearing on a suo motu petition in the Gujarat high court was ongoing, cops were seemed stricter on people in recovering mask fine. In the same month, the Gujarat government increased the mask fine from Rs 200 to Rs 500 on July 12. The cases dropped to just 13,110 in August but the state government increased the fine from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 when the petition was still being heard in the high court. This was the same time, when the festivals were observed and cops were bit soft on the people, said a police officer. The city again reported a peak in the Covid cases in November 2020 following festivals. In October, the city reported 45,636 cases of mask violations which decreased to 26, 207 cases in November. This was the time when the buzz for holding elections was on its peak. After the cases rose in mid of November and December, the cops registered the second highest number of mask violations which were 1.04 lakh. In February — the month of civic body elections, city police registered the lowest 7,925 cases of mask violation so far. But as the Covid cases began increasing in April and people witnessed second killer wave, the cops strictly implemented the mask rule as 52,311 cases were reported in April, 2021 and 56,725 cases in May 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavadis-have-coughed-up-rs-51-cr-in-mask-fines-are-still-paying/articleshow/83759856.cms||Ashish Chauhan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CM stays plan for 100 Mhada flats to Tata cancer hosp||Mumbai: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday ‘stayed’ a decision of housing minister Jitendra Awhad to hand over 100 flats in Mhada buildings to Tata Memorial Hospital for housing relatives of cancer patients. The keys for the flats were handed over to the hospital authorities in May by NCP chief Sharad Pawar. Thackeray stayed the decision on Shiv Sena MLA from Sewri Ajay Chaudhary’s letter requesting it as other residents living in the two buildings feared for their health if cancer patients and their relatives move in, especially during Covid-19. Thackeray wrote on the letter, ‘Principal secretary (housing). Examine the issue and submit a report. Stayed till then.’ Awhad said he was disappointed and disheartened. Chaudhary said there were 750 Maharashtrian families at Sukhakarta and Vighnaharta housing societies, where the housing department decided to hand over the flats. He said instead of allotting flats in buildings where other families were residing, cancer patients and relatives must be given all 100 flats in a Mhada building in Bhoiwada, near the hospital. “There is an atmosphere of tension and fear among residents,,” Chaudhary said in his letter. “On March 19, Mhada expressed its desire to provide accommodation to relatives of patients undergoing treatment at the Tata Cancer Hospital from a humanitarian point of view. In five days, we delivered around 100 houses for rural patients and relatives of all such patients. Maintenance and distribution has been given to Tata Cancer Hospital. This time I was reminded of my mother, when she was diagnosed with cancer. It is hoped that today’s decision will bring relief to patients and their relatives,” Awhad had said when the keys to the flats were handed over in May. Dr Shailesh Shrikhande of Tata Memorial Hospital was present when the flats were handed over. Dr Shrikhande had said that everyday the hospital gets requests from 300 patients for accommodation. Of these, around 60% of patients are unable to get any proper accommodation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-stays-plan-for-100-mhada-flats-to-tata-cancer-hosp/articleshow/83764366.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ahmedabad||GSTBA red lights VAT recovery notices||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Sales Tax Bar Association (GSTBA) on Tuesday moved a representation to chief commercial tax commissioner, J P Gupta, and state finance minister, Nitin Patel, red-flagging issuing of indiscriminate notices via email and SMS to taxpayers for value-added tax (VAT)-recovery notices. The tax professionals have alleged that system-generated notices for recovery under VAT and central sales tax (CST) have been issued to various taxpayers, who have already paid their dues or have won the appeal against the disputed dues. For instance, Pratap Chandan, owner of an edible oil trading company, who won the appeal for a VAT dispute in January 2019, received a system-generated recovery notice. “The case was disputed for dues worth Rs 2.44 lakh. My bank account had been attached for the same. However, the court not just ordered a stay on this but I won the appeal in January 2019 after which my dues were null and void. Yet I received a recovery notice for business transactions carried out in 2013-14,” said Chandan. In the representation, tax professionals have alleged that the state commercial tax department has not updated its records, due to which many taxpayers whose dues are cleared or who have won the appeal, have received notices, suggesting arm-twisting methods being used by the tax professionals. “This has created huge havoc amongst the taxpayers and tax professionals as it has resulted in unnecessary and undue hardship to them. Tax officials are pressurizing taxpayers by sending such system-generated notices without verifying records, communications, submissions, orders, challans of the taxpayers,” states the representation. GSTBA has alleged that this is only adding to the compliance burden of taxpayers and is far from ease of doing business. Estimates by state commercial tax department suggest that tax dues worth Rs 46,000 crore are pending for recovery under the VAT and CST regime. Speaking on the allegations, Gupta said, “There is no ban on recovering pending government dues and the means are well-prescribed in the law. The department is updating its records from time to time and just in case there is a discrepancy due to which a wrong order has been issued, the same can be rectified by approaching the department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gstba-red-lights-vat-recovery-notices/articleshow/83762206.cms||---

It was on the suggestion of the court last year, that the Gujarat government had raised the fine from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000. Chief minister Vijay Rupani on Tuesday instructed the department concerned to prepare a formal request to the high court to allow the government to lower the fine to Rs 500. The Gujarat high court in its directions last year, had suggested when the first wave of the pandemic was at its peak, that the government collect a minimum fine of Rs 1,000 from those found without masks in public places. Following this, the government had raised the fine to the present level. A government release on Tuesday said that “keeping I mind the interests of the people, CM VijayRupani has asked officials to prepare a request to the high court to reduce the fine for not wearing a mask from the existing Rs 1,000 to Rs 500.” There has been a steady fall in daily-Covid-19 cases in the state as the second wave of the pandemic appears to be receding. The number of daily new Covid-19 infections, which crossed the14,000 cases mark in April, has fallen to less than 150.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-wants-mask-fine-halved/articleshow/83759883.cms||---

The terrace of the two-storey building has collapsed already,” he said.The building did not have any fire-safety equipment in place and was heavily jammed with highly combustible materials due to which the fire spread faster, the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charred-human-remains-found-in-shoe-factory-blaze/articleshow/83759861.cms||---

They also demanded relief package for traders and financial assistance to staff members working in shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/shopkeepers-demand-relief-march-to-cms-residence/articleshow/83757773.cms||Anmol Jain

Shinde was wanted for trying to kill the husband of the woman he loved. The woman, however, did not reciprocate his feelings. The accused paid five lakh rupees and hired two contract killers to murder Jaipur-based businessman Aaditya Jain (41) as he was infatuated with his wife. Police said the incident came to light on June 16 when two unknown persons on a motorcycle fired three rounds at Jain outside his house. Jain suffered bullet injuries on his hand and is currently admitted to a private hospital. After the firing, Jaipur police filed an attempt to murder case and recorded Jain’s statement. Police made the connection with Shinde after Jain revealed that between 2018 and 2020 his family lived in Dombivli, where Shinde got infatuated with his wife and started harassing them. It was because of this that Jain left Dombivli to settle in in Jaipur.  Jaipur police shared Shinde’s details with the Kalyan crime branch unit and a team led by senior police inspector Sanju John laid a trap and nabbed him on Monday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-dombivli-man-tries-to-kill-jaipur-bizman-over-love/articleshow/83762256.cms||---
---||Delhi||Experts warn against development in Zone O||New Delhi: The proposal for delineation of Zone O of the Yamuna floodplain has prompted experts to call for maintaining the sanctity of the area. They have asked Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to ensure that no construction, even to the extent of building cycleways, is carried out in the active floodplain or the “riverfront” area proposed under the draft Delhi Master Plan 2041. Citing past judgments, which includes recent orders from National Green Tribunal (NGT), experts say only biodiversity parks or restoration work should be permitted all through Zone O while encroachments should be removed at the earliest. No construction is currently allowed in this zone. Under the draft, Zone O will be split into two halves — a 6,295-hectare O-1 area, known as the active floodplain, and a 3,638-hectare O-2 area, the “regulated riverfront”. Experts feel activities in this area, including construction, may be detrimental to the overall health of the floodplain, even allowing unauthorised colonies to stay. Manoj Mishra, convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan and a petitioner at NGT, said the 2015 tribunal order, based on his plea, had laid down a clear roadmap not only to rejuvenate the river but also to protect the active floodplain from Palla to Jaitpur. “Any activity that is not part of the judgment or is not in consonance with the roadmap is contempt,” said Mishra, stressing that Zone O needed to be left untouched. “In the past, too, DDA has tried to create a riverfront and allow certain activities, but the plan was rejected by NGT. An expert later laid down guidelines on how to restore the floodplain and the key word here is restoration, not development,” Mishra pointed out. Bhim Singh Rawat, a Yamuna activist and part of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, told TOI that unauthorised colonies on the floodplain had been on DDA’s radar for a long time. However, these haven’t been cleared despite multiple directions, said Rawat. “The concept of a riverfront has rarely worked in India, excluding the Sabarmati, where additional fresh water is coming from the Narmada. In Delhi, we don’t have adequate fresh water to maintain the flow of the river and, even if that happens, the focus needs to be on improving the water quality, not on floodplain development,” Rawat emphasised. He said that while farmers were being removed from the floodplain, unauthorised colonies still stood there. “Farmers are being terrorised, but then the same approach needs to be adopted for all parties. If one needs to allow any activity in the floodplain, organic farming could still be done away from the river and in a regulated manner. This will provide livelihood to farmers,” he added. Diwan Singh, a Yamuna activist who launched a satyagraha in 2007 to remove encroachments from the Yamuna, said the move had led to the lieutenant governor declaring in 2008 that the floodplain won’t be open to any urbanisation, allowing only biodiversity or restoration work to take place. DDA has two biodiversity parks along the Yamuna floodplain — Yamuna Biodiversity Park in Wazirabad and Kalindi Biodiversity Park in Kalindi Kunj. Singh, however, said even cycling should be restricted in the proposed “riverfront” area. “If any activity beyond biodiversity parks are allowed, this will open the floodgates to many activities in the future. Natural walkways within biodiversity parks are still allowed, but even laying down tracks for cycling could be detrimental. DDA needs to stick to the original mandate of protecting the floodplain from encroachment,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/experts-warn-against-development-in-zone-o/articleshow/83762189.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Despite increased police presence and vigil in the city, people were seen flouting Covid norms such as wearing masks or maintaining social distance. Some traders were relieved that the government had lifted restrictions on movement and extended business hours but others said Covid-appropriate norms needed to be enforced more strictly. Himanshu Joshi, a businessman, said, “The opening of markets is a relief as we need to earn to be able to meet our fixed expenditures like water, electricity and taxes etc.” As per traders, the losses of the business community in Dehradun city amounted to Rs 25 crore in April 2021. Talking to TOI, Pankaj Mason from the Doon Valley Mahanagar Vyapar Mandal, said, “We welcome the relaxation being given by the state government. It will help us take care of our families and those we employ. At our end, we are taking utmost precautions while dealing with customers. Shop owners have been asked to wear masks and gloves at all times. Only a limited number of customers are allowed inside shops, that too, with masks.” Residents, meanwhile, said market-goers should exercise caution. “I just hope there isn’t a surge in Covid-19 cases again. The pandemic is far from over and people need to be careful.” District administration officials said they are keeping a close watch on the situation and regular drives are being conducted to ensure social distancing at public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/crowds-swell-in-markets-as-city-unlocks/articleshow/83757871.cms||---
---||Kochi||Assam gets world’s 1st GM rubber sapling||Kottayam: World’s first genetically modified (GM) rubber sapling was planted at the Rubber Board’s Sarutari research farm on the outskirts of Guwahati in Assam on Tuesday. Developed at the Rubber Research Institute of India (RRII) here under the Rubber Board through long years of research in its biotechnology laboratory, this GM rubber sapling is expected to grow well under the climatic conditions of the north east. This is the first time any GM crop is developed exclusively for this region, said K N Raghavan, chairman and executive director of Rubber Board. Raghavan said that Rubber Board attaches great importance to its activities in the north east. The board is actively promoting rubber cultivation in the region with financial support given by the Indian tyre industry, he said. Addressing the media after inaugurating the field planting, Raghavan explained that with additional copies of the gene MnSOD (manganese-containing superoxide dismutase) inserted in it, the GM rubber is expected to tide over the severe cold conditions during winter, which is a major factor affecting the growth of rubber saplings. MnSOD gene has the ability to protect plants from the adverse effects of severe environmental stresses such as cold, drought, etc. Laboratory studies conducted at RRII showed that GM rubber plants over-expressed the MnSOD gene as expected, offering protection to the cells. Therefore, it is expected that the GM rubber plants will establish well and grow fast here, he said. Raghavan explained that what is planted now is not on a commercial basis, but on an experimental level following all mandatory biosafety measures applicable to field trials involving GM crops. He also allayed unfounded fears about GM rubber. “MnSOD gene used in the GM rubber was taken from the rubber plant itself. Its copies were multiplied in the laboratory and reinserted into a cell of the rubber plant which was then regenerated into a full plant that is now planted in the field. There are no plant species in India that can breed with natural rubber. Therefore, there is no risk of genes flowing from the GM rubber into any other native species, a concern often raised by environmental groups against GM plants in general,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/assam-gets-worlds-1st-gm-rubber-sapling/articleshow/83759903.cms||---

The unit will generally provide newspapers and periodical-based support to people in general and young adults in particular. It will be equipped with the best possible information and communication technology (ICT) based support to the readers,” said National Library director general Ajay Prasad Singh. The Esplanade East Row building briefly housed the National Library after shifting it from Metcalfe Hall (then Imperial Library) before it was relocated to its current address at Belvedere House. Even after the entire library was shifted to Belvedere House, the newspaper and periodical section remained at Esplanade East Row. Finally, only the newspaper section operated till 2004, when that section too was shifted to Bhasa Bhawan at Belvedere House. “It was an amazing place. Almost all the newspapers of India and those from abroad used to come there. I used to drop in to read foreign newspapers. In those days, many famous people used to drop in. I saw Radha Prasad Gupta and Satyajit Ray among the readers in the ’80s quite frequently,” recollected Bidhu Bhushan Chakraborty, a bibliophile and researcher. Apart from reviving the Esplanade facility, the National Library is set to hold an exhibition of its exquisite collection of lithographic paintings for the first time in Kolkata. “The lithographic collection of the National Library was enriched by the personal collection of Sir Asutosh Mukherjee, which was later donated to the National Library by his family. The paintings took us back to the quaint city of the early Raj era. People will get a glimpse of some wonderful structures which are no more,” said Singh. “The existing children section of the National Library is also going to be changed thoroughly for transforming it into a vibrant creative centre exclusively for the children so that they can inculcate the reading habits among them as well as to make them innovative and self-reliant," said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/natl-librarys-esplanade-facility-set-for-revival/articleshow/83759897.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Not only were many roads waterlogged, but cave-ins were also reported from at least five spots in three days. This has drew the wrath of Hitesh Barot, chairman of the standing committee of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).  Complaints of waterlogging resulted in AMC office-bearers getting irked and he visited several areas and took photographs. Another office-bearer said water logging in underpasses is also a major issue and even two inches of rain cause underpasses to be closed. “We were told that special work had been taken up at Mithakali underpass to address waterlogging but this year too there was waterlogging.” A senior officer who asked not to be named said, “This year the work was not taken up as there was shortage of labourers due to Covid. However, in almost all areas, the water receded within a couple of hours.” The BRTS track near the Blind People’s Association campus has seen major cave-ins before and there was one in the same area again on Tuesday. “This reflects poor work done by AMC officials when it comes to cave-ins,” said the senior AMC officer. The city on Tuesday got an average 33mm of rain in the 24 hours ending 4pm and the city control room received 43 complaints waterlogging of which six were from West Zone and the remaining were from the eastern part of the city. The western part did not receive heavy rain on Tuesday, A BJP office-bearer, who is on an AMC committee, who asked not to be named, said that according to the guidelines, catch pits have to be cleaned much before the monsoon begins and stormwater drains have to be cleaned. However, it appears that the entire exercise is only done on paper as all waterlogging complaints are from areas which have been facing the issue for several years now. Hitesh Barot, the AMC standing committee chairman said, “We have taken photographs of areas where there was waterlogging and this was in just one or two inches of rains. We cannot take this lightly and will send the entire AMC team on to the city streets on Wednesday and to ensure that they get to the bottom of the problem. If we have to have more catch pits, we will ensure this work is done. Desilting will be taken up from Wednesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-gets-waterlogged-after-two-hours-of-rain/articleshow/83762232.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The cases have got halved from its peak of about 450 active cases in the last week of May. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that with drop in Covid-19 cases in the state, there is a definite fall in the mucormycosis cases, too. “On May 15, we had admitted 60 patients in a day. Now the number has got reduced to one to three,” he said, adding that since April 5, the hospital has admitted 1,217 patients of the fungal infection. The infection is largely attributed to severe Covid-19 infection that reduces the patients’ immunity, allowing the opportunistic fungus to grow. As on Tuesday, the mucormycosis cases are now three and a half times more than the Covid-19 active cases, which now stands at 62 at Civil Hospital, one of the biggest Covid treatment centres in Gujarat. Dr Bela Prajapati, head of the ENT department at Civil Hospital, said that the patient profile has remained almost the same. “About 80% of the patients fall in the age bracket of 45 to 59 years, male patients account for 66.6% or two-thirds of the total cases, and majority of the patients are recovered from severe Covid infection,” she said, adding that about 38% of the patients needed oxygen support during Covid treatment. She added that several of the patients would undergo corrective surgeries after two to three months of discharge. “The severe cases where removal of eye is required has gone down in the past couple of weeks. Majority of the corrective surgeries are for the cosmetic purposes after removal of infected parts of the face,” she said. Civil Hospital authorities said that the number of patients coming from other parts of the state and other states has also gone down in the past couple of weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mucormycosis-active-cases-at-civil-now-50-of-may-peak/articleshow/83759909.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Delhi||Father’s obligation won’t end at son turning 18: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: A father’s obligation doesn’t end on son turning 18 years as the entire burden of his education and other expenses cannot fall only on the mother, Delhi high court has said. It granted Rs 15,000 interim maintenance to a divorced woman for her adult son till he completes graduation or starts earning, saying the court cannot shut its eyes to the rising cost of living. The court said it was unreasonable to expect that the mother alone would bear the entire burden for the son with the small amount of maintenance given by her estranged husband for the maintenance of their daughter. The court was hearing a woman’s plea challenging a 2018 trial court order declining maintenance to her and granting it only to their two children, who are living with her. “The woman has to take care of the entire expenditure of the son who has now attained majority but is not earning because he is still studying. The family court, therefore, failed to appreciate the fact that, since no contribution is being made by the respondent (man) towards the son, the salary earned by the woman would not be sufficient to maintain herself,” Justice Subramonium Prasad said. The couple got married in November 1997 and had two children. They got divorced in November 2011 and the son and daughter are 20 and 18, respectively. The Family Court said the son was entitled to maintenance till he turned an adult, while the daughter would be entitled to maintenance till she gets employment or gets married, whichever is earlier. The court noted that, “The two children are living with the mother. Since the purpose of granting interim maintenance is to ensure the wife and the children are not put to starvation, the courts while fixing interim maintenance are not expected to dwell into minute and excruciating details and facts which have to be proved by the parties.” It said this court could not shut its eyes to the fact that the man, who got remarried and has a child from the second marriage, has to maintain that child also and the reduction of the amount for maintenance by the family court could not be found fault with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fathers-obligation-wont-end-at-son-turning-18-hc/articleshow/83762285.cms||---

One of the youths, Nikhil Gupta (17) of Para, died in the incident. Other occupants of the vehicle – Abdullah, Saurabh Singh, Shivam Singh, Vinod Pal, Gaurav Singh, Babu Gupta and Shivam Kumar – were rescued. Saurabh was on the driving seat of the SUV which was registered in the name of one Ashok. Five of the youths are plumbers while two of them work as electricians. Barring Nikhil, a student of Class 12, all of them were in their early 20s. ADCP, North, Prachi Singh, who was the first to reach the spot and supervise rescue operations, said the group was returning to their homes in Para from Barabanki. “Around 2.30 am, they reached Samata Mulak crossing and took the Gomti Riverfront lane to reach Paper Mill colony culvert. They reached the spot where the Kukrail drain falls into the Gomti. There is a portion which is unfenced and has a layer of moss on the road. The SUV was running at a high speed and the driver could not control the vehicle which slipped and fell into the river,” the ADCP said. She said the accident took place at Bheekhampur embankment where Kukrail’s dirty water falls into the river. “The front windscreen of the SUV was broke open by constables Anil Yadav and Nitin Sharma who saved three of the youths. However, they could not pull out the SUV and informed the SDRF,” said Singh. In the meantime, four other youths swam to safety. An SDRF team of 18 personnel, donning deep diving suits and modern gadgets including modern communication system and breathing apparatus, started the search using dragon cameras and located the SUV. By the time they could trace Nikhil, he had died. “Nikhil’s father, Rajesh, has given a complaint against other youths but we are waiting for the post-mortem report after which we will lodge an FIR,” the ADCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/suv-zooms-rolls-into-gomti-teen-drowns/articleshow/83762227.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kin seek premature closure of FDs||Thiruvananthapuram: The district administration is receiving requests from relatives of Ockhi victims for premature closure of fixed deposits where the relief fund was deposited as a long term sustainability measure. One request was filed by the daughter of a fisherman who went missing in the sea during Ockhi cyclone. As per the request, she wanted to withdraw the Rs 5 lakh deposited as FD in her name at Fort sub-treasury to pay off the debts of her husband. She had reported that her husband owned two boats and an engine, bought using borrowed money. The boat was damaged by waves at Cheriyathura in 2019 and the FD amount was required to pay off his debts and buy a new boat. The district collector, having considered the request, has recommended that the withdrawal of the money be allowed. There was another request by the wife of a fisherman who had gone missing in sea. She wanted the FD amount to clear the loan taken by her and her deceased husband and also the loan later taken by her son. Although it was recommended that 25% of the FD may be used for the purpose, she said that that would not be sufficient. The district administration has now granted the request subject to consent from all her four children. The state government which had set a model in timely disbursal of Ockhi relief fund had earlier dealt with the applications for using Ockhi fund for marriage expense. With number of such applications at the district collectorate on the rise, the revenue department had been forced to issue an order allowing district collectors to give consent to Ockhi-affected families to withdraw money from separate accounts of dependants for marriage expense after proper enquiry. The government had deposited Rs 20 lakh in separate treasury accounts of dependants as fixed deposits for a tenure of five years with a view of long-term financial security for the dependants of Ockhi victims. The plan was that they could live with interest accrued from fixed deposit on a monthly basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kin-seek-premature-closure-of-fds/articleshow/83757945.cms||---

Henceforth, colleges with at least one existing NBA accredited course only will be given the no-objection certificate to apply for new courses. The recommendations submitted by the affiliation standing committee in this regard were approved by the syndicate meeting on Tuesday. Colleges with no NBA accreditation courses must meet three criteria prescribed by the university in addition to the conditions laid down by the AICTE. At least 50% pass in the final year examination of the previous year, admission in at least half of the seats, and an excellent ranking in academic auditing are the additional criteria propounded by the University. Though the university had insisted NBA accreditation and a set of quality criteria for sanctioning new courses in the past, several college managements had secured favourable orders to unsettle the varsity move. However, KTU challenged the HC division bench order in the Supreme Court and got the apex court’s permission to introduce quality criteria, over and above the ones prescribed by AICTE. The syndicate also resolved to direct the academic council to formulate a plan for all engineering colleges under the university to obtain NBA accreditation within five years. The syndicate has also decided to revise the affiliation fee from 2020-21. Colleges will be given six months more to pay the affiliation fee arrears and a complete waiver of penalty. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/now-accreditation-by-nba-a-must-to-start-new-engg-courses/articleshow/83759929.cms||---

While educational institutions across the city completed the admission process for 2021-22 in February, the MA school didn’t carry out the admission process. The 82-year-old state board school has an unaided primary medium and an aided secondary section. Congress corporator Meher Haider had written a series of letters to the education department alleging that the school is on the verge of shutting down. Congress activists joined the protestors on Tuesday. Later, Haider, her husband and former corporator Mohsin met state education minister Varsha Gaikwad. K/W education inspector Shruta Wankhade, who visited the school on receiving complaints from parents, told TOI that the school has been directed to put up boards regarding admission for 2021-22, and to accept forms. The school’s primary section headmistress (incharge) Madhuri Ahire, in a letter dated February 22, informed the education department that they did not receive any application for admission in the academic year 2021-22. The school stated that that 10 per cent students in 2019-20 and 80 percent students in 20-21 had not paid their fees but continued to take online classes. In a letter dated November 24, 2020, the school informed the education department that its Council of Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (CICSE) had to be shut for want of students. Speaking to TOI parents alleged that the school did not put up any notice of admission this year. “In February, when I went for the admission of my son in Class I, the security guards turned us away citing Covid,” said a parent, who was on Monday asked to submit an application for admission to the security guard. Parents said they were told to leave their applications for admissions with the security guard. Another parent said her child who studied in the school is being denied admission in the secondary section. “After our protest, the school on Tuesday issued leaving certificates to all Class IV students whose fees were pending and all were given admission in Class V,” said Mohsin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-parents-protest-after-school-in-andheri-denies-admission/articleshow/83762323.cms||Sandhya Nair

The Telangana government alleged that the neighbouring state was also violating the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order not to go ahead with the project without getting the mandatory environmental clearance. In a letter to KRMB chairman J Chandrasekhar Iyer, Telangana special chief secretary (irrigation) Rajat Kumar on Monday urged the board to take steps to protect the genuine and legitimate claims of Telangana on Krishna waters. The state government also sent pictures of ongoing works at the RLIP site to the board. “As per section 85(8)(d) of the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014, it is the responsibility of the KRMB to restrain AP from proceeding with RLIP works, enhancement of Srisailam right main canal and other works. The ministry of jal shakti has already directed AP not to proceed with the project without submitting the DPR before the KRMB and getting its approval,” Rajat Kumar said. The state cabinet had recently expressed displeasure over AP taking up construction of projects on Krishna river, particularly RLIP to divert more than 80,000 cusecs of Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir to outside the basin. Telangana said that there has been no action from the KRMB in sending a fact-finding committee as directed by the NGT. “We are constrained to note that KRMB has failed to ensure that the NGT orders are followed as it is reliably learnt that AP is proceeding briskly with the construction of RLIP,” Rajat Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-ap-from-constructing-rlip-telangana-to-krmb/articleshow/83762271.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Hyderabad||Unite, and government will help, Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao tells adopted village||HYDERABAD: Making his first visit to the adopted village of Vasalamarri, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said he would like to see the tiny village in Yadadri-Bhuvunagiri district transform into a ‘bangaru (golden) Vasalamarri’ in one year. He said his government is ready to sanction funds and support the village in its development, but wanted the entire village to stand united with no bias towards caste, creed and religion and strive to develop the village. He also urged the people to spare two hours every week for the village and revel in its transformation. He said the entire village is his family and added he won’t mind visiting the village 20 times to guide the people and oversee the developmental works. KCR said he is ready to spend Rs 100 crore to Rs 150 crore on roads, community halls and other works in Vasalamarri. During his nearly four-hour visit on Tuesday, the CM took part in a community lunch with locals and enquired about their problems and issues. He interacted with 70-plus Akula Agamma and Chinnuri Laxmi and enquired about the functioning of local sarpanch P Anjaiah. He also spoke to village girl Supraja, who is aspiring to become a doctor, and said he would be more than happy to help her. In his 58-minute long speech at a public meeting in the village, KCR explained how Vasalamarri could be developed into a model village and gave examples of Ankapur village in Nizamabad district, Erravelli and Ramunipatla villages in Siddipet district. “There should a village development committee and other committees like gram shramadan committee, drinking water and sanitation committee, Haritha Haram committee and agriculture committee. The collector will officiate as a special officer and survey every house and family and take stock of their needs,” the CM said. “The only thing, I am expecting from you is committment and dedication. In Ankapur, the village development committee is doing an excellent job and resolving the issues locally. Police have not entered the village for the last 45 years and the village sarpanch was fined twice for violating norms,” he said. Asserting that peace is the stepping stone for achieving overall development, the CM said: “Similarly, in Ramunipatla village, the local committee has provided employment to the local youth.” Like Ankapur has become a role model for other villages, Vasalamarri should also become a model village for surrounding villages, he said. He urged the villagers to resolve their issues amicably. He said tractors, DCM vans, buffaloes, sheep and ration cards will also be given to the villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unite-and-govt-will-help-cm-tells-adopted-village/articleshow/83762316.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||Delhi Metro through Ridge: Back to drawing board||NEW DELHI: Ridge Management Board (RMB), which recently conducted a meeting, has asked the forest department and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to thoroughly explore all the alternative alignments for the construction of Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor for Phase-IV. Delhi Metro had sought permission for the corridor to pass through parts of Delhi Ridge. “It was decided that the forest department and DMRC should thoroughly explore all the alternative alignments for the MRTS corridor and overlay all those alternate alignments on a map of Ridge/Morphological Ridge to give a clear picture in this regard. The NGO, which has filed a petition in Delhi High Court, may also be consulted if needed in the process of exploring the alternative alignments saving/reducing the land under Ridge/Morphological Ridge,” according to the minutes of the meeting. “A detailed presentation highlighting Ridge alternatives will be given by DMRC in the next meeting of RMB, which will be held shortly, for taking a final view on the matter.” The proposal of phase-IV corridor was first placed in a meeting held in March. However, a petition filed in the high court was referred to the central empowered committee (CEC) and hence, RMB had deferred the agenda in the last meeting. After the CEC asked for comments or recommendations from RMB, the latter conducted a meeting in June. At the meeting, RMB chairman also enquired if a joint inspection had been carried out by the forest department and DMRC to minimise the use of forest area involved in the project. “The principal chief conservator of forests stated that joint inspections had been carried out and forest area involved had been reduced by 2,400 square metres. The number of trees proposed to be felled has reduced from 1,109 to 1,072,” according to the minutes of meeting. Of these 1,072 trees, 466 trees are situated in Southern Ridge, 455 in South Central Ridge and 151 in Morphological Ridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-through-ridge-back-to-drawing-board/articleshow/83794035.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

A total of 23,161 people took the first or second shot of the two-dose vaccine at 244 booths. While 22,317 were inoculated at 234 government booths, 844 got the jabs at 10 private hospitals. This was the second highest turnout this month after June 4 when the turnout in a single day was 23,388. Of the total recipients, 21,063 got the first dose. Among them, the maximum beneficiaries, 15,325 (73%) were from the 18-44 years age group followed by 4,805 (23%) in the 45-59 years group and 728 (3.4%) in the 60 years and above category. The remaining were healthcare and frontline workers. As many as 2,098 persons across categories got fully vaccinated after taking the second dose. However, women continued to be behind men in all categories. Of the total beneficiaries who took the first or second dose, 12,842 (55%) were men and 10,319 (35%) women. The trend has been similar since the start of the campaign on January 16. The people in the 18-44 years age group had to come after booking their slots on the CoWin portal and those 45 years or above were allowed walk-in registration for vaccination. On Monday, the health department had increased the number of booths from 158 to 214 in the city including special camps organized at religious and workplaces. District immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said, “Awareness drives are underway to maximise public participation. Our target is 30,000 vaccinations daily from Thursday.” Blocks miss target again  Though overall vaccinations increased, the health department could not reach the target set under the pilot project on ‘cluster vaccination program’ in Gosainganj, Mohanlalganj and NK Road blocks of Lucknow for the second consecutive day. Only 3,487 (52%) had got vaccinated against the target of 6,735 people in these three blocks taken together on Monday. The turnout increased on Tuesday, but still missed the mark, as 5,514 (72%) came to take the shot against the 7,636 called for inoculation. Under the cluster vaccination programme, healthcare workers visit every house in a village/locality, sensitise people about Covid-19 vaccine, give slips to eligible persons and ask them to get the shot at the nearest booth. All those having slips can walk into a centre to take the jab. District immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said that the pilot project will be run till June 26 and thereafter, evaluation will be extended to other blocks of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-second-highest-june-turnout-23k-get-vax-but-women-yet-to-catch-up/articleshow/83762327.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Kolkata||City director’s film makes cut in Cannes programme||Kolkata: Suman Sen’s ‘Eka (Solo)’ has been selected for the 2021 edition of La Fabrique Cinéma. This tailored programme, developed by the Institut français, in partnership with France Médias Monde – RFI, France 24, Monte Carlo Doualiya –, the Sacem and the International Organisation of La Fancophonie, is aimed at helping talented young directors increase their international exposure. Through this programme, ten directors from across the world working on their first or second feature films are invited to attend the Festival de Cannes every year. French filmmaker of Lebanese origin Danielle Arbid will be mentoring the programme. Sen’s gritty socio-political feature, which is only the fourth from India to secure a spot as part of the programme, is his feature film debut. ‘Eka’ has already been part of NFDC Film Bazaar’s co-production market in 2019 and was also selected by Torino Film Lab Next in 2020. Leaving on June 25, Sen will have to quarantine for 10 days in Nice before attending the Cannes film festival from July 6. “It is really difficult for me to enter from India now since our country is currently in the red zone for France. I am extremely fortunate and humbled to get a special permission to travel now. I owe it to Gabrielle Beroff Gallard, Emilie Pianta Essadi, Josie Blanchet and Juliette Grandmont for making the impossible happen,” he said. ‘Eka’ reflects and documents the kind of time he has been living in for the last couple of years. “It is a time of hatred, intolerance and violence. The reason our society is failing today, comes from the burden of our past,” says the director. Set in Kolkata, Sen’s film lays bare the decaying social, economic and cultural conditions of our society. Shooting for the film is expected to begin around the middle of next year. The story explores a week in the life of a 56-year-old long-term diabetic insurance agent. Every morning, he sees a huge human toe of a massive under-construction statue in the middle of the main city square. When everything starts going wrong in his life, the feeling that he failed his loved ones the same way the society is failing him grows stronger. One morning, he stands speechless in front of the statue. In the events that follow, he finds himself giving birth to a mass revolt in his own city. His resistance gives rise to a powerful worldwide movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-directors-film-makes-cut-in-cannes-programme/articleshow/83759934.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

On Monday afternoon, Suraj C Pandey (36) and a woman reported at a Vistara counter at Delhi’s IGI Airport to check in for the Mumbai flight UK 933. While the woman had a RT-PCR report and was given a boarding pass, Pandey did not have the same and was refused permission to fly. “He started misbehaving with staffers at the airport and other passengers. He started walking on the conveyor belt for check-in baggage. The airline staff called Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and he misbehaved with them too,” said a source. Security personnel had to drag him from the check-in area to hand him over to the local police, he added. “The woman flew to Mumbai.” According to Vistara sources, the airline has initiated proceedings against Pandey under Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)’s unruly passenger rules and he could end up on the no-fly list for at least a couple of months. The airline tried to explain to him that the RT-PCR requirement for Mumbai-bound passengers is a government rule. A CISF official said the airline had also agreed to give Pandey a full refund, but he insisted on taking a subsequent flight. “The passenger then turned violent and started shouting. He started walking on the check-in baggage belt and obstructed the working of airline staff and other passengers,” said Rajeev Ranjan, DCP, IGI Airport. “The CCTV footage showed Pandey doing all these activities. Based on the complaint, CCTV footage, an inquiry was conducted and he was arrested under Delhi Police Act. Since the offence was bailable, he was released on police bail and will be produced before a court,” Ranjan added. Under DGCA’s norms, an airline can put an unruly passenger on the no-fly list for a specific period depending on the gravity of the safety violation after following a due process. Other carriers are free to ban him, too, for the same period. So far the Indian airlines have collectively followed such a decision.

The sanction was given along with six other units to come up in different parts of the state including Chengala in Kasaragod (44 units), Kalanjoor in Pathanamthitta (32 units), Edappal in Malappuram (44 units), Kadambanad in Pathanamthitta (56 units), Karimba in Palakkad (72 units) and Eraviperoor in Pathanamthitta (28 Units) under the LIFE Mission project. In September 2020, the construction of two housing complexes under the LIFE Mission began at Azhoor and Madavoor panchayat. Flats being constructed at Azhoor will house 44 families. The project costs Rs 6.72 crore. The flat at Madavoor is coming up on 1.2 acres of land, which were handed over by the revenue department. The project will be completed at a cost of Rs 5.5 crore. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had inaugurated the construction works online of 29 apartment complexes across the state as part of the LIFE Mission project in 2020. The total housing units envisaged under the latest proposal, including Kattakada, is 304 and the total plinth area will be 17,613 sq m. The average plinth area cost for the project is 27,747/sq m. The government had earlier sought a clarification from the chief executive officer, LIFE Mission, for actual increase in the unit cost of external work as the unit cost m/sq was seen increased by 3 to 9% over original unit cost. The government had directed the CEO of the LIFE Mission to ensure that all amenities are there in the housing clusters and that it shall be constructed to provide a congestion-free building, the order said. As per the clarification issued by the CEO for cost rise, the cost of construction depends on type of foundation . Cost of external site development works mainly depends on terrain of land, length of compound wall, retaining wall, road development, earth cutting/filling required etc. It varies from site to site and it cannot be directly compared with number of dwelling units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/life-towers-at-kattakada-get-administrative-nod/articleshow/83757979.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Since he was a juvenile on the date of commission of the crime, his case was immediately referred to the Juvenile Justice Board, which sent the case to the children’s court of sessions for trial thereby separating his trial from the adult co-accused.According the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, a preliminary assessment was made and the board sought an opinion from Dharpur Medical College on the mental condition of the child. It was opined that he was physically and mentally capable of committing the alleged crime and understood the consequences. Considering the gravity of the crime, the board considered that the juvenile was to be tried as an adult and sent his case to the special children’s court.On the other hand, before the sessions court, which was trying the adult co-accused, the prosecution demanded that the child’s case be consolidated with the main trial because the child was to be prosecuted as an adult. In 2019, the sessions court ordered the consolidation of both trials.When the order for trying the juvenile with the adult accused in one court was challenged, the high court found it illegal and without jurisdiction and contrary to the Juvenile Justice Act’s provisions. The court said that though the child is to be prosecuted as an adult, the 2015 Act provides special protection and care for the child who faces trial and the provision to send him to jail is only after he turns 21. The HC said that Section 23 of the Act bars the courts form putting a juvenile on trial alongside an adult co-accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/separate-childs-trial-from-adult-co-accused-hc/articleshow/83759951.cms||---

Bharat Parmar (31) and his friend Jagdish Thakore, who are both rickshaw drivers in Navi Dharampur village, went to the provision store of Chandrika Goswami, in an extremely inebriated condition and started forcing her to close the shop. When Goswami asked them to leave, Bharat and Jagdish started hurling abuses at her. Things worsened when Bharat picked up a stick and started chasing her. In a video that went viral, he is seen thrashing her with the stick even as other villagers including women urge Goswami to call the police. As the video started circulating in the village, some locals went to the houses of the duo and beat them up with iron pipes and other blunt weapons. “Both were taken to the Morbi Civil Hospital where Bharat again created some ruckus. He was taken to the police station but as his condition worsened, he was taken back to hospital where he died,'' police said.  Jagdish was referred to Rajkot Civil Hospital. Police booked eight persons for murder following a complaint lodged by Bharat’s wife Manju. She named Jadav Bharvad, Bechar Bharvad, Saliyo Bharvad, Maylo Koli, Sanjay Koli, Baliyo Koli, Shivo Koli and his son among others for the murder.

---||Delhi||Udyog Nagar fire: Missing labourers yet to be traced||New Delhi: Excessive heat and unstable structure prevented the fire brigade on Wednesday to carry out a search operation in a building in Udyog Nagar where a major fire broke out on Monday morning. Fire officials had pulled out charred remains of a human being from the building near west Delhi’s Peeragarhi on Tuesday. The spots where five other missing labourers could be found have been identified, but rescue teams couldn’t enter the building as it may collapse. Police officials said the forensic team also could not go in to lift DNA samples. The owners of the building are still absconding. The corporation has already declared the building dangerous after portions of its second and first floors collapsed. According to Atul Garg, director of Delhi Fire Services (DFS), “The entire building was stacked with shoes, plastic, packaging material and it took almost nine hours to douse the fire. We are trying to carry out a search but everything is completely burnt, some parts of the flooring had also collapsed.” A fire officer has slipped and fractured his ribs while trying to climb the stairs inside the building, Garg added. “Even on Wednesday, we carried out a search but could not move around much as the floor was heated; nothing substantial was found.” Police are carrying out raids to trace the owners. “Whatever information we have received about the labourers is due to their family members approaching us. The owners have been absconding since the day of the fire and we don’t have any record of the people who are allegedly missing,” said Parvinder Singh, DCP, Outer. The missing people have been identified from family members’ information as Abhishek, Neeraj, Shamshad, Vikram, Raju and Ajay, added Singh. Around 30 fire tenders were rushed to the location to douse the fire. Firemen said that the fire had rapidly spread and engulfed an adjacent portion of the building as inflammable materials were stacked inside. The building, consisting of a basement, ground and two other floors, did not have a valid fire no-objection certificate. Thick smoke had made firefighting difficult for officials. They then made an opening at the front of the building and started dousing the fire from both sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/udyog-nagar-fire-missing-labourers-yet-to-be-traced/articleshow/83794107.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Exports of marine products down 17% in fiscal 2021||AHMEDABAD: Exports of marine products from Gujarat took a beating in fiscal 2020-21 due to the disruption in export markets, especially China. The state’s marine exports declined by 17% to Rs 4,137 crore in 2020-21 from Rs 4,985 crore in the previous financial year, shows data from the Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI). Exports in volume terms dipped by about 20% to 2 lakh tonnes in 2020-21 compared to 2.51 lakh tonnes. “Seafood exports from Gujarat have declined due to Covid-19 induced disruptions in export markets, especially China, loss of fishing days on account of the pandemic as well as depleting catches,” said Jagdish Fofandi, national president, Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI). The decline in exports to China pulled down overall exports from the state, which is among the top seafood exporters in India. Seafood exports to China plummeted by 41% to Rs 1,287 crore in 2020-21 from Rs 2,197 crore in 2019-20. Exports in volumes dropped to71,637 tonnes from 1.26 lakh tonnes during the same period. Exports to Southeast Asia and the Middle East also declined. However, the reductions were not as steep as China. According to seafood exporters, China made its import protocols and norms stricter due to Covid-19. Previously, it was an easy market for exports. However, the risks in the Chinese market increased and its seafood market shrank due to the pandemic. There were a few rejections of consignments, containers were held up and exporters also faced payment-related issues. “Gujarat’s exports of seafood also depend on the catch from the sea as well as inland production. Overall, marine output has not gone down but catch from the sea have dropped partly due cyclonic conditions in the previous years,” said Fofandi. “There is a need to adopt sustainable fisheries to save the industry from a major hit in the long run,” he added. Freight cost has increased by around 200%-300% across the board over the past six or seven months, which has affected bottom lines in the seafood trade. Seafood exporters also complained that non-payment of incentives under the previous Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) is also hampering cash flow for the seafood trade. The rates under the new scheme, called Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP), which came into force after MEIS, have not been declared, which has further added to the woes of exporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/exports-of-marine-products-down-17-in-fiscal-2021/articleshow/83759944.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Varanasi||UP: BJP fields Poonam Maurya in zila panchayat chief’s election||VARANASI: After a dismal show in the recently held zila panchayat polls, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Poonam Maurya — daughter-in-law of Akhil Bhartiya Kushwaha Mahasabha former president Motilal Shastri — in the upcoming election for post of zila panchayat chairman in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency, Varanasi. The seat is reserved for an OBC woman candidate and the family is said to be having a sizeable support in the community. The BJP could secure only eight of the 40 zila panchayat member seats in the zila panchayat polls. Regarding BJP chances, party state vice-president and in-charge of Varanasi Salil Vishnoi said, “Currently, the party is enjoying support of 25 zila panchayat members. The numbers will increase by the time of polling.” “BJP announced the candidature of Poonam Maurya for zila panchayat chairperson election from the prestigious Varanasi seat with the consent of state co-in charge Sunil Oza,” said party’s Kashi region unit president Mahesh Chandra Srivastava. Maurya had won the zila panchayat member election from sector 3 of Kashi Vidyapeeth block as an independent candidate. Her husband Kunwar Virendra had also been a zila panchayat member in past while his mother-in-law Rukmini Devi had won gram Pradhan election. Srivastava said, “After winning the election, Maurya joined BJP. Before finalising her candidature, feedback of party workers had been taken. Vishnoi, Srivastava and BJP district unit president Hansraj Vishwakarma then unanimously recommended the name of Marya, who holds BSc and BEd degrees,” he added. Party sources told TOI, “After a dismal show in panchayat polls in which BJP could secure only eight of the 40 zila panchayat member seats, finding a candidate for winning the prestigious zila panchayat chairperson election in PM’s constituency was a challenging task for the party leadership. The reason: Samajwadi Party (SP) claimed 16 seats while Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) claimed four and three seats, respectively.” However, following confirmation of Maurya’s name, both Bishnoi and Srivastava confident of a ‘a sure victory’ and claiming support of 25 members. They said, “The figure of zila panchayat members, who will extend support for BJP candidates, will increase by the date of polling on July 3. Maurya will file her nomination on June 26.” The Varanasi zila panchayat not only houses the PM's parliamentary constituency but also parts of his cabinet colleague Mahendra Nath Pandey’s Chandauli constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bjp-fields-poonam-maurya-inzila-panchayat-chiefs-election/articleshow/83727325.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Malappuram and Idukki, were identified as ‘most vulnerable’ areas to substance abuse and drug addiction. These districts are part of 272 districts in the country where the ministry has chalked out an annual action plan called “Nasha Mukt Bharat” campaign fully funded by the Centre. These districts have been identified based on the inputs received from the Narcotics Control Bureau and the findings on the comprehensive national survey done by the ministry. The campaign was launched after a report on ‘magnitude of substance use in India’ was published by the ministry. Though the campaign was to be launched last year, it is being actively launched across the country now. As part of the programme, awareness generation will be the first phase with inclusion of various social media campaigns. However, the social justice department officials said that the study, which is based on data that is a couple of years old, indicates Kerala somewhere in the bottom except in case of alcoholism. “We are launching it across the state, not just in the selected districts. We began last year by training school counsellors and followed it up with peer groups in schools and colleges,” said Sheeba George, director, social security mission. She said that peer groups serve as the best alert system to reach out to victims of substance abuse and addiction. “The school counsellors are also reaching out to students so that an alert society is in place, not only to prevent addiction among the young but also prevent them from being victims of anti-socials,” said George. “The study uses data which is more than two years old. The numbers could be larger and more in many districts,” she added. The Nasha Mukt Bharat campaign also focuses on counselling and treatment facilities in hospitals and rehabilitation centres. Capacity building is planned for service providers too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/substance-abuse-a-concern-in-6-districts/articleshow/83759972.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Congress likely to name leader of Opposition soon||DEHRADUN: Reacting to Congress’s allegation that state is on the verge of “constitutional crisis” as chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat needs to win an assembly seat before the elections, likely to be held last year, and he cannot contest a bypoll when the assembly election is less than a year away, BJP state president Madan Kaushik said that the Opposition “is simply spreading confusion”. There is no technical or constitutional issue in the appointment of chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat as the governor appoints the CM under article 164 and appointment of ministers is done on the suggestion of the CM, Kaushik asserted. “It is clear in para four of article 164 of the Constitution that a minister who is not a member of the state legislature party for a period of six months shall contest the election within six months, failing which he/she shall cease to be a member. The day the chief minister took oath, more than a year was left for the elections, so we are out of the (purview of) category of 151. According to Nav Prabhat, who was transport minister in the Harish Rawat government, provisions of section 151A of the Representation of the People Act mandate that a bypoll cannot be held in a situation where only a year is left for state polls. “The state is heading towards a constitutional crisis. CM Tirath Singh Rawat’s six-month tenure ends on September 10, BJP will have no option but to name a new chief minister,” Prabhat had told TOI. However, Kaushik brushed aside the contention. The BJP state president said that it is the responsibility of the Election Commission to conduct elections and his party is all set to contest one, “even if the polls are announced tomorrow.” At present, two assembly seats – Gangotri and Haldwani — are lying vacant. Gangotri seat fell vacant on April 22 after the demise of MLA Gopal Rawat while Haldwani MLA Indira Hridayesh passed away this month, resulting in the seat becoming vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-likely-to-name-leader-of-opposition-soon/articleshow/83757975.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Pune||Pune: Builder held on charge of duping investor of Rs 21.26 lakh||PUNE: The Pune police crime branch on Monday arrested prominent builder Amit Lunkad of Lunkad Realty firm on the charge of cheating a Katraj resident of Rs 21.26 lakh after promising him handsome returns on investment made in the firm in 2019. On Tuesday evening, the police produced Lunkad, a director of the firm, before a special court (MPID Act), which ordered his remand in magisterial custody till July 6. He was later sent to a temporary jail at Yerawada. “We will submit a plea with the sessions court registry on Wednesday, seeking regular bail for our client,” his lawyer Sudhir Shah told TOI on Tuesday evening. Complainant Sanjay Vilas Honrao (48), a resident of Dattanagar near Katraj, stated in the FIR lodged with the Yerawada police that Lunkad and his representatives promised handsome returns of 14% pa to 15% pa but failed to keep their commitment, and also refused to return the initial investment amount. The police have invoked charges under Sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act, besides, Sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the IPC against Lunkad. DCP(crime) Shrinivas Ghadge told TOI, “We have received 23 complaint pleas, including that of Honrao’s, against Lunkad. Five of these pleas had reached before Lunkad was taken to court for custodial remand proceedings, and another 18 were received thereafter. The overall amount of alleged cheating will increase once all these complaints are made a part of the FIR.” In the court, lawyer Shah, while opposing the police remand plea, submitted that his client had returned Rs21.26 lakh dues to Honrao through an RTGS money transfer on Monday, and returned Rs15 lakh each payable to other four investors on Tuesday. “We further brought to the court’s notice that our client was prepared to return money in case of any fresh complaint that may come up in the matter. This was after a submission was made by the prosecutor on behalf of the investigating officer that the police were expecting more complaints,” said Shah. The TOI on Tuesday made repeated calls to complainant Honrao but his cellphone was switched off. A crime branch official said that Honrao has been advised to keep his phone switched off to avoid any pressure. DCP Ghadge said, “Soon after the case was registered, Lunkad returned the money to five investors, but we do not have details of these investors yet.” Crime branch inspector Balaji Pandhare said, “We called Lunkad to the police commissioner’s office many times after receiving the complaint, but he did not present himself. Finally, we arrested him from his office on Monday evening.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/builder-held-on-charge-of-duping-investor-of-rs-21-26l/articleshow/83760004.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rat bites ICU patient on left cheek at civic hospital||MUMBAI: A patient admitted to ICU of civic-run Rajawadi Hospital (Ghatkopar) was reportedly bitten by a rat on his left cheek on Tuesday. Kurla resident Shriniwas Yellapa (24) was admitted two days back with liver-related complications and is on ventilator support. On Tuesday, his sister found a bandage under his left eye and asked about it. A source said only after she created a commotion she was told doctors suspected a rat had bitten her brother. Rajawadi Hospital superintendent Vidya Thakur said it was not the patient’s eye but the skin below that had been bitten. “It is not a deep cut and could heal,” she said. A hospital staffer said the cut was large. “The bite may seem small in comparison to his serious condition caused by a cirrohottic liver,” he added. Rat infestation and bites are not unknown in municipal hospitals. In 2017, three patients admitted to Babasaheb Ambedkar hospital (Kandivli) were bitten by rats and state human rights commission granted each a compensation of Rs 2 lakh. In 2018, a Thane family alleged their 27-year-old coma patient died in Hinduhridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care Hospital (Jogeshwari) after rats chewed his right eye (the patient’s parents said an ulcer caused by the rat bite claimed his life, but an inquiry report said he died due to ‘intracranial haemorrhage’). Mayor Kishori Pednekar said as the wound was superficial only a tetanus shot was given. A probe will be ordered, she said. “I was informed the hospital is packed from all sides and precautions have been taken to ensure rats do not go inside. But as the ICU is on the ground floor and with monsoons here, the rat may have entered when the door was opened,” she said. As the patient is too critical to notice, nurses saw the wound and called an opthalmologist to check the eye, added Pednekar. AAP Mumbai working president Ruben Mascarenhas said it was shocking. “as, on one hand, we talk about the Mumbai model and, on the another hand, we cannot guarantee safety of our patients in civic hospitals”. He tweeted, ‘Even more shocking is mayor Kishori Pednekar’s statement that the rat must have sneaked in while the door was opened! Shame!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rat-bites-icu-patient-on-left-cheek-at-civic-hospital/articleshow/83758200.cms||---

Airlines had initiated action against them under DGCA’s unruly flyer rules that include putting them on no fly list. The grounding period is decided after following a due process that takes over a month. Vistara is learnt to have barred three such unruly flyers for up to three months. India’s biggest airline IndiGo, which accounts for almost one in every two domestic flyers, had by virtue of its market share seen the highest onboard Covidiots. The airline did not comment on whether it barred such flyers from flying and for up to what time period. Onboard violation of Covid norms was seen mainly till mid-April after which the devastating second wave struck. The killer wave saw the number of air travellers nosedive and those flying in that period were mainly following the norms. “People were and are very scared after the second wave erupted. There have been no reports on onboard violation of Covid-19 norms since late April,” said sources. Before the Covid second wave, there were several instances of people being offloaded from flights before take off for refusing to wear masks or being handed over to police after landing for the same reason. Following a Delhi High Court order, the aviation regulator had earlier ordered airlines and security agencies to take strict action against unruly flyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/airline-bars-3-for-covid-violation/articleshow/83762449.cms||Saurabh Sinha

---||Kochi||Kerala: No concrete steps to save Kadambrayar from pollution||KOCHI: Kadambrayar portrays the best example of how encroachers, corporates and callous authorities kill a river. A source of drinking water to many places on either shore, Kadambrayar is polluted due to excessive dumping of waste from factories. The flow of the river, which caters to the potable water needs of Infopark, Special Economic Zone (SEZ), Smart City among others, is obstructed due to water hyacinths, silt and waste dumped by houses and industrial units . Projects and funds earmarked for the revival of the river have gone down the drain. The 27-km-long river, which originates as a stream at Keezhillam near Perumbavoor, passes through canals amidst paddy fields of Vengola, Vazhakkulam, Kizhakkambalam and Kunnathunadu grama panchayats and Thrikkakara municipality. The river converges with Manakkathodu canal and Chithrappuzha near the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram and joins Vembanadu backwaters at Thevara. “It is a fact that some of the factories at Kolencherry, Kizhakkambalam and Karimughal dump its waste into the river. Still, the authorities hardly take any action against such firms,” said Maleril Paulose, an environmentalist. “In 1995, waste dumped by the company caused public protest and the district collector had convened a meeting of the all stakeholders. Though prompt action against pollution was promised, nothing happened,” he said. A few months ago, Thrikkakara municipality had passed a resolution against Kitex, a garment unit in Kizhakkambalam, for allegedly dumping waste into the river. “As per a water quality test conducted by employees of an IT firm at Infopark three-four years ago had found that the PH value of the water is around 4.5 whereas it should have been 6.5 to 7.5 for using it as drinking water,” Paulose said. The leachate from the solid waste treatment plant owned by the Kochi corporation at Brahmapuram percolates into Kadambrayar. “The septage treatment plant at Brahmapuram also causes river pollution. Though we have lodged complaints before the authorities, nobody took action,” said former member of Vadavokodu-Puthenkurisu grama panchayat Koyikkal Abdul Basheer. A few years ago, the state government had allotted Rs 25 crore for cleaning and increasing the depth of the river by dredging. Environmentalists alleged that the contractor did nothing other than removing the hyacinths. The contractor didn’t carry out dredging for increasing the depth of the river by one metre. Dredging is required for removing the silt and waste sediments on the waterbed. The Kadambrayar tourism project started in 2009 is in an abandoned stage now. Rejuvenating tourism is the most practical method for protecting the river. Boating had been stopped for several years. “We have plans to revive the project. Kunnathunadu MLA P V Sreenijin has convened a meeting for the purpose on Thursday,” an official with tourism department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-concrete-steps-to-save-kadambrayar-from-pollution/articleshow/83758047.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Class XI strength to be raised from 60 to 75||AHMEDABAD: To tackle the issue of a major rush expected this year for admissions in Class 11, the state education department has decided to increase the classroom capacity from 60 to 75 students per class. The state government has announced a mass promotion for all school students, including regular students of Class 10 and Class 12. “The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board has made some changes in the classroom strength for this year and the next. For Class 9 and Class 11, we will allow 75 students to be admitted per class. This rule will be applicable for Class 10 and Class 12 students for the academic year 2022-23,” said sources in the education department. The government has also issued a notification in this regard. The decision has been taken based on the recommendation by a special committee that was formed to look into the challenges arising by mass promotion to Class X students. “The decision has to be implemented with adequate vigilance at the local level so that no additional financial, revenue burden or legal responsibility is put on the government,” said sources in the department. Out of 7.92 lakh regular students who participated in the Class 10 board exam, 60.64% or about 4.80 lakh students cleared it last year. This year, however, 8.57 lakh regular students are eligible for admission to Class 11. As per some initial estimates by the GSHSEB, about 2,000 new classrooms need to be added to accommodate the large number of students who will be taking admissions in Class 11. This will require an addition of 3,500 teachers in Class XI. “As this option was not viable given that the schools have started for the new academic year and the financial burden involved, the board has decided to raise the number of students per class,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-xi-strength-to-be-raised-from-60-to-75/articleshow/83759989.cms||---

The second wave continued for 16 weeks in the district. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “World Health Organization (WHO) has set the criteria that infection is under control if weekly test positivity rate (TPR) is below 5% for two weeks. It is understood that the wave has ended if weekly TPR is below 5% for two consecutive weeks,” he said. As per data of district civil surgeon, weekly TPR dropped below 5% in the district in last week of May. Weekly TPR was 4.15% in the week from May 22-28. Weekly TPR further declined to 2.07% in first week of June. Thus, second wave ended in the district at the beginning of second week of June. Weekly TPR has continued to drop and was 0.77% in second week and 0.58 in third week of June. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B also confirmed second wave has ended for the district. “Therefore, we have started allowing commercial activities in phased manner. It is a sign of relief for us but there is nothing to rejoice or relax. We are preparing for projected third wave. I urge people to continue following guidelines so that cases do not rise and we continue with unlocking activities,” he said. The district had witnessed peak of first wave in last two weeks of August and entire September last year. The cases and deaths started to decline from beginning of October and continued till first week of February. Weekly TPR was 6.44% in last week of January and 6.63% in first week of February. From second week of February, cases started to increase in weekly TPR. In second week of February, weekly TPR increased to 8.58%. Dr Shinde said commencement of second wave can be considered as second week of February. The cases and deaths were very high in April, and were highest-ever in a month in the pandemic since March 11, 2020. Weekly TPR ranged from 24-31% in April, with the highest-ever weekly TPR at 31.06% in last week of April. Since then, cases started to plummet and second wave began to recede. From second week of June, cases were below 100 on all days in the district. The cases have been below 40 for last four days. Cases even fell to 16 on June 19, and were in single digit (8) in the city and also in rural (7) on June 19. Dr Shinde said, “These are sporadic cases and will continue till third wave.” Radhakrishnan said these cases are also known as tail of second wave, as the pandemic is considered an endemic in the district. Thus, second wave continued for 16 weeks in the district. Though highly contagious, second wave ended faster than the first wave. The peak of first wave came to an end from commencement of October last year. Weekly TPR was never below 5% till beginning of second wave. Lowest weekly TPR was 5.85% in second week of November, and 5.88% in third week of November. Dr Shinde said, “End of first wave can be considered as second week of November. TPR did not plummet at that time as testing was very less.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-covid-19-wave-in-ngp-dist-ended-early-june-lasted-16-weeks-experts/articleshow/83760014.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Pune||ZP teachers’ videos, activity sheets posted online fill wide learning gap||PUNE: Vajiprasha Shaikh, a zilla parishad teacher from Ausa taluka of Latur district, decided to put up a small skit with help from a few children in the primary class he teaches. The skit is based on a story in their Marathi textbook in Std V, and recorded on a cellphone by Shaikh. He then posted the four-minute short film on YouTube and the video has over two million views. In Vidarbha’s Washim district, zilla parishad teacher Meenakshee Nagrale composed a song with maths tables from one to ten. It has background music and a chorus of children singing along and some animation. The video is up on YouTube and has garnered a huge 4.5 million views. Nagrale’s YouTube channel is a treasure of content from Balbharati books turned into interesting animation with stories, concepts, grammar, vocabulary and poems from Std IV books. She said she has now adapted very well to the audio-visual medium and with an encouraging response from viewers and students, she has tried to bring in more interactivity, fun and entertainment along with teaching the lessons in this new medium. The pandemic has changed the way zilla parishad schools have started to function in the past six months. From creating an official YouTube channel that has over one lakh subscribers to creating activity sheets for students to practice at home, all this has been downloaded by more than 80,000 users. For those not been able to access online education, about 40,000 students have received doorstep schooling with volunteers visiting their homes to impart lessons. YouTube channels and videos prepared by teachers are getting huge responses and viewership is improving every day. Shobha Khandare, principal of Pune-based District Institute of Education and Training, said they had over 900 videos created by teachers during the pandemic. “The teachers have been given basic training on how to record the videos, modulate their voices, elements that can be added to the videos to make them interesting and other small add-ons. The interest is increasing since teachers have gone online and they seem to have adapted and added some creativity,” she said. Film-maker Deepti Ghatge, who is in process of creating video tutorials for the Pune zilla parishad schools, said, “The teachers have made a good effort. More can be done regarding the video tutorials. The videos should ensure that students sit in front of the screen from the start to the end. They should not get bored and, hence dramatisation of concepts is important.” The education offices in the state have also been creating banks of teachers’ videos and those that are good enough to stream are being put up on various channels on YouTube. Some videos have garnered lakhs of views appreciating the efforts put up by the teachers. A ZP teacher from Velhe, Geeta Bandal, said, “I bought a high-end smartphone a year ago after we realised that it would take some time for offline classes to begin. With this device, I have been enacting some poems at my home and taking the help of my husband and relatives to record these videos. The school headmaster encouraged me to upload the videos on YouTube and after one year, I have a good collection and they get good views.” Banda said in the initial days the videos had a slow response and garnered just 20-50 views, but now she has requests to upload new videos to clear concepts from Balbharati books. Today, Bandal’s videos have between one to two million times views.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-teachers-videos-activity-sheets-posted-online-fill-wide-learning-gap/articleshow/83760025.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Corona casualties under-reported by 43 times, says Akhilesh Yadav||Lucknow: Citing statistics collected through Right To Information (RTI) from 24 districts, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday accused the ruling BJP of fudging figures and 'grossly under-reporting' deaths due to novel coronavirus by up to 43 times than the actual toll in UP. “Actually, it seems that the BJP is trying to hide its face in the statistics as they don’t want to answer questions on the issue. As per the information accessed through RTI local authorities in 24 districts have come out with statistics which show that the state government has under reported Covid-19 deaths in nine months ending March 31, 2021, by up to 43 times,” Akhilesh said. “During these nine months municipal corporations of 24 districts issued as many as 4,591 death certificates, but as per the government statistics only 243 people had died,” the SP chief said. Though the BJP is an expert in fudging statistics, this time the party will not be able to evade ire of people who have been at the receiving end during the pandemic, he added. The former UP CM said there has always been a difference between what the BJP says and what it does. “The party brought in demonetisation in the name of putting an end to black money and the decision only brought misery to people. The government paid no heed to the repeated warnings and cautions sounded by experts regarding the second wave of novel coronavirus and the result was that thousands of people died including many for want of oxygen and medicines,” he said. Hitting out at the government for alleged widespread corruption, Akhilesh said the poor quality of material used in the laying of Purvanchal Expressway has exposes tall claims of the government despite the fact that the monsoon season has just started. “The expressway has caved in at over 50 spots in Ghazipur, Mau and Azamgarh. A huge crater has been formed near Ukraira village because of poor material used in its construction,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/corona-casualties-under-reported-by-43-times-akhilesh/articleshow/83762453.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

He sought directives to the school management to submit its balance sheet and clarify about tax paid by it against receipt of term and miscellaneous fees for academic year 2020-21. Bansod also demanded that the fees should be waived for last session due to Covid-19 pandemic and it should be revised in consultation with parents.The petitioner, through counsel Ravi Sanyal, further sought directives to reduce the fees by Rs40,000 and charge only Rs46,800 as tuition fees as directed by the government.Terming the school’s action as arbitrary, the petitioner said he had no other option but to approach the HC after state school education department failed to provide any relief to the student during the pandemic.In a nutshellDhairya was in the school for 3 years after being admitted in pre-primary sectionIn March 2020, all schools had stopped functioning due to Covid-19 pandemicAll students including him were promoted to KG-I without any assessmentSchool started online coaching through Google classrooms in July last yearIt didn’t give any idea about fees to parents as online coaching was underwayOn March 13 this year, school asked parents to pay Rs86,800 in five daysOn March 26, school discontinued online classes of Dhairya for want of feesOn April 3, his parents paid Rs46,800 fees to escape coercive actionWhen Dhairya’s results were withheld despite paying fees, he moved the HC||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5-year-old-moves-hc-as-school-withholds-result/articleshow/83760007.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

According to University Police Station officials, Dhimant Kothari (62), a resident of Shree Ram Park on Kalawad road, lodged a complaint against Shobhna Gohel and her husband Manish Gohel under various sections of the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act 2020. Kothari accused the couple of illegally occupying the bungalow owned by Neena Shah, who now lives in London, UK. Kothari is husband of Shah’s sister. The complaint stated that Shah had rented her bungalow Shobhna in 2014 for a few months. Shobhna was a teacher with a reputed school in the city then. Everything was fine for the first few months and Shobhna kept paying rent regularly. After few months, Shobhna stopped paying rent and even refused to vacate the bungalow, Kothari alleged in the complaint. In 2017, when Shah came to Rajkot she asked Shobhna to vacate the house but the latter refused and even threatened her. Shah gave an application stating that Kothari was illegally staying in her house, but nothing happened. Now, with a new law in force, Shah asked Kothari to lodge a complaint to get back her property located in Gulmohar society on Sadhu Vasvani road. Kothari recently approached the collector’s office and a committee after evaluating the complaint gave nod for registering a criminal case against Shobhna and her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/couple-booked-under-land-grabbing-act-for-illegally-occupying-nris-bungalow/articleshow/83758137.cms||---

All political parties supported the notice tabled in the general body by ruling party leader and senior BJP leader Avinash Thakre.Thakre also urged the House to approach the state government to give extension to local bodies whose tenure will end in near future. If the state accepts the plea, BJP being ruling party in the NMC stands to benefit.Without any discussion, BJP, Congress, BSP, Shiv Sena and NCP corporators backed the proposal, which led mayor Dayashankar Tiwari to pass the resolution. The resolution was passed to reassure Maratha community voters ahead of NMC elections slated early next year, said sources.Thakre told TOI that the apex court decision bars OBCs to contest local body election on the basis of their caste and they will have to contest from open category.In 2017 NMC elections, 30 seats had been reserved for SC, 12 for ST and 41 for OBC candidates.Since OBCs constitute a large section of the population in Nagpur city, they play a vital role in deciding the fate of any candidate or political party, said political observers.Erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government had announced reservation for OBCs in local bodies. Ruling that total reservation ceiling of 50% can’t be breached, Supreme Court had quashed the 27% OBC quota in any local body polls in Maharashtra. The review petition filed by the incumbent Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government too was rejected by the Supreme Court.While Fadnavis blamed the MVA-led state government for the loss of OBC quota, state Congress chief Nana Patole blamed BJP-led Union government for not providing data as the central government was urged to submit relevant facts to support the OBC reservation.Thakre told TOI that it was the state government’s responsibility to provide empirical data of the OBC community in Maharashtra. According to him, in the coming days, more local self-government bodies will pass a similar resolution to pressure the MVA government to act towards restoring OBC reservation in local bodies.On March 4, the apex court had directed Maharashtra government to set up an OBC commission, collect empirical data of OBC population and submit the same, pointed out Thakre.If the state government does not act, OBC leaders will have to contest local body elections from open category, which will be a great loss to the community, he claimed. Hence, the NMC general body has passed the resolution, said Thakre.The SC judgment has also led to cancellation of membership of 31 OBC members elected to the local bodies, including Nagpur Zilla Parishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-local-body-polls-till-obc-quota-is-restored/articleshow/83760021.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Kochi||Polluting river in Kerala: Kitex MD dismisses claims of MLA||KOCHI: P T Thomas MLA has come up with allegations that Kitex, a textiles group operating from Kizhakkambalam, has been dumping waste from its dyeing unit into Kadambrayar river. Speaking at a press conference in Kochi on Tuesday, Thomas said that excessive pollution was killing the river. According to Thomas, the state pollution control board (SPCB) in its report prepared a couple of months ago attests to the charges levelled by him. “In 2012, the then minister K Babu had convened a meeting in Kochi to address the issues related to Kadambrayar. The owners of Kitex Garments had promised to address the pollution caused by the firm within six months,” Thomas said. “Still, the promise remains a promise. The content of chromium in the waste water dumped by Kitex is 0.1mg per litre, which is three times higher than the allowed levels,” Thomas said. Another allegation levelled by Thomas against Kitex was that the company is operating without proper waste treatment facilities. “The company undertakes dyeing jobs from other textiles units outside the state. I have documents to prove that. This is causing widespread pollution in Kizhakkambalam,” Thomas said. “The company doesn’t have zero liquid discharge system,” he said. At the same time, Kitex Garments managing director Sabu M Jacob denied all the charges levelled by Thomas, in a separate press conference. Jacob said the dyeing method used in his unit was the most modern one which is prevailing in developed countries. “We don’t use water for dyeing purpose. So, there isn’t any waste discharged from our factory,” Jacob said. Jacob also termed the allegations that orders for dyeing jobs were being undertaken from outside the state as baseless. Jacob said that he would file a defamation case against Thomas who raised “baseless” allegations. The allegations by Thomas damaged the goodwill of the company among consumers from across the globe as well as in India. Jacob also alleged that Thomas has started to raise allegations against Kitex following Twenty 20 fielding its candidate from Thrikkakara assembly constituency in the election held in April. But Thomas said that his intention was to save Kadambrayar and not to close down the factory. It was in January 2021, which is months ahead of the assembly elections, that he started to raise the allegation against Kitex, Thomas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/polluting-river-kitex-md-dismisses-claims-of-mla/articleshow/83758096.cms||---

Crucially, Congress wants that the J&K region should get special provisions for land ownership based on domicile “like they exist for Himachal”. The three-point charter emerged in the discussions of Congress’s J&K affairs committee chaired by former PM Manmohan Singh and attended by party president Sonia Gandhi, senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, P Chidambaram and state incharge Rajani Patil among others. Sources said Azad spelt out the issues that the party should focus on in the discussion called by the Centre. It is statehood for the region, which is now a UT, that tops the party agenda. The meeting, sources said, expressed surprise that the Centre had not issued any official agenda for the June 24 discussion. Going over the possible scenarios, the gathering, it is learnt, went through a gamut of concerns and crunched them to the three points. Chidambaram and Azad will draft the Congress stand according to which the party will respond in the meeting depending on the agenda that the Centre specifies later. The Congress delegation in the meeting will comprise Azad, J&K unit chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir and former deputy CM Tarachand Sharma. The party has refused to dwell much on Article 370. Sources said the subject was “sub-judice in the Supreme Court”. A few days ago, when a controversy erupted because of a comment made by senior leader Digvijay Singh, party spokesman Randeep Surjewala had clarified that Singh’s reported remark was not the party stand and Congress was bothered about statehood — its stance dictated by the August 6, 2019, resolution of the CWC. Congress veteran Karan Singh reportedly lamented at the meeting that his father, late Hari Singh, gave statehood to J&K and now he was having to fight for the same after so many decades. Sources said Ghulam Mir and Patil held a meeting of state party leaders on Monday and submitted a report summarising the views of local workers. Mir said, “It has been Congress policy that if there is conflict or anger in any part of the country, it should be resolved by dialogue. So, when PM Modi has taken the initiative for talks, we should attend it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pms-jk-meet-cong-to-seek-early-polls-statehood-restoration/articleshow/83766033.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Prima facie, we’ve an impression that earlier judge, who was presiding over the conduct of trials, may not have taken prompt steps for their conclusion on or before June 9 deadline. From the facts stated in application, we gather that there has been no stay granted by the Supreme Court to HC’s May 6 order.”Before adjourning the hearing by two weeks, the judges clarified that if any proceedings are pending before the apex court, then their numbers along with the orders be obtained and incorporated in report submitted to HC.The HC had registered a criminal suo motu contempt on April 29, based on media reports of vital drug being black marketed at a premium to patients, and appointed Shreerang Bhandarkar as amicus curiae. After receiving complaints, the police had launched a crackdown and arrested 32 persons, including a doctor.“Due to the sudden surge of Covid-19 cases, neither manufacturers nor authorities entrusted with distribution of medicines were prepared for such situation, resulting in unscrupulous people taking advantage. The demand supply ratio of remdesivir, which is a lifesaving drug, is exponentially inverse. Due to big demand and lack of supply, the people in urgent need, and in particular the lower strata of society, are unable to get it at a market price,” the then division bench comprising justices Zaka Haq and Amit Borkar had observed.The judges pointed out that the time consumed for investigation of offences and disposal of criminal trials aren’t dissuading black marketers from indulging in such activities. “In such unprecedented time of crisis, it’s necessary to take certain unprecedented measures to deter unscrupulous people from indulging in black marketing of life saving drugs,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-orders-fact-finding-probe-if-judges-delayed-remdesivir-black-mktg-trials/articleshow/83760030.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Delhi||Hopes dashed: Delhi’s date with monsoon set to be delayed||NEW DELHI: The arrival of monsoon over Delhi is likely to be late this year. With India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting that monsoon may not advance any further over the next seven days, its onset is likely to happen after the normal date of June 27 in Delhi. The Met department had earlier forecast monsoon to reach Delhi by June 15. “Southwest monsoon 2021 has so far covered most parts of the country except parts of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. However, further progress of monsoon over the remaining parts of the country is unlikely during the next seven days,” said IMD on Tuesday. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said, “There are chances of cloud formation on June 25 while parts of Delhi may witness very light rain on June 26. The weather is largely expected to remain dry over the next seven days and hence, the onset of monsoon may be late.” The capital recorded a hot day on Tuesday as the maximum temperature rose to 39.8 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum temperature was recorded at 27.4 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 81% and 31%. According to the forecast of the Met department, there is a possibility of very light rain or thundershowers on June 26 while thundery formation is expected on June 25 and 27. The maximum temperature may hover around 40 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and Thursday. It is likely to come down to 38 degrees Celsius on Friday. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality deteriorated on Tuesday as the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the national capital was recorded at 127 in ‘moderate’ category. “AQI is likely to deteriorate and stay in the ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderate’ category for the next three days,” stated System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hopes-dashed-citys-date-with-monsoon-set-to-be-delayed/articleshow/83762518.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Hyderabad||SEC okays Covaxin phase-3 trials data, 77.8% efficacy||HYDERABAD: A day ahead of Bharat Biotech’s pre-submission meeting with the World Health Organisation (WHO) for emergency use listing (EUL) for Covaxin, the subject expert committee (SEC) has given its nod to the vaccine’s phase-3 efficacy trials data. The inactivated SARSCoV-2 vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is learnt to have shown an efficacy of 77.8% as per the data submitted to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The SEC, which advises the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), is reported to have given its approval to the efficacy data after a marathon meeting on Tuesday. This followed the submission of the efficacy trials data to the drug regulator over the weekend. The next step would be an approval from the DCGI, following which the company would be applying for a full licensure for the vaccine, as Bharat Biotech had indicated earlier this month. The Hyderabad-based vaccine maker will also be carrying out a phase-4 clinical trial of Covaxin to check its real world efficacy, as it had indicated recently. The company had been facing a lot of heat for the delays in making public the final phase-3 data of Covaxin, which has been mired in controversy since its restricted emergency use authorisation on January 3 while its phase-3 trials were underway. Bharat Biotech’s top brass had attributed the delays in declaring the data to it being the largest efficacy trial conducted in the developing world, generating reams of data that was taking time to process. The phase-3 study was conducted on 25,800 volunteers in the 18-99 years age bracket. While the company had declared an interim efficacy of 81% after the first analysis in March, it had in April declared an overall interim efficacy of 78% and a 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sec-okays-covaxin-ph-3-trials-data-77-8-efficacy/articleshow/83764499.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Ahmedabad||Prohibition’s aim? Law’s text is dry on that||AHMEDABAD: Is Gujarat’s much touted prohibition law without any objective? When the Chief Justice of the Gujarat high court on Tuesday raised the question about the objective of the prohibition law, none of the lawyers could find an answer in bulky files. The papers are part of the proceedings on various litigations demanding the freedom to drink liquor in private places. During the discussion on the state government’s preliminary objections to the petitions challenging some provisions of the Gujarat Prohibition Act, which earlier was the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949, Chief Justice Vikram Nath raised certain questions. The questions related to the objective of the law when it was enacted in 1949. “Why was prohibition necessary? Why only in the state of Bombay?” the Chief Justice asked. Senior advocate Mihir Thakore, who represents the petitioners, read from the text of the 1949 Act which mentions a particular press communique and how the Abkari Act came into being for levying of excise duty. But the Chief Justice asked once again what the legislation says about the objective of the law. It was brought to the court’s notice that nothing was stated in the law about it. “Possibly in one line the said policy was defined in the press communique of 1946, which might have contained it,” it was submitted. But that document could not be traced, the court was told. The only answer put forth by the petitioners’ counsel was that Mahatma Gandhi was of the view that there should be prohibition. Morarji Desai, who was the chief minister of the Bombay State at the relevant point in time, was a staunch prohibitionist. This could be a reason for the state’s adoption of the prohibition policy, it was said in court. Dissatisfied with the answers, the Chief Justice reiterated that there must be an objective for bringing out the legislation. Advocate general Kamal Trivedi referred to the debates of the Constituent Assembly, in which the members discussed the idea to curb drinking and raise health standards. Another senior counsel, Devan Parikh, who also represents the petitioners, submitted that there was a difference of opinion on prohibition. He said it was left to the states to take the decision on prohibition, but there was no relation of this prohibition policy to the Abkari Act, which earlier used to regulate liquor sales. As for the state government, it says that the Supreme Court decided the issue of the validity of the prohibition law in 1951. The state government contends that, therefore, the new challenge on the grounds of the right to privacy is not maintainable before a high court. The lawyers read out the Bombay high court and the SC orders to point out that the earlier challenge was limited to medicinal and toilet preparations because they also contain alcohol. But, the lawyers said, the question on the consumption of liquor has come up for the first time and hence the petitions are maintainable. Another senior advocate, Mihir Joshi, submitted that the question on the prohibition policy is in light of the new interpretation of the SC on the right to privacy. “What stops the government from saying that there should not be non-veg food in your home from tomorrow?” he said. He said that this is a test of people’s right and the state’s approach. CJ’s questions During the hearing, the Chief Justice questioned whether alcohol is defined in the definition of liquor and whether the percentage of alcohol in a prohibited drink is mentioned. The answers were in the negative. The CJ also questioned for how long a person has to wait before entering Gujarat after consuming liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prohibitions-aim-laws-text-is-dry-on-that/articleshow/83762509.cms||---

Though earlier issue of fake jobs was mainly done in IT and other sectors, the scam is spreading into health sector too. Now, the increased hiring of health workers by hospitals during the pandemic is used as an opportunity by fraudsters and fake job offers are even made in the name of leading hospitals in the city. Even medical graduates lost their money in such cases. One such case was reported in Ernakulam on Monday when a woman medical graduate was swindled out of around Rs 5,000 in a fake pre-interview session with a leading hospital in the city held via online. The woman, a native of Kollam, was on a job hunt in various hospitals in the city . “My interview with the hospital was scheduled on Tuesday. On Monday, I got a call from a person, who introduced himself as the HR manager of the same hospital. After briefing about the interview , which included verification of certificate, he asked to pay Rs 5,000, which was a ‘refundable’ deposit for the interview purpose. I paid it via UPI and later he asked money again citing other charges, which made me suspicious and I cut the call,” said the woman, on condition of anonymity. The woman informed her bank about the fraud and registered a complaint with the police cybercell, which launched a probe. “Several such cases are being reported each day and the ideal way to prevent it is people becoming more cautious,” said K Karthick, district police chief (Ernakulam rural).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rise-in-cases-of-fake-online-job-interviews/articleshow/83758141.cms||---

A formal police complaint in sexual harassment of medical attendants was lodged with B-division police station after one victim agreed to come forward. Police are likely to arrest the accused on Wednesday after the due procedure. According to police sources, LB Prajapati and Akbar Ali, both working as attendants, were allegedly involved n sexually harassing the victim. The FIR states they used to touch the women inappropriately and resort to physical and unwelcome advancement that included disrobing, passing sexually coloured comments, obscene gestures etc. They both were booked under IPC sections 354, 354a, 354b, 509 and 114. Prajapati and Ali were both holding the same positions as the victim but the former was given the administrative powers which he allegedly misused to harass the victim. “When the victim resisted his sexual advances, Prajapati used to publicly torture her by rebuking her on a small mistake. He used to assign her night duty, which made her uncomfortable in her work,” said police. A police officer quoting the contents of the FIR told TOI that Prajapati harassed the victims for more than six months till the time she left the job. “The sexual consent was implied through the gestures though it was not directly demanded,” an officer said adding that “Since Prajapati was holding an informal position, he tried to disrobe the victim making her uncomfortable and traumatised.” Prajapati was assigned the powers like deciding the duty hours of the attendants, taking their presence, deciding their leave and others and he used to take on a round to see if the work other attendants were carrying out properly. He had powers to report about anybody’s mistakes. Police said the sexual harassment was committed inside the premise of GG hospital and it took them few days to convince the victim to register the FIR but she was scared if the issue blew up. Meanwhile, the three-member committee appointed by district collector also submitted its report after recording the statement of nearly 10 women attendants and collecting the primary evidence. The report is under consideration and based on the instructions of the government, more victims will be included in the FIR or some other separate FIRs may registered. The committee submitted its report to the state government and it’s under consideration with the home ministry.

Following state directives, half of them will be for walk-ins. Covishield will be given at these centres. “Totally, 15,900 can avail of this facility,” said Ram Joshi, the NMC additional municipal commissioner.For the first time, on-spot registration and vaccination is being allowed in the 18-44 years age group. Earlier, after the Centre had allowed vaccination of 18-plus from May 1, only online was permitted. State stopped vaccinating this age group on May 12 citing shortage of doses after the responsibility of procuring vaccines was put on it. On June 8, Centre announced free vaccine for all adults from June 21. The state started vaccination of 30-44 year age group from June 19 with 50% slots remaining offline.Joshi added that 50 slots at each centre will be for 45-plus in offline (21,200 slots on Wednesday). “They can also book online,” he said. GMCH, Mahal Diagnostic and Khobragade Hall will continue only for 45-plus with Covaxin shots.Private hospitals Kingsway, Wockhardt and New Era will continue with paid vaccination of 18-plus.With resumption of vaccination of 30-44 years age group, the number of beneficiaries swelled in the district. On Tuesday, 26,378 took the jab of which 16,057 were in this category. A 14,354 took the shot in city and 12,024 in rural.The number of beneficiaries had dropped to less than 4,000 per day in the district before commencement of inoculation of 30-44 years age group. As per the NMC’s data, there are 17 lakh adults in the city. 5.73 lakh people, including healthcare workers and frontline workers, had taken the first dose by June 22.

Two of the four others, who refrained from venturing into deep waters, were injured when the tragedy occurred.Those who drowned have been identified as Toufique Khan (16), Pravin Galorkar (17), Awesh Shaikh (17) and Arif Patel (16).

---||Lucknow||BL Santhosh, Radha Mohan meet BJP leaders, ministers to chart Uttar Pradesh poll strategy||LUCKNOW: A day after holding detailed sessions with the RSS functionaries and then with the party's core committee comprising Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP national secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and vice-president Radha Mohan Singh on Tuesday turned to state BJP organisational leaders and then met the UP ministers. Yogi, too, was present at the meeting at the UP BJP headquarters. The exercise was largely viewed as the saffron party's attempt to chart out a cohesive political strategy which could be implemented at the ground level to take on an assertive opposition in the run up to UP assembly elections due next year. Maurya presenting a saffron ‘angavastram’ to the CM.“The party leadership has stressed on stepping up the constitution of a robust organisational structure up to the booth level,” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, after the meeting between the two senior BJP leaders and state organisational functionaries. The meeting, which lasted four hours, was attended by BJP's national secretary Harish Dwivedi and party's national treasurer Rajesh Agarwal, as well as UP BJP's regional presidents and conveners. The decision to ramp up organisational structure comes close on the heels of the party's recent move of constituting a new team of office-bearers of frontal wings, and IT/social media cells. The BJP seeks to set its new organisational team in motion to consolidate its position at the grass-roots, especially after the recent panchayat elections which saw the opposition, mainly the Samajwadi Party, posing a formidable challenge. Singh said that the party will also focus on the matters pertaining to awareness about vaccination against Covid, other public service related issues including free food grain distribution and tree plantation. The meeting between the two senior BJP leaders with UP ministers too attained much significance amid the party's Central leadership stress on scaling up measures to address a host of issues including those pertaining to Covid and farmers. The meeting was attended by senior ministers, including both deputy chief ministers — Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma — besides Suresh Khanna, Surya Pratap Shahi, Shrikant Sharma, Sidharthnath Singh, Jai Pratap Singh, Dara Singh Chauhan and Swami Prasad Maurya. Sources said that both the senior BJP leaders underscored on the need for ministers camping in various districts where they have been appointed as in charge. The measure was recently announced by UP BJP chief after a cabinet meeting presided over by Yogi. The BJP leaders also stressed on meeting the target as mentioned in the `Sankalp Patra' (BJP manifesto) of 2017 UP assembly elections. The issue is learnt to have been taken up by Santhosh and Singh in the state BJP core committee meeting on Monday. During their previous three days stay between May 31 and June 2, Santhosh and Singh had met the UP ministers, in what was billed as an exercise to streamline coordination between the state government and the party organisation. Sharma attends meet called by Santhosh: Four days after he was appointed as UP BJP vice-president, former bureaucrat and PM Narendra Modi's close aide, AK Sharma attended the meeting called by BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and vice-president Radha Mohan Singh. Sharma was present at the meeting of Santhosh and Singh with UP ministers along with other BJP organisational leaders including party VP Rekha Verma and national secretary Harish Dwivedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/santhosh-radha-mohan-meet-bjp-leaders-mins-to-chart-poll-strategy/articleshow/83762529.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Accused conspired with BARC officials to rig TRPs’||Mumbai: The accused in the TRP case “conspired with the arrested BARC officials to rig the TRPs of their channel,” the crime branch press release on the second supplementary chargesheet stated. While the first chargsheet had mentioned 15 accused, the second supplementary chargesheet, over 1,912 pages long, has enlisted seven more persons as accused. This case was probed by the crime intelligence unit (CIU) headed by assistant police inspector Sachin Waze and Riyazuddin Kazi, both arrested in the planting of gelatin sticks in a vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the subsequent murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran. The case was registered on October 6 last year after the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) lodged a complaint that certain TV channels were rigging TRPs through illegal means. BARC has installed 2,000 barometers in Mumbai to monitor TRPs, which are strictly confidential. BARC, which releases weekly rating points for TV channels in India, had given the contract to Hansa Research, which filed the complaint against some former employees who misused the data on households where TRP monitoring systems are installed. Police during the probe had said that when Arnab Goswami launched Republic TV in 2017, he sought former BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta’s help in manipulating TRPs to take the channel to the No. 1 slot. Both have known each other since 2013. Police said they had also stumbled upon certain email exchanges and WhatsApp chats between Dasgupta and Republic channel’s chief operating officer (COO), Romit Ramgarhia, discussing TRP manipulation. There are also WhatsApp chats between Goswami and Dasgupta discussing TRP manipulation, police had said. The crime branch had arrested 15 people, including employees of Hansa, Republic TV, Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema, News Nation, Maha Movies and Wow music channels for inflating viewership figures, a key parameter that media buying houses consider while placing advertisements. The channels are accused of paying money to households (in those houses where barometers are installed) for keeping channels on. Officials said the arrests of Waze and Kazi have not impacted the investigation. The case was subsequently probed by assistant commissioner of police Shashank Sandbhor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-accused-conspired-with-barc-officials-to-rig-trps/articleshow/83762970.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Pune||Air quality near crematorium to be assessed||PUNE: The civic body has planned a third-party assessment of air quality near the Vaikunth crematorium. For this purpose, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has engaged the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). The civic administration planned the assessment following complaints of poor air quality by residents, who claimed that cremation of bodies — including those of Covid-19 victims — was causing air pollution in the vicinity. The presence of carbon particles and other pollutants has increased in the vicinity of the crematorium, residents claimed. “The assessment will be completed in the next six months. It will check if cremations are causing or intensifying air pollution,” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, said. The committee approved a proposal regarding the assessment on Tuesday. The facility has three electrical crematoriums, one gas crematorium and six stands for wood pyres. PMC has set up separate blowers and scrubbers to prevent pollution. The smoke is discharged through a chimney that is 30 metres tall. PMC has installed sensors for air quality monitoring near Vaikunth. PMC limits have 24 cremation facilities, including electric and gas-operated crematoriums. As per civic administration data, around 10 to 15 Covid deaths were recorded per day. The number of deaths went up 80 during the peak periods of the pandemic. Per day, around 300 bodies were cremated across the civic limits, officials said. Among other decisions, the standing committee took the call to scrap the revenue committee constituted under the chairmanship of municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar. The standing committee approved Rs 6.71 crore for a city library and study room for students preparing for competitive exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/air-quality-near-crematorium-to-be-assessed/articleshow/83760125.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana weddings get creative: Covid-19 jab & OTT membership as gifts for guests||HYDERABAD: Wedding planners in Telangana are busy these days, adjusting to the ‘new normal’ demands from families beyond the usual floral decorations and destination marriages. As Telangana gears up for some 3 lakh marriages with the second Covid-19 wave ebbing, vaccinations for all guests, OTT memberships as gift, and YouTube premium passwords that can unlock the entire marriage as a three-hour package, are the flavour of the season. “These days, demand is for innovative gifts for those who cannot attend the wedding due to restrictions. Bride or groom, many families are preferring OTT membership as return gifts. The trend began during the first wave of Covid-19, but now it has picked up a lot,” Ashok Patnaik, owner of a digital marketing company and a wedding planner, said. While some are postponing weddings so as to hold grand celebrations later, many are organizing it in style, albeit with limited numbers. Those who cannot make it to the wedding can watch the entire marriage, sitting hundreds of miles away, and still feel part of the proceedings. “The video of my marriage will be posted on YouTube premium and with limited passwords. The passwords will be shared with near and dear ones, who otherwise would have attended the wedding but for the pandemic,” Sai Kumar, a groom, said. Kiran Neta, an independent cameraman who works for several wedding photography companies, said the videos are hosted for two to three months. The cost of such videos can go up to Rs 12 lakh. The shoot is in two parts, which includes two minutes of a promotional video, and 30 minutes of full video with celebrations,” Neta says, adding that the actual footage runs into several hours. Turns out, vaccines are also coming into play as part of the wedding preparation. “Some families who are taking my help to perform the ritual have asked me to get vaccinated before the festivities. And some are even asking only vaccinated people to attend the wedding,” KVR Sharma, a priest from Chikkadpally, said. A family in Jubilee Hills got the entire guests vaccinated before the marriage took place, while others are planning on similar lines. “First, we asked our priest to get vaccinated; now, we told those on our guest list to get vaccinated. We were polite and said our wedding planner can also help, and it worked,” Chandrasekar Reddy, who got his daughter married a few days ago, said. Every year, some 10-12 lakh weddings take place in Telangana, many in Hyderabad and its surrounding districts. Some are even sending digital video invitations to guests. “People are wearing masks, while fever checks and sanitizers are all in place. But during weddings, social distance goes for a toss,” Sharma, the priest, says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-weddings-get-creative-covid-19-jab-ott-membership-as-gifts-for-guests/articleshow/83764561.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Pune||Pune airport set to get IAF land for new cargo facility||PUNE: The Indian Air Force (IAF) has agreed to provide land to the Pune airport authorities to facilitate the shifting of the cargo hold area to a larger space, three years after the proposal was first floated. “The defence ministry has given us an oral confirmation; we are waiting for permission in writing,” Pune MP Girish Bapat, chairman of the Pune Airport Advisory Committee, told TOI. “I will be in Delhi later this month for the Monsoon session of the parliament and will get the written confirmation by the end of the month. Once this happens, the cargo hold area can be shifted by early next month,” Bapat added. Pune airport has emerged as an important centre as stocks of Covishield vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII), are sent out from here. Larger consignments of the vaccine, however, are transported by road to the Mumbai airport and flown from there. The new space would help increase the volumes transported. “We are looking at very large consignments of vaccine being transported from Pune in the near future,” a source at the Pune airport said. Bapat further said the defence ministry made it clear that no permanent construction would be allowed on the plot. “We will come up with temporary sheds so that cargo is protected from weather conditions,” he said. The shifting of the cargo facility had been pending for over three years. Last October, Pune airport authorities had said they were losing business worth Rs 2.5 crore per day. “If we get the plot opposite IAFs barrack store office yard, the handling capacity will increase to 500 tonnes each day. About 150 tonnes of cargo is handled by the existing facility,” Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh said. However, a sense of urgency set in with the transport of vaccines starting in January, airport officials said. “Also, the existing area where cargo is processed has to be closed to facilitate construction of the new terminal building. We were expecting things to move by January, but it didn’t work out,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-airport-set-to-get-iaf-land-for-new-cargo-facility/articleshow/83760119.cms||Joy Sengupta

While many were seen enjoying the downpour, several commuters were wading through deep waters as the rainfall occurred for nearly one hour during the peak evening hours. According to an estimate, 25 mm rainfall was reported in an hour in several parts of western Rajkot. People reported knee-high water near Lodhika GIDC, Race Course Road and near police headquarter which disrupted routine traffic. Heavy rain also blocked several roads for nearly an hour in areas like Kalavad Road, University Road, 150 foot Ring Road, Bhaktinagar, Dhebar Road and other areas. The work on flyovers is also under progress at Hospital Chowk, Madhapar Chowk and KKV Chowk and water logging affected the movement of vehicles in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/25mm-rainfall-in-one-hour-floods-rajkot/articleshow/83758266.cms||---

A woman who had befriended him on social media had posted an allegedly morphed video showing him in the nude talking to her on a video call. The 42-year-old Sanand resident told cybercrime police on Sunday that the accused had done so after he refused to pay her money. “The woman’s Facebook profile identified her as Nikita Rajput. She sent a friend request on June 5. Once I accepted it, she began chatting with me on Facebook messenger,” Raghav told police. Then, on June 8, Rajput allegedly made a video call. “She disrobed on the call and asked me to take off my clothes. I was stunned. Then, I immediately disconnected the phone. However, a while later, I received a video in which I was naked on the video call with the woman,” he said in the complaint. He told police that the woman asked for Rs 50,000 but when he refused to pay up, she posted his video on social media on his birthday — June 11. He approached police and filed a complaint of defamation under IPC along with sections under the information technology act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-gets-obscene-video-as-birthday-gift/articleshow/83762569.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Maurya’s lunch for Yogi, RSS brass keeps political circle abuzz||Lucknow: In a development that send ‘all’s well’ message across political spectrum, Chief Minister Yogi Adityasnath and some of top RSS functionaries, including Sarkaryawah Dattatreya Hosable, and Sah Sarkaryawah, Krishna Gopal, attended a lunch hosted by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on Tuesday afternoon. While the event was kept strictly away from media glare, sources close to the deputy CM said that the lunch was in the “honour” of Yogi and RSS leaders who were invited to give their blessing to Maurya’s son Yogesh and daughter-in-law Anjali who got married a month ago. The marriage was solemnized on May 22 in Rae Bareli in presence of very few guests in the wake of Covid pandemic. In fact, Maurya gave the information about the marriage through a tweet. The presence of Hosable and Krishna Gopal at the event raised much curiosity in the BJP corridors since the two RSS top leaders have been focussing intensely on UP’s political turf while being in close coordination with PM Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. Significantly, this was perhaps for the first time since BJP came to power in 2017, that Yogi and senior RSS functionaries attended any event hosted by Maurya at his residence. Although a government spokesperson said that the CM’s visit was to bless the newly wed couple and no political string should be attached to it, the development created a buzz in the state capital in the light of talks about the ‘cold vibes’ between the CM and deputy. A few days ago, Maurya had said that the face of BJP in 2022 UP assembly elections would be decided by the party’s Central leadership. Maurya’s statement was later dittoed by labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya, who also maintained that party’s top leadership would take a formal decision as to who would be the chief minister if BJP comes back to power next year. This was despite top UP BJP ranks consistent assertion about Yogi being the best choice to steer the party in the forthcoming state polls. Maurya’s decision to host a lunch for Yogi and senior RSS leaders coincided with BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and vice-president Radha Mohan Singh reaching Lucknow to hold a coordination meeting with the state BJP leaders and UP ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mauryas-lunch-for-yogi-rss-brass-keeps-political-circle-abuzz/articleshow/83762623.cms||Pankaj Shah

The elected members said the works should have been completed before the onset of the monsoon and demanded a detailed plan from the administration to prevent delays in this annual exercise. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol told the departments concerned to give a written explanation to each corporator on the issues raised by them. Corporators from Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena raised slogans about the delay at the start of the discussions in the general body meeting. NCP’s Vishal Tambe said, “The officials and mayor should drive across the city to check the condition of the roads. Commuters are facing hardship as all major roads have still not been repaired fully.” Congress corporator Aba Bagul too spoke about the condition of the roads. “The officials concerned should explain what work was done and why it was not completed before the monsoon. Roads should be restored with proper planning, as a haphazard approach could lead to more chaos,” Bagul said. NCP corporator Ashwini Kadam meanwhile pointed out that construction of safety walls along the nullah has been ongoing for two years. Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar said there was a need to check all nullahs in the city. “Every year, issues of nullah cleaning and choking of stormwater channels are discussed at the GB meeting. There is a need for a detailed plan that can be executed every year to complete the work on time,” Sutar said. The deadline for completion of works was extended twice, till June 10. Leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar said old drainage pipelines were replaced in the city’s central areas. The work was delicate and essential to strengthening the drainage system, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporators-slam-delay-in-roadworks-cleaning-nullahs/articleshow/83760177.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Traffic cops step up action against helmetless riders||PUNE: With markets re-opening and vehicular movement increasing, cases of motorists riding without helmets have emerged as the most common traffic offence, the Pune police have said. Statistics provided by the traffic police revealed that 2.79 lakh motorists were caught for the offence between April and June 15. “From June 16 to June 20, a total of 28,244 people were fined for the violation. On an average, each day we are looking at 9,000 to 10,000 such cases, which is much higher than any other traffic offence. Most cases are being recorded on the basis of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame told TOI. The relaxations, such opening of malls and non-essential shops on weekdays, eateries, restaurants and bars operating till 10pm, came into force from June 14 in Pune. The fine for not wearing a helmet is Rs 200. However, according to the Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, which is still to be implemented in the state, the fine has been increased to Rs 1,000. Between January and March this year, more than 4.70 lakh people were caught for not wearing helmets. Activists blamed the police for the situation. “The enforcement is not up to the mark. Presently, the police’s focus seems to be only on people not wearing masks. The conditions had improved not too long ago, when the police had become very strict about riding without a helmet. If most fines for not wearing helmets are being levied after checking CCTV cameras, it makes no sense that they are letting such offenders go free,” said Sujit Patwardhan, convener of NGO Parisar. “In cities like Delhi or Kolkata, you cannot ride for even half a kilometre without a policeman stopping and fining you if you are without a helmet,” said Adarsh Pandit, a working professional. The helmet rule was made mandatory on January 1, 2018, by then police commissioner K Venkatesham. The move had run into a lot of opposition initially, with residents and even some elected representatives opposing it. The police then held workshops to educate citizens about the importance of wearing helmets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traffic-cops-step-up-action-against-helmetless-riders/articleshow/83760169.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Nagpur||NMC told not to ‘harass’ animal lovers||Nagpur: The state animal husbandry department has asked the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to stop “baseless” complaints against animal lovers. Recently, a young animal feeder was allegedly harassed by residents in Jaripatka. “On complaint of some residents, NMC staff came to pick up stray dogs from the area. When the boy tried stopping them citing animal welfare rules, the residents filed a false police complaint against him with charges of abusing and fighting,” said Karishma Galani, animal activist and member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). Following the incident, Galani wrote a letter to state animal husbandry commissioner in Pune requesting safeguarding of stray dog feeders and animal lovers. Stating that it is the constitutional right to feed stray animals, she said, “As per the norms of central government, it is illegal to relocate dogs. Even after sterilization, dogs have to be released in the same locality.” The activist added that due to inconsistency in the animal birth control (ABC) programme, the population of strays in Nagpur is on a significant rise. “Residents just want to get rid of dogs from their area. When animal lovers try to stop them citing norms, they get into trouble,” added Galani. Based on her complaint, the animal husbandry department has asked NMC to ensure that its veterinary officers personally intervenes in such matters and ensure that no animal lover or feeder is falsely accused of anything. As per the letter written by the department to the civic body, the officer has to personally visit police stations at times of such complaints. Welcoming the move, Galani said that the concept of community dogs needs to be implemented in the city on the lines of metros like Mumbai. “We need to realize that dogs help in controlling various outbreaks like plague. It is important to have dogs in your locality. To control their over-population, citizens can also contribute and get sterilization done of street dogs instead of being dependent on the local bodies,” she said. The activist also informed that in case the stray dogs are sick, aggressive or pose any danger to humans, the civic body has the authority to shift them. “Such dogs can be shifted to animal shelters. Same is the case with incidents of dog bites. However it is scientifically proven that dogs get less aggressive if ABC is done properly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-told-not-to-harass-animal-lovers/articleshow/83760155.cms||Manka Behl
---||Vadodara||Jilted lover tried to kill married colleague, end life||Vadodara: The mystery behind two employees found wounded at a private firm at Padra over a week ago turned out to be a case of one-sided love. The police have booked Ashwin Parmar (22) for attempting to murder his 29-year-old colleague Suvarna Dorik. According to the police, Ashwin had been proposing to Suvarna for the past two-and-half months. She is married and has a two-year-old child but that didn’t deter Ashwin from harassing her. They both work in the quality control department of BDR Lifesciences Pvt Ltd. While Ashwin works as a helper, she is an officer. “Ashwin wanted to have a relationship with Suvarna but she had rejected his advances. Ashwin used to call her on phone too but she kept ignoring his harassment,” said M A Karmur, Padra police inspector. On June 14, Ashwin again approached Suvarna when she was about to finish her shift and leave the office. He cornered her and again proposed for marriage. “When she rejected his proposal, he got angry and slit his own throat with a paper cutter. Ashwin then slit Suvarna’s throat before injuring himself again. She panicked and ran out of the room where the other staff members spotted her,” Karmur added. The duo was rushed to a hospital in Padra in serious condition. Their condition improved after a couple of days but both were not able to talk. The cops took a statement of the Suvarna late on Monday night wherein she narrated the entire incident. “We will arrest Ashwin as soon as he is discharged from the hospital. Investigations reveal that the company staffers were not aware of the woman’s ordeal,” Karmur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jilted-lover-tried-to-kill-married-colleague-end-life/articleshow/83755783.cms||---

He reacquired his Indian passport and citizenship in 2009. Ramesh’s counsel Y Rama Rao said that German officials had already clarified that all those who possess German passports were not that country’s citizens. The central government, which cancelled the Indian citizenship of the MLA on grounds of suppressing required information while applying for Indian citizenship in 2009, sought time to file its counter. Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili posted the case to two weeks for taking up final hearing. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/citizenship-row-ramesh-files-reply/articleshow/83762599.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid forces backpackers’ paradise Paharganj down the hill||NEW DELHI: Puneet Kumar Chhabra sits in his massive Paharganj store peering out, the fan overhead desperately trying to cool the hot summer air. Chhabra’s eyes sweep the main bazaar road for potential customers for the pajamas, shawls, shirts and other wares colourfully arrayed in his shop. But a shopper is rare in the once bustling hub of foreign backpackers and tourists. The bazaar, known for its kitschy, touristy offerings, has gone without customers for over a year now due to the pandemic, which has affected global travel. This has prompted many shop owners to rethink their business. Hotels, restaurants, and shops — even popular ones like Appetite German Bakery — are all but shut or only partially open. Ramesh, who runs an electricity hardware shop, looks at the closed shop opposite his establishment. “It used to be a bakery and operated for several decades,” he said. “With foreigners no longer coming here, the owners are starting some other business. In truth, however, the market of Paharganj is now dead.” This ominous claim is also made by other shop owners in the once busy market. Manish Gupta sits among the hookahs, shishas, chillums and other smoking devices and says in a desultory tone, “These days, I get just 10-20% of the business I used to two years ago when Paharganj was overcrowded and you wouldn’t even find space to walk in comfort. Now, only a few locals come looking for specific items.” Next door, Dinesh Kumar, who too sells smoking items, claimed, “There are days when we don't have a single customer. The employees of many shops like ours aren’t being paid their salaries. This is because the items we sell have a certain clientele and are oriented towards foreigners and tourists. It will need some miracle for the market to be rejuvenated.” The biggest victims of the pandemic, of course, are Paharganj’s hotels and restaurants. Vijay Sharma, owner of Hotel Anoop, claimed the business was now “zero” and there were no hopes of improvement in the situation. “Flights from other countries aren’t operating and we are not even getting domestic tourists for our hotels,” rued Sharma. “Many states in south India are still reeling from the pandemic and very few people are travelling to Delhi. The whole hotel industry is in turmoil and 50% of Paharganj’s hotels are fully shut down.” Mohammad Shoaib of Heritage Hotel concurred. “The main bazaar is entirely dependent on foreign tourists. We earn nothing without them. We are keeping our hotel open only to let any rare customer know we are open. Of course, nobody ever comes.” Satyam Hotel’s Suresh hoped for vaccinated foreigners to be allowed to travel. “We can at least get some business,” he said. Jagdish of Metropolis Restaurant isn’t so sure. The popular eatery, started in 1928, has been shuttered for a year now. “Most of the stuff on our menu was meant for the palate of foreigners. After they stopped coming, we haven’t opened the place,” said Jagdish. He remained circumspect about any hopeful turn in the dire situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-forces-backpackers-paradise-paharganj-down-the-hill/articleshow/83762645.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Lucknow||Then Barabanki SDM gets HC notice on masjid||Lucknow: A Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the respondents to file their response within three weeks in connection with the demolition of a mosque on May 17, 2021. It also issued notice to the then sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Ram Sanehi Ghat in Barabanki for his reply as 'malice was alleged against him'. It further granted a week to the petitioner for filing a rejoinder affidavit, fixing July 27, 2021 as the next date of hearing. A division bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice Saurabh Lavania passed the order on two writ petitions filed by P Sunni Central Waqf Board and Hashmat Ali and others respectively. The bench had heard the matter on June 15 and reserved its order on the question of interim relief. Pronouncing the order through video-conferencing on Tuesday, the bench observed, “We are of the opinion that these petitions prima facie raise important questions inter-alia (among other questions) as to the existence of a mosque on public utility land, if it is so, as also, with regard to exercise of power by state authorities under Section 133 Criminal Procedure Code and other related provisions, its scope, especially the allegations of mala-fide exercise of power and the manner in which it has been done, as alleged by the petitioners.” The bench recorded in its order that the senior advocate appearing for UP Sunni Central Waqf Board was unable, as of now, to show any documentary proof about the ownership right of the committee of management on the land where the mosque was constructed. On being pointed by the bench that if the relief for restoration of mosque is to be considered in these writ proceedings, assuming that the occasion so arises, then, the fact that the mosque validly existed on the land in question would have to be established and that this issue may also fall for consideration in the context of other reliefs claimed. Senior lawyer Yusuf Muchhala, who appeared for Hashmat Ali and others, referred to concept of 'Waqf by user' but ultimately submitted that they would not enter into complicated questions of title and would not raise the same in these proceedings and would confine their grievance to the relief claimed against the arbitrary, illegal and blatant exercise of power under Section 133 and claim for compensation for the same.” In the writ petitions, it has been alleged that the mosque was standing for hundred years on the land recorded as 'abadi land' in revenue records. Muslim community would offer namaz in the mosque. It has been alleged further that the then SDM Ram Sanehi Ghat, due to personal grudges and mala-fide reasons, got it demolished on May 17, 2021 in the garb of powers exercised under section 133 of CrPC. The state lawyer opposed the petitions and pleaded that the writs were not maintainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/then-barabanki-sdm-gets-hc-notice-on-masjid/articleshow/83762655.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Pune||Gujarat trio sent to police custody until June 28||PUNE: A special court on Tuesday sent the three persons — arrested from Gujarat — in police custody remand till June 28 in the case of allegedly duping 12 investors of around Rs3.6 crore from 2013 to 2019. The suspects, Bharat Charandas Joshi and his sons, Deepak and Hiren, from Bhuj in Gujarat were produced before the special court for the remand proceeding. Senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi from the Loni Kalbhor police station said, “We pleaded before the special court that the custodial interrogation of all the three suspects was essential in order to recover the hard-earned money given by the duped investors.” Mokashi added, “The FIR states that the complainant and 11 other investors were duped of around Rs3.6 crore but the investment fraud amount will increase because more investors are in the process of approaching the police even now to be able to give statements against the suspects.” He said, “The custodial interrogation of the suspects is essential to find out the involvement of their other accomplices involved in the investment fraud case. The court, after hearing us, sent the suspects in police remand for seven days.” The police said the suspects had floated four investment companies and lured people to invest in their firm between 2013 and 2019, promising to double their money. The suspects collected money from investors residing in Loni Kalbhor and Uruli Kanchan but failed to give them the promised returns. The trio, without giving intimation to the investors, silently closed the companies in 2019 and their whereabouts was not known since then. The fraud came to light after one of the investors, Dnyaneshwar Kalbhor, registered an FIR under the Indian Penal Code and the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors’ Act on September 25, 2020, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gujarat-trio-sent-to-police-custody-until-june-28/articleshow/83760217.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||As Hyderabad FSI touches the sky, worry builds up on ground||HYDERABAD: The rush of highrises, especially along the city's western corridor, has put the spotlight back on a 15-year-old government policy: Unlimited floor space index (FSI). Latest data available with TOI reveals that many of these big-ticket projects in Hyderabad – the only city in India with no FSI cap -- are recording FSIs of anywhere between 9 and 13, with the average hovering in the 6 to 7 range. The national average is 2 to 2.5. This means, builders in all other Indian cities cannot construct more than 2.5 lakh square feet (on an average), on one acre of land and must mark the rest as open area. In Hyderabad, though, they have no such limit. As a result, multiple upcoming commercial projects across Gachibowli, Manikonda, Madhapur – data showsare clocking between 4 lakh and 5.5 lakh sft per acre, with the minimum ranging between 3.2 lakh and 3.8 lakh sft per acre. While FSIs in the residential segment are lower in comparison, there too, several projects across Narsingi, Hi-Tec City, Kokapet are found crossing the 6 to 7.5 FSI mark. “This is a frightening trend, especially if it happens within core city limits. Construction overload with limited open space can build excessive pressure on the civic infrastructure and lead to several problems: reduced road widths, congestion, urban flooding, sewage overflow among others,” said C Ramachandriah, social scientist with the Centre for Economic and Social Studies. He added: “While the problems might not show up in the peripheral areas right away, given that these projects are still underway, they will become hurdles in the future if we do not plan sensibly now. We need to decongest the city, not clutter it further.” Architect, G Shankar Narayan, agrees. His solution: A variable FSI depending on the infrastructure of an area. “It is true that overbuilding can sap the city of its natural resources. But a blanket FSI is not the solution. The government must cap FSI of a certain locality after assessing the strength of its infrastructure – roads, water lines, public transport system etc. It can be different for different areas,” he said. Apart from civic issues, excessive building can also compromise with the quality of construction, feels Mahesh Khaitan, director of Salarpuria Sattva Group, calling for a cap of at least 5 or 6 on Hyderabad’s FSI. “But if that happens, the city will no longer remain as affordable as it is now,” argued Ashwin Rao, director of Manbhum Group. He said: “If we limit construction on a piece of land, it will reduce the supply and create a demandsupply gap. As a result, a house that is now available for Rs 6,000 per sft will cost a buyer Rs 12,000 per sft.” Further, citing the example of Bengaluru – the maximum FSI there is 3.25 -- he said, despite the cap the city is choking and is ridden with civic issues. “Hyderabad, on the other hand, has world-class infrastructure, especially its road network. Unlimited FSI is not a bane, it’s what is fuelling growth,” he added. Must review FSI rule: PlannersIn 2006, the then Andhra Pradesh government had brought in new building laws (GO 86) to attract real estate investments to the capital city. The order scrapped all floor space index regulations --or floor area ratio (FAR) as it is called in some states -- which basically dictates how much a developer can build on a certain piece of land. While that did become Hyderabad’s USP over time, urban planners and some sections of the realty industry feel that the government must review the rule now – 15 years later. They fear that uncontrolled vertical construction can result in the collapse of Hyderabad’s infrastructure. They attribute the city’s steep rise in land cost to the unlimited FSI rule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-city-fsi-touches-the-sky-worry-builds-up-on-ground/articleshow/83764604.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Goa||Mines dept clarifies law dept queries on mining corp, sends file back for vetting||Panaji: The state mines department has responded to all the clarifications sought by the law department on the proposal to form a new Goa Mining Corporation to restart mining activities in the state. A senior official said that as soon as the file is vetted by the law department, the state would either promulgate an ordinance or wait for the monsoon assembly session to introduce the bill. The state is in the process of finalising the date to sign an MoU with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd, to identify iron ore reserves in mining leases. The law department has vetted the MoU to be signed. The state, which had set a target of making the mining corporation functional by May 31, failed to do so after the law department sought clarifications on the proposal. Sawant, in his budget speech, had announced the setting up of the Goa Mining Corporation through auctioning of leases. “The government will sign an MoU with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL)... and that will help the state government start the process for e-auction,” Sawant had said. Mining in Goa came to a halt three years ago, following the decision of the Supreme Court quashing the second renewal of 88 mining leases. Since then, the government and mining companies have been trying to restart mining activities in the state. While it’s currently unknown if the industry would restart this financial year, the state government has set a target of mopping up Rs 550 crore from the industry. Before Liberation, Goa had 806 mining concessions, and in 1987, after the concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number reduced to 595. In 1987-88 and in 2000, 438 lease holders had applied for the first renewal. Subsequently, 413 lease holders had applied in 2006 for a second renewal. Out of the 595 valid mining leases in Goa, the state government cancelled 252 leases of those holders who had not applied during the first or second renewal of mining leases in 1987 and 2007. In October 2013, 119 mining leases were cancelled and another 133 were cancelled in November 2013. Before mining came to halt in September 2012, around 110 mining leases were in operation and around 45 million tonnes of iron ore were exported from Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mines-dept-clarifies-law-dept-queries-on-mining-corp-sends-file-back-for-vetting/articleshow/83760226.cms||---

The university’s microbiology department conducted 20 lakh tests till June 2021 through RT-PCR method. The department, headed by Prof Amita Jain, was also granted the advanced mycology diagnostic and research centre status by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday. All research related to fungi, especially around mucormycosis (black fungus), an offshoot of Covid — will be done by the department under the guidance of professor Prashant Gupta. This mycology centre is the first in Uttar Pradesh, while there are 13 in the country. “The centre will help in molecular and genetic testing of various fungi. The level of antifungal drugs in the bloodstream will be gathered through this centre from which the drug dosage can be altered and the negative impact of such drugs can be reduced,” a KGMU official said. “KGMU has a mycology laboratory but it lacks advanced technology. With it becoming an ICMR-approved full-fledged centre now, technology and machinery will be upgraded in the lab. This will help us to study the different aspects of fungi and diseases caused by it such as mucormycosis. The time taken to decipher the mechanism of fungi and research for drugs to be used will also get shorter,” said Prof Amita Jain. KGMU spokesperson Prof Sudhir Singh said, “The achievement of 20 lakh tests since February 2020 became possible because of the staff, lab technicians, scientists and research students of the department, many of whom continued the work despite contracting Covid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-indias-1st-institute-to-test-20l-samples/articleshow/83762699.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Delhi||92 street vendors get govt nod to operate at Delhi's Sarojini Nagar market||NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Tuesday issued an order permitting 92 authorised street vendors in the Sarojini Nagar market to operate their stalls closed in wake of the Covid pandemic. It has also directed New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Delhi Police to ensure no encroachment takes place in the area. The order states that “it has come to the knowledge that thareja tehbazari is not allowed to open in the Sarojini Nagar market while as per Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), all markets, malls and market complexes are permitted to open from 10am to 8pm. Therefore, it is once again iterated to allow these NDMC-authorised street vendors (92) in compliance with DDMA’s order.” The circular also directs NDMC’s enforcement director and the station house officer of the Sarojini Nagar police station to ensure that no unauthorised vendor/hawker operates in the area and no shopkeeper encroaches upon the way meant for movement of customers. The order makes the market traders’ associations and the shopkeepers responsible for the compliance of the Covid-appropriate protocols.” The enforcement director of NDMC has been asked to furnish a daily report on the matter. “Any non-compliance will attract relevant action as per IPC and DDMA Act,” it adds. Officials of the district administration visited the market on Tuesday evening to take stock of the situation. Bansilal Grover, chairman of Thareja Tehbazari Welfare Association at the Sarojini Nagar market, said, “We made the request to the lieutenant governor, the district magistrate and other officials explaining that despite the DDMA order and paying the rent regularly to the civic body, we are not allowed to open even after 15 days of the order. This is biased and leading to losses.” Stating that they are aware of the current situation, Grover said they won’t allow encroachment from their side. The decision has, however, got permanent shopkeepers worried. Ashok Randhawa, president of Mini Market Traders Association, said, “The subdivisional magistrate took the round of the area in the evening wherein we clarified that we are not against the vendors, but their operation can increase congestion and maintaining social distance will become even more difficult. For a temporary phase, they can be shifted to another place.” Ashok Kalra, general secretary of Sarojini Nagar Market Association (big shops), also made the same demand. “We have clarified to the department that the market associations should not be held responsible in the given circumstances if social distancing norms are violated. We are not against the vendors and they are like us. All we want is to shift them temporarily to a nearby open site.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/92-street-vendors-get-govt-nod-to-operate-at-sarojini/articleshow/83762716.cms||Vibha Sharma

The traders and residents of the area said that drainage water was seeping into drinking water pipelines and posing a health hazard. The residents want urgent steps to be taken resolve the problem, which, they said, would worsen during the monsoon. “We have been urging the local officials to find a long-lasting solution for this problem, but only some short-term solutions have been given to us. This issue should be resolved permanently,” said a medical practitioner from the area. As per the locals, drainage water overflows after rainfall. As a result, even walking on the road becomes almost impossible after the rains. “The area is on the border of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB). It is being neglected by the PMC. We cannot approach the PCB as it does not fall under its jurisdiction,” said a trader. He said that the area has a sizeable slum population and commercial establishments. Local residents and businesses establishments dump garbage on open spaces. “The garbage dumping spot is adjacent to a school. This will pose a threat to the health of students when the schools reopen. The children will get exposed to the garbage and plastic dumped here,” said a shopkeeper. He added that the PMC had placed a garbage bin at the spot, but it was removed as part of zero garbage project. So, people dump trash at the same spot. “The piling garbage attracts stray dogs and cattle. This leads to major traffic snarls as the lane is very narrow and flow of vehicular traffic is high,” said a resident. “If there is a drainage leakage on the main road, it will be dealt by the drainage department. We will check if the complaint has reached our drainage department,” said Somnath Banker, ward officer of the PMC’s Bhavani Peth ward office. According to civic officials, one side of the road is under Bhavani Peth ward office, while the other is under Dhole-Patil road ward office. “We have been following up on the issue. The location, where the problem persists, falls under ward 20, but residents of ward number 19 are suffering the most. Both ward offices should take steps to resolve the problems permanently,” said Archana Patil, a corporator from the area.

The CBI booked Rapaka Venkata Ramana Murthy, cash incharge at SBI Sakhinetipalli branch, under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections of cheating and criminal breach of trust after he allegedly siphoned Rs Rs 70 lakh. Murthy fraudulently opened hundreds of accounts between 2016 and 2020, credited gold loan amounts and withdrew the cash, the CBI alleged. The fraud came to light in January this year. “Murthy created gold loans without pledging the required gold ornaments. He credited the loan amounts to 319 savings bank accounts of 246 people involving a sum of Rs 66 lakh. There was a mismatch in the gold loans sanctioned and gold mentioned. In 37 instances alone, gold loans sanctioned were more than the ornaments,” the CBI said. Most loan applications did not have photographs of the customers and adhere to KYC norms. “Even the signatures were missing in some cases. Signatures of borrowers did not match in a few cases,” it said. After crediting the loan amount to multiple savings bank accounts, Murthy used to withdraw by cash or transfer. While the CBI booked the case following a complaint lodged by regional manager of SBI, Rajahmundry, A Nageswara Rao, departmental proceedings were initiated against Sakhinetipalli branch managers — K Paramesh and K Kishore Kumar and service managers — B Kameswari and S Veera Venkata Ramana. The SBI also authorised the CBI to investigate into other allegations against Murthy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-books-sbi-cashier-for-rs-70l-gold-loan-fraud/articleshow/83762682.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||India||Nitish in Delhi amid buzz of JD(U) joining Union Cabinet||PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday left for the national capital, purportedly for medical reasons, though speculations ran rife that bargaining a decent share in the Union cabinet was also on the agenda of the JD(U) de-facto leader. The JD(U) has been a BJP ally for close to three decades, barring a hiatus in 2013-2017. Kumar, who had himself served in the cabinet headed by late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, turned down the offer of the saffron party of a “token representation” to all alliance partners after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls which saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi steering the BJP to a thumping majority. “I do not know why his Delhi tour is being linked to the proposed cabinet reshuffle. To the best of my knowledge, he needs treatment for some eye problem and is visiting the national capital for the purpose,” said Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan, one of the closest aides of Kumar. The Union cabinet reshuffle is a prerogative of the Prime Minister and it is for him to decide whom to hold consultations with on the issue, Singh said. Singh, who has been with Kumar ever since the latter broke ranks with Lalu Prasad to chart his own political course, is seen as one of the candidates the JD(U) might strongly back, were it to join the Union council of ministers. Another ministerial probable RCP Singh, who succeeded Kumar as the national president of the party a few months ago, laughed off at the suggestion but dropped ample hints that the JD(U) was now eyeing a spot in the Union government. “My name has been doing the rounds since 2017. Any decision as to who will be in the Union cabinet from our party has to be taken by our leader. Of course, he does so after consulting all,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nitish-in-delhi-amid-buzz-of-jdu-joining-union-cabinet/articleshow/83766059.cms||---

Rashtriya OBC Mahasangh president Baban Taywade said the crucial meet will have representation from across political parties and organizations. On Thursday, OBC leaders in every district will send a letter to the central and state governments through the district collector to press for their demand for having a caste-based census and ensure political reservation. Taywade said, “It’s been said that the Supreme Court has quashed OBC political reservation, but I believe that’s a wrong interpretation of the highest court actually. The apex court said that reservation cannot cross 50% limit, so now it is up to the state and Centre to ensure that the OBC community gets justice.” The senior leader added that differentiation has to be made between types of reservation. “The limit on reservation is specific to jobs and education. We also have the issue of political reservation, to which the judgment has been applied. The demand for empirical data on OBC population has to be addressed either by the central or the state government,” said Taywade. He asserted that the state and Centre must not play blame game. “Collecting data on OBC population can be done by either one of them., So if the Centre is not going ahead with a caste-based census, then the state can do it,” said Taywade. While the political reservation issue is currently at the forefront, Taywade said in no way it should be construed that other issues have been put on the backburner. “We have many demands which need to be addressed by the government. The creamy layer limit of Rs8 lakh per annum needs to be scrapped, reservation for students need to be increased etc,” said Taywade. Thursday’s ‘memorandum’ will be a prelude to the Lonavala meet, said Taywade. “We are making representation to both central and state governments. If they do not agree to our demands, then the next course of action will be decided at Lonavala,” said Taywade. When asked who are the prominent OBC leaders that will be part of the Lonavala meet, Taywade said delegates will be from a wide political spectrum. “Chhagan Bhujbal, Nana Patole, Vijay Wadettiwar, Eknath Khadse, Pankaja Munde, Manikrao Thakre, Sunil Kedar, Chandrashekhar Bawankule and many other legislators will be present. Around 300 senior leaders from the community shall be present at Lonavala,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/obc-leaders-lonavla-meet-on-june-26-27-to-chart-future-strategy/articleshow/83760262.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

While the library has been moved to the directorate of art and culture which also houses the Goa state central library building at Patto, the administrative office is operating from the Adil Shah Palace in Panaji. “Staff and students can still rent books from the Kala Academy library by going to the directorate of art and culture,” Kala Academy member secretary, D L Amonkar told TOI. Consisting of 18,000 titles besides scripts and plays performed at KA, its library also has biographies, gramophone records, photographs and other material dating back to the 1970s. It also has rare literature written by playwrights from Goa, some of which are handwritten manuscripts copies of which cannot be found elsewhere. Currently, the various courses of western music, Indian classical music, dance, etc, have been temporarily suspended owing to the pandemic. A decision on whether these classes will be held at the Adil Shah Palace upon resumption, is yet to be taken. The Kala Academy college of theatre has temporarily moved to the Rajiv Gandhi Kala Mandir in Ponda. Previously, there were talks to shift the premises to the old PWD building at Patto or to the high court building in Panaji. The college administration was also eyeing the campus and vacant spaces at the entertainment society of Goa (ESG) to run the college from. “The students require stages to practice and perform, adequate number of washrooms for the student and staff and classrooms. From the students’ point of view, we can successfully function from the Rajiv Gandhi Kala Mandir,” principal of the college, Ramrao Wagh said, adding that it would’ve been more convenient to have the college in Panaji. The principal has also been given a temporary office at the Adil Shah Palace to ensure coordination between Kala Academy and the college. The Kala Academy might continue to operate in this fragmented manner until the works at the Campal premises are complete – which are estimated to take 17 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kala-academy-shifts-operations-to-three-locations/articleshow/83760313.cms||Nida Sayed

Making the announcement on Tuesday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath praised Tomar for her positive influence on young girls in rural India. Calling her an inspiration for lakhs of people, the CM said that Tomar symbolised determination and woman empowerment. “The decision to name Noida’s shooting range after her is the government’s effort to recognise woman power under its ongoing Mission Shakti programme which is pushing for women empowerment. Naming the shooting range after her will provide inspiration to the youth,” he said. Tomar was a resident of Johri village in UP’s Baghpat district. She took up sharp shooting by chance at the age of 65 years and, along with her sister Prakashi, went on to participate in and win several shooting competitions across the country. While she was known as the world’s oldest woman sharp shooter, Tomar’s granddaughter and nieces are also acclaimed sharp shooters. Tomar was admitted to a Meerut hospital with Covid in the ongoing second wave and passed away on April 30 at the age of 89 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/noida-range-to-be-named-after-shooter-dadi/articleshow/83762761.cms||Neha Lalchandani

BJP leaders say though they lost miserably during the 2018 assembly election, the majority they got in the assembly segments during the Lok Sabha polls is indicative of their improved performance. In the 2019 election, Bandi Sanjay Kumar emerged victorious over TRS’ B Vinod Kumar in the Karimnagar parliamentary constituency. Karimnagar parliament constituency consists of Karimnagar, Choppadandi, Vemulawada, Sircilla, Huzurabad, Manakondur and Husnabad assembly segments. Choppadandi and Manakondur are SC reserved assembly seats, while the rest are open category. During the 2018 assembly contest, BJP’s performance was dismal with its Huzurabad candidate P Raghu not even retaining deposits. However, within a short span, party candidate Bandi Sanjay Kumar was able to get majority in all the seven assembly segments, including Huzurabad. Though the votes secured in Huzurabad assembly constituency during the Lok Sabha election was low for BJP (27,000) compared to what they got (ranging between 80,000 and one lakh ) in other six segments, the party is hopeful of a win for two reasons. “We got less majority in Huzurabad as it is Eatala Rajender’s bastion. Now, he is with us. We have added strength,” a top leader said. The assembly segment has 3.34 lakh voters and BJP has membership of around 15,000. BJP had secured less votes In Illantakunta and Kamalapur mandals during the LS election. Kamalapur is the stronghold of Eatala Rajender . BJP leaders claimed that sentiment also would work in their favour. “BJP not only improved its performance from just a few thousands votes in the 2018 assembly elections to winning the Karimnagar parliament seat, we managed to have majority in Huzurabad too. The bypoll sentiment will also work for us,” BJP district incharge Krishna Reddy told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huzurabad-with-eatala-in-kitty-bjp-banks-on-2019-ls-result/articleshow/83762725.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The key accused knew that the woman’s husband keeps cash at home based on which they hatched the loot plan leading to murder. Court of additional sessions judge AS Vyas convicted Bhavesh alias Dharmesh Dedkawala, Vishal Patel and Akshay Bardoliya for alleged murder of deceased Prabha Khant. “The court convicted the accused considering circumstantial evidence. A woman confirmed presence of the accused outside the apartment of the deceased woman after the murder,” said Kirit Panwala, special public prosecutor. Khant was stabbed multiple times in the throat by the accused between 4 and 4.30 pm on December 9, 2011 when she was alone at her apartment. Probe in the case revealed that the accused Dedkawala was Khant’s husband Gokul’s friend and the duo often met. Dedkawala knew that Gokul keeps cash at home and planned a loot, which he and his two accomplices decided to execute when the latter wasn’t present at home. On December 9, Dedkawala called Gokul on his mobile phone to check his whereabouts. Gokul informed that he was at his farm. Later, he called up the victim on her mobile phone posing as an employee of an automobile company and informed that the Khant family won a prize for purchase of a motorcycle. The woman believed them and called the accused home. She had gone out for lunch at a relative’s place but returned home to receive the prize. The accused entered her home claiming that they had come to deliver the gift and closed the front door. The trio then stabbed the woman, killing her on the spot. However, they failed to break the locker and escaped looting only Rs 30,000 in cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/life-term-to-three-for-2011-loot-and-murder-of-woman/articleshow/83758355.cms||---

Top sources in intelligence agencies told TOI that Enforcement Directorate (ED) may also be roped in to bust foreign funding of the network, which straddles five states and 10 districts of Uttar Pradesh.

Every member of the group will be traced and the network smashed. We are tracking their financial transactions and source of funds. We got clues on many more conversions from parents of underprivileged and physically challenged children who were forcibly converted and their sources are in touch with us. Police and intelligence agencies of other states too have approached us after the arrests,” said Kumar.

Speaking to TOI, the senior BJP functionary said people shouldn’t be surprised if the former allies came together once again. His statement came in the backdrop of MLA Pratap Sarnaik’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray where he called on the Sena’s leadership to patch up with BJP. According to him, the Congress-NCP were weakening Sena across the state. Endorsing him, Bawankule said there was resentment among Sena MPs and legislators over the way MVA constituents were working. “Only Congress and NCP legislators’ works are being preferred in Mantralaya while Sena leaders’ proposals were kept pending. They were also upset over severing of power connections of citizens from their constituencies due to defaulting electricity bills. It’s high time CM needs to introspect the working of MVA, where legislators from his own party are ignored.” Reiterating that the Maharashtra citizens had given clear mandate to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, the former Kamptee MLA said a majority of Sena leaders have faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Fadnavis. “Before 2019 assembly polls, Thackeray had declared on stage that Fadnavis would be their alliance CM’s face, but then they backstabbed the BJP. Now its leaders are realizing that Congress and NCP leaders are dominating the Mantralaya and they were neglected. All of them now badly want to forge the alliance with BJP to form the government,” Bawankule said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-surprises-if-sena-bjp-come-together-again-bawankule/articleshow/83760370.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

On the second day, UP accounted for over 15.2% of the total doses given across the country. As many as 53.4 lakh doses were given across India on Tuesday. UP’s nearest competitor was Maharashtra with 5.56 lakh doses. Best performer of Monday – Madhya Pradesh -- which administered over 16.9 crore doses – administered just 4,800 on Tuesday. Officials attributed the success to the launch of the cluster approach to boost vaccinations in the state. With this, vaccination exercise has been taken inside the villages which have made access much easier for the people, especially women. Of the total 2.84 doses extended in Uttar Pradesh so far, 2.32 crore are first-timers while 41.01 lakh are fully vaccinated. However, at 13.60 crore the target on board is still far. Officials also said that over 85 lakh doses have been administered since the launch of Mission June which had targeted 1 crore jabs in one-month time. “Even as eight days are left in the month, 85% of the target has been achieved. This speaks for the sense of commitment and hard work put in by our teams,” said a senior officer in the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-sets-new-record-with-8-1l-jabs-in-24-hrs-highest-in-india/articleshow/83762822.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Gupta said that his sustained attempts to reach out to the Centre and the Haryana government to protect these villages proved futile. He added that he had announced his protest plan well in advance. “When I reached Faridabad to start the march, Haryana Police detained me illegally. First, they took me to a nearby Sarai Khawaja police station, then for five hours, they drove me in their van. Haryana and Delhi Police ACPs were present. They took me to the BPTP police station followed by the station at Sector 37 Faridabad. Then they asked me to apply for bail else they threatened arrest. I told them that I will not apply for any kind of bail but accept the arrest. I also made it clear that they have detained me illegally and have tried to suppress my right to protest,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/aap-mp-slams-haryana-govt-for-illegal-detention/articleshow/83772867.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Both Delta-plus cases in Mumbai found in April, fully recovered||MUMBAI: A man in his late 70s, a milk dealer’s wife, an electrician who attended a big wedding, two jewellers who travelled to Surat and a teacher in his mid-50s are among the 21 people who were infected by the Delta-plus variant of Sars-Cov-2 in Maharashtra. Some of these cases were detected as early as April but their genome sequencing results arrived only last week, putting the spotlight again on the long turnaround between actual infection and analysis. The two Delta-plus cases in Mumbai had tested positive for Covid as early as April 5 and April 15, suggesting that the variant has been lurking in the city for over two months. One is a Thane resident who was treated in Mumbai, while the other is a 78-year-old man. A majority of those affected by Delta-plus, including the Mumbai resident, were not vaccinated. Civic officials said the senior citizen recovered well and has no complaints at present. A family member, who too had tested positive, has recovered too. “We will keep an eye on them for any developments, but beyond that there is nothing much to do since they had Covid nearly two-and-half months ago,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. Delta-plus cases were found in six districts of Maharashtra, with the most detected in Ratnagiri (9) and Jalgaon (7). Although most had Covid in May, some districts have begun fresh surveillance near their residences. Jalgaon, for instance, held a camp on June 12 and 13 where 165 people were tested with RT-PCR. Two persons were positive but asymptomatic. Sindhudurg, with one case of Delta-plus, will test the entire residential complex of six buildings where the individual resides. All seven Jalgaon patients hail from a single village, Vichkheda, with a population of 1,200. These individuals had tested positive during an RT-PCR camp held on May 5. An electrician in his 60s, who tested positive, had attended a wedding at Chalisgaon. A milk distributor’s wife was also affected but not her husband. Two people had travelled to Surat for jewellery work while one person had a travel history to Thane, said Dr D S Potode, assistant district health officer. “It is important to note here that all remained asymptomatic and we didn’t see any unusual rise in transmission there,” he said. The district is currently reporting 40-50 cases daily, of which fewer than 10 are from the rural parts. In the second wave, Jalgaon was the first district in north Maharashtra to register a surge this March. In Sindhudurg, a teacher is among those affected. District officials said he had tested positive on May 22 and has since recovered. In this case though, all three high-risk contacts had also contracted Covid. But all recovered at home without complications, said Dr Mahesh Khalipe, adding that they would be testing 225 residents, including the family again. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said they are gathering information about these cases, including the symptoms, severity of disease and vaccination status. There will also be surveillance of influenza-like illnesses in the vicinity. Delta-plus (AY.1) has mutated from the highly infectious Delta (B.1.617.2), that was first detected in India, and is believed to have driven the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-both-delta-plus-cases-in-city-found-in-april-fully-recovered/articleshow/83760444.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Goa||Viral video shows rescuer manhandling King Cobra, forest dept initiates action||Keri: The video of a Goa forest department rescuer manhandling a King Cobra has gone viral on social media platforms since Monday and has led to wildlifers across the country expressing their angst over the incident. In the incident that occurred at Poinguinim in Canacona, South Goa, the department staffer is seen stepping on the snake while rescuing it from a private property. Following the incident, Goa forest department officials said that they will be imparting training in ethical rescue methods. A memo has also been issued to the rescuer. “Presently, the snake is in our custody. The veterinary doctor has examined it and found it healthy. Shortly, it will be released into its natural habitat. I have issued a memo to the rescuer concerned,” range forest officer for Cotigao, Anant Velip said. The range forest office at Cotigao had received information that a King Cobra had entered a private property and accordingly rescuers were deployed. The King Cobra is the largest venomous snake in India. As there is no anti-venom available in Goa to treat its bite, rescue operations require to be carried out with a lot of skill. “We will conduct a workshop for imparting necessary skills and techniques for handling and rescuing snakes. There is a need to promote ethical rescues of snakes by which rescuers can perfect their techniques to cause minimum harm. Use of snake hooks to grab them without hurting has to be encouraged,” additional principal chief conservator of forests, Santosh Kumar told TOI. Under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, handling of King Cobra without necessary permits is prohibited. However, often over enthusiastic rescues are seen on social media where the ‘rescuers’ manhandle and pose with the King Cobra in a manner which can agitate the snake. “King Cobras are shy. They rarely attack humans unless provoked. The habitat of the King Cobra is shrinking which forces them to enter human settlements for prey. This is one of the most feared venomous snakes in India, even though it rarely bites humans,” wildlifer Gajanan Shetye said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/viral-video-shows-rescuer-manhandling-king-cobra-forest-dept-initiates-action/articleshow/83760435.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The cops also recovered more than Rs37 lakh from their possession, which they had allegedly stolen from the farmhouse after the murder. The farmhouse owner, advocate Gnyaneshwar Phule, had lodged a complaint of murder with Kuhi police station, after spotting the decomposing body of Karudkar on June 20, mentioning theft of cash Rs50,000. Police said despite knowing the exact amount stolen, Phule had understated the cash for reasons best known to him. It was during recovery that the local crime branch team under inspector Anil Jittewar, and staff from Kuhi and Beltur police, were stunned by the amount they found unexpectedly at the residence of Mahajan at Phegadh. Police said Narule and Karudkar were former co-workers at the same farm. Narule, who drover a tractor, was thrown out of job for stealing fuel around a fortnight ago. Police said he knew there was substantial cash kept at the farmhouse. Narule, who had roped in Mahajan, was planning to settle his dues and also make some fast cash. The duo murdered Karudkar on June 17 and his body was found only three days later, when advocate Phule and his wife went to the farmhouse. SP Rakesh Ola, who was flanked by additional SP Rahul Maknikar and DySP SA Tele, said Narule and Mahajan had taken Rs1,500 from Karudkar to have a feast at the farmhouse and later bludgeoned and throttled him to death after he dozed off. “The cash which Narule and Mahajan found was kept in a tin box at the residence of Mahajan, as they had gone undercover,” said the SP. “The advocate had kept the cash at the farmhouse as he wanted to use it for marriage and other purposes like making payments to others,” he said. Ola said it was a combination of manual and electronic evidence which helped cops zero down on the murderers. “Karudkar had last called Narule, which was the biggest clue,” he said. Police also said Narule had shared information with another fellow villager that there was much cash kept at the farmhouse. The villager had leaked this information to cops, who netted him and Mahajan before they could sneak away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-arrest-two-for-murder-find-rs37-lakh-cash/articleshow/83760420.cms||Soumitra Bose

The studies are on and we cannot say anything if there is any reduced efficacy of the vaccines against the Delta variant,” he added. Nearly 7,500 samples were collected of which about 21 cases of Delta-plus were found, reports Nisha Nambiar. The state had started genomic sequencing of 100 samples from each district, but state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said the state has many districts of concern and genomic sequence should be allowed for more samples. “Results will be expected around first week of July,” said an official. The health minister demanded that at least 5% of the state’s gross revenue be spent on health facilities, appointment of more medical staff, and promised to ramp up rural facilities before the next wave. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-give-icmr-details-of-1st-cases/articleshow/83760446.cms||---

They added that the support of these MLAs was resulting in weakening of the organisation.

The Pilot camp has been pasting posters that seek to highlight his struggle as the Congress state chief to help form the Congress government in the 2018 assembly election. Pilot simultaneously trended on Twitter with his supporters launching a campaign saying ‘#Pilot_aa_raha_hai’ (Pilot is coming) and ‘#SachinPilot’. A day earlier, a hashtag named ‘#Congress_aa_rahi_hai’ (Congress is coming) had trended on Twitter.PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, however, played down the Twitter trend. Dotasra said a few days ago on his birthday, he also trended on Twitter. Posters came up in Jaipur put up by Pilot followers showcasing his struggle and sacrifice before the assembly elections 2018. The pictures show an injured Pilot during a lathicharge among many others with a slogan ‘Rajasthan ne dekha hai, hum sabne dekha hai (Rajasthan has seen, we all have seen)". The poster and Twitter war comes at a time when 13 independents, who are supporting Gehlot, have called a meeting on Wednesday to chalk out strategies in getting rewards for saving the Congress government in the political crisis last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/supporters-of-pilot-launch-poster-twitter-campaign/articleshow/83762894.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NMC extends Danaganj Mall completion deadline again, oppn cries foul||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) general body once again agreed to extend the deadline for the completion of the much-delayed Danaganj Mall on Tuesday. NMC’s public works department, while tabling a proposal to this effect, had cited the private contractor Orange City Mall Pvt Ltd’s assurance to complete the project by 2023-24. This will be the third extension given to the firm. Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe accused NMC of favouring Orange City Mall Pvt Ltd despite its failure to complete the construction of Danaganj Mall. TOI had recently highlighted that the Danaganj Mall was first proposed in 2006, but there was no sign of its completion even in 2021. Demanding termination of the contract of Orange City Mall, Gudadhe also accused NMC’s public works department of being hand in glove to favour the contractor by not levying any penalties mentioned in the agreement for instances of default. The general body meeting also witnessed heated exchange between ruling party leader Avinash Thakre and Gudadhe when the latter said that the private firm is owned by Orange City Water Limited and hence the civic body was favouring the agency. Gudadhe also alleged that the department had ignored the House while giving relaxations to the firm in the past. Executive engineer Dilip Dupare could not give a satisfactory reply to Gudadhe's queries. Commissioner Radhakrishnan B said the delay occurred due to lapses on the civic body’s part for its inability to provide environmental clearance, removal of encroachments among others. Gudadhe and leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve opposed the move to extend the deadline. However, the ruling BJP ensured that the House approved PWD’s proposal. Meanwhile, the mayor has called for a general body meeting on June 30 over adjournment motion tabled by independent corporator Abha Pande on irregularities by NMC’s health department in spending funds allocated to battle coronavirus. The house also passed a resolution to declare neem tree as national tree and will now send a proposal to the central government in this regard. In view of coronavirus pandemic, many property owners defaulted property tax due to poor financial condition. Gudadhe demanded waiving off penal interest on property tax for the three financial years 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22. To his demand, mayor Tiwari said the commissioner has the authority to waive the penalty on property tax arrears. He asked the commissioner to take a favourable decision on the penalty waiver and implementation of amnesty scheme for two months. BJP corporator Vijay Zalke raised the issue of irregularities in NMC’s town planning department. Mayor too expressed anguish over the working of the department and directed the civic chief to look into it. Senior corporators Abha Pande, Vaishali Narnaware, Ibrahim Pathan raised the issue of dilapidated condition of NMC-run libraries and reading rooms. Citing an example, Pande drew the attention of the house towards the Subhash Chandra Bose library situated Khairipura. A couple of days ago, part of the ceiling of the library caved in. Fortunately, there was no one at the library at that time since the incident occurred at midnight, she said. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed the civic administration to ensure that all libraries are maintained properly. He said zonal funds have been made available for their maintenance and if required, more funds will be provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-extends-danaganj-mall-completion-deadline-again-oppn-cries-foul/articleshow/83760442.cms||---

Mumbai, too, repeated its Monday feat by vaccinating over 1 lakh people for the second consecutive day. Importantly, after three weeks of lagging behind private hospitals, free vaccination in public centres surged ahead as they administered double the number of doses compared to paid centres. A total of 5,55,090 doses administered was not just the state’s personal best, it was also the second-highest number vaccinated among states on Tuesday—UP vaccinated 7.96 lakh people. The state has completed administering 2.87 crore doses, the highest so far in the country. Over 56.16 lakh people, or around 7%, of the state’s 8.5 crore population eligible for vaccination, have got both the doses till date. Mumbai, which couldn’t start the free vaccination drive for 18-plus group with the rest of the state on Tuesday, will do so from Wednesday, civic officials said. Over one lakh given shots in Mum for second day in a rowMaharashtra carried out 5.55 lakh vaccinations on Tuesday, its highest in a day. The state opened vaccination for 30-plus last week and subsequently for 18-plus on Monday. In the city, 50% of the vaccinations will happen through online appointments and the rest through walk-ins. CM Uddhav Thackeray and public health minister Rajesh Tope lauded the health department for achieving the feat. “Maharashtra has taken a lead in preventive vaccination,” said additional chief secretary Dr Pradip Vyas. The last time Maharashtra had breached the 5 lakh mark was on April 26. Interestingly, states such as MP and Karnataka that did record-high vaccinations on Monday—when India delivered 81 lakh doses— couldn’t keep up their pace on Tuesday. MP’s numbers dropped from 16.9 lakh doses on Monday to just 4,825 on Tuesday, while Karnataka’s dropped from 10.67 lakh to 3.92 lakh. Maharashtra had administered 3.8 lakh doses on Monday and was behind several states. In Mumbai, 1,13,135 people got vaccinated across 382 public and private centres. The total number of people who have received at least one dose has reached 46.84 lakh. The highest vaccinations happened in the age-group of 30-44 years, where 80,932 people took the shots. Of the total shots administered, 78,827 were in the public and 34308 in private centres. Several private hospitals told TOI there is a sharp drop in demand for paid vaccination.A hospital head said the scam at Kandivli’s Hiranandani housing society, followed by several similar complaints, has discouraged many from holding such drives. “There has been a 50% decline in enquiries and bookings. Besides, we are not sure when we will receive our stocks from the Centre, so that too is holding us back,” he said. Dr Prince Surana of Surana Group too said there was a drop in demand for tie-ups as well as in online bookings through CoWin. “Since vaccine doses have started coming to public centres, many are preferring to wait for free vaccination,” he said. But hen asked if the state and city will be able to continue this momentum, state officials didn’t respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-one-lakh-given-shots-in-mumbai-for-second-day-in-a-row/articleshow/83760493.cms||Sumitra Debroy

A 36-year-old woman from JKC Colony in Palladam delivered a baby girl at Palladam government hospital on June 12 and she was referred to the Tirupur Government Medical College and Hospital for further treatment. The same day, she absconded with the baby from the hospital and returned to Palladam. When a nurse from a local primary health centre visited the woman, she told the nurse that her baby girl died on the same day. The Palladam police received the information a few days ago and began an inquiry. Meanwhile, village administrative officer from Palladam Muthulakshmi conducted an inquiry with the couple and lodged a complaint with the Palladam police on June 19. Based on the complaint, police registered a case against the couple under sections 176 (omission to give notice or information to public servant by person legally bound to give it) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of an offence or giving false information to screen offender) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Jaipur||Home care: Turn your living room into hospital||JAIPUR: “I needed a BiPAP machine urgently for my patient who had breathing issues. The hospital staff provided the machine and healthcare staff installed it at home due to the critical condition of my patient,” said a Aniket Shah (name changed). A BiPAP machine is a type of ventilator that helps to push air into your lungs. This trend is fast catching up in the city as patients are now receiving expert medical care at home, thanks to a number of private hospitals and agencies which are now providing such medical care and equipment. Digital and online consultations with prominent doctors have also made care available wherever it is needed. A lot of patients require various kinds of care such as post-discharge, cancer, geriatric, post-natal, post-cardiac surgery, post-spine surgery or hip replacement and a lot of patients with neuro problems such as stroke, Parkinson’s and post-brain and spinal surgery require home-based care. Many private hospitals are now not only providing caregiver services, but also helping patients with medical equipment such as Bipap machines and ICU-like facility at homes. With growing need of patients for home-based care, some private hospitals have created a separate unit for home care, while others have roped in private firms to help their patients with care at home. “Polaris homecare is an initiative to keep patients safe at home. In Covid pandemic, it became a necessity and we have assisted thousands of patients. We are providing trained and experienced doctors, nurses and caregivers to patients with chronic illnesses and physical disabilities. We are also providing medical equipment at reasonable costs,” said Harman Swarankar, director, Vaidehi Hospitality Pvt. Ltd, a unit of Mahatma Gandhi Hospital. “EHCC provides homecare support for Covid patients providing psycho-social support which is extremely important to ease the worries of the patient and make them feel comfortable. It helps them recover well,” said Dr Vikram Singh Chouhan, chief operating officer, Eternal Hospital. “Healthcare at home with trained ICU doctors and nursing staff gave relief to many who couldn’t get beds and also did not have the capacity to go to hospital, due to several reasons like ongoing immunocompromised states – cancer, cardiac and transplant patients. Ventilators and assisted respiration were ensured till the time a bed was made available at the hospital,” said Dr Suhasani Jain, medical superintendent, C K Birla Hospital. Bhagwan Mahaveer cancer hospital is providing free palliative care at home for terminally ill cancer patients. “Palliative care aims at providing physical, psychological and social support to a patient with a life limiting illness. The aim is to improve the quality of life of the patient and her/his family,” said Anjum Khan, director, department of anesthesia and palliative care at BMCHRC. Apart from hospitals, private firms too are offering services for taking care of patients at home. “We provide 24x7, non-stop dedicated services at patients’ home like free oxygen, online doctor consultation, bedside attendant, medicines and equipment," said Madhukar Pareek, CEO of Caresathome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/home-care-turn-your-living-room-into-hosp/articleshow/83762925.cms||---

After the councillors visit, corporation officials razed the building on Tuesday evening.The issue is related to a shop being constructed at Nahargarh Road, which is said to be illegal. According to Kishanpole MLA Amin Kagzi, mayor Munesh Gurjar’s husband Sushil Gurjar was allegedly involved in it. When the construction wasn’t stopped, around 40 councillors from different areas of JMC-Heritage reached the headquarters to meet commissioner Awdhesh Meena.Ward 79 councillor Rubiya Gudej said, “Whatever is happening is not correct. As per law, the shop is illegal and it should not be allowed to be constructed.”A councillor on the condition of anonymity said Sushil Gurjar was supporting this construction because the building’s owner is his friend. When asked why the councillors were standing up against their own mayor, he said they would not support illegal activity in the city no matter who is involved.Sushil Gurjar said investigation found that the construction was illegal. “I am nowhere involved in this. Corporation officials investigated the matter and found the building to be illegal, which was later razed. The law is being followed,” said Gurjar.When TOI contacted Amin Kagzi, he said he had no knowledge about the councillors reaching corporation office. “I don’t know why the councillors reached there. The building was illegally constructed on public land. It is good that it was destroyed. We were told Sushil Gurjar was supporting the construction, but the law of the land prevailed,” said Kagzi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-councillors-defy-mayor-force-jmc-to-raze-illegal-bldg/articleshow/83762996.cms||---

He said the party would then present the report to the state government with recommendation to the government to announce appropriate schemes to help these families. He said the outreach programme will be completed in a month and based on the data collected, they would identify the problems faced by these families and would come out with measures to address these problems. Dotasra claimed that the BJP state in-charge Arun Singh also praised Covid management of the state government. Dotasra said Singh reportedly said that since there was no anti-incumbency against the state government, the BJP could not cash in during the bypolls held recently. He said it means that he is indirectly admitting that the state government is doing a good job. Dotasra, however decried the statement of Singh on the MLAs protesting against Vasundhara Raje’s posters being removed from party office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-survey-on-condition-of-11-lakh-families-hit-by-covid/articleshow/83762950.cms||---

As all shops and commercials properties were shut down due to lockdown, it seems difficult to get urban development (UD) tax from the owners. However, grocery, private hospitals, pharmacy and other essential businesses that remained opened will now be asked to pay tax.A senior JMC-Greater officer said, “It is not possible to expect UD tax from owners of shops that remained shut for more than two months. They faced severe loses. So, we are trying to get hold of properties were open during the pandemic and will collect revenue from them.”The rest of the shop owners are demanding some relaxations in the UD tax due to the losses they have faced. It is expected state government to give them relaxations by waiving the penalty and 50% interest rate. At present, the revenue collection of both the corporations has been impacted. Most of the billboard sites were not auctioned. JMC-Greater had identified more than 200 such sites, but because of pandemic they are not able to invite tenders. A similar problem is being faced by JMC-Heritage revenue department. Around 14 parking sites have already been auctioned and new tenders were invited for eight sites, but no one came to bid. Revenue officer of JMC-Heritage said, “This is a very difficult time for the corporation as many people do not have any earnings. So, most probably, the government will give them rebate, but for others, we also have to make some action plan.”The revenue collection company also shut its working due to lockdown as they were not allowed to go for field survey. Now, with relaxations, it is expected that company will resume work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-greater-to-start-revenue-collection-drive/articleshow/83763012.cms||---

In a caution notice to Sultana, district collector S Asker Ali, who is also chairman of the Disaster Management Authority, alleged that Sultana, who arrived at Kavaratti on June 19 after being summoned by police for questioning, moved out of the place of her stay, visited public places and mingled with other people, violating the seven-day mandatory home quarantine rule in force in the islands since May 12. Sultana, an islander, was booked by Lakshadweep police for sedition while she was in Kerala. She returned to the islands after being summoned by the Kavaratti police in connection with the case. The administration said Sultana was exempted from the mandatory quarantine provision only for the purpose of interrogation in the case against her. It alleged that she violated the home quarantine direction and roamed in public places, interacted with the public, visited a first line treatment centre and interacted with Covid-19 positive patients. Terming these actions are “certainly illegal”, the administration in its notice said, “Hence you are hereby cautioned that stringent actions will be taken against you if you are violating the quarantine rule again, which is specified as per the standard covid protocol that is in place in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep”. She was booked by the Kavaratti police on June 9 for alleging that the Centre used biological weapons against the people of Lakshadweep. She made this allegation while participating in a debate telecast by a Malayalam news channel on June 7. The complaint was filed by a BJP leader on the islands. Sultana was allowed to leave after the initial round of interrogation on Sunday. A source close to her said she has been directed to appear before the police again on Wednesday. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/aisha-sultana-warned-against-violating-home-quarantine-rules/articleshow/83760569.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore logs 870 fresh Covid cases||COIMBATORE: The district logged 870 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, even as collector G S Sameeran inspected the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) and the ESI Hospital to check preparedness for the possible third wave of the pandemic. In the wake of experts around the world predicting that the wave might affect the children, he inspected the paediatric wards at the hospitals and said he was satisfied with the infrastructure in place. He told the media there was no specific warning or validated information on the arrival of a third wave, but they were simply taking precautionary measures. The CMCH has readied 370 beds for paediatric Covid-19 cases. Of them, 100 have oxygen support and another 36 have ventilator and monitor facilities. Similarly, there are 250 beds for paediatric Covid-19 cases in the ESI Hospital. While 100 beds are equipped with oxygen, 22 beds come with ventilator facilities. “Both the hospitals have procured paediatric oxygen masks, nasal cannulas, steroids like methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin to handle multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. There is no need to panic, as there is no clear indication confirming that such a wave would occur,” the collector said. Meanwhile, the number of active Covid-19 cases in the district fell to 8,373 with 2,046 patients getting discharged from various treatment centres. While the district has tested 2,14,256 positive for the virus till date, 2,03,953 of them have recovered. The recovery rate has improved to 95.1%. The Covid-19 toll rose to 1,930 with the state listing another 19 deaths that occurred in the district in the media bulletin. Health department officials said they were using the lull in fresh cases to upgrade the infrastructure to prepare for the third wave. “We want to equip every bed in every Covid care centre with oxygen support. We are also working on to increase the oxygen availability,” said Dr Senthil Kumar, deputy director of public health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-logs-870-fresh-covid-cases/articleshow/83760558.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra State, NIA told to file reply on Elgar accused bail plea||Mumbai: Elgar Parishad accused Sudha Bharadwaj, who is seeking default bail from the Bombay high court, on Tuesday said that the order of extending time to file chargesheet was passed by a judge not designated as a special judge and hence, without jurisdiction. Bharadwaj’s advocate Yug Chaudhry said that a RTI reply disclosed that sessions judge K D Vadane was not designated under the NIA Act to hear the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case, and while there were other designated judges, the state chose to go before a non-designated one. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar directed the state and National Investigation Agency (NIA) to file their replies to her contention and placed the matter next on July 3. Bharadwaj, an activist and lawyer, is seeking default bail in the Elgar Parishad case of January 2018. She has been lodged in Byculla women’s prison since her arrest in August 2018. On June 11, a single-judge bench of the HC had allowed Bharadwaj’s counsel to move plea before a division bench after he submitted that the chargesheet was not filed within the statutory 90-day period and, hence, his client was entitled to a default bail as per the Criminal Procedure Code. Chaudhry relied on responses received under RTI Act from the HC registry, which stated that judge Vadane who, on November 26, 2018, had granted 90-day extension of Bharadwaj's detention as sought by Pune Police, was only a district and additional sessions judge and not appointed as the special judge by the state under Section 22 of the NIA Act 2008 for the period between January 2018 to July 2019. Chaudhry further referred to RTI replies and said that the judge was also not authorised to take cognizance of the supplementary chargesheet filed by Pune Police in February 2019. He also said that it was not the NIA which was probing the case then, but the state police. Opposing the plea, NIA cou-nsel Sandesh Patil said as the ce-ntral agency had taken over the probe, grievances against the st-ate police at this stage were not maintainable and sought two weeks’ time to file a reply. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-nia-told-to-file-reply-on-elgar-accused-bail-plea/articleshow/83763065.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Police get proof of gold heist plan||Kozhikode: Police investigating the case of intended robbery against the eight accused hailing from Cherupulassery who had followed the car involved in the road accident that left five passengers of the vehicle dead at Ramanattukara on Monday got evidence, including voice clips from the mobile phones of the accused, showing their alleged involvement in a plan to get away with the smuggled gold. Malappuram district police chief S Sujith Das, who reviewed the progress of the probe at Karipur police station on Tuesday, said that the accused had come to provide protection to the ‘carrier’ who had arrived at the airport with smuggled gold. Police suspect that multiple gangs had reached Karipur airport in the early hours of Monday to lay hands on the smuggled gold. Customs had seized 2.33kg of gold from a passenger identified as Muhammed Shafeeq, who arrived at the airport from Dubai at 2.30am on Monday, which according to Customs was planned to be handed over to a team from Kannur. Also, investigation is on to find out whether the arrested accused was involved in smuggling of another consignment of contraband gold sneaked in through the airport. The eight accused who were arrested under IPC section 399 (making preparation to commit dacoity) were remanded in custody on Tuesday by Nilambur court. The accused have been identified as Cherali Faisal, 24, Shanid, 32, M Suhail, 24, V Musthafa, 26, Nadakkal Fayaz, 29, Hassan,35, Saleem, 28 and Nadakkal Mubasheer, 27. “We have booked them under sections involving preparation of robbery as we have got clear evidence including voice clips for actions in this regard. They had come to favour gold smuggling and to help take it from one place to another place,” Sujith Das said. Five people who had come to Karipur along with the arrested accused in another vehicle were killed when their car collided with a cement-laden truck at Ramanattukara at 4.45am on Monday. Police are also on the lookout for the remaining two people who were part of the 15-member team from Cherupulassery who had come in three vehicles. Adding to the mystery in the case is the recovery of some imported food items from the vehicle involved in the accident. Meanwhile, the police are also looking into the links of the arrested Cherpulassery gang with Anas Perumbavoor, a gangster accused in several cases, after a video footage of him along with the arrested Faisal emerged on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/police-get-proof-of-gold-heist-plan/articleshow/83760618.cms||---
---||Goa||Govt websites vulnerable to hacking: Cong||Panaji: Congress on Wednesday wrote to the chief secretary that state government websites are vulnerable to hacking as the security protocols are not followed. It has submitted evidence to show how departments like the transport department and Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority had failed to adhere to web security norms. “It is very disheartening that most of the official websites of the state government have not procured renewal of the security certificates, which forces the citizens to surf insecure websites, thus making the cellphone, laptops, computers, iPads or Notebooks vulnerable to hacking,” Congress RTI cell chairman Dominic Noronha said. Congress said the government must immediately ensure that all departments update their websites with appropriate security certificates. Noronha said that Congress will approach the high court if the government did not resolve the issue within a month. He said that insecure websites are an invitation for invasion of privacy and puts people’s lives in danger. “It could be either oversight, or pure negligence or that the file for its approval is pending for a long time, which in either case, is unacceptable,” said Noronha. The Raj Bhavan website was hacked twice, while 13 websites maintained by state government departments were defaced in 2013. Data tabled before the state assembly in 2016 shows that at least 17 state government websites were hacked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-websites-vulnerable-to-hacking-cong/articleshow/83760620.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Noida||Daily vax target to be doubled to 40k||Noida/Ghaziabad: The health departments of Noida and Ghaziabad have decided to double their daily inoculation target to 40,000 doses from July 1, when the government plans to ramp up vaccination drives in the districts. Officials in Noida said they would increase the number of clusters to 85, where 115 additional session sites would be set up. As of now, there are just two clusters in Dadri and Jewar blocks, where people are being administered shots under the Centre’s free vaccine policy. The routine vaccination drive, where advance registration on Co-Win is mandatory, is also going on simultaneously. The decision to double the target comes a day after both the districts failed to meet their daily target under the free-vaccine policy. As part of the plan to ramp up the drive, officials in Noida have decided to hold free vaccination camps in every housing society from July 1. "We have asked the societies to submit their requisitions. We will prepare a schedule and organise camps in every society. It will be a free drive at people’s doorsteps, and everyone should participate in the camps," said Neeraj Tyagi, the immunisation officer in Noida. Ghaziabad chief medical officer NK Gupta said they would eventually increase their target to 60,000 vaccinations a day. “A higher target is needed to achieve over 40,000 jabs per day. The health department has written to three private medical institutes to provide 100 nursing students and to the education department to send 200 teachers. The staff nurses will help with the vaccinations while the teachers will update the details of recipients on the portal. A training session will be held for them,” Gupta added. Meanwhile, the cluster vaccination drive, which opened to a poor response on Monday, saw more participants on Tuesday. In Jewar, 1,500 people were vaccinated while 3,000 took the shots in Dadri. A total of 17,280 people got vaccinated at government centres alone. In Ghaziabad, a total of 26,500 doses was administered on Tuesday. So far, 8.9 lakh people have taken the jab in the district. Of them, 7.7 lakh people have been given the first dose while 1.2 lakh recipients have taken both shots. Of the 26,500 people who were vaccinated in Ghaziabad, 21,732 were in the age bracket of 18-44 years, while 3,799 people were above 45 years and 924 aged over 60. The six clusters where vaccination camps were organised under the Centre’s policy were at Bhojpur, Vasundhara, Maharajpur, Makanpur, Khoda and Sadik Nagar. Walk-in vaccinations were allowed in these camps and Asha workers involved to make people aware about the initiative. Meanwhile, the health department in Ghaziabad has increased the number of online slots from 15,000 to 25,000 at a time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/daily-vax-target-to-be-doubled-to-40k/articleshow/83763029.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Drop in demand for jabs at pvt hosps clear over 2 days’||In Mumbai, slots for free vaccines in the 18+ age category opened late on Tuesday evening. The same day, Sanjeevani Hospital in Malad opened 400 slots, but over 200 slots were available an hour later and Surana Hospital had 156 of its 200 slots available.“For the government centres, the 18-44 category sees the maximum rush,” said Suchdeep Juneja, a 25-year-old software engineer who launched the mhVaccineTracker in Maharashtra and has around seven lakh subscribers on Telegram channels for different age groups. “For the last two to three days, the demand for private slots has slowed down, and they are open for hours.”Dr Prince Surana of the Surana Group of Hospital said the drop in demand for paid vaccination has become pronounced over the past two days. The hospital saw only 70% people turn up for their 1,000 online slots on Tuesday. Even for 200 walk-in spots, less than 100 people came in. “Till a few days ago, 500 of our slots would be taken in 2-3 minutes. One of the reasons could be wide availability of free vaccines and the second could be the ebbing of the second wave,” he said. Private centres were giving as much as 75% of shots in the city till now. Sources in the Centre said this could be because vaccine supply to the state has improved. A senior health ministry official told TOI, “It’s because we have also made 50% minimum online capacity mandatory for government sites in urban areas. Also, some people are now going to government centres and hence, there is better availability in private sector.”Ankita Garg, co-founder of Questrack—a mobile app that lets users filter their alerts by cost of vaccination and pin code—told TOI, “Our latest app usage data on how users from metro cities are filtering their alerts is showing that about 43% of users are not interested in paid vaccination slots anymore.”Sanil Mahajan, a Pune-based professional, said, “I tried booking slots at paid centres for my house help recently, but it took me two to three days to get an appointment. In contrast, hundreds of slots are now available in private centres for 48 hours.”Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said: “People who can afford paid shots should take them from private hospitals for two reasons: government is still allowing vaccine manufacturers to sell doses to private sites. Two, free doses should be left for people from lower income groups and those in economic difficulty.”(Inputs from Sumitra Deb Roy)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-drop-in-demand-for-jabs-at-pvt-hosps-clear-over-2-days/articleshow/83760650.cms||Neha Madaan

He has disowned the matter and blamed it on a media house. I don’t intend to say anything on what he has disowned,” he said. However, he said that he is open to listening to any kind of personal criticism against him.

He said that he is presently at a stage where the people have already judged him. He also repeated that he does not intend to take anyone’s name, when asked about the person whom he said had shared alleged plans of Sudhakaran to kidnap his son and daughter.

---||Ghaziabad||Glitch in Co-WIN: Jabs taken in Ghaziabad, but no record, certificates||GHAZIABAD: Many people who have been inoculated in the past few months still do not have their vaccination certificates because of glitches on Co-WIN or delay in uploading their information at the session site. For now, there is no solution to the problem, as vaccination details cannot be uploaded on a past date. A 75-year-old resident of Vasundhara said he and his wife took the first dose of the vaccine on March 23. They visited the District Women’s Hospital for the second shot on May 8, but were told there was no information on Co-WIN about their first jab. Despite getting both the shots, the couple’s details were registered on Co-WIN for just one dose and they were asked to get their “second jab” after July 31. Sources said the number of such cases runs into hundreds and even after months, many people are still trying to update the data through officials in the health department. The problem started after on-site registration was allowed in March, officials said. Many residents who turned up for the jabs, preferred on-spot registrations and staff posted at the session sites would often note down their mobile numbers and Aadhaar card details to upload those later. But in many cases, the details were not uploaded on time, or incorrect information got uploaded. For most people, the discrepancy came to light when they tried getting their second dose. While some people found that their details had not been uploaded at all, for others, the data was incorrect. In case no details were found, fresh registration had to be done. As a result of this, despite getting both vaccine doses, many people have themselves registered as single-dose recipients. Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said the matter has come to his notice and he is conducting a review to address the issue. Although similar problems were reported in Noida, most data has been updated. “In February-March, we were given an option of back-date entry on the portal. We had submitted entries of around 500 people. Now, there are just a few cases with discrepancies and we are handling those,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. In some cases, all entries from a centre could not be recorded on a particular day. Such entries were made later with the back-date data entry option.

Jutapanvar suspects that a short circuit in the refrigerator could have triggered the fire. Ponda fire officer Sushil Morajkar said a passerby spotted smoke emanating from a closed house in Bablyakhali area in Curti and informed them. “Two fire tenders were rushed from two different routes to avoid getting stuck in traffic jam,” Morajkar said. The fire fighters controlled the fire before it could cause major damage to the property. Fire fighters used additional hoses to reach to the house and over powered the fire. Jutapanwar, a small contractor, had kept Rs 80,000 in cash at home as he could not deposit in bank, but the amount was also gutted in fire. Jutapanwar has suffered a loss of Rs 1.5 lakh, Morajkar said quoting the house owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fire-at-a-house-at-curti-loss-estimated-at-around-rs-15-lakh/articleshow/83760809.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Monday, the constituency reported 53 Covid cases and only one death. As per Solapur district health administration data, there may be a link between spike in cases and electioneering. Since April 7, when poll campaigns started, 22,569 people in the constituency contracted Covid-19; 357 of them succumbed. The data reveals the constituency had 27.2% of Covid cases in the district during the current wave. It also had 21.5% of the district’s Covid-related deaths. The two tehsils, especially Pandharpur, had most deaths and cases compared to 10 other tehsils of the district. Most parties flouted Covid protocol. The state election commission allowed only 200 individuals for closed-door meetings but politicians held meetings in the open, with attendance of thousands. Udasingh Bhosale, sub-divisional officer of Mangalwedha, said now they have only five active cases in the tehsil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-after-post-poll-surge-covid-cases-drop-in-pandharpur/articleshow/83760694.cms||---

However, Nitish told the media that he was on his personal visit and had no information about the cabinet expansion. “I have come here for my eyes check-up,” he added. Responding to a query, Nitish said it’s the PM’s prerogative as to how and when to expand his cabinet. “I have no knowledge about it. Moreover, there is no scheduled meeting with the PM,” he said. When asked about the coup in the LJP, the CM said it was an internal matter of that party. He, however, maintained that some people (read Chirag Paswan) speak against him and his party for publicity only. “It gives him publicity when he either speaks or writes something against us,” he asserted. Water resources minister Sanjay Jha, eye specialist Dr Sunil Kumar Singh and a close friend Uday Kant Mishra are accompanying Nitish. On Monday, JD(U) MP from Munger Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh had said that it was a coincidence that the CM’s visit would coincide with the likely expansion of the Union cabinet. PM Modi's cabinet meeting is likely to be held on Wednesday. JD(U) national president RCP Singh, however, has hinted that his party would be part of the Narendra Modi cabinet. He, however, ruled out his name for a cabinet berth. “My name has been doing the rounds since 2017. So, it’s obvious to mention my name by some well-wishers,” he had said. Sources in the JD(U) said apart from Lalan and RCP, JD(U) MP from Purnia Santosh Kushwaha may be inducted as ministers in the NDA government at the Centre.

District health data showed that the number of active cases in the rural areas has dropped below 5,000, recording more than 50% drop in just a matter of two weeks. The number of patients in Pune municipal limits has also declined below 2,500, while that in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas has reduced below 1,000. Health officials said the number of active cases in the rural areas was a major concern, but the number has been on the decline for some time now. “Active cases have been on a decline in both the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits since the last month. However, the cases in the rural areas were rising. It was only after that the testing was increased and strict restrictions were imposed that the numbers started dropping,” a health official said. The PMR was among the top few districts with the highest number of active cases during the peak of the recent surge. The number had surged beyond one lakh-mark in mid-April. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant health chief in PMC, said, “The PMC areas had the maximum active caseload of around 56,000 on a single day in April. After that the daily cases and the tally of active patients started to decline. The cases have been dropping since the last two months. A few civic wards are now reporting single-digit cases per day. However, restrictions are in place despite the drop in cases. We have continued contact tracing efforts and swab centres are operational across the city.” The PMC has temporarily closed down Covid Care Centres following a drop in cases. An official from the civic health department said a decline in cases had improve bed availability in the hospitals. The daily cases in the PMC and PCMC areas have dropped below 500, while the cases in rural areas have been ranging between 500 to 1,000. Health experts have said people needed to abide by the Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent another spike. However, the way crowds are returning to roads and markets, the experts have expressed fear of the third wave gripping the state in a matter of few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-8299-pmrs-active-covid-cases-drop-to-4-month-low/articleshow/83760658.cms||Sarang Dastane

While the incident occurred last year, the matter came to light only this year after a child helpline and the child welfare committee received a complaint and informed police. The boy, now 15, was booked for rape and under relevant sections of the POCSO Act and sent to a juvenile home on Monday. According to police, the rape survivor and the minor boy studied in the same school and knew each other for the past five years. “The girl gave birth towards the end of last year,” said a police officer. The private hospital where the girl gave birth helped a couple ‘adopt’ the child by procuring a fake birth certificate which showed them as the infant’s biological parents. “A case has also been registered against a doctor at the hospital and a staff member,” said Rakesh Gusain, station house officer, Nehru colony police station. The foster father has also been booked for illegally adopting the child, said police. All three of them were booked under section 420 (cheating) and 465 (forgery) of the Indian Penal Code. The girl, now 13, had dropped out of school and is staying with her parents. “We will interrogate the girl’s parents and the couple to see if there is a child trafficking angle to the case,” said police.

Last week, chief minister Hemant Soren had directed the health department to initiate the necessary steps in this regard. “With Mucormycosis being declared an epidemic, each private and government hospital of the state will have to report every case to the state government,” cabinet secretary Vandan Dadel said. Jharkhand has reported 82 confirmed cases of Mucormycosis so far, of which 26 people have died. There are 54 suspected Mucormycosis patients in the state at present while 58 patients are currently hospitalized. In another decision, the cabinet approved a health department’s proposal to extend the services of doctors in the state health services who are due to retire in between March 2021 and September 2021. “Their service tenures have been extended till March 2022. Those who are retiring October onwards will be awarded service extensions for a period of six months from the date of their superannuation,” Dadel added. The cabinet also gave its approval for withdrawal of Rs 8 crore, which was provided by the Centre in the state contingency fund, for expenses pertaining to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. In another decision, the cabinet gave its nod to amending the existing state direct appointment regulations of 2014 to allow direct appointment of athletes and sportspersons of various disciplines.

The police said that the duo might be members of the Irani gang that is notorious for such thefts. “The spot where the theft happened has no CCTVs around. Also, the complainants approached the police several hours after the incident which gave the accused a leeway to flee. It is possible that they have left the city after looting so many ornaments. We are scanning CCTV footage of the city’s entry and exit points and the spots around the scene of the crime,” a crime branch official said. “It is possible that the duo is a member of the Irani gang. They may have been following the complainant after getting information about the jewellery from some insider. It would take a couple of days to crack the case as we haven’t got strong clues,” the official added. The complainant Vipul Dhakan had arrived in the city on June 16 with his salesman Jalpesh Lathigara and driver Praful Dangar. They had brought jewellery weighing about 5.75 kilograms worth Rs 2.35 crore in two bags. The accused had broken the glass of the car window to open the boot where the jewellery bag was kept.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/5kg-gold-heist-robbers-may-be-from-irani-gang/articleshow/83755834.cms||---

Sources said officials from the civic body as per prior notice had gone to Munsi Mohallah on Dimna Road area to evict shopkeepers who had encroached on government land. As soon as they reached the spot, a large number of shopkeepers, mainly those who had occupied government land, started protesting. Local BJP functionary Vikas Singh sided with the protesters and put up stiff resistance to the eviction work. Singh said, “The civic body is acting in a partisan manner as there are several places in other parts of Jamshedpur where main roads have been encroached upon but no action is being taken against the shopkeepers. Only small traders are being targeted. Proper vending zones should be made in the city and then encroachments should be removed.” The officials were told to go back as the shopkeepers refused to allow them to pull down more than 12 shops constructed illegally. The owners of the shops said they had been doing business from here for the last 20 years and it is their only means to feed their families. Mohd Sakil, who runs a bedding store in the area, said, “Officials can’t throw us out without giving a proper alternative arrangement.” Shop owners Kailash Yadav and Santu Pal too echoed similar views. The shop owners said the civic body should be sympathetic during the pandemic period as businesses have been badly affected due to the lockdown. Civic body officials refused to comment on the entire episode saying the drive will be resumed later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/civic-body-fails-to-evict-shopkeepers/articleshow/83773652.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||CID probe findings revive hope for jailed former Jharkhand minister Yogendra Sao||RANCHI: Former minister Yogendra Sao, who fought for the rights of displaced people, is likely to see some relief for himself and his family after an investigation by the crime investigation department (CID) recently said he was implicated in at least two cases by former investigating officers and registered an FIR against them. The two cases in which police have been caught on the wrong foot could be the tip of the iceberg as far as wrongdoing against the former Congress minister, his wife Nirmala Devi, also a former MLA, son Ankit Raj and sitting Barkagaon MLA and daughter Amba Prasad is concerned. They together face nearly 50 cases, all lodged during the previous regime of the BJP-led government. Facing nearly 30 cases himself, Sao continues to be in jail, while his wife Nirmala Devi, after a brief restriction on her entry into the state, is now allowed regular bail and at their home in Hazaribag. Sao had repeatedly made demands for re-investigations into the cases and handing them over to the CID. Finally, the Hemant Soren government agreed to hand over five cases to the CID and in two of them (90/15 and 91/15 at the Tandwa police station), the department has already found loopholes. Meanwhile, Sao’s daughter and MLA Amba Prasad claimed that the CID has found similar flaws in the rest three cases as well and action would be recommended soon. “We have been saying it for long that my father and mother were implicated by the BJP government because they were giving voice to the people of Barkagaon, who were being forced by the previous BJP government to give away their land to the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) at throwaway prices,” she claimed. It may be put on record that a series of protests by the residents of Barkagaon and Keredari blocks resulted in raising the compensation rate payable to the owners of the land acquired by NTPC. The negotiations began at Rs 3 lakh per acre and were finally settled at Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh per acre way back in 2015 through a tripartite agreement signed among the NTPC, the state government and the agitating villagers represented by Sao. Soon after the agreement, a series of cases were lodged against Sao and Nirmala Devi. The cases were allegedly used by the then ruling dispensation as arm twisting tactics against the family to support the BJP candidate in the 2016 Rajya Sabha election. A complaint was filed by Sao against then ADG Anurag Gupta and Ajay Kumar, the political advisor to erstwhile chief minister Raghubar Das, for coercing his wife, then an MLA, to abstain from voting during the Rajya Sabha polls. An audiotape purportedly related to the negotiations among Sao, Gupta and Kumar was also released by then JVM-P chief Babulal Marandi, acting on which the Election Commission had ordered the transfer of Gupta to Delhi and departmental proceedings against them. In the audiotape, the family was assured of “relief” from cases, if Nirmala Devi supported the BJP candidate by abstaining from voting. Earlier this month, the same case got an upstart in favour of Sao after Ranchi Police petitioned before the court to include the name of the former chief minister, Das, to press charges against him under the Prevention of Corruption Act related to the Rajya Sabha polling case. Amba said the motive of implicating her parents is clear and after the CIDs investigation established foul play in two cases, the government must review all the cases and drop the charges. “My parents have suffered a lot and the precious time of court is being wasted in hearing the false cases. So, the cases must be reviewed and action be taken accordingly,” she said. The MLA has also asked the government to take action against the policemen who killed four villagers in Barkagaon on October 1, 2016, by opening fire indiscriminately on the protesting crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cid-probe-findings-revive-hope-for-jailed-former-minister-yogendra/articleshow/83760615.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
