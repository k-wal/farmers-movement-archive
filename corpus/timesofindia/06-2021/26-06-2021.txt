---||World||WHO: Delta variant is 'most transmissible' identified so far||LONDON: The head of the World Health Organization said the Covid-19 delta variant, first seen in India, is "the most transmissible of the variants identified so far," and warned it is now spreading in at least 85 countries. At a press briefing on Friday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the lack of vaccines in poor countries was exacerbating the delta variant's transmission. He described a recent meeting he attended of an advisory group established to allocate vaccines. "They were disappointed because there is no vaccine to allocate," he said, criticizing rich countries for declining to immediately share shots with the developing world. "If there is no vaccine, what do you share?" Tedros said the global community was failing and risked repeating the mistakes made during the AIDS crisis decades ago and during the 2009 swine flu pandemic , when vaccines only arrived in poor countries after the outbreak ended. "It took 10 years (for antiretrovirals) to reach the low income countries after (HIV) was already rampant in high income countries," he said. "Do we want to repeat the same thing?" COVAX, the UN-backed effort aiming to distribute vaccines to poor countries, has missed several targets to share Covid-19 shots, and its biggest supplier is not expected to export any vaccines until the end of the year. The hundreds of millions of doses promised by countries including Britain, the US and others are not likely to arrive anytime soon. "We have through COVAX this month zero doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, zero doses of Pfizer vaccine, zero doses of (Johnson and Johnson) vaccine," acknowledged Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the WHO chief. "Every single one of our suppliers is unable to supply during this period because others are making demands on those products, others who are vaccinating very young populations that are not at risk." As border restrictions and other public health measures are loosened across Europe, the US and in other countries with high vaccination rates, WHO officials warned that this could lead to a resurgence of disease. "The global situation is incredibly fragile," said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19. Van Kerkhove said that while transmission is dropping in Europe, there are numerous events - from large sporting events to backyard barbeques - that all have consequences for disease spread. "The delta variant, the virus, will continue to evolve," Van Kerkhove said. "Right now our public health and social measures work, our vaccines work, our diagnostics work, our therapeutics work. But there may be a time where this virus evolves and these countermeasures don't." Earlier this month, British officials announced that they would allow 60,000 fans to attend the semi-finals and finals of the European football championships at London's Wembley stadium - to the dismay of some public health experts. Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, called it "worrying and confusing," saying there was limited data to prove its safety, especially given the prevalence of the more infectious delta variant. "(The) inevitable opportunities for the virus to spread in enclosed spaces like lavatories is a recipe for disaster."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/who-delta-variant-is-most-transmissible-identified-so-far/articleshow/83851580.cms||---

The coast guard said the boat transporting seven migrants was stopped Thursday in the Ionian Sea, west of the island of Corfu. Forged identity documents were found in their luggage. A 69-year-old Greek man was arrested on smuggling charges along with a Greek woman aged 35. A third suspect, described as a 37-year-old foreign national, was later arrested and accused of transporting the migrants from Athens to Corfu. Smuggling networks remain active in the southern Balkans and Ionian Sea despite a sharp drop in arrivals in Greece during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/greek-migrant-traffickers-arrested-in-italy-bound-speedboat/articleshow/83851585.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa trigger two-year extension in Ishan Pandita’s contract||Panaji: FC Goa have triggered a two-year extension in Ishan Pandita’s contract but will allow the striker to leave, should he wish to ply his trade in Europe. Pandita, 23, made a name for himself with four goals in the last edition of the Indian Super League (ISL), despite playing just 131 minutes across 11 matches. Except for the second-leg semifinal against Mumbai City, he was used as a late substitute and delivered with goals against Chennaiyin, Mumbai, ATK Mohun Bagan and Hyderabad. There was never any doubt that Goa would want the striker to continue and they have now triggered a clause in his contract. “When we signed Ishan a year ago, we did have an option built into his contract where the club and the player mutually agreed that the club would have the option to extend his contract to two further years. We have exercised that option in March and Ishan is technically contracted to us for two more years,” FC Goa’s director of football Ravi Puskur told TOI. Pandita arrived in Goa after working his way through the youth system in Spain where he found a place for himself at Lorca FC in the third tier. The striker is now keen to return to Europe. Should he have an offer, Goa won’t create hurdles. “Ishan has told us that he wants to have an opportunity in Europe and we don’t want to stand in the player’s way, if such an opportunity arises,” said Puskur. “Getting to play in Europe is very good. We have been honest and transparent with Ishan. Till that opportunity arises, he continues to be an FC Goa player.” The super-sub’s impressive performances in ISL were enough to catch the eye of national coach Igor Stimac who summoned him for national duty and handed him his international debut against Oman in a 1-1 draw.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-trigger-two-year-extension-in-ishan-panditas-contract/articleshow/83851678.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||World||China pressures Ukraine at UN rights council||GENEVA: China pressured Ukraine into withdrawing its support for a call for more scrutiny of human rights in China's western region of Xinjiang by threatening to withhold Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccines destined for Ukraine unless it did so, diplomats told The Associated Press on Friday. Ukraine briefly joined a statement by over 40 countries, presented by Canada at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday, urging China to allow immediate access for independent observers to Xinjiang. Some human rights groups have alleged Chinese mistreatment of Muslim Uyghurs and others in the region. On Thursday, Ukraine pulled its name off the list of supporting states after Chinese authorities warned Kyiv that they would block a planned shipment of at least 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Ukraine unless it did so, said diplomats from two western countries. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Ukraine has agreed to purchase 1.9 million doses of CoronaVac vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech. As of early May, Ukraine had received 1.2 million doses, according to Health Minister Maxim Stepanov. In the past, China's government has been no stranger to pressuring other countries in Geneva diplomatic circles or in national capitals either to line up behind its statements or avoid backing statements that criticise, question or seek scrutiny of human rights in the country. But the alleged pressure would mark an escalation of intense recent efforts by Beijing to push back against criticism of its rights record, this time by potentially jeopardizing health - even lives - as a way to minimize international attention to it, the diplomats said. One of the Western diplomats called it sign of “bare-knuckles" diplomacy by China. The other diplomat cited “reports of significant pressure in Kyiv,” adding, “last night the delegation told us they needed to pull out.” The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing and a spokesman for the Chinese diplomatic mission in Geneva in did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Ukrainian authorities did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. The situation could still change. Under the practice of the 47-member council, countries can add their names to statements or resolutions up to two weeks after the end of a session. The current 3 1/2-week session that began Monday runs until July 13. Canadian Ambassador Leslie Norton said in a statement Tuesday that “credible reports indicate that over a million people have been arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang.” Norton's statement was initially backed by 41 countries and is now supported by 44. Ukraine was briefly country No. 45. Norton also pointed to “reports of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, forced sterilization, sexual and gender-based violence, and forced separation of children from their parents by authorities” in China. Also Tuesday, a Chinese diplomat decried shortcomings in Canada's own rights record, pointing notably to abuses against Indigenous peoples. Belarus read a joint statement - allegedly by 64 countries - speaking out in defense of China's right to manage its own internal affairs such as with Hong Kong or Xinjiang. A spokesman for the council's secretariat said Belarus had not provided a list of those 64 countries. Belarus' diplomatic mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to an e-mail from The Associated Press seeking a list of those countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-pressures-ukraine-at-un-rights-council/articleshow/83852339.cms||---

"On behalf of me and my family, we seek the maximum penalty," Terrence Floyd said in delivering one of four victim impact statements during Derek Chauvin's sentencing hearing. "We don't want to see no more slaps on the wrist. We've been through that already." He said he's struggling to explain George Floyd's death to his daughter but feels he has to "because this is story." "This, this is the case everybody knows about,'' he said. "So she's going to find out and I'm gonna have to explain that to her. And I think that's, to me, harder than even just standing here. That I have to talk to my daughter and tell her, you know, about her niece, about her uncle, about the situation. That's basically reliving it all over again, years down the line." Another of Floyd's brothers, Philonise Floyd, wiped his eyes and sniffled as he too asked for Chauvin to receive a maximum sentence. "My family has been given a life sentence," he said. "We will never be able to get George back."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/floyds-brother-my-family-has-been-given-a-life-sentence/articleshow/83853630.cms||---
---||World||French woman convicted of killing 'monster' abuser, set free||CHALON-SUR-SAONE, France: A French mother of four was sentenced to one year in prison on Friday for killing her husband after decades of sexual, physical and psychological abuse starting when she was an adolescent. The verdict allows her to walk free, as she has already served time in preventive detention. The case had drawn broad attention and support for the defendant amid a national reckoning with long-held taboos around domestic abuse. Valerie Bacot, 40, has admitted to shooting Daniel Polette dead in 2016. Polette was her stepfather, who later married her and forced her into prostitution. A jury in Chalon-sur-Saone, central France, found Bacot guilty of the murder. She was sentenced to one year in prison and a three-year suspended sentence. The prosecutor had earlier requested that Bacot should not be sent to prison, saying he didn't consider her a danger to society. The trial showed the degree of control and influence Polette, 25 years Bacot's senior, had over her. "Yes, I killed him but if I had not done it, my children would have," Bacot said. Polette arrived in Bacot's life in 1992 as her mother's companion. A few months later, she said, the sexual abuse started. She was 12 when he began raping her, Bacot said. Polette's sisters reached out to a social worker and he was arrested in 1995 and convicted of sexual assaults, spending two years in prison. Afterward, Polette returned to the family home and started abusing Bacot again. "When he came back, he said he would leave me alone. My mother had forgiven him. But it started again. Following a rape I got pregnant," Bacot said. She was 17 at the time. Her mother threw her out of the house and she started living with Polette, whom she described as having total control over her life. He did not allow her to work or use contraception. She had three other children. "He was beating me, slaps then punches, he throttled me. He was beating and then things were going better," she said, adding he also threatened her with a handgun. In 2002, he forced her into prostitution, still controlling all of her actions. In March 2016, following a violent prostitution-related situation, she shot Polette with the gun. Her children helped her bury the body, an act for which they were given suspended prison sentences. Bacot was arrested by police the following year and imprisoned, before being released under judicial supervision in 2018 pending trial. The psychologist who examined her said the protection of her children was key in Bacot's reaction. In 2016, she feared Polette would assault her 14-year old daughter and force her into prostitution. A petition in favor of Bacot has gathered over 710,000 signatures. Family members came to the court to say they don't regret Polette's death. His brother and sisters described him as a "monster." "The person I thank the most in the world is Valerie, because she killed him. She did what I should have done for a long time," said Polette's sister, 59. She said he raped her when she was 12. Dr. Denis Prieur, a psychiatrist, said that at the time of the domestic abuse, Bacot no longer had free will. "She was not able to turn to the law (for assistance) because her husband was always there." Now, "she has become somebody" and is not "a thing" anymore, he said. Bacot's case echoes that of another French woman, Jacqueline Sauvage, who was convicted of shooting and killing her allegedly violent husband. Sauvage was granted a presidential pardon in 2016, allowing her to get out of prison. Sauvage had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for fatally shooting her husband three times in the back with a hunting rifle in 2012. During the trial, she said her husband had beaten her for 47 years. The couple's adult daughters also said he had abused them. The Associated Press doesn't typically name victims of extremely severe abuse, but Bacot, like Sauvage, has told her story publicly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/french-woman-convicted-of-killing-monster-abuser-set-free/articleshow/83854417.cms||---

Her residential society was planning to make COVID vaccination mandatory for every resident and staff, but her two domestic helps were refusing to take the jab. She recounts, “Both of them had such grave misconceptions about the COVID vaccine and feared that it would hurt or even kill them. They were obdurate. I had to get our RWA secretary to counsel them and somehow convince them.” The scenario isn’t a one-off. Many domestic helps, guards and other staff members in residential societies are hesitant about getting the jab due to the myths and misconceptions about the vaccines floating around. To address this, many resident welfare associations (RWAs) across the Millennium City have been setting up counselling and myth-busting sessions around vaccines. Some have even taken the implementation in their own hands, organising vaccination camps and financing the jab for those unable to afford it. Residents pitch in with financial help to get vaccineIn many places, residents and RWA officials found that the myths and misconceptions were compounded by financial woes and inability to find slots. There, societies set up vaccination camps within the premises to address that issue. Madhukar Kapur, RWA President of The Verandas in Sector 54, says, “For most, the horrors of the second wave were enough to convince them of the need for vaccinating. But still, there were many who were swayed by hearsay and gossip about the entire process. Many lacked the technical know-how to book slots online. Some had financial concerns too. So, we made sure they could get vaccinated at camps set up within the society for residents and staff alike and residents pitched in financially for those who couldn’t afford it.” In several societies, apart from the RWAs, individual residents have also taken it upon themselves to make sure their domestic helps get the jab as soon as possible. Prakhyaat Sharma, a resident of Central Park Resorts in Sector 48, tells us, “The residents have created a special section for vaccination and counselling of domestic helps working in the society. Many have taken individual initiatives to get their house helps vaccinated. I booked a slot for my two helps and had to guide and navigate them through it, also clarifying their doubts and misconceptions about it.” Others say they had to take a sterner approach. Natasha Singh, a resident of Nirvana Country, says, “My house helps refused to get vaccinated saying that they heard the side-effects are fatal. The two have been working at my house for years and are like family so I tried to counsel them. When that failed, I told them that not getting vaccinated could lead to loss of livelihood as in the months to come most people would prefer vaccinated staff. That eventually convinced them.” Vaccination drive being conducted at The Verandas in GurgaonCounselling sessions to get rid of misconceptionsMany RWAs have roped in medical professionals living in the society to conduct awareness camps and counselling sessions for those with doubts and hesitation about vaccines, chiefly for the domestic helps working in the society. Rear Admiral (Retd) Kapil Gupta, the President of the RWA at Escape Apartments in Nirvana Country, says, “We had a goal that everyone within the society should be vaccinated roughly by the end of July. But we realised that the biggest hindrance in achieving that was the misconceptions a lot of our staff had regarding vaccination. It stemmed from lack of awareness and to counter that, we held counselling sessions for them, where we had residents and medical experts speak to them about why the vaccine is safe and good.” Medical professional Dr Rinkesh Bansal conducted one such awareness camp at Escape Apartments in Sector 50 earlier this month. “Many people claimed that they read on WhatsApp that vaccination causes impotency or that it is some form of clandestine sterilisation. Others were worried about the side-effects being fatal. There was very little awareness. I found one domestic help who had been vaccinated and had her as my mediator during the session. She conveyed my expertise to them in their vernacular, which helped me convince them about the safety and necessity of vaccination,” he tells us.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-residents-organise-myth-busting-sessions-and-vaccine-drives-for-helps-staff/articleshow/83843667.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

Carolyn Pawlenty made the statement in court before her son, Derek Chauvin, heard his sentence on a second-degree murder charge. She didn't mention Floyd by name. "Derek has played over and over in his head the events of that day," Pawlenty said. "I've seen the toll it has taken on him. I believe a lengthy sentence will not serve Derek well. When you sentence my son, you will also be sentencing me. I will not be able to see Derek, talk to him on the phone or give him our special hug." She told Judge Peter Cahill that Chauvin "has a big heart." "My son's identity has also been reduced to that as a racist," she said. "I want this court to know that none of these things are true and that my son is a good man."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chauvins-mother-calls-her-son-honorable-and-selfless/articleshow/83855847.cms||---

It was unclear how many people were injured in the attack in a central part of the Bavarian city. Police identified the suspect as a 24-year-old Somali man living in Wuerzburg. His life was not in danger from his gunshot wound, they said. The man was in psychiatric treatment before the attack and had been known to police, Bavaria's top security official Joachim Herrmann said. Videos posted on social media showed pedestrians surrounding the attacker and holding him at bay with chairs and sticks. A woman who said she had witnessed the incident told German RTL television that the police then stepped in. "He had a really big knife with him and was attacking people, "Julia Runze said. "And then many people tried to throw chairs or umbrellas or cellphones at him and stop him.'' "The police then approached him and I think a shot was fired, you could hear that clearly." Police spokeswoman Kerstin Kunick said officers were alerted around 5 pm to a knife attack on Barbarossa Square in the center of the city. Bavaria's governor Markus Soeder expressed shock at the news of the attack. "We grieve with the victims and their families," he wrote on Twitter. Police said on Twitter that there was no danger to the population. They urged social media users to refrain from speculation. Wurzburg is a city of about 130,000 people located between Munich and Frankfurt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/knife-attack-in-german-city-leaves-3-dead-suspect-arrested/articleshow/83855998.cms||---
---||World||Ex-police officer Chauvin offers condolences to Floyd family at sentencing||MINNEAPOLIS: Some of George Floyd's relatives tearfully asked the judge to send former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin to prison for decades during a sentencing hearing on Friday, while Chauvin offered condolences to them. A jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty on April 20 of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter after a trial that was widely seen as a landmark in the history of US policing. Prosecutors asked several members of Floyd's family to address Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill as the hearing got underway. Floyd's 7-year-old daughter Gianna began, appearing in a video recording played for the judge. "I ask about him all the time," she said in the video as Chauvin sat before the judge dressed in a gray suit and tie, a blue mask covering his nose and mouth. "My daddy always used to help me brush my teeth." Asked what she would say to him if she could see him again, she said: "It would be I miss you and I love you." Prosecutors have asked for a 30-year prison sentence, double the upper limit indicated in sentencing guidelines for a first-time offender. Cahill ruled earlier this month that prosecutors have established grounds for giving Chauvin a harsher sentence. Chauvin will be sentenced on the most serious charge for which he was convicted, which carries a statutory maximum of 40 years. The defense has asked for probation and had unsuccessfully sought a retrial ahead of an expected appeal. Video of Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, for more than nine minutes in May 2020 sparked outrage around the world and the largest protest movement seen in the United States in decades. Floyd's brother Terrence Floyd addressed Chauvin directly during his victim impact statement on Friday. "What was going through your head as you had your knee on my brother's neck?" he asked. He told the judge he wanted the maximum sentence. "We don't want to see no more slaps on the wrist. We've been through that already." Haunted by video:Philonise Floyd, another brother, said he was haunted by the videos of Floyd's death, which were replayed countless times at Chauvin's trial. Chauvin addressed the judge briefly, saying, "At this time due to some additional legal matters at hand, I'm not able to give a full formal statement at this time. But very briefly though, I do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. There's going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest and I hope things will give you some peace of mind. Thank you." He did not elaborate. Chauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, told the judge she would always believe her son was innocent and that her life's two happiest moments were giving birth to Chauvin and pinning his police badge on him when he joined the Minneapolis Police Department. "Derek has played over and over again in his head the events of that day," she said, her voice quavering at times. "I have seen the toll it has taken on him. I believe a lengthy sentence will not serve Derek well. When you sentence my son, you will also be sentencing me." Aggravating factors:In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors from the Minnesota attorney general's office wrote that Chauvin's crime "shocked the conscience of the Nation." In a six-page ruling last month, Cahill found that prosecutors had shown there were four aggravating factors that would allow him to hand down a longer prison term than sentencing guidelines would dictate. The judge agreed that Chauvin abused his position of trust and authority; that he treated Floyd with particular cruelty; that he committed the crime as part of a group with three other officers; and that he committed the murder in front of children. Through his attorney Eric Nelson, Chauvin had asked in court filings that the judge sentence him to probation, writing that the murder of Floyd was "best described as an error made in good faith." Chauvin was helping arrest Floyd on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill. Mary Moriarty, Hennepin County's former chief public defender, said in an interview that the judge may take note that Chauvin did not express remorse. "I think what Cahill would have been looking for from Chauvin or through his defense counsel is some responsibility for his actions or some empathy for George Floyd," she said. Chauvin has been held at the state's maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights since his conviction. In Minnesota, convicted people with good behavior spend two-thirds of their sentence in prison and the final third on supervised release. In 2019, the former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor was sentenced by a different judge to 12-1/2 years in prison after he was found guilty of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for fatally shooting an Australian American woman, Justine Damond. The three other police officers involved in Floyd's arrest were, like Chauvin, fired the day after. The three are due to face trial next year on charges of aiding and abetting Floyd's murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ex-police-officer-chauvin-offers-condolences-to-floyd-family-at-sentencing/articleshow/83857289.cms||---

"We'll never fully recover, but we'll remember," Biden said as he signed legislation establishing Florida's National Pulse Memorial, joined by survivors of the shooting and lawmakers who worked on the measure. "May ... no president ever have to sign another monument like this." A gunman stormed the popular venue, opening fire with an AR-15-style assault rifle and pistol in one of the most lethal modern mass shootings in the United States. Biden, in a shift from his Republican predecessor, has sought to emphasize equality for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community, officially recognizing Pride Month with a June 1 proclamation and nominating LGBTQ officials to top US government posts, among other actions. The Democratic president has also pressed for full rights for LGBTQ+ Americans, including passage of the Equality Act in Congress, noting that protections are lacking in many US states. "Our presence this afternoon makes a very strong statement: Pride is back at the White House," Biden said, after being introduced by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay, and a young transgender man, Ashton Mota. On Friday, he named Jessica Stern, head of the New York-based human rights group OutRight Action International, to be a special envoy at the US State Department to ensure that U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance include LGBTQ rights. After signing the legislation, Biden noted that half of US states do not have specific protections for LGBTQ+ Americans and their families. “We must protect the gains we’ve made,” he said. In Florida, authorities branded the 2016 shooting an act of Islamist extremism by a 29-year-old US citizen of Afghan descent. But civil rights activists said the massacre was also a hate crime targeting gay men and Latinos frequenting the club. The new Orlando site will join other memorials including the National AIDS Memorial Grove in San Francisco and New York City's Stonewall Inn, a national monument commemorating what is seen as the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement following riots after police raided the gay bar in 1969. Biden has sought to reverse course from former President Donald Trump, who did not officially recognize Pride month. He has ordered federal agencies to protect LGBTQ people under federal anti-discrimination laws. He also reversed a Trump-era ban on transgender people openly serving in the US military and on flying rainbow Pride flags at US embassies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pride-is-back-at-the-white-house-biden-says-signing-pulse-nightclub-bill/articleshow/83857240.cms||---

Currently, 565 districts have weekly test positivity at less than 5%. However, 75 districts still have over 10% positivity, whereas 92 districts have positivity rate between 5-10%. Read AlsoCovid-19: Most of country should remain locked down for 6-8 weeks, ICMR chief saysThe head of the main Indian health agency responding to the coronavirus has said districts reporting a high number of infections should remain locked down for another six to eight weeks to control the spread of the rampaging disease. Dr Balram Bhargava, head of ICMR, said lockdown restrictionsMeanwhile, An ICMR study titled 'Plausibility of a Third Wave of Covid-19 in India: A Mathematical Modelling-based Analysis', published in the peer-reviewed Indian Journal of Medical Research on Friday, found a substantial third wave of Covid-19 could occur but it may not be as large as the second wave. Researchers said scaling up vaccinations could play an important role in mitigating any eventuality and future waves of the disease. At a briefing, Dr Bhargava said, "The second wave is not yet over in our country. In a large part of India, the second wave is over. However, these districts (where positivity is still above 5%) are important and it is possible for us to avert a big third wave provided individual and societal protective behaviour are adhered to." Read AlsoNo Covid death for second day in row; 43 test positive in LudhianaNo death due to Covid-19 was reported in Ludhiana on Friday, the second consecutive day. However, 43 residents tested positive for the virus.While daily new cases have come down significantly over the last few weeks, there are still 125 districts reporting more than 100 cases of Covid-19 every day. There were 6.1 lakh active cases across the country on Friday morning. The overall weekly positivity rate stood at 3.1%.

The punishment which fell short of the 30 years that prosecutors had requested came after Chauvin broke his more than yearlong silence in court to offer condolences to the Floyd family and say he hopes more information coming out will eventually give them "some peace of mind." With good behavior, Chauvin, 45, could be paroled after serving two-thirds of his sentence, or about 15 years. In imposing the punishment, Judge Peter Cahill went beyond the 12.5-year sentence prescribed under state guidelines, citing "your abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty" shown to Floyd. Chauvin was immediately led back to prison. As with the verdicts in April, he showed little emotion when the judge pronounced the sentence. His eyes moved rapidly around the courtroom, his Covid-19 mask obscuring much of his face. The fired white officer was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for up to 9 1/2 minutes as the 46-year-old Black man gasped that he couldn't breathe and went limp on May 25, 2020. Bystander video of Floyd's arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store prompted protests around the world and led to scattered violence in Minneapolis and beyond. On Friday, Chauvin, who did not testify at his trial, removed his mask and turned toward the Floyd family, speaking only briefly because of what he called "some additional legal matters at hand" an apparent reference to the federal civil rights trial he still faces. "But very briefly, though, I do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. There's going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest. And I hope things will give you some some peace of mind," he said, without elaborating. In asking that Chauvin be left off on probation, defense attorney Eric Nelson called Floyd's death "tragic" and said that Chauvin's "brain is littered with what-ifs" from that day: "What if I just did not agree to go in that day? What if things had gone differently? What if I never responded to that call? What if what if what if?" Floyd's family members took the stand and expressed sorrow about his death. They asked for the maximum penalty. "We don't want to see no more slaps on the wrist. We've been through that already," said a tearful Terrence Floyd, one of Floyd's brothers. Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams said: "Our family is forever broken." And Floyd's 7-year-old daughter, Gianna, in a video played in court, said that if she could say something to her father now, it would be: "I miss you and and I love you." George Floyd's 7-year-old daughter Gianna testifies via a cell phone video. (Reuters photo)Prosecutor Matthew Frank asked the judge to exceed sentencing guidelines and give Chauvin 30 years in prison, saying "tortured is the right word" for what the officer did to Floyd. "This is not a momentary gunshot, punch to the face. This is 9{ minutes of cruelty to a man who was helpless and just begging for his life," Frank said. Chauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, appeared in court to plead for mercy for son, saying his reputation has been unfairly reduced to that of "an aggressive, heartless and uncaring person" and a racist. "I can tell you that is far from the truth," she told the judge. "I want this court to know that none of these things are true and that my son is a good man." She added: "Derek, I want you to know I have always believed in your innocence, and I will never waver from that." Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin mother Carolyn Pawlenty is seen during victim impact statements as Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presides over sentencing. (AP photo)"I will be here for you when you come home," she said. The concrete barricades, razor wire and National Guard patrols at the courthouse during Chauvin's three-week trial in the spring were gone Friday, reflecting an easing of tensions since the verdict in April. Ahead of the sentencing, the judge agreed with prosecutors that there were aggravating circumstances that could justify a heavier punishment than the recommended 12.5 years among them, that Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty, abused his position of authority as a police officer and did it in front of children. Before the sentencing, the judge denied Chauvin's request for a new trial. The defense had argued that the intense publicity tainted the jury pool and that the trial should have been moved away from Minneapolis. The judge also rejected a defense request for a hearing into possible juror misconduct. Nelson had accused a juror of not being candid during jury selection because he didn't mention his participation in a march last summer to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Prosecutors countered the juror had been open about his views. Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, said 11 non-federal law officers, including Chauvin, have been convicted of murder for on-duty deaths since 2005. The penalties for the nine who were sentenced before Chauvin ranged from from six years, nine months, to life behind bars, with the median being 15 years. With Chauvin's sentencing, the Floyd family and Black America witnessed something of a rarity: In the small number of instances in which officers accused of brutality or other misconduct against Black people have gone to trial, the list of acquittals and mistrials is longer than the list of sentencings after conviction. In recent years, the acquittals have included officers tried in the deaths of Philando Castile in suburban Minneapolis and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Two mistrials were declared over the death of Samuel Dubose in Cincinnati. "That's why the world has watched this trial, because it is a rare occurrence," said Arizona-based civil rights attorney Benjamin Taylor, who has represented victims of police brutality. "Everybody knows that this doesn't happen every day." Chauvin has been held since his conviction at the state's maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights, where he has been kept in a cell by himself for his own protection, his meals brought to him. The three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest are scheduled for trial in March on state charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter. They will also stand trial with Floyd on the federal civil rights charges. No date has been set for that trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ex-officer-derek-chauvin-gets-22-5-years-in-prison-for-killing-george-floyd/articleshow/83858027.cms||---

The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in the country declined to 983 on Friday, from 1,036 on the previous day. The average has been falling steadily since hitting a peak of 4,040 on May 16 in keeping with the fall in Covid-related fatalities as the second Covid wave continues to ebb. However, statistics on the death count have been complicated by “backlog” deaths being recorded, mainly by Maharashtra, every day since mid-May. If such “backlog” mortalities are counted in the daily numbers then the toll still goes over 1,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/average-daily-covid-toll-below-1000-after-71-days/articleshow/83858826.cms||---
---||World||UK's Johnson stands by health secretary who broke Covid rules kissing aide||LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected calls on Friday to fire his health secretary after pictures appeared of him embracing and kissing an aide in his office, in what he acknowledged was a breach of coronavirus rules. The Sun newspaper, which published the photographs of Matt Hancock and the aide on its front page, said the images were taken last month before the government lifted rules banning intimate contact with people outside a person's household. The aide had been a friend of Hancock's before she was appointed to his staff. Hancock is married. "I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances," Hancock said. "I have let people down and am very sorry. I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter." Hancock, 42, has been at the centre of the government's fight against the pandemic, often appearing on television to tell the public to follow strict rules and to defend his department against criticism of its response to the crisis. A spokesperson for Johnson said the prime minister had accepted Hancock's apology, had full confidence in him, and "considers the matter closed". The opposition Labour Party called on Johnson to fire Hancock and demanded an investigation into whether he breached the code governing the behaviour of ministers. "This matter is definitely not closed, despite the government's attempts to cover it up," a Labour spokesperson said. "Matt Hancock appears to have been caught breaking the laws he created while having a secret relationship with an aide he appointed to a taxpayer-funded job." Public pressure:Hancock has been criticised for his department's handling of the pandemic, particularly in the early months last year when it struggled to deliver testing and protective equipment for hospital staff treating COVID-19 patients. Hancock was found in February to have acted unlawfully by not revealing details of contracts signed during the crisis. The health ministry said it had needed to move quickly. Hancock also said last year that it was right that a government scientist resigned after breaking COVID rules by meeting a partner. More than half of UK adults said Hancock should resign, according to an opinion poll on Friday. Savanta ComRes found 58% of those polled thought he step down. "It's a disgrace," said Charlie Irwin, a 19-year-old who lives in Kent in the south of England. The government has been "so onto us about, you know, 'you can't do this, you can't do that,' and then to go and break them." The Sun did not say how it obtained the security camera images, but it cited a whistleblower as commenting on the relationship. London's police said they would not investigate Hancock because they do not retrospectively investigate breaches of the government's coronavirus regulations. The Sun said Hancock met the aide at Oxford University in the early 2000s. She is listed on the health department's website as a non-executive director. Asked about the appropriateness of appointing friends to positions in government, Transport Minister Grant Shapps told Sky News that "very strict rules" were in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uks-johnson-stands-by-health-secretary-who-broke-covid-rules-kissing-aide/articleshow/83858912.cms||---

Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar, the founder of the Shul of Bal Harbour, said that his community is praying for miracles as rescue teams on Friday continued to search for survivors among the rubble of the 12-story Champlain Towers South in Surfside. "It definitely needs miracles ... because the circumstances are very, very grim," said Lipskar, who is a Chabad-Lubavitch emissary to the area. Lipskar could not say exactly how many members of his congregation were missing. But he said that many members of Surfside's Jewish community were unaccounted for. "It's a very large group of people, unfortunately," he said. "From the synagogue, everybody knows somebody. It's like one big community, so (there were) a lot of people that lived in that building." Governor Ron DeSantis visited the Shul on Friday afternoon. Reporters were not allowed inside and the governor entered and exited through an underground garage. The Shul is located about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) north of the building that collapsed early Thursday morning, killing at least four people. Officials said Friday that 159 people are still unaccounted for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jewish-community-prays-for-miracles-after-condo-collapse/articleshow/83859089.cms||---

---||India||Twitter temporarily blocks Ravi Shankar Prasad over 'copyright plaint'||NEW DELHI: At a time when it is in the thick of the storm around its reluctance to follow India's new IT rules, Twitter was embroiled in a fresh controversy and embarrassment on Friday after IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad revealed that his account was blocked for nearly an hour over alleged violation of an American copyright law due to one of his tweets. The minister linked the action by the global micro-blogging giant to his tough stand against the company over non-compliance with the new rules. "Twitter's actions indicate that they are not the harbinger of free speech that they claim to be but are only interested in running their own agenda, with the threat that if you do not tow the line they draw, they will arbitrarily remove you from their platform," Prasad said in a series of Tweets. It later emerged, through the Lumen database of Harvard University, that Prasad's tweet that resulted in the action was from December 2017. He had tagged music composer AR Rehman's 'Maa Tujhe Salaam' video, while writing about India's 1971 victory over Pakistan. The video, according to Twitter, violated copyright laws after there was a complaint to this effect. Read AlsoNot in favour of banning Twitter but norms must be followed: Union minister Ravi Shankar PrasadAsked if the microblogging platform can be banned in India, Prasad said that the government is not in favour of prohibiting any platform but the norms must be followed."If half of the government is on Twitter including Prime Minister and President ... that shows how fair we are. But norms are norms.What is, however, still unclear is why the company had taken the action after nearly three-and-a-half years, especially when it is embroiled in a bitter exchange with the government over the new IT Rules.And, also, why the account was restored after just an hour the minister was indeed deemed to have violated a US law.? Prasad alleged that the action and "agenda" by Twitter was the result of the government's "no compromise" stand against the company after it failed to comply with the new rules. The non-compliance has seen Prasad's IT Ministry reprimand Twitter over the past few weeks, while the company also lost its 'safe harbour' protection over third-party content, just when an FIR was filed against its India MD in relation to a probe by UP's Ghaziabad Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-temporarily-blocks-ravi-shankar-prasad-over-copyright-plaint/articleshow/83859590.cms||Pankaj Doval

The attack in the north targeted a temporary base set up by the peacekeepers near the village of Ichagara in the Gao region, where Islamist insurgents linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State are active. A UN mission spokesperson said 12 of the wounded were German and one was Belgian. The mission had earlier said that 15 peacekeepers were wounded but revised that number downward. Three of the German soldiers were severely wounded, Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a statement. Two of them are in a stable condition and the third is still in surgery, she said. At least six Malian soldiers were killed and one wounded in a separate attack in Boni in the neighbouring region of Mopti, the army said in a statement. It provided no further details. Armed attacks by Islamist militants and other groups are rampant across vast swathes of Mali and its neighbours Burkina Faso and Niger despite the presence of the peacekeepers and thousands of other international troops in the region. The UN mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA, has deployed over 13,000 soldiers to contain violence by armed groups in the north and centre of the West African nation. MINUSMA has recorded about 230 fatalities since 2013, making it the deadliest of the United Nations’ more than dozen peacekeeping missions. Germany contributes up to 1,100 troops to MINUSMA. Most of them are based in Gao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/thirteen-un-peacekeepers-wounded-six-soldiers-killed-in-mali-militant-attacks/articleshow/83859476.cms||---
---||World||Pakistan fails FATF test, to stay on terror watchdog's grey list||NEW DELHI: While acknowledging "substantial" progress made by Islamabad in addressing strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT (anti-money laundering/combating financing of terrorism) regime, global terror watchdog FATF on Friday retained Pakistan on its grey or Increased Monitoring List. There was no reprieve for Pakistan even as the Paris-based body admitted Islamabad had now largely addressed 26 of the 27 items in its 2018 action plan to combat terror-financing. The one remaining unaddressed item, because of which Pakistan couldn't exit the grey list, relates to the need to demonstrate that terror-financing investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN designated terrorist groups. FATF president Marcus Pleyer described it as a key issue that Pakistan needed to address. As NSA Ajit Doval said at an SCO meeting this week, India has repeatedly emphasised on the need for full implementation of UN resolutions and targeted sanctions against UN designated terrorist individuals and entities. Significantly, Doval had also proposed an MoU between FATF and SCO for countering terror-financing. Pleyer said after the plenary meeting there was also a high-level commitment made by Pakistan this month to address strategic deficiencies, as identified by FATF's regional partner Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering in 2019, in keeping with a new action plan that focused on combating laundering. While acknowledging Pakistan's "political commitment" that led to what FATF described as significant progress across a comprehensive CFT action plan, Pleyer said Pakistan's delisting will take place only after it complies with all the agenda items in both the action plans. He said an on-site evaluation will take place for both FATF and APG action plan. FATF called upon Pakistan to address its strategically important AML/CFT deficiencies as identified by the APG mutual evaluation report. These include the need to demonstrate that assistance is being sought from foreign countries in implementing counter-terror UNSCR 1373 designations and also to demonstrate an increase in money laundering investigations and prosecutions and that "proceeds of crime continue to be restrained and confiscated in line with Pakistan's risk profile, including working with foreign counterparts to trace, freeze, and confiscate assets".

---||World||US report on Pentagon-documented UFOs leaves sightings unexplained||A major US government report on UFOs released on Friday said defense and intelligence analysts lack sufficient data to determine the nature of mysterious flying objects observed by military pilots including whether they are advanced earthly technologies, atmospherics or of an extraterrestrial nature. The report, submitted to Congress and released to the public, encompasses 144 observations of what the government officially refers to as "unidentified aerial phenomenon," or UAP, dating back to 2004. It was issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in conjunction with a US Navy-led UAP task force. The report includes some UAP cases that previously came to light in the Pentagon's release of video from US naval aviators showing enigmatic aircraft off the US East and West Coasts exhibiting speed and maneuverability exceeding known aviation technologies and lacking any visible means of propulsion or flight-control surfaces. A senior US official, asked about the possibility of extraterrestrial explanations for the observations, said: "That's not the purpose of the task force, to evaluate any sort of search for extraterrestrial life. ... That's not what we were charged with doing." "Of the 144 reports we are dealing with here, we have no clear indications that there is any non-terrestrial explanation for them – but we will go wherever the data takes us," the official added. All but one of them, an instance attributed to "airborne clutter," remain unexplained, subject to further analysis, US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters during a briefing describing the report's findings. For the remaining 143 cases, the government has yet to rule in or out whether the sightings might be of extraterrestrial origin, the officials said. Likewise, the task force lacks enough evidence to conclude whether any of those incidents represented some exotic aerial system developed either by a US government or commercial entity, or by a foreign power, according to the officials. "Of data we have, we don't have any clear indications that any of these unidentified aerial phenomena are part of a foreign (intelligence) collection program, and we don't have any clear data that is indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary," the senior official said. "We continue to put a lot of effort and energy into tracking those types of developments, and we watch that very carefully. Nothing in this data set clearly points us into that direction," the official added. The government in recent years has adopted UAP as its preferred term for what are otherwise known as "unidentified flying objects," or UFOs, long associated with the notion of alien spacecraft. A second senior official said that 21 of the reports show UAPs "that appear to have some sort of advanced propulsion or advanced technology," and appear to lack any means of propulsion or acceleration and exhibit speeds beyond what the United States believes foreign adversaries possess. The report was ordered by Congress as part of broader intelligence legislation signed by former President Donald Trump in December. Senator Marco Rubio was instrumental in commissioning it. The report marks a turning point for the US government after the military spent decades deflecting, debunking and discrediting observations of unidentified flying objects and "flying saucers" backing back to the 1940s. "Anytime there is a safety-of-flight or counterintelligence concern we take those things very seriously and we will continue to take those things seriously," the first senior official said. The second senior official added, "Our approach has been driven by science and data." A number of naval aviators have come forward in recent years to discuss their observations of UAPs with documentary filmmakers and news organizations including Reuters. "A lot of the work that the task force has done to date has been on the de-stigmatization issue, ensuring that those who observe unidentified things are comfortable reporting that and that it's clear how they should report that," the first official said. "I think DoD (the Department of Defense) has made very significant strides in recent months in getting the message out on that." It is not the first official US government report on the subject. For example, the US Air Force carried out a previous UFO investigation called Project Blue Book https://www.archives.gov/research/military/air-force/ufos#geninfo, ended in 1969, that compiled a list of 12,618 sightings, 701 of which involved objects that officially remained "unidentified." In 1994, the Air Force announced that it had completed a study to locate records relating to the 1947 "Roswell incident" in New Mexico. It said materials recovered near Roswell were consistent with a crashed balloon, the military's long-standing explanation, and that no records indicated that there had been the recovery of alien bodies or extraterrestrial materials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-report-on-pentagon-documented-ufos-leaves-sightings-unexplained/articleshow/83859574.cms||---

This includes Navi Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur and Pune. The move came even as the state reported its first death from the variant. The government has effectively done away with the first two levels of unlocking - level 1 and 2 - that offered the most relaxations, citing the potential threat of an "imminent" third wave which is expected to be "more severe", according to an order by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday. Read AlsoWhy cases spiked in 15 Maharashtra districts after the lockdownSame old story – people flouting lockdown norms; big weddings; birthday parties; home isolations leading to entire families testing positiveThis does not change anything for Mumbai though, which is at level 3 despite being eligible for level 1. All districts and cities in level 1 or 2 will slip to 3. Irrespective of indicators like weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy, unlocking will now be only at three levels, starting with 3 at the easiest and going up to level 5. Those at level 4 and 5 will continue to face the restrictions applicable. Most cities in MMR will be at level 3, except places in Raigad district which were at 4 last week. Going by indicators last week, there were 25 districts in the state eligible for level 1, 8 at level 3 and 3 at level 4. “This revision has been done in the wake of the emergence of the Delta plus variant and the advisory received from the Centre,” said Aseem Gupta, relief and rehabilitation secretary. Read AlsoWith people flouting Covid norms, Maharashtra CM asks administration to prepare for lockdownMUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday asked senior health officials to prepare for restrictions "similar to lockdown" if people continue to flout Covid norms in the state. Maharashtra on Sunday recorded its highest ever single-day spike of 40,414 Covid-19 cases. Mumbai, too,The order says new variants like Delta, Delta plus may precipitate a more severe third wave in 4-6 weeks across a wider geographical area. So far, 21 cases of the Delta plus variant have been reported from the state. “A big problem this time was that the public was just not cooperating. Crowding, no adherence to health norms were being reported on a large scale,” said an official. To make the mechanism stricter, the government will allow ranking to shift to an easier level only after a declining trend is observed for two weeks. Earlier, decisions were based on a week’s data. However, to tighten, a twoweek period may not be considered and districts will not require permission from the government to impose fresh restrictions. Read AlsoDelta+ has been lurking in Maharashtra for over 2 months nowA man in his late 70s, a milk dealer’s wife, an electrician who attended a big wedding, two jewellers who travelled to Surat and a teacher in his mid-50s are among the 21 people who were infected by the Delta-plus variant of Sars-Cov-2 in Maharashtra. Some of these cases were detected as early asAlso, to determine the weekly positivity rate, only RT-PCR tests will be taken into account and not antigen or other tests, which throw up more false negatives. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said the revision in guidelines is not surprising. “The five-point formula to unlock is a dynamic process… at the moment, cases are coming down but not fast enough.

---||World||UN envoy calls for new international talks on Syrian war||UNITED NATIONS: With no progress toward ending the 10-year Syrian conflict, the UN special envoy for Syria called Friday for new international talks on concrete steps like exchanging prisoners and a nationwide cease-fire that the government and opposition could agree on as initial steps to give impetus to a political solution. Geir Pedersen told the UN Security Council he believes these and other areas "of vital concern for average Syrians'' have the potential to achieve common ground among Syria's warring parties. Progress would also "promote internal and regional stability and build trust and confidence,'' he said. "This will not be easy," Pedersen said, But he said he senses that all key players are interested in deepening talks on a way ahead, which is why "we need a new constructive international dialogue on Syria." Pedersen said he has been in regular contact with senior officials from Russia, a close Syria ally, and the United States, which supports the opposition, before and since this month's meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden,. He said he has also been in regular contact with many countries on the 15-member Security Council and key states in the region. Pedersen said he will go to Rome to talk with foreign ministers at a meeting on Syria convened by Italy and the United States and soon after that, he will head to Moscow. He also plans to consult Turkey and Iran -- the guarantor states along with Russia in the so-called "Astana process'' aimed at ending fighting in Syria -- ahead of an Astana group meeting in Kazakhstan's capital in early July. After this round of meetings, Pedersen said, he hopes to provide more details. In response to a question afterward on when he might launch a new international dialogue, he said, "I hope we are not talking about too many weeks.'' Since the Syrian conflict erupted in February 2011, there have been many high-level gatherings designed to stop the fighting and guide the country to a political transition. Locations included Istanbul, Paris, Rome, Vienna, and Geneva and included assemblies with names such as "Friends of Syria'' and the "London 11.'' In 2016, it was the "International Syria Support Group.'' None has made a lasting impact. Pedersen told reporters he thinks this might be the right time to try to launch international talks because "there are a few very important developments.'' He pointed most importantly to the 15 months of relative calm on the ground in Syria, but stressed that ``it is a very fragile calm, and we need to discuss how we can make sure that this does not break down.'' He also cited the collapse of Syria's economy, the lack of movement on releasing detainees and abductees and accounting for missing persons, and the millions of Syrians forced to flee their homes. Warning that the relative calm remains fragile, Pedersen told the council there were "alarming signs of escalation'' in the June 12 rocket attack and shelling of the al-Shifaa Hospital in the northern Syrian town of Afrin controlled by Turkey-backed fighters that killed at least 13 people, including medical personnel, and destroyed parts of the hospital. He also cited airstrikes and shelling in the south of rebel-held Idlib resulting in casualties and more displacement. "Elsewhere, this month has seen more airstrikes attributed to Israel, more turbulence in the southwest'' and more attacks by terrorist groups including operations claimed by the Islamic State extremist group, he said. Pedersen said there are worrying signs the Islamic State extremist group may be getting stronger, "given the increased frequency and reach of its latest attacks.'' He urged key international players to cooperate on countering IS and other terrorist groups. "Recovering from the economic impact that most Syrians face after a decade of war and devastation is another area of potential common focus,'' Pedersen said. He said all sides, Syrian and international, say the action is needed on detainees, abductees, and the missing, adding that the UN has recently engaged the Syrian government on this issue. "I believe a step-for-steps discussion could help unlock more serious progress,'' he said. Pedersen also urged the international community to focus on the 13 million Syrians forced to flee their homes within Syria and abroad, half the country's pre-war population. "This is a profound humanitarian and national tragedy and also a ticking time-bomb for regional stability,'' he warned. "These are the kinds of issues, and there may be others too, that I believe could be seriously discussed," Pedersen said, "and where mutual and reciprocal actions could begin to make a positive difference for Syrians and give impetus to a political process.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/un-envoy-calls-for-new-international-talks-on-syrian-war/articleshow/83860342.cms||---

He said he has also been in regular contact with many countries on the 15-member Security Council and key states in the region. Pedersen said he will go to Rome to talk with foreign ministers at a meeting on Syria convened by Italy and the United States and soon after that, he will head to Moscow. He also plans to consult Turkey and Iran -- the guarantor states along with Russia in the so-called "Astana process'' aimed at ending fighting in Syria -- ahead of an Astana group meeting in Kazakhstan's capital in early July. After this round of meetings, Pedersen said, he hopes to provide more details. In response to a question afterward on when he might launch a new international dialogue, he said, "I hope we are not talking about too many weeks.'' Since the Syrian conflict erupted in February 2011, there have been many high-level gatherings designed to stop the fighting and guide the country to a political transition. Locations included Istanbul, Paris, Rome, Vienna, and Geneva and included assemblies with names such as "Friends of Syria'' and the "London 11.'' In 2016, it was the "International Syria Support Group.'' None has made a lasting impact. Pedersen told reporters he thinks this might be the right time to try to launch international talks because "there are a few very important developments.'' He pointed most importantly to the 15 months of relative calm on the ground in Syria, but stressed that ``it is a very fragile calm, and we need to discuss how we can make sure that this does not break down.'' He also cited the collapse of Syria's economy, the lack of movement on releasing detainees and abductees and accounting for missing persons, and the millions of Syrians forced to flee their homes. Warning that the relative calm remains fragile, Pedersen told the council there were "alarming signs of escalation'' in the June 12 rocket attack and shelling of the al-Shifaa Hospital in the northern Syrian town of Afrin controlled by Turkey-backed fighters that killed at least 13 people, including medical personnel, and destroyed parts of the hospital. He also cited airstrikes and shelling in the south of rebel-held Idlib resulting in casualties and more displacement. "Elsewhere, this month has seen more airstrikes attributed to Israel, more turbulence in the southwest'' and more attacks by terrorist groups including operations claimed by the Islamic State extremist group, he said. Pedersen said there are worrying signs the Islamic State extremist group may be getting stronger, "given the increased frequency and reach of its latest attacks.'' He urged key international players to cooperate on countering IS and other terrorist groups. "Recovering from the economic impact that most Syrians face after a decade of war and devastation is another area of potential common focus,'' Pedersen said. He said all sides, Syrian and international, say the action is needed on detainees, abductees, and the missing, adding that the UN has recently engaged the Syrian government on this issue. "I believe a step-for-steps discussion could help unlock more serious progress,'' he said. Pedersen also urged the international community to focus on the 13 million Syrians forced to flee their homes within Syria and abroad, half the country's pre-war population. "This is a profound humanitarian and national tragedy and also a ticking time-bomb for regional stability,'' he warned. "These are the kinds of issues, and there may be others too, that I believe could be seriously discussed," Pedersen said, "and where mutual and reciprocal actions could begin to make a positive difference for Syrians and give impetus to a political process.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/un-envoy-calls-for-new-international-talks-on-syrian-war/articleshow/83859906.cms||---

The talks took place under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC). An official statement said, "The two sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through the diplomatic and military mechanisms to reach a mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement from all friction points so as to ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity to enable progress in the bilateral relations." China has refused to ease up its deployment of troops in eastern Ladakh while India has refused to move the bilateral relationship without a full disengagement in the border areas. Agreeing to ensure stability on the ground and prevent any untoward incident, the two sides decided to hold the next (12th) round of the senior commanders' meeting (military talks) at an early date "to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all the friction points along the LAC in the western sector in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols". In response to questions on Thursday, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said, "It has been the Chinese actions over the last year, including amassing of a large number of troops close to border areas in the western sector, and trying to unilaterally alter the status quo along the LAC, which have seriously disturbed peace and tranquillity in the border areas." Bagchi asserted that China's actions were in "violation of our bilateral agreements, including the 1993 and 1996 agreements that mandate that the two sides shall strictly respect and observe the Line of Actual Control and that two sides will keep their military forces in the areas along the Line of Actual Control to a minimum level". Addressing the Qatar Economic Forum earlier this week, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar pointed out that troop deployments continue in eastern Ladakh and added, "The issue is whether China will live up to the written commitments which are made about both countries not deploying a large armed force at the border."

He shared the collage posted by BJP on Instagram with the remarks, "Can you believe what all were banned by the Congress during Emergency? A throwback to the darkest phase in India's democratic history". In its Instagram post, BJP said movies on Chandrashekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh, songs of Kishore Kumar, quotes of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore had been banned by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/can-you-believe-what-all-were-banned-in-1975-prime-minister-modi-shares-bjp-post-on-emergency/articleshow/83860668.cms||---
---||Business||In Covid year, banks see record profit of Rs 1 lakh crore||MUMBAI: The banking sector has recorded its highest ever profits of 1,02,252 crore in FY21, a year when the economy was battered by the pandemic. This is a significant turnaround compared to a net loss of nearly 5,000 crore for the industry in FY19. Two banks - HDFC Bank and SBI - contributed half of the industry's profits. Of the total profits, HDFC Bank at 31,116 crore accounted for 30%, an 18% increase over the previous year. The country's largest lender SBI accounted for another 20% at 20,410 crore. The third-highest was ICICI Bank, which earned 16,192 crore, more than double what it earned in the previous year. Private banks also gained market share as public sector banks (PSBs) went slow in lending. The biggest turnaround was among PSBs which reported a collective net profit for the first time in five years. Only two of the 12 PSU banks - Punjab & Sind Bank and Central Bank of India - reported a net loss for the year. In the private sector, Yes Bank remained in the red with a net loss of 3,462 crore as it continued to make provisions. However, for banks in the red, the losses were lesser than what they reported in the previous year. The single biggest reason for PSBs to post such a 57,832-crore turnaround - from a loss of 26,015 crore in FY20 to a combined profit of 31,817 crore - was the end of their legacy bad loan problem. This burden reached a peak after the RBI forced banks to classify 12 large defaulting accounts, followed by another 40 accounts, as non-performing assets and initiate bankruptcy proceedings. Given the size of these exposures, the move resulted in loans worth 4 lakh crore turning bad. By March 2020, banks had completed making provisions for most of these loans. Additional provisions were offset by large recoveries from earlier written-off accounts, and banks stopped bleeding. According to rating agency ICRA, the profits for the current year were the windfall gains on bond portfolios of public banks account, which contributed two-thirds of their profits before tax in FY21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-covid-year-banks-see-record-profit-of-rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/83860739.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Bihar's former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey turns ‘religious preacher’||PATNA: Former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey has, of late, developed a penchant for “katha vachan (religious preaching)”. Pandey, a 1987-batch IPS officer, appeared in a live show on a digital platform on Thursday to narrate the story of lord Krishna based on “Shrimad Bhagwat Gita”. The one-hour show, which started at 2pm, will be held every day. Those who want to connect with the live show have been issued the related link or ID. The former top cop turned to religious preaching after getting disenchanted with active politics. Pandey was inducted into JD(U) soon after he opted for voluntary retirement from the post of DGP in September last year ahead of the state assembly elections in the state. Born in a Brahmin family at Gerua village in Buxar district, Pandey completed his higher education from Patna University before being selected in the Indian Police Service (IPS). A scholar of Sanskrit, Pandey earlier used to attend religious congregation and regale the audience with his oratory on “adhyatma (religion)”. He is also a good playback singer and an album of religious songs is to his credit. Ahead of the state assembly polls, a song on Pandey, composed by ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’ fame Bollywood singer Deepak Thakur, was a big hit. The song –‘Robinhood Bihar Ke’ had created a buzz in political circles. The people of Muzaffarpur recalled how Pandey devoted his valuable time to manage a huge rush of kanwariyas in the month of Shravan during his posting as DIG and IG of Tirhut range. “He often used to narrate the story of deities at the famous Garib Sthan temple in Muzaffarpur. He was widely appreciated for initiating welfare measures for the devotees,” said Pramod Kumar, a Muzaffarpur-based social activist. Pandey used to visit the Shiva temple, commonly known as Hariharnath Mandir, near Sonepur in Saran district frequently. In 2009, he had hogged the limelight by opting VRS to contest the Lok Sabha election from Buxar. Having denied ticket by the BJP, he returned to the IPS almost after seven months and served as IG and ADG (headquarters) before being promoted as DGP. What’s interesting is that he gives tips to people about relevant sections of IPC during his religious discourses. “I like Pandey’s ‘katha vachan’ as he cites examples from day-to-day happenings to explain a difficult context,” said one Devendra Nath Choubey.

They fail to realise the rationale behind frequent changes in the interval between two shots of the vaccine. Quinquagenarian Manoj Kumar, who received his first dose of Covishield in March, was expecting to get the second dose in May, but he was informed that he would have to wait till July. “Will the increased gap between two doses not reduce the efficacy of the vaccine?” he asks. Amid so much confusion, 22-year-old Rashmi Priya has not yet been inoculated. She claims, “I have come to know that I will have to wait at the vaccination centre for several hours to get my first dose of vaccine. By the time I receive the second dose, I may even test positive for Covid-19.” A few people point out that the gap between two doses of Covishield has been increasing only because of a “shortage of the vaccine”. Health experts, on the other hand, justify the increase in the gap, saying that the vaccine provides safety no matter when its two doses are taken. The joint director of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology, Dr A K Ashu, says, “The Covid-19 vaccines are still evolving and are in an experimental stage. With a gradual progress in studies, the interval between the two doses will change.” He adds, “The behaviour pattern of different vaccines varies at different levels, but it has been observed that the greater the interval between the doses, the higher will be the efficacy. If the gap between the two shots is increased, most people may not require the booster dose.” Quoting different studies, Muzaffarpur-based paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah, says, “It has been revealed that by increasing the interval between two doses, the efficacy of the vaccine is nearly 81%.” The head of the zoology department in Patna University, Arbind Kumar, also observes that the success of the Covid-19 vaccines can be evaluated only after detailed studies over a period of time. “If there are enough doses available, the second shot should be given at the optimal time because it will ensure people’s safety,” he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-bigger-gap-between-2-doses-of-vaccine-means-higher-efficacy/articleshow/83849355.cms||B K Mishra

It was through Eight O’clock that Tata Consumer entered the US java market, and since then it has remained a prized feather in the Indian company’s cap. Eight O’clock will debut in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) model next week, Chandrasekaran said. Tata Consumer CEO Sunil D’Souza told TOI that Eight O’clock will be launched on “our own exclusive website” and later sold on other online platforms. The company recently started launching brands in the D2C model as the Covid pandemic has boosted online shopping. Sonnets was introduced as a D2C/online-first coffee brand. An internet search shows Eight O’clock’s price at Rs 1,202 for a 680gm pack, but D’Souza said that’s the pricing by traders. “Our own product pricing will be more competitive.” Harish Bijoor, founder of Harish Bijoor Consults and a former Tata Consumer executive, welcomed the launch of Eight O’clock in India. “Coffee culture in India today is very evolved as opposed to the early days of my efforts to promote coffee in India,” said Bijoor, who, prior to setting up his own brand consultancy firm, was in charge of marketing Tata Consumer’s coffee portfolio from 1993 to 2001. “Today, coffee is both liquid and solid in India. The liquid that flows through our cafe chains and vending machines at offices, and the solid that moves through retail outlets as roast & ground and soluble coffees. Indian consumers want to explore a lot more than just coffee and chicory. And Eight O’clock offers that ‘more’,” Bijoor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-to-launch-coffee-brand-eight-oclock/articleshow/83854461.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The bank is meeting the challenges by increasing its focus on digital and maintaining momentum on stressed asset recovery. Addressing shareholders at SBI’s annual general meeting, Khara said that the bank has already achieved a high level of digitisation with the share of alternate channels going up to 93% from 91% last year. “In the current financial year, the bank will continue to accelerate its digital agenda,” said Khara. This involves increasing the scope and reach of Yono. For individual borrowers, Yono now has pre-approved personal loans, pre-approved pension loan, and insta top-up for express credit. For businesses, the Yono platform will soon provide a fully digital trade finance solution. On stressed assets, shareholders sought information on how much SBI stands to recover as a result of the enforcement action on Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. But the bank did not provide any specific number. “We also embraced digital readiness to meet our customers virtually and organised over 800 e-townhall meetings for our MSME clientele,” he said. Khara said that with 1.8 crore followers on Facebook and 42 lakh followers on Twitter, the bank had the biggest social media presence among lenders globally. The bank will also provide doorstep banking for customers who cannot visit the branch and this will include 10 services like the launch of the doorstep-like account statement, cash withdrawal facility, and life certificate submission for pensioners. In the branch, the bank has introduced the concept of floor managers in over 2,400 branches for superior customer experience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/second-wave-to-hit-economy-despite-localised-curbs-sbi/articleshow/83854990.cms||---

The rating agency added that barring SBI, profit from the sale of bonds exceeded the pre-tax profits of all other public banks. The profit from bond sales was higher than the Rs 20,000-crore capital infused by the government in FY21. The value of government bonds rises when interest rates fall. The RBI’s aggressive move to keep rates low has reduced interest income but provided huge gains in treasury income. The year 2020-21 was also a year of consolidation for the 10 public sector banks that merged into four. Last year, the merging entities recorded huge losses in the fourth quarter before the merger, which contributed to the Rs 26,015-crore loss among PSU banks in FY20. This year, the acquiring banks made profits with Indian Bank topping the list at Rs 3,004 crore followed by Union Bank at Rs 2,905 crore. The impact of the pandemic is not yet reflected in the balance sheets of the banks as lenders have been allowed to restructure loans of defaulters. In the second wave, the RBI allowed banks to give stressed borrowers one more year to repay. Given that large corporate accounts are not affected, banks do not expect defaults on account of the pandemic to trigger losses in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-covid-year-banks-see-record-profit-of-rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/83854704.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Panchayat election in Bihar likely after monsoon||PATNA: The State Election Commission (SEC) has decided to initiate the process of physical verification of identified polling booths after floodwaters recede in the panchayats going to polls later this year. “We are in the process of issuing directives to the districts to start physical verification of polling booths under their jurisdiction after floodwaters start receding,” a senior SEC official said on Friday. Around 1.20 lakh polling booths were earlier identified for the panchayat polls to fill 2.58 lakh posts in three-tier panchayati raj institutions in the state. The elections scheduled to be held in March-April were put to hold apparently due to inordinate delay in finalising the deal related to use of EVMs in the panchayat polls and second wave of conoravirus that hit the state adversely. “As monsoon entered the state on time this year, we had no option but to defer the election. If things move on the expected lines, the process of election will start in September-October,” another SEC official told this newspaper. Around 30 districts are affected by floods every year. Sources said more than 300 panchayats in those districts remained submerged with floodwaters for a long time, making the task difficult for the officials to hold elections. Meanwhile, the state panchayati raj department has sent a proposal to the SEC, requesting it to allow the candidates to contest the panchayat election only after vaccination. Panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary said, “We have urged the SEC to make vaccination mandatory for the contestants. A guideline should be issued by the commission before the next panchayat polls.” As the tenure of panchayat members expired on June 16, the state government has set up panchayat consultative committees to look after the development works. The committees will monitor the works undertaken by panchayats in the state till new members are elected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/panchayat-election-likely-after-monsoon/articleshow/83850660.cms||Ramashankar

IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the Covid-related proposals cover a wide area, including the incidents of black fungus cases, efficacy in treatment and antibody development. Psychiatry department head Dr Rajesh Kumar would investigate the level of immunity in healthcare workers developed after immunisation by the Covid vaccines and also in the un-vaccinated but Covid patients. Another topic is to examine the various symptoms seen in post-Covid patients later being diagnosed with black fungus causing the deadly disease of mucormycosis. Dr Sanjay Kumar, head of the community medicine, would try to find out the level of authenticity between RT-PCR and HRCT tests for Covid infection in lungs. The impact of Covid on the lever functioning is another topic getting nod for research.

The 1985-batch Bihar cadre IAS officer was scheduled to retire from the government job on June 30 this year on completion of 60 years of age. Now, his service period has been extended till September 30, 2021. “The service of Triapurari Sharan, chief secretary of Bihar, is being extended for three months (from July 01, 2021 to September 30, 2021) under the Rule 16(1) of the All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958,” a notification issued by the state government’s general administration department reads. The central government’s department of personnel and training (DoPT) gave its consent to the service extension of Sharan on June 24, the notification said. Sharan was appointed as the state chief secretary on May 1 this year, a day after the sudden demise of his predecessor and batchmate Arun Kumar Singh due to Covid-19 infection on April 30 this year. However, the service extension granted to Sharan is not an isolated case in Bihar and Jharkhand. In fact, Sharan is the fourth chief secretary in Bihar to get service extension during the regime of CM Nitish Kumar. In Jharkhand, too, two chief secretaries were granted service extension since the creation of the state out of Bihar in November 2000. Earlier, former Bihar chief secretary Deepak Kumar was granted two service extensions of six months each (total of one year). Deepak, who took over as Bihar’s chief secretary on May 31, 2018, was scheduled to retire on February 29, 2020 after completing 60 years of age. But he retired from the job on February 29, 2021 due to a year-long extension granted to him. Deepak’s predecessor Anjani Kumar Singh (a 1982-batch Bihar cadre IAS officer) was also given service extension for a period of three months from March 1, 2018. Singh was earlier scheduled to retire on February 28, 2018. Resultantly, he retired from the post of chief secretary on May 31, 2018 after handing over the charge to Deepak. “Prior to Deepak and Singh, another chief secretary Ashok Kumar Choudhary (1972-batch) was granted service extension for three months from September 1, 2007. Choudhary was scheduled to retire on August 31, 2007. Ultimately, he retired on November 30, 2007,” a senior IAS officer told TOI on Friday. In Jharkhand, former chief secretary Sudhir Tripathi (1985-batch IAS officer of Jharkhand cadre) was given two service extensions of three months each by the Centre at the request of the then Raghubar Das government. “Initially, Tripathi was scheduled to retire on September 30, 2018, but got service extension of three months from October 1 to December 31, 2018. Again, he was granted another extension for a period of three months from January 1 to March 31, 2019,” a Jharkhand cadre IAS officer told TOI. Prior to Tripathi, another Jharkhand chief secretary G Krishnan, who was scheduled to retire from the post on December 31, 2002, was granted service extension of three months from January 1 to March 31, 2003, the Jharkhand officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-chief-secretary-given-3-month-service-extension/articleshow/83849574.cms||Madan Kumar

Sources said his health and the Covid-19 pandemic are the reasons why Lalu will not be physically present in Patna on the occasion of RJD’s 25th foundation day on July 5. “Lalu ji will be addressing all the party members from Delhi because of his health issue, mainly related to kidney. From his water intake to liquid food he takes, everything is measured and given. He had earlier undergone heart surgery. Right now he is being monitored by doctors on a regular basis and moving out from Delhi is little difficult,” said a senior party member. Former MLA and Lalu’s close aide Bhola Yadav said, “We are very happy and eager to listen to him. We hope he will recover soon and be amidst us. Lalu ji is a mass leader and being with the people will cure him faster. That will give him more happiness and he will forget his pain.” Bhola further said a two-day programme has been planned for the foundation day. On July 4, there will be a virtual meeting of party’s MLAs and MPs followed by a virtual meeting of all the party members on July 5. Lalu will address both the meetings. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said preparations were going on even at the block level, especially for the main event on July 5. “Party’s state president Jagdanand Singh, leader of opposition Tejashwi ji and other senior party leaders will be present at the RJD office,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-to-address-legislators-workers-on-rjd-foundation-day/articleshow/83849650.cms||Sheezan Nezami

ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said the move would help many people waiting to reach their workplaces. “There are people in the state who wish to travel to other states to seek better medical treatment. The proposed long-distance mail and express special passenger trains will prove a boon for such,” the CPRO said. He added during pre-Covid period, railways was running 1,768 mail and express passenger trains daily across the country and the number has now come down to 983. The CPRO said the ECR alone was running 274 mail and express passenger trains daily during pre-Covid days from its five divisions. Besides, 389 local passenger trains, including MEMUs and DEMUs, were running on different routes. “The strength of passenger trains was reduced to half due to the pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ecr-gets-nod-to-run-18-more-trains/articleshow/83850925.cms||Kumod Verma

The Kolkata Municipal Corporation is also drawing up a list of the roads that need to be repaired and they are expected to begin work soon. The authorities have already conducted a patchwork on both the flanks of the Bypass stretch near Ruby crossing and VIP Bazar junction to fill up the potholes. “This is the routine patchwork that is being done to fill up the potholes and rough patches that appear on the Bypass stretch due to heavy rains. The patchwork of the other such spots will also be done,” said a KMDA official. The problem of potholes resurfacing on the EM Bypass stretch, especially the areas between the under construction Metro stations, has been a cause of constant worry for the KMDA authorities. The conditions of these stretches deteriorate each year after heavy rain during monsoons and motorists face immense problems.  The KMDA engineers said the sub-base of the road surface at these places has become weak due to additional pressure created by setting up concrete slabs over a period of time. “The barricades placed to divert the lanes resulted in additional vehicular pressure and with the sub-base already compromised, this creates an undulation on the surface during heavy rains, resulting the bituminous surface to crack and create the potholes,” said a KMDA engineer. KMDA is also going to engage an agency for repair, restoration and annual maintenance of the entire EM Bypass road surface for a yearly basis. KMC has drawn up a list of roads ravaged by rains. Earlier, TOI had highlighted the sorry state of city’s major thoroughfares. Some of these thoroughfares include R. G Kar Road, Chittaranjan Avenue, M.

Not only that, there are people who got messages about completion of their Covid-19 vaccination, though they did not get even the first dose. After taking the first jab, several residents complained that their names have neither been registered in the CoWIN software nor did they receive any certificate, causing difficulty in getting their second dose. Rajeev Sinha of Gardanibagh took his first jab at PHC in his locality, but was not sure whether he got Covishield or Covaxin. “I have taken the first dose of vaccine with my wife in April. As per health workers at Gardanibagh PHC, we were administered Covishield and we also received the receipt for the same. But the message arrived recently on registered mobile number and downloaded certificate show Covaxin,” he said. He added: “This kind of error is sheer negligence leading to harassment of citizens. The government should pay attention to such errors. There should be some provisions to rectify these errors as well.” Kunal Kishore was quite irritated by repeated calls for vaccine, even though he had taken both the shots at Mahavir Arogya Sansthan in March. “But the CoWIN application shows only one dose. I have contacted the vaccine centre as well as the civil surgeon, but no correction has been made yet,” he said. Ajay Kumar Anand received his first dose of Covisheild in mid-May, but recently got the message from the vaccine centre that he was administered Covaxin. Such errors and glitches have left the beneficiaries confused as the gap between first and second dose of Covisheild and Covaxin is different. For Covaxin, the second dose should be taken after 4 to 6 weeks whereas the second dose of Covishield is given almost after 12 weeks of the first shot. Aditi Sinha of Patliputra Colony alleged that even after two months, her mother did not receive the certificate for the first dose. “My father and mother took the first jab of Covishield at Medipark Hospital, in April, buy my mother has neither received certificate for the first dose from the hospital, nor her first vaccination is updated on the CoWin portal even after making multiple rounds to the hospital. Due to this, we haven’t been able to schedule her second dose which is due for June 29,” she said. One Shantanu Kumar (38) said he received an SMS and vaccine certificate in May without even getting his first dose of vaccination. “I was supposed to take the vaccine on May 6, but the scheduled slot was cancelled due to some reasons. Later, I got the message that I was vaccinated with first dose of Covishield,” he said. A resident of Ashiana Nagar, Kalyani said she took her first dose of Covaxin in April and failed to take the second dose as some of her family members had tested positive. “I received a message on June 15 around 3.17pm on my mobile phone that my vaccination has been completed. Now I have the final vaccination certificate without getting the second dose,” she said. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh admitted that she received several complaints regarding wrong information about vaccine in vaccination certificate and other errors. “These mistakes will be corrected at the vaccine centre from where the person had taken the jab. There are also some glitches in the CoWIN software as people are getting the certificate without taking a jab. People can make corrections on this application using their registration number,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wrong-info-vaccination-messages-irk-beneficiaries/articleshow/83849259.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Mumbai||With memorial tattoos, bereaved wear their love for those lost on their sleeve||On June 3 this year, 10 months after Covid claimed her, Madhu Madan appeared in her son Kapil’s dream. Madhu was wearing her favourite blue salwar kameez, but she drifted away into the distance when Kapil alighted from a Haryana train to rush towards her. For 34-year-old Kapil, a Delhi lawyer and national convenor of Indian Youth Congress, the memo was loud and clear. The next morning, he called up a tattoo artist and told him to copy a framed picture of his 61-year-old altruistic mother on his arm. “Now I don’t have to open any gadgets when I want to see her,” he says, resting his case. While such memorial tattoos are not a recent phenomenon, the gloomy backdrop of loss and isolation due to the pandemic is steadily reinstating inked tributes back into relevance. Subject to the same protocol as salons and spas, independent tattoo parlours, which are hobbling their way back to normalcy across cities, are seeing young grievers brave Covid threat to extend their arms for a needle that does not build antibodies. “Many called me up for memorial portraits during peak lockdown in Delhi last month when the virus threat was very high,” says Gupt Ram Verma, who runs a tattoo studio in the capital and had to politely decline as he was in his hometown, Himachal Pradesh. At Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per tattoo, portrait tattoos can be expensive, but concessions are made for circumstances and emotions. Two weeks ago, when the youngest of three siblings dropped by at his Delhi studio from Jammu with a small old picture of his deceased mother from her marriage album, artist Abhishek Ahuja not only gave him a discount but also used an AI-powered software to restore the time-worn image to “99% accuracy”. Recently, when a young bereaved husband broke down halfway through the portrait of his wife, Ahuja quietly went about his job. “We don’t probe clients for their stories,” says the tattoo artist. “It can be triggering for them.” This is also why Delhi tattoo artist Max, who has been getting calls for memorial tattoos from as far as Rajasthan and Punjab, advises clients against portraits of deceased loved ones. “Seeing the face can be painful at times. So we usually ask them to go in for something symbolic of the person,” says Max, who recently drew a hibiscus on the arm of a bereaved son from Delhi who was steeped in regret for not spending enough time with his flower-loving mother whom he lost to Covid in the second wave. “He had travelled abroad and then to Goa after the first lockdown was lifted,” says Max. Two wings soar at the back of Charni Road-based teacher Kiran Kaushik’s neck as a reminder of her 28-year-old friend Tanveer, who left a deep, sudden void in her life when he met with a fatal accident in November 2020. “I didn’t even get to say goodbye,” says Kiran, who thought her friends were playing a prank on her when they conveyed to her the news of Tanveer’s sudden demise. Kiran’s parents, too, had wept when she called up his sisters and they confirmed that they had returned from his cremation. Kiran took home Tanveer’s bag and clothes as mementos. “But I wanted something permanent and purely mine,” says Kiran, whose lack of closure conspired with her lockdown-induced loneliness to make her approach her go-to artist Rohit Patil on her birthday on May 4 with the request for a “feminine variation of David Beckham’s back tattoo”. “He (Tanveer) had wanted to get the Beckham tattoo,” says Kiran. Though she hasn’t fully accepted the loss that came soon after the demise of both her grandmother and her maasi, “the tattoo makes me feel that he is around, looking out for me”, she says. A similar sentiment makes Vibhuti Malani use the present tense while referring to her father. On February 12 this year, when her parents would’ve completed their 41st wedding anniversary, Vibhuti made her elder brother Mickey, along with another senior tattoo artist Shyam Gaikwad, copy the immaculate signature from her father’s cancelled cheque. Besides his watch and his long-standing reading glasses, the tattoo is another analog reassurance of the lingering presence of her father, the foodie and jolly Govinda fan who had played both mother and father before succumbing to cancer in 2018. Vibhuti, the youngest of three siblings who lost their mother at a young age, has recently seen pandemic-induced fear of loss make some clients record the heartbeat of parents to get the resulting graph tattooed on their arms. “We all want our parents to be around forever,” says Vibhuti, even as Andheri’s 33-year-old Dharmesh Kuvadia, who makes his one-year-old daughter kiss his deceased mother’s photo daily, is searching for a symbol for ‘Infinity’. Soon, Kuvadia will walk up to Bandra-based tattoo artist Al and get the word ‘Mumma’ etched onto his wrist along with the symbol. On his other wrist is a tattoo dedicated to his daughter which is special because it had the approval of his mother—his 56-year-old go-to companion for Hindi-dubbed Hollywood horror movies who succumbed to a heart attack in April this year. “I could never reciprocate her love,” regrets the banker, recalling the homemaker who would not only keep his workdesk preemptively ready during his WFH schedule but also taught him exam hacks that have seeped into his veins, like a permanent tattoo. “She used to answer the first and the last questions well,” says the banker, who performs well in the first and the last quarter of the financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-memorial-tattoos-bereaved-wear-their-love-for-those-lost-on-their-sleeve/articleshow/83881125.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

Vishal was wanted in several cases, including those of murder bid, dacoity and under the Arms Act. To date, police have arrested 19 accused, while 28 are at large. Besides Vishal, Billa Bori and Deepak Dhaliwal have been arrested. Additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Pragya Jain said, “Eighteen accused were arrested by Division 3 police and one by Tibba cops. Baseball bats, iron rods and sharp-edged weapons were recovered from their possession.” The Delhi police had recently arrested two accused, Karan Walia and Raja Bajaj, who were also wanted by Ludhiana police in these cases. Weapons and ammunition were recovered from them. The two groups’ kingpins, Puneet Bains and Shubham Mota, are lodged in Ludhiana Central Jail. Their aides were involved in the clashes. Days ago, they had fought and created nuisance in Old City areas by vandalising cars of residents. The police had lodged four FIRs in these cases. Assistant commissioner of police (east) Devinder Chaudhary said, “The police had brought Rishav Banipal, a close aide of Shubham, on production warrant from Ludhiana Central Jail. Rishav said the members of Puneet Bains gang had opened fire outside his house and brutally thrashed his friend Karan and so, he wanted to take a revenge.” Rishav confessed that he had sent his two aides, Raja and Karan, to Madhya Pradesh to get weapons. The two were caught by Delhi police while they were on their way to Ludhiana. The city police will bring both the accused on production warrant from Delhi on June 28. So far, the role of Shubham has not come up in these cases. The police will bring Shubham on production warrant only if his role is found in further probe, said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/3-more-held-in-series-of-clashes-in-old-city/articleshow/83849718.cms||---

The association took the decision after a meeting of its president with the deputy commissioner and the health officials. The CICU will also hold a three-day vaccination camp at its Focal Point headquarters, where beneficiaries will be jabbed free of cost. CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja said, “We need to learn from the past mistakes and not lower our guard against coronavirus. It is the need of the hour that we get ourselves and our near ones vaccinated at the earliest. As our workers are also a part of our family, it is our duty to protect them against Covid-19. A review meeting was held on the issue as workers and their families constitute a sizeable part of the city’s population. Even as a number of factory owners are already running vaccination drives at their units, much more needs to be done. The award aims at encouraging the cause.” The association will announce the competition details in the coming days. CICU general secretary Pankaj Sharma said, “We are taking several initiatives to get a large number of people from all walks of life vaccinated. For instance, we are organising a three-day vaccination camp at our Focal Point office from June 28 to June 30 in which first and second dose will be administered to those above the age of 18 years. We also plan to set up a permanent vaccination centre at our headquarters till the target of vaccinating majority of the population is achieved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cicu-to-award-first-20-factories-with-100-of-workers-vaccinated/articleshow/83849707.cms||---

In PharmEasy, we have about 80,000 pharmacies and 6,000 doctors, and only the diagnostics play was missing, which has now been completed with this deal.” API is the parent company of digital healthcare firm PharmEasy, founded by Dharmil Sheth, Dhaval Shah, Harsh Parekh, Hardik Dedhia and Siddharth Shah. The latest deal, in the making for over a month, was struck at 30x ebitda. “Over the last year, we have created our diagnostics business worth Rs 75 crore, and wanted to build on it. Over the next 18 months, we plan to add growth to the diagnostics business, and reach our unified services to each pincode in the country,” he said, adding Thyrocare — with its 4,000 lab partners and a pan-India network — was the best fit. PharmEasy, with a gross merchandise value (GMV) of Rs 7,500 crore, claims to be the largest online pharmacy and diagnostics brand, RetailIO, and DocOn – a leading consultation and EMR platform. The company has a base of 12 million-plus consumers, a network of over 6,000 digital consultation clinics and around 90,000 pharmacies (retailers) across the country.

---||Business||Microsoft 2nd US co to hit $2tn mcap||Chidanand.Rajghatta@timesgroup.com Washington: Microsoft on Thursday became only the second US company after Apple to reach a $2-trillion valuation, sticking another feather in the cap of its Indian-American CEO Satya Nadella after he was appointed chairman of the company — only the second in its history after Bill Gates — last week. The Seattle giant joined the elite club — in which the third and only other member is Saudi Aramco — even as it unveiled its updated Windows 11 operating system amid a relentless run-up in technology stocks. Microsoft is trailed by Amazon and Google (both with market cap of $1.7 trillion) in the Trillion-dollar club, and its astonishing growth is largely credited to Nadella’s vision after he took over in 2014 when the company was considered moribund in many quarters. Microsoft’s valuation was less than $400 billion when Nadella became CEO in 2014, and its fivefold increase has been powered by venturing into new areas such as cloud computing and machine learning. While it took Microsoft 33 years to reach its first $1 trillion in 2019, more than doubling from the time Nadella became the head honcho, the next trillion has taken Microsoft only two years. To put its growth in perspective, its current valuation is 2/3rds the combined mcap of all Indian companies (currently at $3 trillion). The company has gained 20% this year alone, outperforming Apple and Amazon, and market mavens are declaring Nadella the #1 CEO in the US. CEOWorld magazine ranked him second behind JP Morgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon in 2020. Wall Street Journal referred to him as the “King of Microsoft.” Low-key and soft-spoken, the Hyderabad-born Nadella, who did his engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology, is a poetry and cricket enthusiast who makes light of his achievements while speaking in philosophical undertones, including, according to one account, alluding to Schopenhauer in his recent Windows 11 presentation. Asked in a recent interview about his decision-making framework, he said “It starts with mission, it ends with culture, and in between [there is] what’s our worldview, what’s our strategy. I think of the things that are constant as that sense of purpose and mission and culture, and the things that are temporal are worldviews and strategies.” But under his leadership, Microsoft has grown beyond its original business and is seen as outgunning higher profile companies such as Amazon (in cloud computing). It is now challenging Apple with its ramped up Windows 11, its first major operating system revamp since Nadella took over. “Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers, and with Windows 11 we have a renewed sense of Windows’ role in the world,” Nadella tweeted on Thursday, in what analysts saw as a shot across the bow of Apple, which has been under fire for the way it treats developers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/microsoft-2nd-us-co-to-hit-2tn-mcap/articleshow/83854420.cms||---

Senior leaders of the erstwhile RLSP, who joined the JD(U) along with Kushwaha on March 14 this year in the presence of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, have got only around 10% participation in the new state committee announced by its state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha on Thursday. Umesh announced a jumbo-sized state committee, releasing the names of 211 leaders who have been made part of the new state committee. An in-depth analysis of the committee revealed that only 20 leaders of the erstwhile RLSP have been accommodated in the new team. “Among the 29 newly-appointed state vice-presidents, only four are from the erstwhile RLSP. Similarly, out of 60 state general secretaries, only four are Kushwaha supporters and among 114 state secretaries, only 12 are taken from the his camp,” a senior leader told TOI on Friday. “No leader from the RLSP background has been made state-level spokesperson, though the JD(U) released a list of seven spokespersons,” he pointed out. “It would have been far better for further strengthening the JD(U), if the leaders from the RLSP background had been given more participation in the new committee,” Santosh Kushwaha, the state working president of the erstwhile RLSP, told TOI. Santosh, who was earlier the state president of the Yuva JD(U) before joining the Sharad Yadav-led Loktantrik Janata Dal and later on the RLSP, has now been made one of the 114 state secretaries in the new JD(U) committee. Santosh was state working president of the RLSP when it merged with the JD(U) three months back. Besides Santosh, Rekha Gupta (Sitamarhi) was also the state working president of the RLSP. But unlike Santosh, Rekha has been made vice-president in the new team. Expressing satisfaction over her appointment as vice-president, she told TOI, “Now, we all are of JD(U). The day our leader Upendra Kushwaha merged the RLSP into the JD(U), we all became part of Nitish Kumar’s party. Now, we have decided to take the development works of CM Nitish Kumar further.” When contacted, Fazal Imam Mallick, a close aide of Kushwaha and national spokesperson of the erstwhile RLSP, told TOI that the leaders from the RLSP background have got “very satisfactory” representation in the state JD(U) team. “Besides 20 leaders in the state team, our many senior workers have been included as office-bearers in different cells of the state JD(U) as well as in the district teams,” Mallick said. State JD(U) chief Umesh Singh Kushwaha could not be contacted for his comment despite repeated attempts on his phone and also a message on his WhatsApp number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kushwaha-supporters-get-only-10-participation-in-new-team-of-jdu/articleshow/83850727.cms||Madan Kumar

The joint secretary of state energy department on June 17 wrote to the chairman and managing director of Rajasthan Rajya Vidutt Utpadan Nigam Limited and conveyed the state government’s approval for phasing out of old units 1 and 2 of KTPS and directed to initiate the closure from June 30, 2021. Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) member and party’s ex general secretary Pankaj Mehta and Rajasthan Rajya Vidutt Utpadan Karmachari Sangh’s Kota unit president Ram Singh Shekhawat on Friday shot separate letters respectively to chief minister Ashok Gehlot and energy minister BD Kalla and urged them to reconsider the decision of phasing out 1 and 2 units of KTPS. The units 1 and 2 of KTPS with 110-110 megawatt capacity were set up respectively in January and July 1983 and both the units have been generating power unabated for last 38 years and shutting them suddenly would mean leaving at least 1,000 employees of the two units unemployed, said the Congress leader and employees’ union Kota unit president Shekhawat. The engineers, employees, contractual labourers as well as local businessmen and people are filled with anger at the state government’s decision to phasing out the two units and the ruling Congress party might have to bear considerable political loss with this decision in times to come, PCC member Pankaj Mehta said in his letter and urged the chief minister to convey a high level review meeting to reconsider the decision. The two old units, instead of being shut down, could be kept in reserve for power generation in times of emergency, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-leaders-employees-union-object-to-govt-shutting-2-units-of-kota-thermal-station/articleshow/83856025.cms||---

In the last 11 years they have roped in donors who have paid Rs 1,000 each towards the school fees of 3,800 girls. Like everything else under the Sun, the pandemic has impacted their drive too. The Covid-19 induced lockdown has meant more pleas of help and steady decline in donations. With the lockdown resulting in job losses and reduced income, parents of many girl students are knocking at the doors of Rajput for help. “The situation of some families is such that they are hardly making ends meet so obviously it’s the education of kids that suffers the most. Some of the parents who approached us were not able to pay full fees of last academic year too. The report cards of their wards have been withheld by the schools,” said Gulab, who had made fixed deposits of Rs 5,000 each for 21 girls at Nishita’s wedding last year. Mukesh Goswami, an auto rickshaw driver said that since the last one and half years his income has been hit badly. “My daughter has just finished her standard 12 and is awaiting admission in college and my son is in standard 10. If not for financial aid, their education would have been hit,” he said. Kamlesh Rohit lost his job due to the Covid-19 enforced lockdown last year and later had to settle for a lower-paying job. His wife Rekha said that he is the only earning member of the family and they have one daughter studying in school. “We had to rely on a donated phone and fees to ensure our daughter continues studying,” she said. Gulab pointed out that the donations have also started going down since the pandemic began. “In 2019 we were able to collect Rs 69 lakh. This went down to Rs 55 lakh last year. This year, we have been able to collect Rs 27 lakh so far and are hopeful of more help,” he added. The father and daughter collect crossed cheques of Rs 1,000 denomination from donors. If a donor wants to support with a larger amount, multiple Rs 1,000 cheques are taken from him. These cheques are then directly deposited in the account of the school where the girl studies. A set of documents with the details of the girls whose fees has been paid is also handed over to the donor who gives the cheques.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/girls-education-drive-hits-covid-bump/articleshow/83853984.cms||Sachin Sharma

The vigilance bureau has unearthed movable and immovable assets worth more than Rs2.35 crore amassed by Lal disproportionate to his known sources of income. Lal was also handling additional charge of Saran DTO. “The bank deposits are in their SBI, Dena Bank (now Bank of Baroda) and Corporation Bank (now Union Bank of India) accounts in Patna,” a senior vigilance officer said. They said letters were written to the bank authorities concerned on Friday to freeze these accounts. Raids were conducted on three flats in two apartments at RMS Colony in Kankarbagh, Patna and two locations in Muzaffarpur, including his office, on Thursday, unearthing Rs1.11 crore of movable assets. Overall, the vigilance has till now found movable and immovable disproportionate assets worth Rs2.35 crore as per the government rates and amassed by Lal. They said Lal had purchased a 4.89-decimal plot in the Police Colony in Patna in 2017 in the name of Rakhi. “As per the deed, it’s value was Rs60 lakh then, but the present market value is estimated to be in crores,” the officer said. He said they have also got to know about his immovable property at New Nagra Toli at Lalpur, Ranchi. “Investigation is on to know if it’s a plot, flat or house. We also got to know about a locker in Dena Bank’s Kankarbagh branch. It would be opened soon,” he said. “We have found four flats purchased by Lal so far, two in the Kashyap Suman Apartment in the name of his eldest daughter and his own. Lal’s flat was purchased for Rs13 lakh in 2010 and that for the daughter cost Rs43 lakh in 2017,” he said. “Lal also purchased one flat is Asha Double Diamond and another in Mitra Mandal Colony near Phulwarisharif in the name of his mother Geetanjali Devi for Rs19 lakh and Rs14 lakh in 2010 and 2012, respectively,” he said.

The bizarre turn of events unfolded when a recently married youth, Ravi, complained to police that his wife of three days, Komal, had fled with money and jewellery. The Kunadi police station registered an FIR on Ravi’s complaint. The police first picked up “matrimonial agent,” Dev Raj Suman.He had found the bride for Ravi. The police continued to follow up on leads for two other accused-Komal and her brother. “Komal was arrested along with another accused identified as SonuKarpare. Sonu acted as Komal’s brother in the presence of Ravi when the latter had come to arrange the marriage. In reality, Sonu was Komal’shusband,” said investigation officer, Mohan Lal. The police learnt during the investigation on Thursday after the arrest that Ravi’s wedding was an elaborate scam plotted by agent Suman. The accused found Sonu and Komal, a couple from Indore, who agreed to play the part to cheat Ravi. The three accused took about Rs1.80 lakh from the groom. A court marriage was held and the couple were wished good luck by Sonu. Three days after the wedding, Ravi returned home and found his wife missing. A cupboard and drawers were ransacked; Komal’s phone was switched off too.It finally dawned on Ravi that something was amiss. The police investigation unravelled the cheating case which left the complainant as well the cops befuddled. Ravi told cops that Sonu always actedlikeKomal’sbrother. The newly found information heaped confusion on an already distraught bride who could not understand why his wife would desert him shortly after the wedding. “We have taken the accused on the remand for further investigation. As of now, it appears to be that Ravi was their first victim,”said anofficial. Police said they have taken several documents including a marriage certificate under their custody for perusal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hubby-poses-as-wifes-brother-to-dupe-groom-of-rs-2l/articleshow/83856001.cms||---
---||Patna||RJD to celebrate Ram Vilas’ birth anniversary on July 5||PATNA: In a bid to lure Jamui MP Chirag Paswan with an eye on the Paswan vote bank, the main opposition RJD has decided to celebrate the birth anniversary of LJP founder and former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan at a simple function to be organized ahead of its own foundation day on July 5. This will coincide with the ‘Ashirvad Yatra’ announced by Ram Vilas’s son Chirag the same day from Hajipur represented by his father in the past and now by uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, who has engineered a coup in the LJP and unseated his nephew as the parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha with the support of other four party MPs, except Chirag. The yatra is perceived as a show of strength for Chirag in the party, which is now split into two faction and each claiming to be the real one. On his return from Delhi, Tejashwi visited the RJD office and held a meeting with senior leaders on Thursday. During the meeting, he said the RJD’s 25th foundation day celebration will be preceded by a function to pay homage to the late Ram Vilas. Explaining the reason, RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan on Friday said, “The RJD is organising a simple function to pay tributes to late Ram Vilas Paswan for him being a veteran socialist leader. This has been the practice in the party to pay homage to leaders having social background.” He, however, said it is just a coincidence that the birth anniversary of the departed LJP leader falls on the RJD’s foundation day. Though Gagan denied any political motive behind it, sources in RJD said the exercise is aimed at manoeuvring the Paswans whose vote share comes to around 6% in Bihar. The RJD move assumes significance in the wake of Tejashwi’s offer to Chirag to join hands with RJD following a coup in the LJP. “It is up to Chirag Bhai to decide who he wants to stand with,” Tejashwi said. The RJD leader alleged that JD(U) supremo and CM Nitish Kumar was behind the LJP split. Tejashwi pointed out that a similar split was caused in LJP by Nitish in 2005 and 2010. “But RJD chief Lalu Prasad helped Ram Vilas get a Rajya Sabha seat when the latter had lost his Lok Sabha election,” he added. If Tejashwi and Chirag had anything in common besides their fathers' Janata Dal roots, it is their political aversion to Nitish. LJP had polled about 25 lakh votes in the state assembly elections held last year. “The vote share of LJP is about 6%. If it is added to 17% of minority votes and 16% of Yadavs, it comes to around 39%,” a senior RJD leader said. Under such circumstances, it will be an uphill task for the ruling NDA to perform well either in the assembly or in the Lok Sabha elections. The results of the 2020 assembly elections affirmed that most of the Muslims and Yadavs voted for the RJD, which have 76 MLAs in the 243-member House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-to-celebrate-ram-vilas-birth-anniversary-on-july-5/articleshow/83849620.cms||Ramashankar

All the teachers are likely to get their appointment letters before Independence Day, said education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary. The minister told this newspaper that following the intervention of the Patna high court, the physically challenged candidates were given 15-day time to apply again on seats reserved for them. “But, contrary to the expectations, very few applications have been received during the last one fortnight. This may be just because most candidates under this category might have already applied in response to the general advertisement,” he said. Chaudhary said the counselling of candidates would be held in two different batches – one for the candidates of those units where no new fresh applications have been received and another for the candidates where physically challenged candidates have applied afresh. “The counselling will commence on July 4 and complete by the first week of August. The final integrated merit list will be released thereafter by the Employment Authority following the verification of original certificates of candidates. Appointment letters will be distributed among the selected candidates before August 15,” he said. The minister added these teachers would join their jobs in 72,000 schools spread across the state. The notification for recruitment of about 94,000 teachers was issued by the state education department on July 5, 2019 and the appointments were supposed to be finalized by the end of December that year. But, for one reason or another, the process got delayed and ultimately, it got the go-ahead signal by the high court in the first week of this month. “If all goes well, even the appointment of teachers in the seventh phase will be completed soon with a view to ensuring regular classes in elementary and secondary schools of the state,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/94000-teachers-to-get-appointment-letters-before-i-day-minister/articleshow/83849489.cms||B K Mishra

Canara Bank-led lenders stand to rake in Rs 531 crore from the sale of Hyderabad-based Sathavahana Ispat where stressed assets investor JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction (ARC) outdid its own anchor bid. Earlier, SBI-led bankers made Rs 470 crore from the sale of Odisha-based MSP Metallics to CFM ARC. Both deals were outside the bankruptcy process. At a time when banks are seeing most of their loans wiped out, like those to Videocon Group or Jet Airways, the traditional business of steel manufacturing is turning out to be relatively safer for lenders. Three of the biggest NPA recoveries has been in the steel sector — Essar Steel, Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel. What went in favour of the sector was the turning of the commodity cycle, which helped recoveries, and the fact that the plants continued to be operational despite being in the insolvency process. In the case of Sathavahana Ispat, JC Flowers ARC was initially the highest bidder at Rs 410 crore. Subsequently, Canara Bank ran a ‘Swiss challenge’ process where bidders get an opportunity to top the best bid. During this process, Megha Engineering bid Rs 531 crore. JC Flowers then exercised its right as an anchor bidder to match the bid. As a result, lenders are likely to recover more than half their dues. ARCs buy distressed businesses from lenders and consolidate the holdings and sell them for a profit. Last month, CFM ARC emerged as the top bidder for MSP Metallics, which has dues of around Rs 1,500 crore. Lenders are set to recover Rs 470 crore, which is much higher than their reserve price of Rs 370 crore. According to Care Ratings, demand for steel rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of FY21. “While a low base effect due to Covid-led disruption resulted in a sharp 50% rise in net sales in Q4FY21 compared with Q4FY20, net sales was also higher by a sharp 21% compared with Q4FY19. This was on account of higher realisations and volume growth,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lenders-see-more-recovery-in-steel-sector/articleshow/83854637.cms||Mayur Shetty

In only one of the six auctions, the government opted for the green shoe option and mopped up nearly Rs 2,900-crore extra, in addition to the planned Rs 14,000 crore announced by the RBI, the data from the central bank showed. Of the five auctions, each of Rs 14,000-crore, three were cancelled and two partially devolved on some of the bond houses. RBI data showed that of the Rs 84,000 crore worth of these bonds put up for auction since April this year, those worth only about Rs 27,453 crore, or just 33% have been sold through the regular channel. The low interest among bond dealers for 10-year bonds, usually the most liquid among gilts across tenures, indicate that in future the government may have to pay higher rates to mobilise funds from the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/10-year-gilts-unsold-in-q1s-sixth-auction/articleshow/83855174.cms||---

Under this drive, the police issued 10 challans on Wednesday and 75 challans on Thursday. On Wednesday, two people died in a road mishap when a passenger bus rammed into a parked truck on Ludhiana- Delhi highway near Khanna. It was an overloaded truck from which iron roads were hanging behind. Joint commissioner of police, Deepak Pareek, said, “On Wednesday, we started a drive against the vehicles that overload and cause road mishaps. Usually, vehicles carrying iron roads invite such accidents, as the rods are hanging outside the vehicle. We have issued 10 challans on Wednesday and 75 challans on Thursday.” JCP added that on zone 1, 16 challans were issued, in zone 2 35 challans, in Zone 3 11 challans and in zone 4 13 challans were issued. He added the drive is being conducted in areas like Focal Point, Industrial area, Sahnewal Chowk, Shiv Chowk, Veer Palace, Samrala Chowk, Gill Road and Transport Nagar. “On Wednesday night, the city police are also starting a drive against the vehicles using illegal LED lights on their vehicles. It is observed that the youngsters get extra LED lights installed in their cars to give their vehicles a fancy look. However, these lights are so sharp that it would literally make you blind for a few seconds and thus also invite accidents.

The hospital has procured 600 Sputnik V vaccines and people can get inoculated by booking their slots on CoWin or Aarogya Setu apps. “Sputnik V is only available at Medanta. It is the first hospital to get the Russian vaccine in the state. Two doses have to be taken by one person with a gap of 21 days and the price per shot is Rs 1,125. Proper arrangements have been made for the people at the hospital so that they can get their jabs comfortably,” the hospital’s director, Dr Arun Kumar, told this newspaper. He added, “The hospital was already inoculating people with other vaccines provided by the government. Hence, facilities were there for vaccination at the hospital. Trained nursing staff are inoculating people.” Experts have hailed debut of the Russian vaccine in the city. “Sputnik is a very good vaccine with its efficacy ranging from 92-94%. However, it has only been made available to private hospitals. With the arrival of Sputnik, India now has three vaccines. The Russian vaccine is expensive, but its efficacy is better than other vaccines available in the country. It has shown no adverse side effects as of now,” said Dr Arun Shah, a Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician and former president of Bihar chapter of Indian Academy of Paediatrics. People in the city are also upbeat with the arrival of Sputnik. “I would prefer taking this vaccine.

The most favourite watering hole for ‘parched’ Gujaratis is all set to fully open in a short period. With weekend curfew already lifted two weeks ago, and Covid wave receding fast as well, the administration of the union territory has decided to soon open up tourist spots, including its attractive beaches, while it is still engaging in re-beautifying the cyclone-ravaged district. Diu was devastated by cyclone Tauktae last month. The UT had been weekend curfew since the peak of the second wave of Covid and after the restrictions were lifted two weeks ago, hotels were flushed with tourists last week. President of Diu Hotels Association, Yatin Fugro said, “Tourism is picking up more than expected lines after the weekend curfew was lifted and weekend occupancy has reached around 35 percent from zero. We are expecting good turnout in August when the festival season starts.” Many NRI families, who have been restricted from travelling to India for almost two years now owing to the global pandemic are expected to come down during Diwali. And, together with vaccination ‘foreigners’ could inject Diu’s slack hotel industry which is running in losses since March 2020, with a shot of hope. Incidently, July is also a slack period because of monsoon. While hotel owners are expecting to pick up speed by August, they pray that a third wave won’t upset their apple cart. Owners are also waiting for the district administration to open all the tourist points to attract in more visitors. On the other hand, many cyclone-hit hotels are still renovating and will not be able to open so soon owing to buildings and infrastructure damages. Owners here are also facing acute manpower crisis after majority of the catering staff hailing from North India left for their native places during the second wave and are yet to return. Diu collector, Saloni Rai said, “There is a decline in Covid cases and there has been no new cases in Diu for the past one week. We are, therefore, mulling to open tourist points will take a decision in this regard soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/ravaged-diu-preps-to-get-lost-spirit-back-on-its-beaches/articleshow/83856482.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Business||Online company PharmEasy to buy Thyrocare for Rs 6,900 crore||MUMBAI: In a deal worth nearly $1 billion, online pharma startup PharmEasy is buying out leading pathology laboratory chain Thyrocare Technologies to bolster its e-commerce play. Under the contours of the deal, API Holdings, the parent of PharmEasy is acquiring a 66% stake in Thyrocare from its main promoter A Velumani and his family for Rs 4,550 crore. At the same time, the pharma retailer’s parent is also making an open offer to acquire an additional 26% from public shareholders for Rs 1,788 crore, a release from the two companies said. As part of the deal, Velumani, who had started the company with an initial capital of just Rs 2 lakh, will now acquire a minority stake of less than 5% in API Holdings. Under the current valuations, the deal is worth about $925 million or around Rs 6,900 crore. This is the second high-value deal in India in which a startup is buying out an established brick-and-mortar company, and the first where a unicorn (valued at over $1 billion) is buying a listed firm. Earlier this year, edtech major Byju’s had announced the acquisition of unlisted Aakash coaching classes for about $950 million. API Holdings and its associates are making an open offer to Thyrocare’s shareholders at Rs 1,300 per share. On Friday, the stock on BSE closed at Rs 1,448, up 6% on the day. In the last one month, Thyrocare’s stock price on the BSE has gained a little over 40%.This is the second acquisition for PharmEasy this year. In April the company acquired its smaller e-pharma competitor Medlife for an undisclosed amount. Speaking to TOI, Velumani, CMD of Thyrocare, said that Covid fast-tracked growth for both the company and the industry. In the last one year or so, Thyrocare’s turnover grew 20% and its ebitda (gross profit) went up around 40%. “From ordering medicines online to tele-consultations and now diagnostic services, amid the pandemic there is a shift not only in consumer preferences but also the business approach and modus operandi by doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and clinics across the country. This (Thyrocare-PharmEasy) unified model will soon be followed by others,” Velumani said, adding I wanted to retain some part (of our share), but the acquirers were keen to buy out completely. In this deal, Nomura was the adviser to the promoters of Thyrocare, while JM Financial and Kotak Mahindra Capital Company (KMCC) were the advisers to API Holdings. According to Vishal Kampani, MD, JM Financial Group, the deal brings together India’s leading digital health platform and one of the most cost-efficient diagnostics solution providers to create an unbeatable integrated digital health platform. S Ramesh, MD & CEO, KMCC, feels that API and PharmEasy are using their one-of-a-kind tech-ops platform “to fundamentally reshape the out-patient healthcare ecosystem in India”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/online-co-pharmeasy-to-buy-thyrocare-for-rs-6900-crore/articleshow/83855752.cms||Partha Sinha
---||Business||RBI tightens CEO norms for cooperative banks||MUMBAI: Taking a tough stance on the governance of urban cooperative banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday announced minimum qualifications and age limits for CEOs and whole-time directors of these banks as part of its ‘fit and proper’ criteria. The rules gain significance considering that in many cooperatives the appointment is political, and the central bank is slowly tightening its grip over them. The RBI got the power to regulate cooperatives last year in June after the government issued an ordinance to bring 1,482 urban cooperative banks and 58 multi-state cooperatives under the central bank’s supervision. The new rules come in the wake of the collapse of several urban cooperative banks, the biggest being the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank where the CEO conspired with some members to divert funds to real estate developers. The RBI has asked all cooperative banks where the CEO has been appointed without its approval to review the fit and proper status of the existing MD in terms of present directions. RBI guidelines require that the MD should be a graduate and preferably have additional qualifications such as a diploma in banking, chartered cost account, or post-graduation in any discipline. The minimum age for a CEO has been set at 35 years and maximum age at 70 with at least eight years’ experience in the middle or senior management level in the banking sector. Also, the post of the MD and whole-time director cannot be held by the incumbent for more than 15 years. PMC moratorium for 6 more monthsThe RBI on Friday extended the moratorium on PMC Bank by another six months. “In response to the expression of interest (EOI) dated November 3, 2020, floated by PMC Bank for its reconstruction, certain proposals were received. After careful consideration, the proposal from Centrum Financial Services (CFSL) along with Resilient Innovation (BharatPe) has been found to be prima facie feasible,” the RBI said. It added that considering the time required for completion of various activities involved in the process, it is considered necessary to extend the direction up to December 31, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-tightens-ceo-norms-for-cooperative-banks/articleshow/83854848.cms||---

On Friday, two people got a fresh lease of life as ophthalmologist Dr SP Singh transplanted the corneas harvested from Singh. According to doctors of government-run MD Eye hospital, “Sunita Singh died of brain hemorrhage on June 24. Her husband Man Singh timely informed the Eye Bank at Regional Institute of Ophthalmology (MD Eye Hospital) about the demise of his wife, who had expressed wish to donate her eyes after death,” said Dr Singh, principal, MLN Medical College and director, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology. Getting the information, a team of doctors consisting Dr Anirrud Sharma and Dr Srishti Nagarajan rushed to the residence of Singh. The two corneas were properly examined by Dr Singh and found suitable for transplantation. The prospective recipients were called and transplantation of the donated cornea (keratoplasty) ) was performed. Dr Singh has appealed to people to come forward to donate their eyes after death and be part of the noble cause. “Indeed, it will be a great service to the mankind if the family of the donor fulfil the last wish of their loved ones. It will go a long way in promoting corneal transplantation surgeries,” Dr Singh said. To facilitate easy communication between the general public and eye bank, two phone numbers 09451762902 and and 09807477789 are active 24 hours a day, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/woman-gifts-vision-to-two-after-death/articleshow/83850898.cms||---

I will request the government to provide vaccines to all and after that I will get vaccinated,” Tejashwi said. When asked how he will participate in the monsoon session of the assembly without being vaccinated, he replied, “Will see to that. When there will be a need, I will take…” However, JD(U) and BJP leaders lashed out at Tejashwi for avoiding vaccination. JD(U) state spokesperson Anjum Ara called Tejashwi an irresponsible public representative and said, “He is setting a bad example by not taking the vaccine. At least in this pandemic, he should avoid politics and think of people first. I will pray to God to give him sense to get vaccinated and help others from not getting infected.” BJP state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel also criticized the opposition leader and said while the entire nation was focusing on vaccination, Tejashwi was making people fool. “First of all, he runs away from Bihar whenever people need him the most and now at least for the sake of people he should get vaccinated.” Opposition leaders, on the other hand, blamed BJP and JD(U) for diverting from real issues. “They should talk about the shortage of beds, medicines, lack of oxygen and the large number of deaths which have been hidden. But they are busy in Tejashwi chalisa. They have nothing to discuss, except Tejashwi, because they are afraid of his popularity among people,” said RJD state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari. Even Congress state spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari flayed the ruling party leaders for creating an issue out of it. “Even assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha has made it mandatory for MLAs to get vaccinated in order to participate in the monsoon session. This is a dictatorial move. Many people who tested positive have been advised by the doctors not to take vaccines for 45 days or 90 days. Few were waiting for Sputnik to arrive. So how can a Speaker stop a public representative from entering the House?” Tejashwi visits Raghopur: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Friday visited his flood-affected Raghopur assembly segment and adjoining areas in Vaishali district. He accused the state government and JD(U)-BJP leaders of working for business class only and ignoring farmers and the poor. He also criticized CM Nitish Kumar and his government for not handling floods and problems due to it seriously. “With increase in the downpour, a large chunk of agricultural land has been washed away by the Ganga. But the government is busy in loot in the name of flood relief,” Tejashwi alleged. He also asked his party workers to provide all possible help to the people in this time of crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/will-take-vaccine-when-needed-says-tejashwi/articleshow/83850881.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Bihar’s ganja, charas consumption much below national average: NCB||PATNA: The percentage population consuming gang and charas in the state is much below the national average but, of late, it is showing a rising trend, as per the Narcotics Control Bureau figures. NCB zonal director (Bihar & Jharkhand) Kumar Manish said the national average is 1.2% of the population, which consumes ganja and charas as per a study of the ministry of social justice and empowerment in 2019. “Bihar’s average that time was 1.1%. But it has been observed later that there has been a rising trend,” Manish told TOI in reply to queries on the eve of International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, which is observed every year on June 26. This year’s theme for the day is ‘Share facts on drugs, save lives’, set by the UN for combating misinformation and encouraging exchange of drug facts. The NCB also released data showing an increase in seizure of drugs in the state over the last few years. As per the data, the NCB seized 12.3kg ganja, 1.9kg opium and 2.02kg charas in 2015 and 496.5kg ganja, 8.18kg opium and 31.5kg charas in 2016. The figures jumped to 14.8 tonnes of ganja, 5.45kg opium and 114.05kg charas in 2017 and 6.4 tonnes of ganja, 5.5kg opium and 212.83kg charas in 2018. In 2019, the NCB seized 6.67 tonnes of ganja, 7.5kg opium and 33.3kg charas while in 2020, 4.89 tonnes of ganja, 15kg opium and 103.9kg charas were seized in Bihar. This year, with six months still to go, the NCB has already seized 4.82 tonnes of ganja, 5.25kg opium and 48.8kg charas. When asked, Manish said Bihar’s traditional trend has already remained towards ganja consumption. “Synthetic drug consumption trend is almost nil. Liquor addicts also shifted towards drug abuse after prohibition in 2016,” he said. The director, however, said that increased seizure of drugs, especially ganja, also reflects effective crackdown by the law enforcement agencies. He said the percentage population consuming opioid in the state is 0.1%, which is much less than the national average of 0.7%. “Bihar is at the bottom in opioid consumption. It’s also at the bottom in sedatives consumption with 0.01% of population using it against the national average of 0.2%,” he said. As per the NCB data, drug abuse and trafficking has increased since 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, but it has also created unprecedented public awareness about health and measures for staying healthy and protecting each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/states-ganja-charas-consumption-much-below-national-average-ncb/articleshow/83850820.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Expect widespread rainfall in Bihar for next three days: Met||PATNA: Patna and several other places in the state received light to moderate showers on Friday and India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted fairly widespread rainfall in Bihar over the next three days. A yellow warning has also been issued for heavy rainfall along with thunderstorm and lightning in the state on Saturday and Sunday. Through yellow warning, the IMD alerts the authorities concerned to be watchful for extreme weather conditions. The expected rainfall has been attributed to a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and neighbourhood. According to the evening bulletin issued by IMD, the cyclonic circulation would meander over the same area over the next three days. “Under its influence, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall along with isolated heavy falls, thunderstorm and lightning are very likely over most parts of east and adjoining central India, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and east Madhya Pradesh during the next three days,” the IMD said. A trough line was also passing from east Uttar Pradesh to northeast Bay of Bengal across the cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and neighbourhood. Weathermen said moisture incursion owing to the trough line would also augment rainfall in the region. Shailendra Kumar Patel, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre, said the distribution and intensity of rainfall was more in south Bihar as compared to northern parts of the state in the last 24 hours. Highest rainfall in the state was recorded at Triveni (82mm), while Patna received 19mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Patel added the cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and neighbouring areas is likely to cause thundershowers along with lightning at many places in the state over the next three days. Southwest monsoon had entered Bihar through Purnia in north-eastern parts of the state on June 12, a day ahead of its schedule. Light to moderate and up to heavy rainfall has been occurring across the state on most days following the onset, though a lull was observed earlier this week. In fact, Bihar has received 136% excess rainfall in the monsoon season till date. The state has received 285.2mm rainfall from June 1 to 25, while the normal rainfall for the same period is 120.6mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expect-widespread-rainfall-in-state-for-next-three-days-met/articleshow/83850779.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Ludhiana||Punjab government puts their perks under scalpel, doctors go on strike||LUDHIANA: Protesting against the government for reducing their perks after implementing the Sixth Pay Commission, doctors at the civil hospital stalled the OPD and other services on Friday. Patients had to suffer due to the strike. Holding placards in support of their demand, protesters raised slogans against the state government and the finance minister. Talking to mediapersons, Dr Avinash Jindal said they had hoped the government would think favourably about them ahead of the elections by increasing their salary as part of the Sixth Pay Commission report. He said now they feel that every section was troubled, especially government employees, as clerks, including those of the health department and the DC office, were also on a strike. “Instead of appreciating healthcare workers’ efforts during the pandemic, the government disappointed them by reducing their salary instead of hiking it,” he added. The protesting doctor said after 86 days’ agitation in 1989, they had got non-practising allowance (NPA), but after 32 years the government reduced it and it would not only affect the serving health workers, but also the pensioners as pensions would be cut too. “If they don’t concede to our demand, we will intensify our agitation. If our demand is still not met, we will campaign door to door in the coming state elections,” Dr Jindal warned. Protesters said Punjab civil medical services (PCMS), rural doctors, medical officers, and ayurvedic doctors had also joined the protest. Meanwhile, as the OPDs didn’t function, patients had to suffer. “I had come to get myself examined as I was feeling weak for the past few days. But due to the strike, I returned home and would visit the civil hospital again on Saturday,” said Surjit Singh, a resident of Old City.  Some pregnant women, who had come for a check-up, also returned empty-handed due to the strike. Emergency services not hit Even as OPD services were affected due to the strike by doctors at the civil hospital, emergency services functioned normally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/govt-puts-their-perks-under-scalpel-doctors-go-on-strike/articleshow/83849734.cms||---

Before the mid-May restrictions came into force, Metro was running 192 services along the north-south corridor on weekdays. Even as the public are not allowed to board the trains, since last Monday (June 21), the carrier had started operating 40 staff special trains between Dakshineswar and Kavi Subhas. Now 22 more trains have been added, with 31 in each direction. Ever since the Covid-induced restrictions were clamped in May, the city’s lifeline started running these special trains to ferry its own staff members. Later, the number was increased from six to 12 and non-Metro employees were allowed to board the trains. From Monday, the first trains will leave Dakshineswar and Kavi Subhash at 8.30am (instead of 9am). The last service will be at 11.30am (instead of 11.15am). In the evening, the first trains will be at 3.45pm and the last at 6.30pm (instead of 6pm). The trains will ply at 11-12minute intervals from Monday to Saturday. There are no services on Sunday. From Monday, Eastern Railway (ER) will increase the number of staff specials from Howrah division from 154 to 204. From Sealdah division there will be 359 trains instead of 259. There will be 563 staff special trains instead of the current 413. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday ruled out opening of local trains. But earlier that day, protesters at Mallikpur station on the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour stretch demanded opening of suburban trains and allegedly hurled stones at cops who had gone there to end the blockade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-er-to-run-more-spl-trains/articleshow/83851708.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

According to businessmen, for over two months, the payments from majority of their customers for already supplied orders remained pending due to lockdown and now they are short of funds to execute the new orders immediately. In wake of the situation, businessmen are either overdrawing their bank limits or are requesting their dealers to increase credit days till the time the payment cycle resumes back to normal. Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, said, “On the one side, there was a glimmer of hope of resumption of businesses back to normal with lockdowns in other states ending fully and movement of goods starting, but on the other hand we have got into soup because we are short of funds to execute new orders. The funds shortage is because majority of customers based in other states failed to make full payments for the already supplied orders in March and April. Due to this, our fund situation has touched critical levels where we only have enough to pay for the expenses like salaries and bills. As far paying for our raw material and other high amount purchases is concerned, we are forced to overdraw our bank limits.” According to Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, “More than 90% of the sewing machines and parts made in Ludhiana are supplied to other states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajashthan, and Karnataka. Due to lockdowns in these states for a long time, the payment cycle has been disrupted as our customers failed to make us our old payments citing the closure of markets and no sales.  In addition to these old payments, the payments for the orders of goods, which we were unable to supply to them during lockdown has also got invested with our customers. Which means double investment and if this was not enough, we have started getting new orders too but we do not have money to execute them and left with no option than to request our suppliers to supply us raw material on credit, who are complying to it but as a common trade practice charging interest according to the credit period.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-face-fund-crunch-as-payments-for-previous-orders-still-pending/articleshow/83849733.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Lucknow||Overcoming vaccine blues: Non- monetary incentive can aid the fight against hesitancy||By: Piush Antony As the country is recovering from the second wave of Covid-19, states are adopting various strategies to open up in a phased manner. Pivotal to this strategy is increasing the coverage of vaccination among adults. The threat of the impending third wave and the positive experience of countries with higher vaccination coverage make it imperative to aim for near universal vaccination among adults. Indeed, a challenging task. Apart from addressing the supply side issues and establishing outreach mechanisms, the state with the largest population needs to focus on surmounting vaccine hesitancy. Globally, there is limited experience in managing adult vaccination, and Covid-19 pandemic has exposed several other issues related to vaccine intake. Given the potential of multiple factors to undermine vaccine coverage, it is important to take immediate steps to promote approved vaccines. The first step would be to understand the extent and nature of hesitancy. Ostensibly, there is too much conflicting information, misinformation and disinformation on vaccines spilling from various platforms. These do impact people’s attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and intention to accept vaccination. The growing evidence on factors that delay or refuse vaccines emphasizes lack of trust in the importance, safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Of the evidences, some of them deserve attention from multiple actors and in a concerted manner. For example, many community members believe that cure either already exists in the form of some herbal remedies or other unproven treatments. Equally significant is the lack of clarity regarding differences among vaccines, cures and treatments. To address these, WHO and Unicef have recommended robust community engagement to increase trust and acceptance, which would include vaccine demand and clarifying apprehensions on vaccine safety. Community engagement Uttar Pradesh has proven models of community engagement in dealing with polio and Japanese Encephalitis. Social mobilization network of community-level workforce, developed and nurtured in high-burden districts for achieving polio eradication, is active in promoting routine immunization in the state. Dastak campaign focused on reducing JE in the affected districts involved both frontline functionaries and community level leaders. Nigarani Samitis sustaining the ODF movement at the village level as part of Swachh Bharat Mission also provide a pliable communication channel. Self-help groups and MNREGA workers together cover a sizeable proportion of adults at the village level. While these systems provide effective platforms to reach out to communities to promote vaccine intake, they can also be leveraged to address misinformation and create demonstration models. Since newly elected gram panchayat members have started functioning, coordination of these community level platforms can be given to the gram panchayats. With increased allocation of the Fifteenth Finance Commission to the gram panchayats, utilization of untied fund (60% ) earmarked for national priorities can be creatively combined for social mobilization to promote vaccine intake. Social media platforms, especially WhatsApp and Telegram, that have been remarkably used for communication among various interest groups at decentralized levels, also provide an effective channel for communication to dispel myths and promote vaccine. Examples are groups of fair price shop owners, pashu mitra or para vets, literacy preraks, rozgar sewak, safaikarmi, kisan sahayak, etc. At gram panchayat level, 18 persons reporting to 10 different departments are functional and can be activated through various social media platforms with desirable communication on vaccine. All gram pradhans need to be educated on Covid-appropriate behaviour and they need to be motivated to be vaccine champions to create positive deviance among the general population. In urban areas, many residential associations and private companies are opting for spot vaccination at their locations. While supporting the same, cooperatives and agriculture mandis also need to be supported for covering the workers who are likely to be missed out during the outreach sessions. When religious institutions open up, kiosk for registration can be activated on selected days. Agriculture extension services and PDS shops must be supported with communication materials on vaccine promotion. Social marketing strategies promoted to contain HIV spread in the 1990s can be utilized. When done appropriately, community engagement planned out in a convergent manner at panchayat level expands the influence of local actors, facilitates the access to and understanding of information, enables and promotes the right to provide feedback on the received services, and builds on existing local capacities. The cluster approach adopted by the government of Uttar Pradesh in accelerating vaccine coverage is very much in alignment with this and holds the potential of establishing another successful model of community engagement. Non-monetary incentives Insistence of vaccination for international travel has increased the intake among the group that is likely to travel for business, study, and family visit purposes. Taking a cue from this ostensibly successful model, there are conversations on non-monetary incentives for promoting vaccine intake. In the context of UP, a plethora of ideas can be tested as non-monetary incentives. If carried out in coordination with central ministries, these measures can act as an effective incentive to a significant section of population across the states. These measures reach out to different sectors and age groups. Despite vaccine shortage in the initial stages, the state has achieved impressive coverage. The ongoing efforts of the state government can be effectively accelerated through some of these non-monetary incentives with no budget commitments. If we can perceive what prevents vaccination, overcoming is a matter of conviction.

Seeking relaxation in the timings, the members said the government should make it possible to organise events in the night, catering to at least 100 people, if all necessary precautions are taken. The members said they have been facing losses for the last two years. “Unemployment is particularly high for performing artists, because artists are much more likely to be self-employed. Performing artists have more trouble earning money by working from home, whereas designers, writers, and even visual artists may be able to continue working, publishing, or selling their art remotely,” they said. Pradeep Shahi, member of Sangeet Parivar Welfare Society, said, “A night of jagran, which will involve arranging decorations, tents, food, waiters and sound recording systems, will employ at least 20 to 25 people. But the last two years, we are unable to perform and this is putting pressure on our community, as we have family to feed.” Bunty, head of Sangeet Parivar Welfare Society said the members of sangeet or jagran community were worst hit by the pandemic. “There have been incidents in which co artists have made attempts to take their lives, as they have not been able to survive due to financial crisis. Some families are already ruined by such painful event. We request our government to remove restrictions and allow us to work and earn money and live life peacefully. We are ready for future protests as well if our demands are not met within two to three days,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/jagran-artists-threaten-to-go-on-hunger-strike-if-covid-rules-not-relaxed/articleshow/83849782.cms||---

The traffic brass said that there are multiple parking lots located on these roads and the absence of any alternate sites to shift these parking lots was the biggest stumbling block. The cops said that bus stops at regular intervals and encroachment of the left lane too were other major challenges to the project. “In a city that has very little road space, we cannot block a lane for cycles. The cycle enthusiasts must realize our limitations,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Cops, however, said it is open to the idea of creating special cycling lanes on the stretches around Maidan and off EM Bypass, provided the Army the custodian of the Maidan, agrees to the plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cycle-lanes-on-major-roads-impractical/articleshow/83851757.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Girl’s father Ram Kishan, who hails from Gonda district of Uttar Pradesh, had moved to Ludhiana’s Jeevan Nagar on Wednesday with his wife, son and two daughters for a job. On Thursday morning, his children were playing outside the rented accommodation when suddenly his five-year-old daughter Radha went missing. “She was playing right outside the house and when she did not return home, we started looking for her in the locality. I got scared, thinking my daughter has been kidnapped. It was her second day in Ludhiana and she had no idea about the locality. When we failed to find her, I lodged a missing complaint with the police post at Industrial Area-A,” said the father. Radha’s family spent a sleepless night as they had come to the city with a hope to have a better future and the very next day, their daughter went missing. “All night, we prayed for her safe return,” Ram Kishan said. Meanwhile, Radha lost way and reached near Dhandari Bridge, a few kilometres away from Jeevan Nagar. Seeing a small girl roaming around alone, tea stall owner Nisha, 45, asked her about her address. Scared and lost, the girl could not share the information. “The child kept crying. I took her home as it was risky to leave a small girl alone on the road. But before that I searched for her parents in a nearby locality, but to no avail. At home, I tried to calm her and asked about her parents, but she didn’t tell me anything. Then on Friday morning, I took her to Dhandari police post, where the cops already had information about her,” said Nisha. ASI Dharampal Chaudhary, in charge of Industrial Area-A police post, said, “The Dhandari chowki informed us about the girl, following which we took her to our police post and called her family and handed over their child to them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tea-stall-owner-helps-5-year-old-missing-girl-reunite-with-parents/articleshow/83849747.cms||Payal Dhawan

Multiple police teams have been constituted to crack the case. Shanti Devi, 81, was found murdered on June 22. A day after, the body of her husband, Hari Chand (85), was found buried at the back of his house. Raikot DSP Sukhnaz Singh said, “We have constituted two to three teams to solve the case.” Police said they have questioned relatives of the deceased. “Robbery does not seem to be the motive as gold jewellery and cash were not stolen. No CCTV cameras are installed at the house. We scrutinized the footage of a camera installed at some distance, but it gave no clue. Property angle and previous enmity are being investigated,” said a cop. The couple’s post-mortem underlined brutal murder. Their son Pawan Kumar, 59, of Preet Nagar in Moga, had told the police, “Of my three siblings, my younger brother Kuldeep Kumar lives in Finland. My sister Parveen Rani started living with our parents 17 years ago following issues with her in-laws. My second sister Anita Sharma is married to my namesake and resides in Moga.” On June 21, Parveen had gone to Anita’s place to get vaccinated against Covid. “On June 22 at 5.30pm when Parveen and Anita, along with her husband, reached home in Lakha, they found our mother dead and father missing. Killers had hit our mother in the face with rods. We looked for our father everywhere, but to no avail,” he added.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Fair, remunerative price for milk to be considered||MUMBAI: Against the backdrop of an agitation by milk farmers over plummeting prices, state dairy development minister Sunil Kedar said on Friday that government would look into demands for a fair and remunerative price for milk along the lines of sugarcane. Cane farmers are guaranteed a minimum price known as FRP. “The state government will study this issue. Farmers have been suffering with the lack of demand and low prices for milk during lockdown,” said Kedar. Dairies have slashed procurement price for milk over the last few months. Farmer groups have also been pushing for milk prices to be raised to Rs35/litre. The FRP for milk has been discussed several times but there are challenges to its implementation as very little milk is procured by government and bulk of trade is with private sector. The state procures less than 1% of milk produced, cooperative dairies procure 35%, while private dairies procure over 60%. Officials said it was difficult to enforce pricing in a decontrolled sector dominated by private players. Farmer groups said private and cooperative dairies had slashed procurement rates by Rs10-15 during lockdown. “Farmers used to get Rs35/litre before lockdown. Then it fell to Rs20. Farmers are being looted,” said Ajit Navle of Kisan Sabha. After a meeting with state government, Navle said they would welcome an FRP for milk and were hopeful milk procurement prices would start rising.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fair-remunerative-price-for-milk-to-be-considered/articleshow/83860565.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The activists had sought permission to hold a protest at Chhatrasal Chowk of Chhatarpur by following all SOPs for the Covid -19, they said. The campaigners said the diamond project would also damage with it a 25,000 year old-rock painting site older than that found at Bhimbetka. “Our protest may not be held at one place in Chhatarpur for five days, but we will launch a harit satyagrah from June 26 . On Saturday, we will begin the campaign with a day-long fast near a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Chattarpur,” said Amit Bhatnagar, an activist based at Buxwah. After a Google meet event, it was decided to hold awareness campaigns, blood donation camps and many other activities during the five days from June 26 to June 30, he said. Dr Sadachari Singh Tomar, former deputy director general of the Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) and one of the campaigners said, “if the government is out to destroy the forest of a drought and water-stressed region, we too are ready to take on the government.” Tomar also said that Bundelkhand is already a waterstressed region and felling of large numbers of trees would further deteriorate the ecology of the whole region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/buxwah-protest-permit-withdrawn-1-day-before/articleshow/83851792.cms||---

The export credit in 2020-21 stood at Rs 1,036 crore against a target of Rs 1,668 crore laid out in the service area credit plan (SACP) according to the latest report by state level bankers’ committee (SLBC). M M Bansal, convener, SLBC – Gujarat, said, “Only 62% of the export credit target was met in the pandemic year. Exports took a major hit across all the sectors. Since shipping companies were shut through the lockdown and industrial units barely operational, exports were near-zero in the first quarter. As a consequence, export credit went down.” Since lockdown continued across other countries as well, demand took a major hit. As a consequence, companies suffered several order cancellations as well due to which exports went down. Interestingly, barely 5% of the targeted accounts under SACP 2020-21 have sought credit, according to the SLBC report. Bankers said that export credit has gone down as exports across major sectors took long to recover in the subsequent quarters. Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham – Gujarat state council, said, “Exports are impacted in sectors such as textiles, apparels, garments, automobile, engineering goods and ceramics, among others. As demand slowed, exports declined. Even as lockdown eased, the recovery in exports did not take place until the fourth quarter and one cannot expect demand of a single quarter to drive exports. As a consequence, export credit took a hit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/only-62-of-export-credit-target-met-in-pandemic-year/articleshow/83851839.cms||---

The baby’s father on Thursday filed an FIR against the doctor, his son, also a medical practitioner, and his another relative under sections 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code. Senior inspector Bhaskar Jadhav of the Talegaon Dabhade police said, “The incident occurred about a year ago. The baby’s father filed a complaint on Thursday. Our probe is on.” Sub-inspector Aniket Hivarkar of the Talegaon Dabhade police station said the accused doctor allegedly had some dispute with his wife and father-in-law, also a medical practitioner running the hospital near Talegaon Dabhade. “In July last year, the doctor had heated arguments with his father-in-law in the hospital. The oxygen supply system was shut in a fit of rage hardly for a few seconds. The supply was restored immediately,” Hivarkar said. He said the complainant’s child was being treated in the ICU of the hospital then. “He also alleged in the complaint that the suspects had abused him and his wife,” Hivarkar said. He said the incident was fallout of a family dispute. “We are yet to make any arrests in the case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doc-kin-booked-for-briefly-stopping-o2-supply-in-hosp/articleshow/83851799.cms||---

The police teams conducted raids near Sanganer, Jawahar Nagar, Malpura gate, Jawahar Circle, Transport Nagar, Pratap Nagar, Mahesh Nagar, etc and arrested 19 accused. The police said that they seized 2kg of ganja and 2.6grams of smack. The police also arrested several other accused involved in the illegal liquor trade, during a similar operation through the day. “All the accused arrested during the raid are localised peddlers. They are the key chain in the distribution of drugs in neighbourhoods. They roll cannabis and other narcotic items into papers known a ‘pudki’. These rolls can be easily hidden and delivered very quickly,” said an official. The crime branch of the city police in 2019 had started Operation Clean Sweep, a city-wide hunt for people involved in drug networks. Several addicts were also sent to rehabilitation centres in Jaipur. The big drug bosses, however, continue to elude the city cops. “We are indeed targeting the big fish that are running the network through their underlings. We first wanted to dent the localised distribution chains so that it could bring down the demand of drugs in Jaipur,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/crime-branch-arrests-19-drug-peddlers/articleshow/83856318.cms||---

ED also searched Deshmukh’s official bungalow, Dyaneshwari, at Malabar Hill, his residences at Worli, and detained his personal secretary Sanjeev Palande, of the rank of additional collector, and personal assistant Kundan Shinde, as part of its probe into the money laundering case, a fallout of the CBI’s FIR accusing the minister of corruption. ED also searched the premises of Palande and Shinde, and directed both to accompany them to their Ballard Estate office for further questioning. The ED found a financial trail of Rs4 crore which the agency believes to be part of the tainted money collected by dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze from 12 bars and passed on to the former minister. A source said, “The money collected from the bar owners was deposited into accounts of shell companies and then diverted to an entity associated with Deshmukh family.” In the operation at Nagpur, Deshmukh’s residence-cum-office at GPO Square was the prime focus of the ED sleuths. In a media briefing in Mumbai, Deshmukh assured his complete cooperation with all central agencies like CBI and ED probing the allegations against him. He reiterated that former Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh had levelled baseless allegations against him after his transfer due to his dubious role in Antilia gelatin sticks case and Mansukh Hiran murder. Though the veteran NCP leader, incumbent MLA of Katol constituency, was not present, his son Salil and others were interrogated at length at his house. The ED, which has registered an offence under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, against Deshmukh and others in May, has so far conducted 10 searches in the city, investigating mostly builders and business associates of the veteran politician and his family members. In a show of strength on Friday, a mixed force of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), with women commandos, was sent as additional security at Deshmukh’s bungalow, where city police had already deployed bandobast under an ACP and two senior most inspectors. During CBI searches at Deshmukh’s bungalow on April 24 this year, the CRPF was not present despite almost 13-hour action. Later on Friday, city police chief Amitesh Kumar also sent additional Riot Control Police (RCP) as NCP supporters started gathering in front of Deshmukh’s bungalow. NCP leaders raised slogans, and lambasted BJP leadership at the Centre, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and also former state CM Devendra Fadnavis for implicating Deshmukh. Fadnavis, who was in the city, said it was wrong to politicize the ED and CBI action. “The agencies are working as per the guidelines laid down by the high court. The court had ordered CBI to inquire and subsequently other agencies too had started probing,” he said. NCP chief Sharad Pawar said in Pune that the searches were being initiated out of frustration and such attempts were not new for NCP leaders. “A new trend of using central agencies by those in power has emerged. Desmukh is not the first in the party to face such action. We are not worried,” Pawar said. During the searches, unconfirmed sources claimed ED team collected documents, photocopies of some records, details of banking transactions like cheque books, passbooks and transaction summaries, statements of various accounts and so on. The ED team is learnt to have also spent considerable time checking laptops, office and personal computers, collected copies of hard disks, transferred data, and also conducted physical searches in different parts of the house and office, said a source. The CBI had conducted similar marathon search operations at Deshmukh’s place on April 24. On May 25, the ED had searched five places, mostly offices and residences of different associates of Deshmukh family. Later, ED’s Mumbai team had searched residences and offices of his chartered accountant and other associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ed-on-rs-4-crore-hafta-trail-searches-maha-ex-ministers-bungalow/articleshow/83856071.cms||Soumitra Bose

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday has once again raked up the issue and the party has declared that on Monday its functionaries will stage protest outside homes of all 62 Congress councillors. A delegation of BJP met Ludhiana mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu on Friday and once again demanded the roll back of the charges imposed on the city residents and also informed him about the decision to protest. Pushpinder Singal, district president of BJP, said, “Ever since the Congress government took over in Punjab, every other day new tax is imposed on the citizens. The new one in this list is the water and sewerage charges from the residents who own houses measuring up to 125 square yards. This tax, which has been imposed from April 1, has given a big jolt to thousands of poor and middle class house owners who are still unable to come out of the devastation caused by Covid-19. By imposing this tax, Congress has proved that it is anti people and the biggest enemy of the poor people as party’s leaders did not even think about the on ground situation and went ahead with this move which will prove to be disastrous for the common man.” Singal also added, “Our opposition is towards handing out contract of collection of the water and sewerage bills to private contractors, which indicates that already bankrupt Congress government wants private players to further loot the money of the taxpayers. We have been continuously demanding rollback of this new tax and cancelling the contract with this private company, but till now neither mayor nor any of the 62 councillors have acted. So we have decided to protest on Monday and our campaign will continue till the time the voice of people is heard.” Earlier, the BJP also observed a black day to mark the imposition of emergency in India by Congress 46 years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bjp-to-protest-outside-homes-of-62-cong-councillors-over-water-sewerage-bills/articleshow/83849830.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state law and judiciary department, which controls the shrine trust, approved the move. Around 12,000 litres is used each month to prepare prasad laddoos, which are a favourite with devotees who visit the shrine. In the wake of the pandemic, temples were closed for darshan. Thus, raw materials became stale and passed their expiry date. Siddhivinayak senior officer Nanda Raut said, “We will clarify, the ghee is unfit for human consumption. It can be used as raw material by soap and cosmetics manufacturers, and other industries that extract components of ghee for multiple uses.” With the auction, the temple hopes to recover 60-70% of its investment gone bad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-siddhivinayak-temple-to-sell-its-spoilt-ghee/articleshow/83858902.cms||---

Presently, the district has 6,721 active cases. With 1,199 people getting discharged from various treatment centres on the day, the number of recovered patients has soared to 2,07,791. It also had an impact on the recovery rate, which has slightly improved to 95.9%. At 26, the district also topped the state in the number of Covid-19 fatalities. With this, the toll has shot up to 1,994. Among the deceased were three people in their 30s. Two of them had comorbidities and died at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday. One of them was a 32-year-old diabetic and asthmatic man who was hospitalized on June 7 and died of pneumonia, while the other one was a 38-year-old diabetic man, who was admitted on June 16. Two other patients too had died in the CMCH the same day - a 38-year-old woman without any comorbidities who was hospitalized on June 19 and a 40-year-old diabetic man who died 11 days after hospitalization. While the fresh cases have been plateauing in the district, the number of fatalities continues to be relatively high. The district’s death rate stands at 0.92%, compared to 0.76% in April-end and May first week. However, it is much lower than Chennai’s death rate, which stands at 1.53% or that of Salem, where the mortality rate is even higher at 1.66%. While one of the reasons behind the low death rate could be severe under reporting of deaths between April third week and May third week, officials attribute the same to the better management of oxygen supply in the district. A health department official said, “No one had died because of oxygen shortage or oxygen-related incidents in the district. The speed at which we added beds and oxygen generators from various sources definitely made a difference in ensuring its availability to all the needy patients.” At 13, Tirupur, meanwhile, reported the third highest number of deaths in the state. With this, the toll has touched 736 in that district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-tops-state-with-698-fresh-cases/articleshow/83856377.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Post social boycott, dad declares 'ghar wapsi' for Shahjahanpur woman who took up Islam||BAREILLY: A woman from Shahjahanpur, 29, who works in Delhi and had converted to Islam of her own accord, will now be “reconverted” to Hinduism after her retired army man father faced a social boycott. While local right-wing groups linked her conversion to the alleged mass conversion case being investigated by the UP Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), police found no evidence to support the claim. “I converted (to Islam) on my own. I work at the Delhi airport. Everyone wants to move ahead in life. I’ve worked hard and have a job lined up in aviation in Dubai. I got converted and told my family,” woman said. “I get around Rs 20,000 here. I’d get about Rs 2.5-3 lakh there.” A person close to the family said she had told the family that they could keep her conversion a secret, adding, “She said no one in India would come to know. Somehow, the news got out.” Discussions on social media began and local right-wing groups started mounting pressure. “Her father faced a social boycott. The groups started associating the whole thing with the mass conversion case,” the person added. Two Delhi-based Muslim clerics have been accused of converting "more than 1,000 vulnerable people to Islam with foreign funding”. Her father, however, said he “was not aware” initially that his daughter had converted. “I have managed to convince my daughter to reconvert to Hinduism. Now, she has gone to Delhi to do whatever is needed for her ghar wapsi (reconversion),” her father told TOI. President of the district unit of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Rajesh Awasthi, claimed responsibility for “bringing her back” to the Hindu fold. “We have managed to convince her to return to Hinduism. A team of priests from the Arya Samaj will reconvert her on Sunday,” he told TOI. “The family was depressed. We only told them that we are with them. We will request police to initiate an investigation because the girl was lured into conversion, which is an offence.” Police dismissed that. “As of now, it appears the motive (for her conversion) was to get a job in the Middle East. We didn’t find any communal sentiments. No complaint was lodged by anyone. Even our intelligence agencies didn’t find any trace of offence,” Shahjahanpur SSP S Anand told TOI. An ATS official who looks after the Bareilly division added, “No religious conversion linked to the mass conversion case has been reported in Bareilly division. We are looking into this case but found nothing.” An intelligence official further said, “Besides, the conversion took place in Delhi, not UP. And it was wilful. It cannot be considered a crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/post-social-boycott-dad-declares-ghar-wapsi-for-woman-who-took-up-islam/articleshow/83847430.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

If we fail to get reservation back, I will retire from politics,” said Fadnavis, while addressing protesters, who gathered in large numbers at Variety Square. Fadnavis was later detained and taken to Sitabuldi police station before being released. Thousands of BJP activists across the state staged a ‘Chakka Jam’ agitation against the MVA government for its failure to defend OBC reservation. Former energy minister Chandrasekhar Bawankule, city BJP president Pravin Datke and other MLAs from the party were present. “On the the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, who sacrificed his life for the betterment of all communities, a decisive battle has been launched today across the state by the BJP for OBC reservation,” the former CM said. Accusing the MVA ministers of making false promises, the Southwest Nagpur MLA said they have failed to constitute a backward class commission since the last 15 months. “While the Supreme Court has asked for empirical data, leaders of the state are misrepresenting facts that census data is needed. Instead of collecting data, they’re blaming the Centre for their own failures,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/if-we-fail-to-grant-obc-reservation-in-four-months-i-will-retire-politically-fadnavis/articleshow/83870880.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Senior leaders of BJP SCs-STs Morcha also participated in the discussions. On Thursday, senior BJP leader and national joint secretary Shiv Prakash is learnt to have asked the state leadership to work in backward and tribal areas where BJP has good support but it results in less support during the elections. Party's national head of SCs Morcha, Lal Singh Arya was also present during the meeting. “Discussions were held by SCs-STs Morcha to strengthen the organisation base and to expand the activities. BJP has worked in backward and remote areas during Covid-19 crisis and the party has now given responsibility to all fronts to review and monitor the relief and welfare works undertaken during past few months," said BJP state chief Vishnu Dutt Sharma. "Congress ruled the country for almost 57 years after the Independence but always treated the SCs as the vote bank. It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who provided basis facilities like cooking gas connection, constructed toilets, started health scheme under Ayushman and planned PM Awas scheme for housing. Congress did nothing for Baba Saheb Ambedkar," said SCs Morcha national head, Arya. Meanwhile, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has resolved to help all sections of the society through the welfare schemes launched by the state and the central government. Expressing gratitude towards party national president JP Nadda, Chouhan said that he has encouraged the workers and the government by praising the efforts. "It is the constant effort of the BJP government that whatever public welfare programs our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji launches, we should ideally implement them down to the lowest level," said Chouhan on Friday. He further said, "We feel proud and have great satisfaction when our national president J P Nadda ji appreciates the works of Madhya Pradesh. Our goal is to build a prosperous and developed Madhya Pradesh and do welfare of the people to build a glorious and powerful India."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-focusses-to-strengthen-support-among-sc-sts/articleshow/83851836.cms||---

There was a 35m landslide in the upper hill and a 40m landslide downhill, cutting off the arterial road link. On Thursday, Kurseong recorded 63.2mm of rainfall. The NH-55 assistant engineer Dinesh Bardewa said, “The landslide was caused due to high intensity rainfall on Thursday night. Two stretches of NH-55 have been badly damaged in Tindharia.” All heavy and mainline traffic has been diverted to the Rohini and Mirik routes from Siliguri to other parts of the Hills. “There is no alternative route for the movement of heavy traffic on the main line because of the severity of the damage to the road,” the assistant engineer said. Locals, though, have the option of taking the short-cut from Bypass to reach Chunbatti, from where they can avail vehicles for Kurseong town around 20km away. Bardewa said it would be an uphill task to repair and restore the road. “Preliminary estimates show it will take a minimum of two months to repair the damaged road,” he said. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) tracks, too, have been affected. “No major damage other than fallen boulders and debris has affected the tracks due to collapse of the highway,” said DHR director Arvind Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/key-darj-link-closed-after-landslides/articleshow/83851829.cms||Deep Gazmer

The assets are in the form of agricultural, residential, and commercial land parcels situated in Rajasthan, Haryana, and New Delhi, along with fixed deposits and bank balances, the agency said in a statement. The ED began an investigation on the basis of an FIR which was filed by the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan police against Mukesh Modi, Rahul Modi, and others of AdarshGroup, officials of Adarsh Credit Cooperative Society Ltd (ACCSL) besides other private persons. The investigation revealed that Mukesh Modi in collusion with his relatives- Virendra Modi, Rahul Modi, Rohit Modi, and associates including the society’s officials, siphoned off depositors’ funds from ACCSL through fraudulent transactions. Mukesh Modi, his relatives, and aides incorporated several companies and firms for the sole purpose of diverting funds from the ACCSL to their real estate business by way of availing fraudulent loans. According to the ED, he also infused huge proceeds of crime (PoC) in these companies as share capital from the ACCSL. Also, a huge amount was diverted and siphoned off by means of exaggerated salaries, incentives, and commissions to his own kin and companies. The agency said that the actions of Mukesh Modi and others caused society a huge loss and deprived several lakhs of investors of their life savings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-366cr-in-adarsh-society-case/articleshow/83856366.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: New policy to pave way for quota in mining allocation||JAIPUR: Rajasthan is set to introduce a reservation system in mines allocation. Quotas will be reserved for SCs, STs, women, young entrepreneurs and differently-able persons in the new mining policy which is at the final stage of preparation. In a review meeting of the mines department, mines and petroleum minister Pramod Jain Bhaya gave directions to the mines department to create provisions for reservations so that the growth becomes inclusive and employment opportunities are created. The state had some form of reservation previously, especially in allocation of quarries, but they were scrapped in 2011-12. Currently, there are hardly any states in the country where such a reservation in allocation of mines exists, said representatives of the mines industry. The minister’s meeting with the officials of the mines department comes three days after the chief minister’s review of the mines department. The department is currently working on the preparation of the draft on reservation quota in mines allocation and is expected to be ready in a fortnight. Additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Subodh Agarwal said, “We are working on the draft and it will be ready very soon. After that the final draft will be sent to the finance and law departments for vetting.” When asked for details of the quota system, Agarwal declined to flesh out further saying they are working on the draft and it has not been finalised as yet. However, when TOI spoke to representatives of the mining industry, they said that reservation will not yield the inclusive growth the government wants to achieve. “We should not go back. We have to move ahead. I doubt that reservation will achieve the objectives that the government is looking to achieve,” said an industry representative preferring anonymity. Rather, the government should focus on illegal mining which is going on without much hurdle. Bhaya, too, admitted that illegal mining needs to be curbed and directed the officials to strengthen vigilance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-quota-in-mining-allocation-new-policy-to-pave-the-way/articleshow/83856445.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The transporters were up in arms against the transport department after it had made the new reflector strips mandatory to pass the fitness tests. Pune’s deputy regional transport officer Sanjiv Bhor told TOI that the transport department had issued a fresh circular regarding the amendment on Thursday. “According to the new circular, the vehicles with the old reflector strips and the certificate from the dealer, would not be forced to get new strips and their vehicles would pass the fitness test. The regulation applied for all commercial vehicles, including autorickshaws. But, there were some vehicles that didn’t have the old certificates, but still had the old reflector tapes,” he said. Earlier, the transporters had alleged that the state government’s March order had made it compulsory for all commercial vehicles to have new reflector strips from three companies in Maharashtra. “These three companies have a lesser reach in the market here and many transporters were not able to get these new reflectors with QR codes imprinted. Moreover, the cost of these new reflector strips is Rs60 per square feet against the earlier Rs20 per square feet,” Baba Shinde, president of Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatna, said. He claimed many vehicles were stranded at the Dive Ghat facility of the Pune regional transport office (RTO) in Purandar due to the issue. “We still don’t know whether the fresh circular issued is also applicable for heavy vehicles or just autorickshaws,” Shinde said. An RTO official said, “ Apart from the vehicles that don’t have the old certificates, all other vehicles are getting tested and passed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/norms-eased-for-vehicles-with-old-reflector-strips/articleshow/83851834.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||After RT-PCR only order, Covid positivity jumps in Maharashtra, 18 districts||MUMBAI: Covid-19 test positivity rates for districts as well as the state increased significantly a day after the state government ruled that weekly positivity rates (WPR) for its district-wise, multi-level unlock plan would be calculated only on the basis of RT-PCR reports. At least 18 districts have reported a rise in WPR as per the revised norms, of which 13 districts now have a weekly positivity rate of over 5%, considered low enough by international standards (including those set by the World Health Organisation) to ease Covid restrictions. Previously, the state’s multi-level unlock plan looked at the positivity rate of both RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests (RAT). Twelve districts, including Kolhapur, Sangli, Palghar, Sindhudurg, Pune and Satara, have a positivity rate of over 10% that puts them in the stringent Level 4 restrictions. The Covid positivity rates of other districts too have increased, but are below 5%; Mumbai is one of them with its rate revised from 3.7% last week to 4.7% now. The overall state average as per the new calculations for the June 19-25 period went up to 8.7% from 5.2% last week when positivity rate included both RAT and RT-PCR tests. A total of 36,043 people tested positive on RT-PCR in the week ending on June 25. Overall, nearly 15 lakh tests were conducted, of which 4.16 lakh were conducted using RT-PCR, while the rest used RAT. Apart from the change in WPR calculation, the state government has added stricter restrictions by doing away with the first two levels of its unlock plan that allowed several relaxations such as opening up of malls. Now, Level 3 is the base, resulting in districts that were eligible for Level 1 and 2 restrictions slipping to Level 3. As per the revised formula, any change in status can occur only after a two-week ‘declining trend’ as against one week previously. In the last two months, the state government's dependence on antigen tests has increased drastically. While the ratio used to be 70:30 between RT-PCR and RAT tests, only 41% of the tests conducted in June so far have been done using RT-PCR. Districts such as Buldhana, Gadchiroli, Sangli, Osmanabad and Palghar report even lower rates at 20%. Although known for its ability to deliver quick results, rapid antigen tests are not considered to be very accurate and are known to give false negative results. Hence experts don’t recommend their use in high numbers. RT-PCR is, on the other hand, considered to be the gold standard for detecting Covid-19. The reason for depending on RT-PCR tests is clear if one looks at Mumbai's testing statistics. On June 25, the city performed 17,200 antigen tests and 16,600 RT-PCR tests. The positivity rate for antigen tests was close to 1% while the RT-PCR positivity was almost 4% and the overall rate was little above 2%. Mumbai is among the few districts that conducts nearly 50% of its total tests through the RT-PCR route, but many districts don’t. "We realised that some of the districts were conducting random antigen tests to bring their positivity rate to make them eligible to open up. But, this kind of an approach was not giving us the correct results and so the revision was done,'' said a senior official from the state government. A doctor with the state government's public health department said positivity rates in certain pockets indicate that the second Covid wave is still raging. "Kolhapur, Sangli, Sindhudurg account for 40% of the daily cases reported from Maharashtra," he said. Their RT-PCR positivity score is not surprisingly high and invite the highest level of restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-rt-pcr-only-order-vity-jumps-in-state-18-dists/articleshow/83881258.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kolkata||IIEST Shibpur ex-students’ model village awarded in London||KOLKATA: Two architecture passouts of IIEST Shibpur, who have now formed their own start-up company, had adopted Jaugram, a village in Burdwan, two years ago, to give the villagers ideas of low cost homes, restore ponds for pisciculture, help them with better models of agriculture and irrigation and give their children a school to go to. The self-sustainable model was selected to be exhibited and awarded at the prestigious London Design Biennale, 2021. The duo – Ayan Roy and Soumyodeep Das – however, could not be present at the ceremony on Thursday at Somerset House because of the Covid-19 situation here, but IIEST alumni in London represented them. After getting their B Arch from IIEST in 2017, the two batchmates worked as interns in Malaysia where they planned to form their start-up VBridge, that will take architecture to the grassroots. They selected Jaugram, where poverty and underutilisation of available resources made people migrate. The village had a ramshackle building for a government aided primary school, which remained flooded in the monsoons. The duo decided to rebuild it first and make Kalupukur Shishu Shiksha Kendra a happier place for kids. They were able to do this just before Covid-19 started and headmistress Jharna Biswas, came forward to bridge the gap between the two and the villagers. Even the local panchayat was interested. “We have called this vernacular architecture because we have shown how low cost buildings can be built that will withstand for a long time,” said Roy. The model was praised in the Biennale especially because of the use of a technique, “biophilic architecture”, in the model. The village has more than 100 ponds but they were largely not utilised. That done, simple techniques of pisciculture were taught and now the ponds teem with fish. “We are really happy at the way we have started earning from the village resources,”said Tanmoy Ghosh a farmer who has worked as a surveyor for the architects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iiest-ex-students-model-village-awarded-in-london/articleshow/83851915.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

He said there is complete peace in the state after abrogation of Article 370. "The Prime Minister's meeting held yesterday with J&K leaders has been very commendable. All the leaders present have taken the meeting positively with great hope. With the initiatives and vision of Prime Minister, Jammu and Kashmir will soon emerge as destination of peace and prosperity, instead of terrorism," said Tomar while talking to reporters at the state BJP office here. The BJP minister who arrived in the morning to attend party's ‘Chintan Baithak' and SCs-STs meeting said Jammu and Kashmir is moving towards a new tomorrow. “There is an atmosphere of harmony. The elections from panchayats to zilla panchayats have been completed in a good atmosphere. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has sanctioned a huge amount for the development of panchayats in Jammu and Kashmir. I believe that the state is now moving towards a new tomorrow. In the field of agriculture and marketing of agriproducts, the Government of India is working at a great pace," said Tomar. On the ongoing farmers’ agitation to repeal new farm laws, the Union minister said farmers interest have been protected and be rest assured that there could be no harm to farmers during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure. "Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last seven years agriculture and farming sector have been given all facilities whether the Prime Minister crop insurance or infrastructure fund of ₹one lakh crore or provision for food processing," he said. "The farmers have produced bumper crops and the government is making all efforts to buy it and is also increasing the procurement price every year. The MSP (minimum support price) has been increased one and a half times so the farmers have no problems. Farmers across the country have stood with the (farm) bills. There are some unions who have objections," Tomar further said. The BJP leader also hit out at the Congress for raising doubts over the vaccination drive. "Congress from top to bottom (leadership) only raise questions. When Congress was in power, it could not solve nation’s problems. We all should be proud of the fact that Corona began in February 2020 and in April the Prime Minister formed a task force to prepare vaccines. In nine months in December 2020 the vaccine was ready and from January 21, the Prime Minister launched first vaccine and started vaccination with our medical and paramedical staff," Tomar recalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/jk-heading-towards-a-new-dawn-tomar/articleshow/83851906.cms||---

The plan to set up 22 automated driving test track (ADTT)s across the state has been delayed due to the pandemic said state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne. The decision to come up with ADTTs was taken late last year and officials had then said that the new tracks would be operational by 2022. Another official told TOI that since the learner’s licence test has gone online, the permanent licence test needed to be stricter. “Presently, permanent licence seekers have to manoeuvre along the test track and convince the RTO inspector that they have control over the vehicle on any road (straight or bumpy), know how to park a vehicle and get it out of a parking area and, recognize road signs and signals. There will be certain additions to the test which are being discussed,” he said. Sources said early discussions touched upon including a written test before anyone goes for the permanent licence test. In March this year, there was talk of providing driving simulators at all the RTO offices across the state. “There have been incidents where learner’s licence seekers were using dummy candidates for online tests. There are middlemen who are contacting the examinees and offering to take the exam for money. The transport department is developing an artificial intelligence-based system which will tighten this process. A system is being developed wherein people appearing for the examination have to keep the web camera on and IP addresses can be checked,” the official said. In Pune, permanent licence tests for two-wheelers are conducted at the Alandi Road RTO facility and tests for four-wheelers take place at the Institute of Driving Training and Research (IDTR) in Pimpri Chinchwad. “In Pune the tracks are sensor-enabled. If more such tracks come up in other parts of the state, getting a permanent licence will not be an easy job,” a source in the Pune RTO told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tests-for-permanent-driving-licence-to-become-tougher/articleshow/83851878.cms||Joy Sengupta

The man identified as Azhar Guddu, a resident of Katra village in Medniganj area of Pratapgarh, surrendered in the local court, after which he was booked under Sections 419, 376, 506 and 406 of IPC at Kotwali police station of Pratapgarh. The victim, in her FIR, also alleged that the family members of the accused, including his brother Waqar Ahmad and his father, had threatened to leak her vulgar videos if she approached the police. IG, Prayagraj range, K P Singh, told TOI that the accused had surrendered in a local court on June 23 and was sent behind the bars. He added that police have been probing the case thoroughly and stern action would be initiated. The victim, a resident of Balipur village in Pratapgarh district, told police that Azhar came in her contact in 2017 when she was pursuing industrial training from Pratapgarh. The accused told the victim that his name was Ankit Mishra, and he was the son of Prem Sagar. He then raped her several times on the pretext of marriage. The victim also alleged that Azhar even had a fake account by the name of Ankit Mishra on social media, and kept on chatting with her. He promised that he would marry her once his sister’s marriage was solemnized. On May 14, Azhar told the woman that he was married, and later disclosed his real identity. When the victim visited the house of the accused in Katra village of Medniganj, his father and brother threatened her of dire consequences and said that they had many vulgar videos of her which they would upload on social media if she dared to report the matter to the police. She also claimed that the accused and his family duped her of Rs 3 lakh, and said that they would fight the case with this money if she dared to approach the police.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: State assured of 1.1cr doses in July, vax hesitancy now a hurdle||Mumbai: The state government has been assured of 1.1 crore vaccine doses in July, which includes the share for the private sector, said public health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday as Maharashtra became the first state to reach the milestone of administering three crore doses. The minister said Maharashtra can complete immunising the rest of the adult population within 3 months if it receives adequate doses from the Centre. “We have done the highest vaccinations in the country. Our capacity is to do 10lakh vaccinations per day. We have already given three crore doses and can deliver another six crores in 2.5months to 3months. That way we can finish vaccinating 9crore,” he said. Tope said that the queues and the eagerness for vaccination have diminished. Figures underscore the absence of eagerness even in the most vulnerable groups. The above-45 years lot accounts for more than 70% deaths in Maharashtra, but less than 10% of them have taken both doses. Only one-third (1.22crore) are partially vaccinated in this bracket. In the younger category of 18-44 years, around 7.6% have taken the first dose and less than 1% (0.43%) is fully vaccinated. The drive for the 18-44 group resumed at government-run centres last week after being suspended since May 12. The trend in Mumbai is no different—merely 40% of senior citizens are completely vaccinated while 45% are partially vaccinated. The data suggests an estimated 15% in this group may not have taken a single dose. In the 45-59 age group, 53% have taken the first dose and 11% have taken both. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said Mumbai has a long road ahead as merely 10% of the estimated adult population of 93lakh has completed immunisation. “We can vaccinate more than 1lakh people daily, but supply has to be consistent,” she said. Among healthcare workers, 4.38lakh are partially inoculated and 8.25lakh have taken both doses. They are estimated to be around 15 lakh, but the number is being constantly as more recruitments are made during the pandemic. Among frontline workers, a staggering 11.89lakh are still partially vaccinated, which has become a matter of concern. The drive to immunise health workers and other frontline staff began in January. State officials said double registration in Co-Win could be pulling down the second dose coverage numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-assured-of-1-1cr-doses-in-july-vax-hesitancy-now-a-hurdle/articleshow/83856763.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Earlier, the ministry of education has asked the varsity authorities to send the details of courses taught by AU so that a common entrance test could be conducted for admission at all the central universities of the country. This is proposed to be held by the National Testing Agency (NTA) which would pave the way for admission in all the central universities of the country, including AU. However, after AU providing the details sought by the ministry, varsity authorities have not been informed of any further instructions as to when this common entrance test would be conducted. Meanwhile, the AU administration has decided to go ahead with conducting the admissions for professional courses of its own. The idea is to make the preparations and if the ministry says that it would hold test for professional courses too, the process would be put on hold. “Since the entire process for conducting any entrance test requires preparations for at least around two months, we decided to go ahead with making the preparations and conducting then entrance test for selective professional courses run on the campus including all the courses run under the Institute of Professional Studies (IPS)”, says director admissions, Prof I R Siddiqui. He further informed that the courses in which AU intent to conduct the entrance test and the follow-up admission include Law Five year integrated course and LLB along with MBA, MFA (masters in fine arts) MEd, etc. Sources told TOI that Au has not yet decided whether these entrance test would be conducted in offline or online mode but probably this would be held somewhere in August or early September. It is also learnt that the core committee of the admissions has decided to move ahead with the process of holding the entrance test of the professional courses after the approval of the vice-chancellor Prof Sangita Srivastava. Sources also inform that AU is still awaiting the instructions of the ministry in terms of conducting entrance test and follow-up admissions through NTA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-to-hold-entrance-test-for-admission-to-professional-courses/articleshow/83850861.cms||---

The bride’s objection was that the groom’s family had not told her family about the poor eye-sight of the boy. According to reports, Arjun Singh of Jamalipur village had fixed his daughter Archana’s marriage with Shivam, hailing from Maharajpur area of the district. The bride’s family had gifted the groom a motorcycle and some cash in advance. On June 20, when the `baraatis’ reached the village to solemnise the marriage, they were given a warm welcome by the bride’s parents and other guests and served with snacks. Ahead of the `jaimaal’ ceremony, when the bride’s family noticed that the groom was constantly wearing a pair of glasses, they asked him to remove it and read a newspaper. Shockingly, the groom could not read the newspaper without glasses. On coming to know that the groom had poor eye-sight and couldn’t read without glasses, the bride refused to marry him and walked away from the ‘mandap’ saying she would not marry a person with poor eye-sight. The groom’s family and the local police tried to persuade her to go ahead and solemnize the ceremony but she refused to budge. “We were shocked when the groom failed to read the newspaper. They (family of the groom) kept us in the dark about his poor eye-sight,” said Arjun Singh, the bride’s father and added, “It was a very awkward situation for all of us as well as a matter of prestige. The groom’s family has cheated us.” The bride’s father later filed a complaint with the local police. “We have booked the groom under relevant sections of IPC. The bride’s side has demanded that the groom’s family return the dowry, including cash and motorcycle. Investigations are continuing,” said inspector Kotwali Sanjay Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/groom-fails-to-read-newspaper-without-glasses-bride-refuses-to-marry/articleshow/83852596.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

These girls have not only skilled themselves in these male-dominated crafts, but are also supporting their families financially. When most of the commercial activities remained closed, these girls successfully completed the orders worth lakhs of rupees during the second phase of the pandemic without violating the Covid-19 protocol. A group of 15 girls and women could be seen busy in pink enamelling (Gulabi Meenakari) in Lalghat Gaighat locality. These girls, including Shalini Yadav, Anju Seth, Kajal Yadav, Roshani Verma and others, have been trained by national merit awardee and expert of pink enamelling Tarun Kumar under Kashika project of Human Welfare Association supported by the Titan under corporate social responsibility initiative. One of these girls Shalini Yadav had even presented a live demonstration of this art before the Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hastkala Sankul in Bada Lalpur in February 2019. Earlier, the master trainer Tarun Kumar had also got an opportunity to demonstrate the art before the French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigittee Marie-Claude during their visit to Varanasi in March 2018. They were accompanied by PM Modi. A pair of beautiful pink enamelled ‘Jhumka’ was presented to the French First Lady on the occasion. The Gulabi Meenakari is a Geographical Indication (GI) tagged art of Varanasi. The GI expert Dr Rajni Kant of HWA said that Meenakari or enamelling is an art of decorating a metal surface by fusing mineral substances on it. It was introduced in India by the Mughals. This art was prosperous till about a hundred years ago. “Generally, the art of pink enamelling is mostly done by the male artisans, but these girls broke male dominance in this art,” said Kant, adding that the girls took a three-year training under the project. Even during the pandemic period, they completed the order of several lakhs of rupees. Similarly, another group of 15 women artisans also skilled themselves in zardozi craft on fine silk, organza and khadi fabric under the guidance of master trainer Shadab Alam at Chandrapur in Lohata area. Two of them, Tarannum and Afsana had also caught the attention of the French President during the demonstration of handmade emblem of French Flag by them. Macron had appreciated their work and expressed his happiness by shaking hands with them. Kant said that the region has a great potential of handicrafts, which is attracting the women artisans also now. According to him, in eastern UP approximately 1.5 million people are involved in the handicraft and weaving sector. About 26% of handicraft items come from UP, which is the highest in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/covid-pandemic-fails-to-hurdle-success-of-women-artisans-in-kashi/articleshow/83852468.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Denizens tighten purse strings as fuel prices continue to skyrocket||COIMBATORE: Even though there is not much work during the lockdown period, Madukkarai-based electrician B Dhandapani travels to his workplace at Town Hall on his two-wheeler every day. Dhandapani doesn’t know when he would get work. But he cannot afford to miss whatever comes his way. Whether he manages to find work or not, he has to shell out Rs 200 every day on fuel. With every passing week, the amount he spends on fuel keeps increasing due to rising fuel prices. On Friday, petrol price touched almost Rs 100 a litre in Coimbatore. “Two years ago, I used to fill petrol for Rs 150 every day. But now I spend Rs 50 more. I have been spending close to Rs Rs 6,000 per month, which is about 40% of my family’s earning, on fuel,” said Dhandapani, whose wife works as a domestic worker at Ganapathy. “Earlier, she used to travel by bus to her workplace. But now that bus services are temporarily suspended due to the lockdown, I have to drop her. Unlike mine, her salary is fixed and nowadays, we are managing expenses with her salary. So, I have no option but to drop her. Even if my work gets over early, I have to wait for her till she finishes her work,” he told TOI. Like the Dhandapanis, most of the families in the district are affected because of the petrol price hike. While some are cutting down on petrol expenses by limiting vehicle usage, others are bearing the brunt. M Gunasekaran, a Keeranatham-based graphic designer, has been spending at least Rs 150 a day on fuel to travel to his workplace at Gandhipuram. “We have limited buses from Keeranatham and also, I fear Covid infection during use of public transportation. I have been spending about 25% of my salary on fuel. At times, I am forced to fill power petrol, which is a few rupees higher than the normal petrol, because of non-availability of normal petrol.” Arun Kumar Unnikrishnan, a resident of Vellalore, has decided to use his motorcycle instead of his car to save on fuel. “Two years ago, I used to fill petrol for about Rs 500 to Rs 600 a week. Now, I spend Rs 1,000. I used to use my car often, but now I have decided to use car only when it is absolutely necessary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/denizens-tighten-purse-strings-as-fuel-prices-continue-to-skyrocket/articleshow/83856632.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Ridden with typos and falsehoods, this was among the 3,000 forwarded messages ranging from “Doctors are saying 18 years unmarried men turn transgender if they put vaccine” to “Varsha Gaikwad (school education minister) says school fees will be cut off for the coming year” that TOI busted as fake recently through its new campaign ‘Times Verified’. Since its launch on April 17, the initiative, that aims to break the chain of viral misinformation and disinformation, has received over 7,500 unverified or suspicious messages from readers for verification on the WhatsApp number 9819432222. And our expert panel—comprising reporters, editors and representatives from the BMC and the government—have been busy clearing the air by tapping into their credible bank of sources. In the last few weeks, the panel has not only called out scams pertaining to adoption of children whose parents were affected during Covid, but also dismissed absurdities such as “bulbs lighting up automatically at the vaccinated area” with a bold red stamp that cried: “This message is fake.” Stressing on the dangers of this parallel wave of false news, US-based physician Dr Seema Yasmin recently urged readers to identify red flags such as information that is packaged to be “very certain”. Even as misinformation continues to spread faster than microbes in the face of an inevitable third wave of Covid-19, trust TOI to alert you to such red flags and vaccinate you with the truth. Forward all dubious, anxiety-causing messages to our expert panel, and let the green tick in the ‘Times Verified’ logo counter the tyranny of the grey curved arrow of forwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-toi-red-flags-3000-viral-fake-messages/articleshow/83860604.cms||---

According to TS Rajamani, president of the union, all the seven NTC mills – five mills in Coimbatore and one each in Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga districts – were closed in April 2020 following the lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. But even after the government had relaxed the lockdown norms and allowed industries/mills to operate following the lockdown restrictions, the mills were not operated. Subsequently, trade unions had staged multiple protests demanding the higher-ups to operate the mills. “Following the continuous protest, the Union government had granted permission to operate three mills – one each in Coimbatore, Sivaganga and Ramanthapuram districts – with 50% manpower. Citing several reasons including fund crunch, they refused to operate remaining mills,” he said. With the help of members of Parliament, we met Union government officials and they in turn had assured us that all the remaining NTC mills would be brought to operating stage gradually before March 31, 2021, he said and added that nothing has been implemented on ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/take-measures-to-operate-ntc-mills-urge-workers/articleshow/83856682.cms||---

The move will help GMB upgrade and develop port-led economic activities. GMB’s action represents the resolution of the long pending issue of land survey around the 11 ports. Manjo Das, additional chief secretary (ACS), chief minister’s office, and in charge ACS, ports & transport department, had directed the immediate completion of the survey. He said that the port sector is expected to witness major growth in the coming years and for that, land adjoining the state’s ports is highly valuable. “The land survey had not been completed for some or the other reason,” Das said. “Technically, GMB owns land adjoining all ports. The CM wanted the land survey completed.” Das said that GMB has also been directed to prepare the land-use plan for this 2,286 hectares and take measures to prevent encroachment or misuse. “The government is planning to increase the capacity of all the ports and also to promote ancillary industries in the vicinity of these ports,” he said. “So this new land available to GMB will help in boosting the port-led development in the state further.” Gujarat has also recently invited global bids for the development of a greenfield port at Nargol located in South Gujarat through the public-private partnership with an extended BOOT (build-own-operate-transfer) period of 50 years. The state government expects over Rs 4,000 crore in fresh investments through this project. The Government of Gujarat is setting a precedent by keeping the initial BOOT period for Nargol port development at 50 years, rather than the 30 usually offered for greenfield port development in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gmb-acquires-2286ha-land/articleshow/83851978.cms||Kapil Dave

For example, our MoUs with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), realized from the fact that one of our strengths is liquid cargo. So, when we initially identify the potential areas, we focus on those areas which have a growth potential and discuss with the stakeholders in those areas, finally reaching the MoU stage,” said CPT chairman M Beena. According to her, the projects will be completed within a two-year period. “We are progressing with the target of bringing a visible change and hence we are aspiring to finish the projects by 2024,” Beena added. Manufacturing industries usually serve as the main source of inward or outward cargo movement for any port, but in Kerala, the story is different. CPT’s hinterland so lacks a healthy manufacturing industry. Further, there is Tuticorin Port which is a competitor as it is equidistant to the Cochin Port, for those industries in southern Kerala. With this background, CPT is coming up with the new projects with an overall project cost of Rs 3,108 crore. The port is providing the land and the entities concerned are investing there to set up the necessary infrastructure. For development of the port, four MoUs with a total project cost of Rs 989 crore were signed. Establishment of a multispecialty hospital at a cost of Rs 175 core, connecting Cochin Port with minor ports in the state and establishing a multi-modal logistics hub, seaplane connectivity between Kochi and Lakshadweep, deepening and broadening of channels, building a cryogenic warehouse, cement import-cum-bagging terminal, aviation fuel terminal, port-based edible oil refining unit at Muvattupuzha, petrochemical terminal, coir product consolidation centre are some of the projects CPT is pursuing now. A container freight station for coastal cargo — facility for de-stuffing of containers, storage and warehousing is also part of the new projects. Cochin Port has signed a MoU with Kottayam Port and ICD Services for offering inland container depot services for exim (export-import) as well as coastal cargo, linked through national waterway. Also, BPCL will develop HSD export facility at MULT (multi-user liquid terminal) at Puthuvype, as part of the various projects envisioned by the Cochin Port.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpt-aims-to-get-world-class-facilities/articleshow/83849983.cms||Shenoy Karun

On June 14, MP had 1,280 patients left, followed by Delhi, which had 1,767 cases. If all states and Union Territories are taken together, MP is at seventh position in active cases. Jharkhand, whose Covid tally is less than half of MP’s, is the lone state ahead with 1,224 active cases. With nearly 7.9 lakh cases, MP is 13th on the national chart in cumulative count. On Friday, MP’s active count dropped to 1,110. Two months ago, it was more than 91,000. The state’s positivity rate is among the lowest in the country at 0.07%. Dadra and Nagar Haveli has the least number of active cases, followed by Andaman and Nicobar, Chandigarh, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Jharkhand and then Madhya Pradesh. All of them have a fraction of MP’s population; even Jharkhand has less than half. Health officials point out that the drop from nearly 1 lakh active cases to close to 1,000 in around eight weeks is among the fastest in the country. It’s because of increased awareness, stricter compliance with Covid precautions and the two-month-long lockdown, they say, adding that this experience, plus vaccination, will prove effective in tackling the third wave if it hits MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-has-least-active-cases-among-big-covid-19-states/articleshow/83852036.cms||Amarjeet Singh

This is part of the CPT’s plan to convert the southern tip of the Willingdon Island into a water sports-based tourism centre. “Seaplane is one of the projects we are trying to promote, which is under the Centre government’s Udaan scheme. We already have a landing for refuelling and we have proposed that this location could be used for connecting to the island of Lakshadweep,” said CPT traffic manager Vipin R Menoth. Menoth said the Sagarmala Development Company will be coming up with a detailed project report for this. CPT had recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the district tourism promotion council (DTPC) to develop Cochin water sports complex-cum-pavilion at the island. This includes development of basic amenities for adventure water sports, training and recreation. Also, the project focuses on entrepreneurship development for aqua and adventure tourism startups in Kerala proposed at walkway near BoT bridge at Thoppumpady. “We have land at the southern reclamation area away from the main channels of the port, which is far from the core operational area and we are proposing to use it for tourism. That is where water sports events for which the DTPC has done some initial work and they have submitted the report to the department of tourism,” Menoth added. CPT has also signed an MoU with Greenix Ventures Pvt Ltd for developing tourism-related projects at Willingdon Island. A museum, Bristow Café, home stay, mini-theme park and ferris wheel, water sports, amphitheatre, planetarium and astronomy club, light and sound show, film shooting facilities, helicopter services to nearby places, and performing art centre are planned here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpt-explores-seaplane-connectivity-to-dweep/articleshow/83850014.cms||Shenoy Karun

The boxes were distributed to all the 535 students studying in Classes V to X in the school. The Padana Gift project is implemented at a cost of around Rs 2.5 lakh with the help of various organizations. Besides the gift box, smartphones too were given to around 42 selected students, who have no access to online education. The smartphone distribution cost around Rs 3 lakh and both the programmes were implemented by the school through the sponsorships from various organizations, old students’ association, parent-teacher association (PTA) and the teachers. “Each of the gift box costs around Rs 450 and it contains 10 notebooks, instrument box, fountain pen, ink, five chart papers, 20 A4 sheets, crayons, pens. As Reading Day and Environment Day is in June, we also added a sapling and a book in each kit. Children’s books were given to students up to upper primary level, for others it was Malayalam novels and short stories. It is the first time such a large-scale programme was held by any government school in Kerala,” said C S Vishnuraj, a faculty. The distribution was launched by headmistress Jolly Sebastian, who said that the programme was held to help the students who are struggling to get learning accessories and stationery items due to the pandemic. The kits were collected by the parents from the school adhering to Covid protocols and only around five students, who are Covid positive, are yet to collect the kits. School principal P Geetha said that notebooks are being collected for higher secondary students too through voluntary contribution under Notebook Challenge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/school-gifts-learning-kits-to-students/articleshow/83850047.cms||---

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is providing the vaccines as required to the state and we are getting more and more vaccine doses administered in the state. Madhya Pradesh has set a record for administering the maximum number of vaccines in a day. This is Modi Vaccine, it is not just a dose, but it is life in itself. Every person in the state is being vaccinated and protected from corona. Chouhan said that Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Faggan Singh Kulaste have played a commendable role in setting up Covid Care Centers and providing other facilities to Madhya Pradesh. “I express my heartfelt gratitude to both the ministers”. Besides, a hospital was built near the refinery in Bina to facilitate oxygen supply. If there is a third wave of corona in the state, these Covid Care Centres will prove to be a milestone in corona treatment. Chouhan was speaking after virtually dedicating a 100-bedded Covid Care Center constructed by MOIL (Manganese Ore India Limited) at Mandla. Dharmendra Pradhan said that Madhya Pradesh has presented an ideal in the country in Covid control. Here, Covid control brought about with public participation is commendable. Now, the chief minister has made vaccination a mass movement in Madhya Pradesh. Vaccination is being done at a fast pace in Madhya Pradesh. He lauded the state government for adopting an effective strategy for vaccinations, oxygen management, availability of Remdesivir etc., corona treatment, ideal system of home isolation and "micro containment" zones. Faggan Singh Kulaste felicitated the team of MOIL, chief minister Chouhan, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan for the construction of Covid Care Center in the district. He said that MOIL is sponsoring the setting up of Covid Care Centers at many places in the state. State health minister Prabhuram Choudhary said that Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan has extended support in the construction of Covid hospitals in Bina, Budhni and Bhopal. For this, he deserves to be lauded. Member of Parliament Sampatia Uikey said that people of Mandla district would get better health facilities with the construction of the Covid Care Center.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/centres-assistance-crucial-in-controlling-corona-in-mp-cm/articleshow/83852062.cms||---

Students said that if they have to attend colleges from July 1, colleges should be asked to ensure that they get at least the first dose. “I have tried to get the vaccine a couple of times, from the primary health care centre (PHC) and at a special camp organized in the city. Both the times, after waiting for over 2 hours, I was asked to come back some other day citing vaccine shortage,” said Vinay V, a final year Electronics and Communications Engineering student. He said that as examinations are scheduled to begin from July 5, colleges should organise special drives and ensure that at least final year students get vaccinated immediately. In Telangana, while there about 15-20 lakh students studying in undergraduate and postgraduate courses, until now about 31 lakh people in the age group of 18-44 have got vaccinated. Even now, there is not much clarity on when students will get access to the free vaccine as those aged between 18-30 are unable to book free vaccination slots through CoWIN. Vaccination centres in the state seem to be following different rules as many are only administering the vaccine to the 45+ age group and others to those above ages of 30. Students in various colleges and universities said that it would be better if special vaccination drives are held in colleges. They said that most of the students are not yet vaccinated and added that not everyone is in a position to afford the paid vaccine.  A few centres, however, are administering the vaccine to 18+ age group.  “While I got my second dose, my cousin, who lives in the western corridor, went to two PHCs today, but did not get the vaccine as she was told that they are only administering it to those aged about 45,” A Srinidhi, a final year electrical engineering student said. Student leaders said that the government should conduct exams only after students are administered at least their first dose. “Colleges should be directed to conduct special drives at their campuses. If not, at least all PHCs should be asked to give vaccination to students. Only after students get their first dose, exams should be conducted,” said J Dileep of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). Faculty working at technical colleges also demanded the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-cry-foul-no-vaccine-for-18/articleshow/83856800.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Kochi||Drunken brawl: Man held for killing mom’s partner||Thiruvananthapuram: The Pangode police on Friday arrested a 39-year-old man on charges of murdering his mother’s partner during a drunken brawl. Police identified the accused as Shiju alias Baiju of Four Cent Colony near Pangode. Biju (49) is the deceased. He died on Wednesday night at Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) while under treatment. He was living-in with Shiju’s mother. Pangode police station house officer (SHO) Philip Sam said that there was no personal rivalry between the two men. The death is suspected to be the result of a drunken brawl that went out of control. The alleged brawl happened around 3pm at Chanthamukku, which is around 500m away from the Pangode police station, on June 17. “According to the statement of the accused, it was Biju who started the fight following a verbal spat. He pushed Shiju down. Though he helped Shiju get up, the latter, who became furious, pushed Biju down on the road and started banging his head repeatedly on the tarmac,” Sam said. People who were nearby rushed to the spot and took Biju to Kadakkal government taluk hospital. He was later admitted to the ICU of GMCH. On Wednesday night, he died. Police have registered a case on unnatural death.  On Friday, the police surgeon who performed a post-mortem examination told the investigating officers that the death was caused by severe injuries suffered on head during the fight. Following this, police have invoked relevant sections of murder and arrested the accused. He would be produced before the court on Saturday, Sam said. The brawl took place a day after the government liquor shops were opened at various places after lockdown restrictions were relaxed. But, the liquor shops in Pangode panchayat were not opened as the panchayat was listed under D Category owing to high test positivity rate (TPR) of Covid cases. “They might have procured the alcohol with the help of friends from outside the panchayat,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/drunken-brawl-man-held-for-killing-moms-partner/articleshow/83850119.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic officials said no operator was willing to run these facilities for the past one and a half years. DDMA guidelines have, so far, kept operation of swimming pools and spa centers banned for most part of last year. A municipal official informed that the civic body has seven swimming pools under the community services department, which were developed for public use. “Private agencies are reluctant to take over operations as the source of income has gone down, while maintenance cost is high. The Shalimar Bagh facility was taken over by a contractor, but it left the operation after two months due to losses,” the official added. Another municipal official said the pools were also used to train schoolkids and charged Rs 800 monthly from outsiders. “The operation of pools is expensive. The operator is also expected to keep lifeguards, coaches, and other safety equipment. The civic body had decided to outsource the facilities in 2016. However, low monthly user fee for public has led to revenue losses for private contractors,” the official added. The civic body has pools in Janana park, Chandni Chowk; UV block Shalimar Bagh; Rohini Sector 14; Rohini Sector 3 near central school; Majlis park; C2 Keshavpuram and BK pocket Shalimar Bagh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-takers-n-corpn-looks-for-its-pools-operators/articleshow/83880247.cms||---

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) received fresh stock of only 25,000 doses of Covishield, which is sufficient for only one day. NMC data showed vaccination happened at only nine of the 112 government run centres in the city on Friday. Three centres — GMCH, Khobragade Hall and Mahal Diagnostic are dedicated centres for Covaxin and allowed only 45+ people. One more centre at Mahal Diagnostic is for Covaxin, but for second dose of 18-44 age group. One centre of Covishield is specially for CRPF personnel. The remaining 108 centres are for Covishield and for 18+ group. Of these centres, only four — AIIMS, IGGMCH, Daga and Mahal Diagnostic — continued inoculations on Friday while 104 remained closed. Activist Narayan Ahuja told TOI, “It is very unfortunate that sufficient doses are not ensured at the centres. State had allowed vaccination of 18-44 age group on May 1 and stopped on May 12 citing shortage of doses. It upset many people. Vaccination for this group resumed two days ago and the situation is still the same. Many people thronged the centres and returned without jab.” The state had resumed vaccination of 18-44 age group on June 23. As against inoculation of 3,000 per day, number of beneficiaries swelled to 23,703 on June 23, including 20,261 of 18-44 age group. On June 24, 20,055 took the jab, including 15,809 from 18-44 age group. Thus, 43,758 people have taken the vaccine, of which 36,070 were from 18-44 age group, in two days. On Friday, the number of beneficiaries dropped to 3,134 in the city. Of these, 2,021 took the jab at government centres and remaining 1,113 at eight private centres. Of total 3,134 beneficiaries, 2,171 were from 18-44 age group. At eight private centres, of which six are administering Covishield and one each of Sputnik V (corporate vaccination) and Covaxin, 1,113 took the jab which is less than the figures in last two days. Vaccination was 1,585 on June 24 and 1,482 on June 23 in private centres. This means number of beneficiaries did not increase in private centres despite unavailability of inoculation at 96% government centres. Vaccination was not affected in rural parts of the district on Friday. Some 18,582 people took the jab of which 13,215 from 18-44 age group. Zilla Parishad (ZP) had 24,000 doses of Covishield before beginning of vaccination on Friday. Due to lack of vaccination in city, the number of beneficiaries dropped to 21,716 in the district on Friday. The figure was 41,721 on June 23 and 37,054 on June 24. NMC officials said the state has supplied 24,000 doses of Covishield for the city on Friday. The civic body received the doses in the evening. Vaccination will resume at all 112 centres and four new ones in the city on Saturday. NMC officials said, “Vaccination will take a hit on Sunday again if we do not receive fresh stock on Saturday. The 24,000 doses are enough for only one day. We have allowed 50% slots at each centre for walk-ins and remaining 50% for online appointments.” The ZP received 16,000 doses, and already has around 5,500 doses left over from earlier stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-vax-at-96-centres-on-fri-after-huge-response-on-2-days/articleshow/83852149.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Besides, the stock availability resulted in Pune district crossing 1 lakh vaccination-mark for the first time on Friday. As per available data, the PMC had vaccinated around 6.62 lakh beneficiaries from the target population of over 9 lakh till Thursday. Health experts said if the vaccine supply remained steady, the entire target population of 45-plus could be vaccinated within the next 30 days in the PMC limits. According to the CoWin dashboard, the district had recorded vaccination of 1.37 lakh people on Friday across its 700 sites (government and private). The earlier highest single day vaccination figure was around 85,000 on April 5. A PMC official said now that many more beneficiaries, who got their first Covishield jab earlier in March and April, are getting eligible, the civic body was making sure their second jab experience remained hassle-free. “We have increased the number of vaccination sites for the 45-plus age group, so that the first and second dose beneficiaries could get inoculated at the earliest,” the official said. Meanwhile, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said they were also focussing on the 45-plus vaccination, especially for the residents of slum and underprivileged groups. “We are arranging the manpower and the specialised vaccination drives will be started soon,” he said, adding that until they begin with the specialised drives, they are giving a boost to the 18-44 age group vaccination drive. On Saturday’s coverage, the PMC will offer the shots from 189 designated Covid vaccination centres, stated a PMC press statement. It said the inoculation drive for the 45-plus category would be conducted across 116 centres, while the 18-44 age group drive would be conducted across 57 centres. For Covaxin, around 16 centres will offer the second dose. In the PCMC limits, 47 vaccination sites will offer Covishield doses for the 18-44 group. The PCMC in a press statement said 90% of the doses will be available for walk-ins and 10% will be available via CoWin app booking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-daily-vaccinations-top-1-lakh-mark-its-highest-so-far/articleshow/83856945.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Kochi||School opens a mobile phone library||Thiruvananthapuram: In a scenario when the state government and private sector are working in tandem to bridge the digital divide that has affected students of the disadvantaged section, the Attingal Government Girls Higher Secondary School has come up with a unique initiative by setting up a ‘mobile library’. Through the mobile library school, authorities aim at lending smartphones to students from needy families who fail to attend online classes. Like borrowing books from a library, students can borrow phones from this school library, which they have to return once they used them. The programme which was kick-started on June 11 by distributing nine smartphones, succeeded in lending 35 phones in 12 days. All school teachers wanted their students to avail the benefits of online classes, so the money to buy smartphones was jointly pooled from their pockets. “By June 22, we could successfully complete the three phases of the mobile library. On June 11 and 18, we distributed nine phones each and, on June 22, 17 smartphones were given to deserving students. Of the 35 phones we distributed, 10 phones were sponsored by a private firm and the rest were bought with the money contributed by the teachers,’‘ said Latha S Nair, headmistress of the school. “When we realized that with the second wave of the pandemic, the classes for this academic year also would be held online, we took the initiative to find out students from our school who do not have smartphones to attend the class. But unfortunately, we found that a few are trying to exploit our good intention by taking this as an opportunity to own a smartphone forever. And amidst this fraudulence, we felt the genuine needs of many deserving students went unnoticed. So, we finally decided to lend smartphones to needy students as we lend books from a library. When they get a new phone, they are supposed to return the phone they borrowed from the school. And the smartphones we bought will be a part of the school assets,” she added.  Students who borrow phones from the mobile library are prohibited from installing any applications besides the apps that contribute to their learning and academics. During the first phase of the programme, preference was given to students who neither have access to television nor smartphone. In the second phase, Class 10 and plus two students, who have to appear for the public exam, were given priority. Besides the classes on the Victers channel, Class 10 and plus two students are given a support class on WhatsApp to prepare them well for their board exam. “Some phones were purchased through online sites while the rest were bought from the shops of our acquaintances. Considering the urgent requirement, we had asked the shop owners to reserve some phones for the purpose,’‘ said Latha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/school-opens-a-mobile-phone-library/articleshow/83850162.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Char Dham Yatra to start from July 1||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand cabinet, chaired by chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Friday, gave its nod to start the Char Dham Yatra for locals of the districts where the shrines are located, from July 1 this year. Talking about the decision, cabinet minister and state government spokesperson, Subodh Uniyal said, “The cabinet has allowed residents of Rudraprayag to visit Kedarnath shrine, Uttarkashi residents to visit Gangotri and Yamunotri while Chamoli residents can visit Badrinath from July 1.” However, there will be a cap on the number of pilgrims to visit the shrines daily and the state government is going to issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the pilgrims going on the yatra, Uniyal added. A negative RT-PCR/antigen test report will be mandatory for every pilgrim who plans to visit any of the four shrines. The state will also ensure that all temple priests are vaccinated before the start of the yatra. Moreover, a senior official will be appointed for each of the four shrines who will be tasked to coordinate with the district administration and Devasthanam Board for the smooth conduct of the yatra. When asked whether Char Dham Yatra will be opened up for pilgrims across the country from July 11 as is being anticipated, the state government spokesperson said the decision in this regard will depend on the overall Covid situation at the time. “There is a concern about the delta-plus variant. We will take it into consideration before we open the Char Dham Yatra for people from other states. The cabinet will meet again and take a call on that,” Uniyal said. Notably, on June 23, the Uttarakhand high court had come down heavily on the state government and termed its decision to open Char Dham shrines for pilgrims as “a recipe for national disaster.” “The court is of the firm opinion that a catastrophe should not be invited by holding and permitting large congregations. Therefore, this court directs the state to review its decision to commence the Char Dham Yatra. Perhaps, the yatra needs to be postponed or cancelled,” the court had said in its order. Besides, as per the provisions of the Uttarakhand Flood Plain Zoning Act 2012, a decision was also taken in the cabinet regarding the notification of the flood plain zones in Tehri, Uttarkashi and Chamoli districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cabinet-gives-nod-for-partial-opening-of-char-dham-yatra-from-july-1-sops-to-be-issued-soon/articleshow/83850123.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Hyderabad||AI-driven model helps get quick diagnosis of virus: KMIT||HYDERABAD: With CT scans emerging as an alternative for early detection of Covid-19, a group of researchers has come up with deep learning models that can assist radiologists for faster and more accurate diagnosis of the virus. With several new Covid-19 variants coming into the picture, CT images are excessively used to identify the virus. Increased bandwidth of CT images consumes a lot of time, resulting in substantial increase in workload of the radiologists. Now, using machine learning and artificial intelligence, researchers from Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology (KMIT) have developed models that can automatically identify Covid-19 regions on CT images. This may significantly reduce the workload of radiologists, KMIT professors said. As part of the research, published in the ‘European Journal of Molecular & Clinical Medicine’, the researchers collected and analysed global dataset of 1,000 CT images that were available in the public domain. “By combining AI-driven computer-aided diagnostic system (CADS), we can improve and assist radiologists for quick, accurate and unbiased diagnosis. We feed the data into the system and train it for three primary models -- automatic lung segmentation, binary classification of Covid-19 and Covid-19 region segmentation,” said Rajasekaran Subramaniam, professor, R&D department, KMIT. He said the proposed deep learning models produce an accuracy of 97 per cent, 98 per cent and 99 per cent respectively.

Police have withheld his identity as he is a relative of the survivors. Police said that the accused sexually abused the girls several times during the past six months. Police have charged him with relevant sections for molestation and sexual abuse under IPC and Pocso Act. Pallickal police station house officer (SHO) R Sreejith said that the accused used to play with them and had a close friendship with them. He exploited this friendship by sexually abusing the girls after inviting them to his house under the pretext of watching television. “A week ago, one of the girls told the matter to another girl while playing. The girl promptly informed the elders following which we received the complaint,” Sreejith said. The case was registered on Tuesday. Following this, the accused went absconding. He was caught from a relative’s house. He was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody. In another case, Kazhakkoottam police on Friday arrested a 21-year-old youth on charges of raping a minor girl and impregnating her. Police identified the accused as Akhinesh Ashok alias Muthu of Vallakkadavu. He was caught from a friend’s house at Vallakkadavu where he was hiding. Police said that the accused went into hiding after police registered a case several days ago based on the complaint filed by the girl’s family.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dists ramp up screening for Delta+ as count rises||Mumbai: Maharashtra’s lone casualty among Delta-Plus cases was an 80-year-old woman who passed away at the civil hospital in Ratnagiri. Doctors said it was challenging to feed her or put her on oxygen support. Her son was moved from a Covid Care Centre to the hospital to stay close to her. Her oxygen levels had plunged critically towards the end. Delta-Plus or ‘AY.1’ has mutated from the highly transmissible Delta variant (B.1.617.2) that was first isolated in India and is currently the predominant strain world over. Of the 21 cases found in Maharashtra, Ratnagiri has reported the highest (9). Three of the nine were children and two were senior citizens. None of the affected adults were immunised. The variant was found between May-end and early June from a batch of 157 samples sent for genome sequencing as a routine exercise. At least six cases were from three different families, unlike the case with Delta where entire families were affected. “Also, none of the affected patients had symptoms drastically different from other classic Covid cases,” Ratnagiri civil surgeon Dr Sanghmitra Phule said. Ratnagiri has intensified tests and is screening nearly 8,000 people daily. Despite the district accounting for more Delta-Plus cases, collector Laxminarayan Mishra said people were reluctant to come forward for testing. The district is awaiting results of another 117 samples sent for sequencing to Delhi’s CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology) lab. The Union health ministry on Friday said 48 cases of Delta-Plus have been found with Maharashtra reporting the highest, followed by seven in MP which includes two deaths. Though there is limited data to link Delta-Plus to high transmissibility or virulence at the moment, Dr Rajesh Pandey, principal scientist at New Delhi’s CSIR-IGIB, said it does hold potential for immune escape and virulence since it has emerged from the Delta variant, which was the major driver of the last surge. “Delta-Plus is already detected globally. More than 10 countries including the UK, the US and Europe have it,” he said, adding that genome sequencing, aggressive contact tracing, local containment and infrastructure build- up will be the main ways to control its spread. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, an advisor to the state, said Delta-Plus should not create unnecessary panic but there shouldn’t be complacency either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dists-ramp-up-screening-for-delta-as-count-rises/articleshow/83857085.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The court remarked that the behaviour of the government “amounted to criminal negligence” and scheduled a special sitting on the matter. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma also said that by denying wages to employees, the state was violating Article 21 (right to life) as well as Article 23 (prohibiting forced labour) of the constitution. The court directed the chief secretary, finance secretary as well as transportation secretary to be present before it on Saturday morning when it will hold a special sitting on the matter. The observations came as the court was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Uttarakhand Roadways Karamchari Union. The HC had in its last hearing directed the government to inform whether it will release Rs 20 crore from the CM relief fund or extend a soft loan to the Uttarakhand transport corporation so it can pay salaries to employees. On Friday, the court was informed that it was not possible for the state to release money from the CM relief fund and that the proposal of the soft loan was still pending with the government. The government further said that it is “willing to grant” Rs 23 crore to the corporation for their loss but was waiting to receive a proposal from the body. The judges held that under the Constitution, the state is bound to protect and promote the lives of people and ensure that no employee works without payment of his “rightful wages”. The court order read: “Since the State is required to behave as a model employer, the State, by violating the provisions of the Constitution of India and the provisions of the Labour Laws, becomes an exploiter, and that too, a ruthless exploiter of its people.” The court also expressed surprise that the transport secretary had failed to bring the plight of his workers to the notice of finance secretary “despite the fact that both of them live and work in the same city” adding that the “lack of communication between the two department does not forebode well about the functioning of the government”. The bench said that it is surprised, if not shocked, that the government “has turned a Nelson’s eye towards the plight of its own people who have been suffering financially for the last five months”. “Even the loan amount that the state claims that it is ‘willing to disburse’, is still stuck in the red-tapism of the bureaucracy, as the file continues to be kept in animated suspension in the government,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-salary-to-roadways-employees-for-months-hc-raps-state/articleshow/83850196.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Pune||CoWin feature to get more options to address issues of beneficiaries||PUNE: CoWin will soon have more options under its “Raise an Issue” feature in its bid to gradually streamline multiple problems being faced by vaccination beneficiaries. The CoWin portal has already started blocking people’s attempts to register with different cellphone numbers, using the same ID number, in a bid to de-duplicate entries, RS Sharma, chairman of the Empowered Group on Covid Vaccine Administration, told TOI. “If a beneficiary registers with two cellphone numbers and uses the same Aadhaar number in both the accounts, s/he will be informed that the Aadhaar number has already been registered, thus, preventing him/her from creating a duplicate account,” he said. For users facing issues in final certificate generation because the vaccination centres concerned failed to update user details post-vaccination, CoWin is also likely to include another feature in its ‘Raise an Issue’ link, where users can ‘self declare’ having received the dose (dose 1/dose 2) and get the provisional/final certificate. Amod Kharait, a Mumbai resident, told TOI, “ I took my second dose on April 9 and received no SMS of confirmation or final vaccination certificate. After constant follow ups with the hospital to update my details on CoWin (which ideally should have been done on the day I got vaccinated), the hospital authorities now tell me that they cannot update the details till vaccination restarts in their hospital. I am in a fix.” Pune-based Kavita Shivdasani took her second dose 60 days ago, but the hospital concerned in Pune cantonment has still not been able to update her details on CoWin. “I still haven’t got my final vaccination certificate. In fact, I keep receiving an SMS prompting me to take my second dose,” she said. A central official on CoWin management told TOI, “Hospitals are given time till 5pm next day to end a vaccination session on CoWin. Hospitals are supposed to update vaccinated beneficiary details in the system till that deadline. If they don’t, they will need another CoWin vaccination session to update these details. However, if a hospital has discontinued the vaccination drive, it will no longer be able to do this.” The official said CoWin is therefore likely to introduce a self declaration module under its ‘Raise an Issue’ link for such beneficiaries whose vaccination centres can no longer update their dose one or two details. Instances of mistaken addition of unknown beneficiaries into somebody else’s CoWin account have also been reported. “The vaccinators concerned in some centres may have made wrong entries of beneficiaries in these accounts, causing such problems. This will also be addressed via Raise an Issue option on the portal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-feature-to-get-more-options-to-address-issues-of-beneficiaries/articleshow/83856993.cms||Neha Madaan

Kaur, however, has turned down the aid. She told TOI on Friday that she declined the offers of help since she does not want charity. “I will continue my fight for a government job for which I’m eligible under sports quota,” she said, alleging that she was being pressured by “those in power” to quit selling snacks on the road. “Today, some locals had come to give ration to us but we politely declined and asked them to support our cause by raising their voices,” said her mother Gurdeep Kaur. The owner of a Punjab-based shooting range who was among those who extended help, said, “I read about her and offered her a job as a coach to young shooters but she declined as she is fighting for a government job. The government should not be apathetic to its sportspersons.” The founder of a not-for-profit also said she politely declined their financial help, “She didn’t want handouts; she is striving for what she deserves.” Kaur has won 24 national-level medals and was considered the country’s best para air pistol shooter at one point. She has represented India in the International Paralympic Committee World Cup in 2015. She has also officiated in several selection committees and shooting competitions, including this year’s International Shooting Sport Federation World Cup in Delhi. Kaur’s family fell on hard times soon after her father’s demise in 2019. They also exhausted their savings to treat her brother, who suffered severe brain injuries after falling from a building. He died in February this year. Meanwhile, the State Legal Services Authority took cognisance of Kaur’s situation and asked the District Legal Service Authority (Dehradun) to take immediate action in this matter. On Friday, the secretary of the DLSA (Dehradun) Neha Kushwaha expressed disappointment at the athlete not getting any assistance from the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/job-offers-donations-pour-in-for-para-shooter-selling-chips-on-road-but-she-says-dont-want-charity/articleshow/83850168.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Pune||Second dose of vaccine: Students going abroad to follow Maharashtra norm||PUNE: Students travelling abroad will have to follow their state- or district-specific arrangements to avail of second dose of Covishield and they would not be able to find an appointment booking component on CoWin after completion of the 28-day gap from the first dose, a central official on CoWin management portal said on Friday. The Centre had recently said the gap between two Covishield doses for those undertaking international travel for educational purposes or employment opportunities or as a part of India’s contingent for Tokyo Olympic games could be reduced to less than 84 days after the date of the first dose. However, as per the guidelines even in these cases, the second dose will only be administered after 28 days from the first dose of Covishield. The statement by the ministry of health and family welfare had also said CoWin system would soon provide the facility for administration of second dose in such exceptional cases. After the Union government announcement, many students approached the local authorities to know when this system would reflect on CoWin so that they could book appointments for shots. The central official, however, clarified, “Every state is making special arrangements for such students to avail of the second dose. Students would not be able to book a CoWin appointment in such cases and will have to approach the designated authorities. The 28-day period option on CoWin system for these beneficiaries is available on the vaccinators’ module.” Rubal Agarwal, PMC additional municipal commissioner, told TOI, “Students going abroad can email us at studentvaccination.pune@gmail.com to get enrolled for vaccination in such cases. We will plan sessions accordingly and give them appointments by email. In fact, we plan such special sessions every Wednesday for students going abroad for studies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pupils-going-abroad-to-follow-state-norm/articleshow/83857024.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nagpur||Nagpur university’s new session from August 1, classes to be online||NAGPUR: The Nagpur University’s new academic session (2021-22) would commence from August 1, but the classes would continue to be held online. Vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari on Friday said lectures for second, third and subsequent years would begin from that date, while first-year classes would commence later after admissions. “The decision has been taken under special powers under Section 12(7) of Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016, as the Academic Council meeting couldn’t take place due to Covid-19 pandemic,” said the VC, who was accompanied by pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe and Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable. The classes would continue to be held in online mode till getting instructions from the state government. “Even exams would be conducted in online mode till then,” he said, adding all students can attend online classes from August 1, without waiting for their results which may take time. The development came as disappointment for a section of NU’s nearly four lakh students, who were hoping for resumption of regular classes as Covid cases have dipped in Vidarbha as compared to the peak in April-May. “The university should make efforts to restart physical classes at the earliest and ensure all students attending it are fully vaccinated. Now, the government has also opened vaccination for all above 18 and a majority of students fit into it. Restarting classes is the need of hour, as many students particularly from rural areas face connectivity and other issues. Daily we’re receiving complaints from students, who couldn’t appear in online exams,” National Students Union of India (NSUI) national coordinator Amin Noori told TOI. Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) was, however, more guarded in its reaction stating it too wants to have offline classes, but the situation wasn’t conducive as of now, particularly after the government has predicted the third wave. “We welcome NU’s decision to offer online classes, as the current situation is highly unpredictable. Rushing for offline coaching can prove detrimental for the students. Instead, NU should ensure vaccination of all students on priority, so that colleges could be started without delay, once the situation normalises,” said ABVP’s central working committee member Amit Patle. The academic session usually begins in June last week, but this year it was delayed as summer-2021 exams are yet to start. The exams are scheduled from June 29 and will continue for about a month. Even winter-2020 papers could be concluded only recently as those were deferred due to the pandemic-induced lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nus-new-session-from-aug-1-classes-to-be-online/articleshow/83852184.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Both were asked to explain why they tried to malign NU’s image by posting the photographs of answer sheets on social media without verifying the facts with officials, and misguided everyone. VC Subhash Chaudhari and BOEE director Prafulla Sable said the answer sheets were part of scrap sold to a vendor and believed to be of summer and winter examinations of 2017, 2018 and 2019. “We’ve also appointed a panel under former exam controller Neeraj Khaty to prevent such incidents in future, as NU’s image was unnecessarily tarnished, when it had nothing to do with the entire episode. The panel conducted two meetings but couldn’t proceed further due to the pandemic,” Sable said. The VC added that after a clip of the incident went viral on social media, the government had sought an explanation from NU authorities. Udapure had brought the incident to the attention of NU officials after which they swung into action. He sent pictures to Sable, who then sought an explanation from contractor Subhash Trading Company, whose godown is located at Telipura here. There were rumours that some answer books were also found at Mouda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-senate-members-asked-to-explain-social-media-posts-hurting-nu-image/articleshow/83852207.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Kochi||Police admit to procedural lapses||Thiruvananthapuram: Police have admitted that there was lapses on its part while registering the first information report (FIR) into the case in which a woman was accused of abusing her minor son. This has come in the form of an inquiry report based on a complaint filed by the chairperson of state child welfare committee (SCWC) N Sunanda, who had called out the irregularities in the procedures. Last week, a high-level probe by the police had revealed that the woman was innocent in the case. In the FIR, police had listed the SCWC chairperson as the complainant in the case. They also erred by violating section 154(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) by not forwarding a copy of the FIR to the informant/complainant. After Sunanda pointed out the irregularity, police had made alterations in the FIR. A copy of the inquiry report, which was submitted before the inspector general (South Zone), was received by Sunanda a day ago. In the report filed by the deputy superintendent of police (DSP), it was mentioned that the sub-inspector, who registered the FIR, had committed the mistake in a bid to register the case without any delay. Speaking to TOI, Sunanda said that this incident could not be brushed off as a one-off case. SCWC has learned that the police had often been naming the committee chairperson as the complainant in cases registered under Posco Act. “This is a dangerous practice that would affect the case when it comes before the court for trial as the witness or complainant has to be the survivor of the abuse,” Sunanda said.  As per the petition she filed before the state police chief, the Kadakkavoor police received the complaint from the child’s father on November 10, 2020. On the same day, the station house officer (SHO) sent the child to the SCWC officials along with a woman civil police officer. SCWC shifted the child to a quarantine home and assigned the district child protection officer to subject the child for a counselling session. SCWC chairperson received the counselling report on November 13, which she forwarded to the Kadakkavoor SHO with a covering letter recommending to register a case. In the report submitted before the IG, the DSP stated that sub-inspector  received the chairperson’s letter in the evening and since it was not possible to summon the child to the station to record his statement again, he added the CWC chairperson’s name in the complainant’s column.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-admit-to-procedural-lapses/articleshow/83850239.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This should be done on priority basis,” he said. Salunkhe has already put up this suggestion before the state government in the wake of the impending threat of the third wave and cases of Delta Plus variant emerging in the state. State task force members had already called in for 70% vaccination stating that the administration should focus on a targeted exercise. Salunkhe said that while the third wave or the Delta Plus variant is a cause for concern, we cannot panic and we have to effectively carry out the vaccination process besides maintaining Covid protocol. “Targetted vaccination for all such establishments will help us ensure that all the operators have been vaccinated. Conducing vaccination camps and ensuring that everyone is vaccinated is the way forward,” he said. Meanwhile, with the central government’s free vaccination programme, the state should be assured of enough vaccine supply and they should be able to carry the same properly, Salunkhe added. Pune civic chief Vikram Kumar told TOI that they are planning vaccination camps and traders themselves are already conducting camps on their own however, traders want supply of vaccines to be streamlined. Fatechand Ranka, president of Federation of Trade Association of Pune said that even as they had approached the administration demanding 15,000 doses of vaccine for traders, they had not received any vaccines. “While some of our members went on their own to private hospitals, many staff members are still not vaccinated. It would be good if they conduct a drive and cover this population,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/expert-calls-for-vax-coverage-for-traders/articleshow/83857070.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The city’s Friday caseload was 693 — lower than Thursday (773) and Wednesday (864) — and the overall total fell by 4,467 to 7.2 lakh so far. “Due to shifting of cases (to different municipal areas) as per the patient’s residential address and omission of duplicates, Mumbai’s tally dropped by 4,467 cases,” said state epidemiology head Dr Pradeep Awate. The reconciliation exercise also resulted in the state’s overall tally dropping by 73 to 60.2 lakh cases so far. On Friday, the state added 9,677 cases and 156 fatalities — under 200 for the sixth day. With the addition of 355 unreported deaths, the toll rose to 1.2 lakh. Daily deaths in Mumbai, however, increased to 23 from 10 on Thursday, taking the toll to 15,368, said BMC officials. Dr Rahul Pandit, head of intensive care in Fortis Hospital and a member of the Covid task force, said there is no cause for concern as the daily positivity rate and case fatality rate are low in the city. Health minister Rajesh Tope said although the cases in the state were dipping, the decline is not as fast as it should be. “Cases have stagnated and are fluctuating between 8,000 and 10,000. We were hoping for them to dip further but it is taking longer than we expected,” said Tope. State government officials said districts have been asked to ramp up testing after it was reported that testing had dropped in nearly 15 districts. “We have asked the districts to ensure that testing does not drop and the focus should be on increasing the percentage of the RT-PCR tests,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-reconciliation-shaves-4-5k-cases-from-citys-overall-tally/articleshow/83857181.cms||Bhavika Jain

Meshram was earlier this year also booked for abetment to commit suicide. Both offences were registered against Meshram at the police station where he was posted. Meshram, who had made undue advances towards the home guard in his chamber, is learnt to have made similar attempt on at least one more colleague of the victim in the last few days. Promising to help the home guard clear MPSC examination, Meshram had been messaging her frequently and would summon her to his chamber on some or the other pretext, before misbehaving on June 23, leading to the complaint. Meshram is also learnt to be harassing yet another home guard colleague of the victim with sexually coloured remarks. He had also asked her to accompany him on a dinner date, offering her a gift worth around Rs10,000 and also other enticements. The victim, along with the colleague and others, visited the office of Zonal DCP Neelotpal on Thursday and narrated their plight. City police chief Amitesh Kumar shifted Meshram to control room immediately after the allegations surfaced on Thursday. “A review meeting of DCPs has been called. The DCPs would now meet and hear grievances of women cops at police stations. Our Vishakha committee for sexual harassment at workplace under Zonal DCP Vinita S would conduct a review meeting of all representatives from the police stations on Saturday,” said the CP, adding a sensitization process and complaint redressal mechanism would be strengthened. During a meeting of officers on Wednesday, Kumar had categorically cautioned Meshram to improve his conduct, as he was already under scanner for being booked under abetment to suicide charges, and also for the suspension of four personnel from his police station over extortion of Rs1 lakh from a ration shop owner. Sources said, undaunted by CP’s warning in the meeting, Meshram had later in the evening misbehaved with the home guard in his chamber before giving her Rs1,000. Meshram, as per the FIR lodged by the victim, had summoned her to his chamber and asked her to help clip the shoulder band of his uniform. He made undue advances when she tried to follow his instructions. The home guard had rushed out howling and narrated her plight to a cousin, who is also deployed at the same police station. The statement of the home guard was recorded by Zonal DCP Vinita S, who is chairperson of the sexual harassment at the workplace committee.

---||Nagpur||National environmental engineering and research institute sends samples of 9 Umred patients for genome sequencing to CCMB||NAGPUR: CSIR-National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute (Neeri) has reportedly sent RNA extracts of eight samples of Covid-19 patients from Umred for genome sequencing to Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB). Till now, Neeri, in association with CCMB, has completed genome sequencing of 420 samples, 412 from city and latest eight samples from rural areas. Zilla Parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar told TOI, “Samples of patients from Umred were handed over to Neeri for genome sequencing.” Kumbhejkar and district civil surgeon VD Paturkar reportedly decided to go for genome sequencing samples of nine patients from Umred, as they formed a cluster of cases. “A woman returned to Umred from Mumbai and tested positive in rapid antigen test. Another eight people whom she met also tested positive in rapid antigen tests. Therefore, samples were sent for genome sequencing to know whether they contracted the existing variant or any mutated variant,” an official from ZP said. After being consulted by ZP officials, Neeri gave kits for collection of samples using gargling technology, which has been invented by Neeri. ZP handed over samples of nine patients to Neeri on Wednesday. Eight of them reportedly tested positive in RT-PCR test and one tested negative, at Neeri. This was the first time ZP has given samples for genome sequencing to Neeri, which is doing it in association with CCMB under Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG). Genome sequencing is being done by a team led by scientist and head of environmental virology cell Krishna Khairnar, who is also coordinator of department of biotechnology’s Covid-19 Testing Regional Lab. Sources from district administration and ZP said, “Neeri’s lab completed entire procedure of RNA extraction and sent it to CCMB on Thursday, which is likely to reach in next one or two days.” Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is yet to give any samples to Neeri for genome sequencing. As per instructions from the government, Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) of IGGMCH sends 15 samples, including five each from laboratories of AIIMS, GMCH and IGGMCH, to Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) for genome sequencing once in 15 days. The last samples were sent on June 15, and next lot is likely to be sent on July 1. In the 15-month-pandemic, Neeri has achieved some milestones. Neeri has crossed a million Covid-19 tests in a year in April, of which 50,000 tests were done using dry swab technology. Neeri gives RT-PCR results in record time of less than three hours. The institute has also come up with new technique of collecting samples through gargling and then testing it under RT-PCR, the first in the world to develop this. NMC has engaged Neeri with its RPTS Swab Samples Collecting Centre.

The report has been made to the governor “for action as deemed appropriate” Joshi has drawn the attention of the governor that Sawant has not given reasons or justification for not accepting the Lokayukta’s report directing that an FIR be registered against Madkaikar on the basis of the complaint filed by advocate Aires Rodrigues. Rodrigues had highlighted that in his income tax returns for the financial year 2015-16, Madkaikar had shown his total income for the year as a mere Rs 1,44,389, and that of his wife Janita, a paltry sum of Rs 24,389, and that they had loans. Madkaikar was a minister in the past in the Congress government, and until 2019, power minister in the Manohar Parrikar government before he fell ill. On September 15 last year, Joshi’s predecessor, justice (retd) P K Misra, in a 15-page order, directed the chief secretary and anti-corruption bureau (ACB) to register an FIR against Madkaikar. Misra also observed that the then chief secretary, Dharmendra Sharma, and former superintendent of police Priyanka Kashyap had entirely failed in discharging their duties in accordance with law. The former Lokayukta had also directed that suo motu proceedings be initiated against Kashyap for gross dereliction of duty. Misra, in his order, had also censured Parrikar. “It is crystal-clear that the then CM avoided the responsibility because (Madkaikar) was a serving minister and MLA belonging to the ruling party,” Misra had observed. Rodrigues had filed a complaint with ACB against Madkaikar and followed it up with a complaint with the Lokayukta in June 2018. Rodrigues, in his complaint, had demanded that ACB register an FIR under Sections 13(1) (d) & (e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and Section 120-B of Indian Penal Code against Madkaikar and his wife Janita, the sarpanch of Old Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lokayukta-sends-guv-report-on-states-non-action-on-madkaikar/articleshow/83857096.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Madurai||‘Can we kill people and throw money at them’||Madurai: Three years after police allegedly gunned down 13 unarmed anti-Sterlite protesters in Tuticorin, the Madras high court on Friday chastised the state for not booking anyone in the matter.“Can we kill people and throw money at them and say that our job is done? Is that the society that we want to build? Just throwing money at some people and everything else is hushed up?” asked the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice T S Sivagnanam. “It is somewhat alarming that the state, through its police, fired at unarmed protesters and no one is booked three years after the incident. It may not augur well for a civilised society governed by the constitutional principles that we have to merely throw money at the families of the victims and give closure to an incident of possible brutality and excessive police action,” the CJI bench said and asked the state to spell out its stand on the issue. Taking a serious view of the May 22, 2018 incident, the judges said that while the state had indeed remedied the nuisance that was created, the part with regard to punishment still remained unanswered. The punishment part should also be answered to prevent occurrence of such incidents in future, the judges observed.Considering the importance of the matter, the judges said it would be heard by the principal seat in Chennai, and adjourned it to August 9. The court was hearing a petition filed by advocate Henri Tiphagne seeking a direction to the NHRC to reopen the police firing incident.The bench pointed out that the National Human Rights Commission first took suo motu cognizance of the matter, but closed the proceedings in October 2018, saying no further investigation was required. The closure came apparently after Tamil Nadu government submitted a report stating that ‘adequate compensation’ had been paid to the kin of the victims, steps had been taken to restore normality and that a judicial commission was looking into the matter.The NHRC had initially made observations like the right to life of victims had been grossly violated and that the police fired on unarmed protestors without following standard operating procedure. It had also called for various reports from authorities and sent its own team for spot investigations based on the order of the Delhi high court.On Friday, Tamil Nadu advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram said Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission submitted an interim report before the government on May 14, 2021.On its part, the bench called for a copy of the report and said the state government must spell out its own stand on the issue when it files its affidavit next. The judges also called for the report filed by the NHRC’s investigation team, in a sealed cover if the commission feels it is delicate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/can-we-kill-people-and-throw-money-at-them/articleshow/83852374.cms||Kaushik Kannan

All of them were hired by Deb and paid well. Police said they questioned four persons on Friday and brought all of them face-to-face with Deb. “If required, we might arrest some,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Sources said they would see if any of the aides was a trained healthcare worker. Several of them claimed they had accompanied Deb to KMC headquarters and to missionaries to distribute PPE and sanitizers. Some reportedly paid Deb Rs 1.5 lakh-Rs 2 lakh to land jobs at KMC, said cops. Police said Amikacin vials, bought in the name of KMC, were taken to Deb’s Kasba office, where the staff replaced the labels with fake Covishield ones. “Deb designed the fake Covishield labels on his computer but someone else provided him with the sample and the labels were printed at a Sealdah unit. We are questioning both,” said an officer. Lalbazar hinted they might write to KMC. “Deb had written on fake letterhead and holograms of KMC. A few had fake state government letterheads.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra national law university - Nagpur training India’s first batch of law graduates eligible to become judges||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra National Law University, Nagpur, (MNLU-N) is currently training the country’s first batch of 40 students, who would be eligible to directly become judges after completing their five-year BALLB (honours) degree in ‘Adjudication & Justicing’. The graduates would, of course, also need to clear the examinations conducted by the public service commissions of respective states, like MPSC in Maharashtra, to be recruited as judges. “This is the first such course in India. The batch has been selected after a rigorous selection process. Besides clearing Common Law Admission Test (CLAT), they were subjected to group discussions and then interviewed by a panel of eminent high court judges,” MNLU chancellor Justice Bhushan Gavai told TOI. The course was the brainchild of former chief justice of India Sharad Bobde, also the first MNLU-N chancellor, who had proposed a National Judicial Academy (NJA) on the lines of National Defence Academy (NDA) to train law students in the art of judging. TOI was the first to report the proposed NJA on August 19, 2019. Justice Gavai, also Supreme Court judge, added these 40 students would be trained in such a way that they are ready to discharge duties of a judicial officer on graduating. “We’re making efforts to get permission from the government to allow them to appear in public service commission exams when they reach their final year. This way they can be directly recruited, after passing out.” MNLU Executive Council member justice Ravindra Chavan, who helped draft the syllabus, said these students could fill the vacuum of good judges in lower judiciary. “These students would be trained in all aspects of the judiciary, including understanding the case properly, applying relevant provisions of the law, and developing a vision to dispense justice.” Vice chancellor Vijender Kumar said due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the admissions were delayed and the course started in October last year. “These students were selected by a panel of HC judges, including Bharti Dangre, Rohit Deo and Manish Pitale. The teaching methodology for them is totally different from other students. We’re also training our teachers in subjects related to justicing. Since these students hail from ten states, including the northeast, we’re training them in a way that they can appear in any judicial exam after their graduation.” The course was granted recognition by the Bar Council of India (BCI) and if the students don’t want to join the judiciary, s/he can still practice as a lawyer across any court in India. “From August, we would be starting our second batch of this unique course, but the classes would continue to be held online till the situation normalizes,” the VC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mnlu-n-training-indias-first-batch-of-law-graduates-eligible-to-become-judges/articleshow/83852419.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The main conspirator, identified as Santosh Deokar (32), is the former driver of the construction firm owner, police said, adding Deokar had lured his accomplice, Azharuddin Shaikh (24), to make a call to the firm owner (name withheld) to demand extortion. Shaikh had even threatened to kill the firm owner’s family if he approached the police. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale said, “A police team laid a trap after Shaikh instructed the owner to deliver the extortion money to him in Aundh. Shaikh was taken into custody while accepting the money from the firm owner.” Morale said, “During questioning, Shaikh revealed he made the extortion calls on behalf of Deokar, following which he was taken into custody. Deokar had quit job as a driver in the firm in 2016. Currently running business of manufacturing spare parts, he planned to extort money from the employer for repaying loan of over Rs 30 lakh.” An FIR relating to extortion under the IPC has been registered with Chatushrungi police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-held-on-charge-of-demanding-rs-50l-extortion/articleshow/83857241.cms||---
---||Goa||After 4 years, Goa meat complex may open this July||PANAJI: After nearly four years of being shut, the Goa Meat Complex is set to restart operations from next month onwards. The directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) is tentatively eyeing July 10, which falls a week prior to Eid ul Zuha (Bakri Eid), to reopen the Usgao-based abattoir. “The Goa Meat Complex has been non-operational since September 2017. We have all our permits in place and can reopen. The state government has invested over Rs 1 crore to modernise the abattoir and carry out repairs,” sources from AHVS said. The state-level meeting held before Eid ul Zuha every year to discuss qurbani, which is also attended by the chief minister, will be held before July 10. “All arrangements have been made for the animals to be brought to the Goa Meat Complex for slaughter. Operations will commence, not only for qurbani, but will be carried out on a regular basis,” sources said. Though the abattoir had closed for repairs, several hurdles with respect to licensing, repairs and protests by NGOs delayed the reopening. In 2016 there was a high court directive that the Goa Meat Complex must be made fully functional to provide services to meat traders in the state so that they could bring animals there for slaughter. The directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services is liable to face contempt of court for not making the abattoir functional. While the licenses that had expired were re-applied for and approved, another hurdle arose when the compressor of the chilling plant broke down after not being in use since 2017. “The traders require the transportation truck to reach across meat markets in Goa by 7am. Since the animals are slaughtered in the morning, by the time the meat is processed, it would reach the markets only by afternoon. The high court directed us to solve this problem by making the chilling plant functional. The animal will be slaughtered the previous day and the meat will reach the markets early,” sources said. Accordingly, the chilling plant has been repaired, in addition to other minor repairs at the abattoir. Goa’s daily beef demand stands at around 10-15 tonnes, while currently only two tons of fresh meat is being sourced from Karnataka and brought to Goa by the meat traders. The AHVS is looking at slaughtering at least 30 animals per day at the abattoir to meet Goa’s local demand. The plant also has provisions to process meat for export. “Currently the live cattle market at Belagavi is closed due to the Covid-19 lockdown there. Once it opens, we will be able to purchase the animals and bring them to Goa for slaughter,” Quraishi Meat Traders’ Association general secretary Anwar Bepari said. Meat traders in Goa are currently worried about a threat to their business due to the ordinance given in the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020, where cattle cannot be slaughtered or transported for slaughter. If Karnataka decides to implement it, even the fresh beef coming from the neighbouring state will stop. The meat traders have taken up the responsibility of sourcing animals from other states and have contacted an agent to bring these animals to Goa. Once they enter the Goa border, they expect cooperation from the police, AHVS and transport department. “As long as these animals are being brought following the rules of the Goa Animal Preservation Act 1995 and the Goa, Daman and Diu Slaughter Act, 1978, no activist or anyone else can stop the animals from coming in,” an AHVS official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-4-years-goa-meat-complex-may-open-this-july/articleshow/83857190.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Delhi||The IT crowd: Nehru Place sets third wave alarm bells ringing||NEW DELHI: Nehru Place market, which is among Asia’s biggest marketplaces for computer, information technology and electronic goods, is open once again after the lockdown, but a visit there suggested that it could become a Covid-19 super spreader if urgent measures weren’t taken. Violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour is rampant there, not helped by the return of a crowd of apparently unauthorised street vendors and the ongoing redevelopment work that has left the lanes dug up and inconvenient for customers. Kailash Bhushan had come to the market from Chhatarpur to get his computer repaired, helpless at having to expose himself to the perilous atmosphere because electronic devices had become a necessity both for his work and for his school-going children. “There is no one here to maintain order. Is this how we will prevent the third wave?” he asked. From packed parking lots, crowded corridors and street hawkers attempting to sell everything from mobile screen guards to software and cheap clothing, the market is now a veritable obstacle course. Vikki Thakur, a worker in an IT shop, said that the redevelopment work has been going on at snail’s pace for a year. “It was halted during the lockdown, but the entire market is again filled with labourers and construction material,” he said. TOI was witness to innumerable violations related to mask wearing and social distancing even as the sewer covers appeared to be favoured spitting spots, potentially releasing a cloud of the dangerous coronavirus into the air. Many eateries were serving their customers in the corridors, defeating the purpose of restricting customers at such places. Traders were aware of the Covid indiscipline and seemed to think that increasing the deployment of Civic Defence personnel could help check violations, as would regulating vending activities. J K Gupta, chairman, Nehru Place Welfare Association, said the basic problem of crowding was due to the unchecked presence of street vendors and operation of the flea market. “Even in normal circumstances, vendors are allowed to operate within the 6x4 ft space allocated to them. But unauthorised vendors have made inroads. They are also the ones who don’t follow Covid norms,” Gupta alleged. Nehru Place is the main commercial hub for computers and accessories in south Delhi. It was developed by Delhi Development Authority in the early 1970s. A popular flea market also runs in the centre of the market plaza. During the evening hours, the market sees heavy footfall and the parking lots are often hard put to find space for every vehicle coming there. Akash Kumar, a parking attendant at the lot near Epicuria, the food court, said that compared to last year’s resumption of business after the Covid lockdown, this year’s unlocking has seen a much higher footfall at the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-it-crowd-nehru-place-sets-third-wave-alarm-bells-ringing/articleshow/83857469.cms||---

When no such report has been approved by the committee, then which report is being used by BJP to yet again malign the Delhi government? Where has this report come from?” he asked at a digital press briefing. If there is indeed a report signed by the oxygen audit committee, then all these BJP leaders and Union ministers should tell us who all have signed and where is the stamp of approval by the committee. Which members have approved this report? We demand these answers from the BJP leaders,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Friday. Read AlsoDelhi govt's actions led to multiple deaths, says BJPBJP on Friday seized upon the report of the SC-appointed oxygen committee, which said the Delhi government exaggerated the oxygen requirement four times, to accuse the AAP government of creating an artificial scarcity to deflect attention from its failure in saving lives in the capital and ofHe said that many big leaders, ministers and volunteers of BJP were rallying together on all social media platforms and maligning Kejriwal. “There is a limit to lying and BJP has crossed all limits in spouting blatant lies. The matter of oxygen supply to states is sub judice - it is ongoing and under judicial consideration. Such unreasonable games and diversions by BJP when the matter is sub judice, is absolutely outrageous,” he said. “People were crying for arranging an oxygen cylinder for their family members, doctors were asking for more oxygen, hospitals were demanding oxygen and facing a huge crisis, attendants of patients and hospitals even went to court to complain – were they all lying?” he asked. “I request Modiji to take stock of his party. The lies uttered by BJP have become perpetual and heinous. BJP is no more Bharatiya Janata Party but Bhartiya Jhagdalu Party because all they do is fight. There is nothing else that BJP does other than fighting with states,” he said. He said that those whose family members were admitted in hospitals during the peak of Covid-19 in April will attest to the scarcity of oxygen faced by all. “The responsibility to manage oxygen supply was fully that of the central government. It completely messed up the oxygen management system because of which many families had to suffer,” Sisodia alleged. “Our doctors, hospitals and people clamoured for more oxygen, but instead of taking responsibility for botching up, the BJP government invented this alleged report full of lies. It is absolutely shameful and despicable that these BJP leaders, sitting at the BJP headquarters, cooked up some misleading facts and fabricated an alleged report to shift accountability from themselves,” he claimed. Taking to Twitter, Kejriwal said: “My crime -I fought for the lives of 2 crore people. When you were holding election rallies, I was awake all night arranging for oxygen. I fought, pleaded for people to get oxygen. People have lost their loved ones due to the lack of oxygen. You shouldn’t call them liars, they are feeling really bad about it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-audit-report-not-signed-by-panel-manish-sisodia-bjp-slams-hoarding/articleshow/83861083.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The court held that right to education is a part of right to life and asked the superintendent of Children’s Home Haridwar, where the boy is lodged, to ensure that he is allowed to take online tuition classes in accordance with the class schedule. The directions came from the bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma. According to the boy’s lawyer, Aditya Singh, he is keen to pursue his education by appearing in BA exams from a private university in Punjab. Singh told the court that the examinations are scheduled to start from Monday and therefore arrangements should be made for him at the Children’s Home itself. Agreeing to the request, the court said, “Considering the fact that under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the Right to Education is a part of Right to Life, this court directs the respondent state to make all the arrangements for the appellant to appear in his examinations scheduled to commence from June 28, and to continue the arrangements till the examinations are over. The arrangements shall be made at Children’s Home at Haridwar.” According to people familiar with the case, the boy is a second-year student at the university and even for his first-year exams last year, the court had directed the authorities to provide him with all the necessary arrangements. Meanwhile, his revision plea along with those of two other minors who were convicted of the gang-rape has been pending before the HC.

---||Goa||Goa Board follows CBSE’s 30:30:40 pattern for Class XII exam||PANAJI: The Goa Board on Friday released its policy for tabulation of marks for the Class XII batch of 2021. The Board has adopted a CBSE-like 30:30:40 evaluation method, with 30% weightage each to the students’ performance in Class X and XI, and 40% to the students’ internal assessments carried out by schools in Class XII. For Class X, the average of the marks scored by the student at the public exam will be taken of any three subjects where the student has performed the best. This component will get 30% weightage. For Class XI, 30% weightage will go to the students’ performance in the final theory component. And in the case of Class XII, the students’ performance in various evaluations carried out by the school like unit tests, mid-term exams, preliminary exams, periodical tests will get together 40% weightage. The Class XII results are tentatively set to be declared on July 20. The Board has said that if any of the students are unhappy with the marks allotted to them, an examination will be conducted provided the conditions prove conducive for the same. “The option to appear for the examination has been provided by the board as and when the situation becomes conducive for examination for those candidates who are not satisfied with the assessment through objective criterion. In such cases, marks scored in the later examination will be considered final,” the Board’s policy states. Like the Board had asked schools in the case of Class X students, each school will form a results committee to tabulate the results of students of their school. The Board has said that the Class XII evaluations carried out by schools in 2021-22 for unit tests, mid term exam, preliminary exam, etc, were mostly through the online mode. Therefore, as these scores alone may not be reliable, Class X and XI components are being given weightage. “These examinations were not in similar settings for all, and (there were) variations in access to digital infrastructure. These examinations were not conducted by the board and will not meet the goal of standardised assessment, and may also reflect subjectivity inherent in school-based assessment,” the Board has said. Therefore, to address these issues, school-based assessment at Class XII need to be supplemented by standardised examinations conducted prior to the Covid-19 pandemic situation, the Board’s policy states. “The additional information of the performance of the same student to obtain more accurate results will result in impartial, fair, accuracy and holistic assessment of students. The Class X board was the only Board examination answered by the current batch of Class XII students for actual year-end assessment, when conditions were normal and the examinations were conducted in a regular standardised manner without any deviation from the scheme announced by the board at the start of the academic session,” the Board policy reads. Therefore, the performance at the Class X Board examinations held for the current batch of Class XII students are being given weightage as a measure of the students’ ability, Goa Board has stated. “Since the students did not know at the time of taking their Class X Board examination that those marks would count towards the all-important Class XII results, some of the shortcomings can be overcome by using the scores obtained in theory (external component) exams, the average of the best three subjects out of the main six to seven subjects, for the purpose of calculating the marks, to give weightage to the students by omitting the scores of the subjects in which they underperformed due to some reasons,” the Board has said. Also, the current batch of Class XII has appeared in Class XI examinations conducted in the year 2019-20 in an offline mode in their schools till the time the lockdown was declared in March 2020. The examinations were conducted in a regular manner without any deviation from the scheme decided by the Board well in advance at the start of the academic session. Therefore, the Class XI marks are being considered and given 30% weightage, the Board has stated. “Unlike Class X, the examination in Class XI is based on the higher secondary syllabus and gives a good indication of students’ ability in their preferred subjects. The examinations were conducted for full duration in examination halls under proper supervision. As a result, this examination has high reliability in terms of fair assessment of students performance,” the Board has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-follows-cbses-303040-pattern-for-class-xii-exam/articleshow/83857285.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut moves Bombay HC against FIR on copyright violation||MUMBAI: Actor Kangana Ranaut and her brother have moved Bombay high court challenging an FIR by Mumbai Police for an alleged copyright violation case filed by Ashish Kaul, author of ‘Didda: The Warrior Queen Of Kashmir’. In January, Ranaut had tweeted about her next production, ‘Manikarnika Returns: The Legend Of Didda’, based on the story of the Queen of Kashmir who defeated Mehmood Ghaznavi twice. Her lawyer, Rizwan Siddiquee, said there was “no film made, hence no copyright infringement offence committed. It is only because she announced that the film will be made the FIR was registered under the Copyright Act’’. Siddiquee said the actor's fundamental rights are at stake, “why should she participate in the investigation?” Her petition said police registered an FIR following an order under section 156(3) of CrPC by a magistrate in March 2021. The FIR was based on “mere conjectures, speculation and surmises”. After state government counsel gave an oral assurance of not taking coercive steps, including arrest against the petitioners till next hearing, HC said it will hear the plea on June 28. HC will also hear a plea by Ranaut, booked by Bandra police in a case alleging an offence of sedition along with her sister Rangoli, seeking directions to the authorities to renew her passport to enable her to go abroad for shooting of a film.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kangana-moves-hc-against-fir-on-copyright-violation/articleshow/83859279.cms||---

If we fail to get reservation back, I will retire from politics,” said Fadnavis, while addressing protesters, who gathered in large numbers at Variety Square. Fadnavis was later detained and taken to Sitabuldi police station before being released. Thousands of BJP activists across the state staged a ‘Chakka Jam’ agitation against the MVA government for its failure to defend OBC reservation. Former energy minister Chandrasekhar Bawankule, city BJP president Pravin Datke and other MLAs from the party were present. “On the the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, who sacrificed his life for the betterment of all communities, a decisive battle has been launched today across the state by the BJP for OBC reservation,” the former CM said. Accusing the MVA ministers of making false promises, the Southwest Nagpur MLA said they have failed to constitute a backward class commission since the last 15 months. “While the Supreme Court has asked for empirical data, leaders of the state are misrepresenting facts that census data is needed. Instead of collecting data, they’re blaming the Centre for their own failures,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/if-we-fail-to-grant-obc-reservation-in-four-months-i-will-retire-politically-fadnavis/articleshow/83871077.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Last Saturday, the government extended the curfew till June 28, with some relaxations. “The state curfew ends on Monday. It will get extended,” said Sawant. The chief minister said that screening of those entering Goa has already begun. “We have started screening those entering Goa, especially from Maharashtra. If any suspected case is found, the person will be kept in isolation, we have prepared labs too,” said Sawant. He also said that Covid hospitals across the state have been denotified, and that OPD services can be offered there again. “Though we have denotified the hospitals as Covid hospitals, we can notify them again at any time as per requirement,” he said. “We will start OPDs in the hospitals now as the monsoon has started. We have denotified hospitals so we can start the OPDs. We have kept only the superspecialty block of Goa Medical College and South Goa district hospital as Covid hospitals.” At present, the number of active Covid-19 cases in Goa has dropped to below 3,000, but the threat of the Delta+ variant entering the state remains a worry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-curfew-to-be-extended-cm/articleshow/83857355.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Delhi||150 homeless people in Delhi get first shot at fighting off Covid-19||NEW DELHI: At a night shelter near Nigambodh Ghat at Yamuna Pushta, among the hundreds of homeless people there on Friday afternoon was Chandan, a 29-year-old who lives in the shelter and vies for temporary work at local weddings to earn some money. They weren’t there seeking shelter, only awaiting their turn for the Covid-19 vaccine. Chandan said he agreed to get injected after being told that it would help him get more work. At the first inoculation drive of its sort, the organiser, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, got 150 people injected during the day. According to DUSIB, the state government body responsible for improving quality of life in the slums, the vaccination drive was carried out in coordination with the various district magistrates’ offices and health departments. The camp at Yamuna Pushta was the first. “More camps will be organised at night shelters in different districts to cover all the homeless people staying in DUSIB shelters,” a statement said. Aftab Ahmed, vaccine officer and supervisor at the vaccination camp, said there was no need for any identity proof to get vaccinated. “In the normal process, you need to register on the Co-Win app with ID proof for vaccination. But since many of these homeless people do not have identity documents, nodal officers from shelter management agencies are facilitating their registration for the jab,” said Ahmed. Shelter residents were grateful for intervention. Indresh, 28, said, “If I take the vaccine now, I may not be infected. I am usually sick all the time, so did not want to take more risks.” Ranjit Mandal, 49, had come from the Monastery Market nearby. “I was brought here by an NGO which made me realise that Covid vaccination is necessary and can save my life.” The vaccination started at 8.30am. Sanat Kumar, a worker at the night shelter, also stood in the queue. Ahmed said the shelter staff were also getting the jab to encourage the inmates. Kumar added, “I am a little nervous about taking the shot, but by doing so, we will make it easier for the homeless people.” A few NGOs also brought the homeless to the site. Mohammad Inaam of Centre for Equity Studies said they had been trying to get the inmates of a shelter at Monastery Market, which assists ailing homeless people, to get vaccinated. “When we learnt of this drive, we got 60 of our folks here today,” Inaam said. DUSIB said all precautionary measures were being taken during the vaccination exercise to prevent the spread of Covid. The steps taken on this include maintaining cleanliness in and around the shelter homes, arranging hand sanitizer, face masks and soaps at the site and by conducting coronavirus awareness programmes. The shelter board has also set up four dedicated Covid isolation centres in Dwarka and Geeta Colony to screen suspected Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/150-homeless-people-get-first-shot-at-fighting-off-covid-19/articleshow/83852641.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Woman loses Rs 1 lakh after Aadhaar fraud call||KOLKATA: A woman, who reportedly attended a Covid vaccination camp in Baghajatin, where she had to produce her Aadhaar card, claimed Rs 1 lakh had been siphoned off from her account after she received an Aadhaar-related call. According to the complaint registered at the Patuli police station, Tutin Mukherjee Halder (37) received the fraud call around 10.30am last Tuesday, a few days after attending the vaccination camp. The caller reportedly asked her Aadhaar card details and sought her permission to link the UID number with her mobile. She agreed and within minutes, Rs 1 lakh was deducted from her account from the Ganguly Bagan branch of a public sector bank. A case of cheating and criminal conspiracy has been registered. Police, however, dismissed chances of Aadhar details being leaked from the vaccination camp. “People have the wrong notion that showing original or photocopies of Aadhaar cards at vaccination camps can be risky. This con job is neither specific to Covid times nor is it the first such crime here. Fraudsters don’t need Aadhaar details for the scam though knowing the number helps in earning the victims’ confidence,” said a Lalbazar officer. People, especially senior citizens, getting calls for linking bank accounts or phone numbers to Aadhaar should be careful, warned cops. The fraudsters, pretending to be representatives of the Unique Identification Authority of India, which managed the Aadhaar database, called targets, offering to link their Aadhaar with PAN or phone numbers, police said. The accused used an OTP to change the targets’ phone number linked to Aadhaar number on the website. “The perpetrators replace the victims’ phone numbers with their own. They then download a popular United Payment Interface-supported application, which automatically detects Aadhaar numbers linked to the SIM of the phone in which the banking application is installed. At the end of this operation, the conman has access to the targets’ bank accounts,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-loses-rs-1l-after-aadhaar-fraud-call/articleshow/83857484.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

For now, bus services have resumed from Pune to places like Bidar, Bijapur and Ganagapura in Karnataka and to Hyderabad in Telangana,” an official with the Pune division of the state transport body told TOI. The official said that around 13 buses were being operated to and fro at present. “With relaxations happening in many states, the regulations on travel have eased. However, whatever regulations are still there must be followed and there are checks at the state borders,” the official said. The MSRTC had stopped its services in April this year after fresh restrictions came into force due to the second wave of the pandemic. Officials said that based on the easing of travel restrictions, buses would ply to other states neighbouring Maharashtra. “If all goes well, we will start service from Pune to Panaji from July. Also, buses to Indore in Madhya Pradesh and Surat and Vadodara in Gujarat would be started. The number of buses to be operated would depend on the bookings,” the official added. According to the current rules, for coming to Maharashtra via any mode of transport an RT-PCR negative report not older than 48 hours is required. Karnataka has eased restrictions and inter-state travel has been allowed without the report. Goa requires an RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours. Passengers travelling to Indore and Bhopal from the state need an RT-PCR negative report not older than 48 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msrtc-resumes-inter-state-buses/articleshow/83857422.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Allow standing passengers, one foot apart, says Delhi Metro||NEW DELHI: With hapless commuters compelled to wait for nearly an hour on average to enter the busy Metro stations during peak hours these days, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has requested Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to allow standing passengers in its trains, sources said. A letter has been written by the operations department of DMRC to the divisional commissioner of Delhi, who is also the DDMA secretary, they added. As part of the gradual unlock process, DDMA had allowed Delhi Metro to resume train services but with only 50% of its seating capacity and no standing passengers. Sources said that “DMRC has stated in the letter that Metro systems are designed to provide more standing capacity in order to carry large numbers of commuters during peak hours and that is why, the present carrying capacity is 10-15% of the capacity its train coaches are designed for.” DMRC has also mentioned in its appeal that all government offices, PSUs, local bodies and private offices have been allowed to function and malls, markets, etc are also open. It has said that opening of most economic activities and workplaces and limited capacity being offered for travel by Metro have led to large queues outside Metro stations and larger waiting time, leading to frequent complaints, sources said. DMRC has also mentioned that with limited space available in Metro, coupled with long waiting hours, people are being forced to take their private vehicles or other modes, leading to more violation of Covid norms in grameen sewa vehicles, mini buses, e-rickshaws, auto rickshaws, etc. After the national lockdown last year, when Delhi Metro operations were closed for 169 days, the services resumed in September 2020 as per a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) prepared based on guidelines issued by the ministry of housing and urban affairs. Sources said, “DMRC has mentioned in the letter that as per the SOP, necessary signage and markings are in place inside the stations and coaches, with seating allowed on alternate seats and standing with social distancing.” DMRC has requested that in larger public interest, Metro services may be allowed to run as per the SOP approved by the central government as of now and further relaxation may be allowed once the situation improves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allow-standing-passengers-one-foot-apart-says-metro/articleshow/83857622.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Dhyani achieved the win despite not getting permission to train at the state government’s synthetic athletic track - ostensibly because SOP for sports activities had not been released yet. TOI had reported last week on how Dhyani, a national record holder, was not given the permission to access basic training facilities prior to the crucial race. The 20-year-old was therefore, forced to practice in a barren pothole-ridden field in Doon while dodging stray cattle. Dhyani was unable to use her spike shoes as well and had to practice in normal ones, putting her at risk of injury. Speaking to TOI, the athlete, who hails from Pauri, said, “If I had got adequate practice on the athletic track prior to the event, then I could have secured the second place. The athletes who came first and second were around 4-6 years older to me. I could still beat them. I wish I had trained on the synthetic athletic track in Doon sports college.” The Olympic qualification mark for the women's 5,000m race was 15 min 10 sec, which none of the competing runners could achieve. The 60th edition of the senior athletics meet will continue till Tuesday and Dhyani’s Tokyo dream would now depend on how she fares in Monday's 1,500m race.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-athlete-who-trained-in-barren-field-amid-cattle-bags-bronze-in-inter-state-meet/articleshow/83850445.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||India||Delhi govt's actions led to multiple deaths, says BJP||NEW DELHI: BJP on Friday seized upon the report of the SC-appointed oxygen committee, which said the Delhi government exaggerated the oxygen requirement four times, to accuse the AAP government of creating an artificial scarcity to deflect attention from its failure in saving lives in the capital and of blocking supply of the life-saving gas to at least 12 states, leading to multiple deaths. "The truth that has come out in the report is very shocking and sickening and makes evident that it was a deep-rooted conspiracy by the Arvind Kejriwal government which was hatched to cover up its gross failures in corona management and to shift blame on others for innocent deaths in Delhi. Kejriwal is guilty of criminal neglect," BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said. How many lives could have been saved if these states had access to oxygen? Kejriwal is responsible for deaths in Delhi hospitals too. We expect that he will be held responsible for these deaths and will be punished for this act," Sambit Patra further said. "It is unbelievable to see that Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi government politicised oxygen supply when Covid-19 was at its peak. This is such petty politics. The data presented by the oxygen audit committee in the report is shocking," he added. The spokesperson said since the Delhi government exaggerated the requirement, the city was stuck with supplies of the life-saving gas which could not be used in the capital. "Oxygen remained on the roads at a time when it was direly needed in many states. It is not a small matter and Kejriwal will have to answer to the people," he added. Patra also took on Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia for denying the existence of such a report by waving its copy. "Dear Sisodiaji, your contention was that no such report by the oxygen audit panel appointed by the SC exists. Friends, the said panel consisted of five members," Patra tweeted while sharing details of the affidavit filed by the Centre on June 22 in which it confirmed the audit team’s report. The five-member committee, headed by Dr Randeep Guleria, (director, AIIMS), had Subodh Yadav (joint secretary, DoWR, Kal Shakti), Dr Sandeep Budhiraja (clinical direct and director internal medicines, Max Healthcare), Bhupinder S Bhalla (principal secretary home, Govt of NCT Delhi), and Sanjay Kumar Singh (controller explosives, PESO). Patra further wrote on Twitter, "Please read para 7 of the below displayed affidavit which mentions the submission of the ‘sub-committee on oxygen audit’ report to the SC. Manishji, by denying the truth you can’t escape responsibility." Subsequently, a mail trail was shared by Patra in which Dr Guleria sent an email on June 4 marked to the remaining four members, thanking them for the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhis-actions-led-to-multiple-deaths-says-bjp/articleshow/83861261.cms||---

Out of those vaccinated, more than 1.25 lakh beneficiaries were in the 18-44 years age group, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi said. “More than 1.5 lakh doses of vaccines were administered yesterday. Along with this, Delhi’s total number of vaccine doses administered has reached more than 69.5 lakh,” Atishi said on Friday. “Yesterday, more than 1.25 lakh youth came to get themselves vaccinated. As the youth steps out of their houses to get themselves vaccinated, consequently, they bring their 45+ family members along, who might have had some vaccine hesitancy. This is the reason why the vaccination speed in Delhi has increased,” she said. The MLA said that the speed of vaccination increases whenever doses are available for the youth. “That is why in the past two months, we have been, again and again, asking the central government for vaccines for the youth, to increase the manufacturing capacity of the vaccines and for increasing vaccine procurement,” she said. Vaccination the youth is important because after the opening of the lockdown, this is the same youth that needs to get out of their houses to work and nurture their families, the MLA added. Atishi said that in Delhi, more than 53 lakh people have received at least one dose of vaccine and more than 16.4 lakh people have been administered both the doses. “Currently in Delhi, a stock of 8.8 lakh doses is available, out of which 1.2 lakh are Covaxin and 7.7 lakh are Covishield,” she said, adding that since Covaxin is being used only to administer the second dose, its speed of usage is relatively less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-1-5-lakh-take-the-jab-in-city-a-single-day-record/articleshow/83852975.cms||Sidharatha Roy

On April 20, it saw over 28,000 Covid cases and 277 deaths. The daily fatality count shot up to 306 on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths, according to official data. However, the number of new cases has shown a downward trend lately and the positivity rate, too, has been shrinking over the past few days. The number of deaths per day has also dipped. Delhi has a total 23,692 Covid-19 beds, of them, only 1,044 are currently occupied. The number of patients in home isolation is 503, while the number of containment zones is 2,048, the official data added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-more-covid-deaths-115-new-cases-in-24-hours/articleshow/83857649.cms||---

The announcement was made by the Union health ministry. Confirming the news, local government officials said that Surat and Vadodara had reported one case each. Those infected include a 22-year-old medical student of Surat Municipal Corporation’s SMIMER Hospital and a 38-year-old woman from Jarod village in Waghodia taluka of Vadodara. ACS (health & family welfare) Manoj Aggarwal told TOI that Gujarat is currently sending almost 25-30% of its daily positive Covid-19 samples for sequencing. “We are relying heavily on timely input on the variants based on genomic sequencing data from Gujarat Biotechnology & Research Centre and National Institute of Virology (NIV). We have already carried out detailed contact tracing of both the cases, and have not found further cases of Delta Plus variant,” he said. The ACS said surveillance has been intensified in both Surat and Vadodara. The presence of Delta Plus variant in the two cases was confirmed by NIV, Pune. The samples of the Surat student was sent on April 10. He has recovered already but was not vaccinated when nasopharyngeal swab was collected, official sources said. “The strain can be confirmed only through genome sequencing and we sent 5% of the total samples collected during surveillance. The samples are randomly selected," said Dr Ashish Naik, deputy commissioner, health, SMC In the Vadodara case, the woman’s family has roots in Maharashtra. “We received information from the state government that genome sequencing of samples taken from a 38-year-old female resident of Jarod — who had tested Covid-19 positive in April in Maharashtra — is a case of new Delta Plus variant,” said Dr Uday Tilawat, district immunization officer and additional district health officer. “The female is completely healthy,” he said. Tilawat added neither the female resident nor her family members had tested positive in Vadodara nor were their samples collected here. “The family has four members. Her husband works with the National Disaster Response Force. They had gone to Maharashtra where their samples were tested. The female had tested positive there and recovered as well. They are residing here since May 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/surat-and-vadodara-report-one-delta-plus-case-each/articleshow/83852966.cms||---

It has been a pressing demand from the retired seamen that the state pension scheme for them may be revived. “On the occasion of International Day of Seafarers, I am glad to announce the launch of New Pension Scheme for Goan Seafarers. Under the scheme, a financial assistance of Rs 2,500 per month will be provided to retired seamen,” Sawant tweeted. There are more than 3,000 seafarers and widows who had been receiving the aid from the state from 2012 onwards, until benefits under the scheme were stopped in October 2019.

Shrikant (63) and Shashank (59), chairman and managing director of the construction firm, respectively, were detained and taken by the Vile Parle police from their Pune residence to Mumbai on Thursday night. In a statement issued to TOI, Shashank’s son Amit Paranjape, director of the construction firm, said, “The complaint was filed by one of our family members due to the misunderstanding about the share in our ancestral property." Amit said his father and uncle were called to the Vile Parle police station to "explain their side of the story" along with a few other members of the Paranjape family, including their cousins. Amit said, "It may be noted all the members of the Paranjape family are together except the complainant. This entire matter is nothing but the internal family dispute about the share in the ancestral property." Amit asserted that the case was not linked to their real estate development business and their firm. Amit said the Vile Parle police have clarified that no arrests had been made in the case. "Both my father and uncle have returned to Pune," he added. Deputy commissioner of police (zone VIII) Manjunath Singe said the two brothers have been asked to be present in Mumbai on Monday for another round of questioning pertaining to the first information report filed by Dongre on Thursday. This is the second FIR that Dongre has filed against the Paranjape brothers. While the first FIR, filed on January 16, 2020, pertained to the dispute regarding Krishna Co-operative Housing Society in Vile Parle (east), the new FIR pertains to a dispute regarding Jai Vijay Society, also in Vile Parle (east).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/paranjape-bros-questioned-not-arrested-mumbai-cops/articleshow/83857637.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The CoWin portal has already started blocking people’s attempts to register with different phone numbers, using the same ID number, in a bid to de-duplicate entries, Chairman of the Empowered Group on Covid Vaccine Administration, RS Sharma, told TOI. “If a beneficiary registers with two cellphone numbers and uses the same Aadhaar number in both accounts, s/he will be informed that the Aadhaar number has already been registered...,,” he said. For users facing issues in final certificate generation because the vaccination centres concerned failed to update user details post-vaccination, CoWin is likely to add another feature in its ‘Raise an Issue’ link, where users can ‘self declare’ having received a dose and get the provisional/final certificate. Amod Kharait, a Mumbai resident, said he got no confirmation or final vaccination certificate. “The hospital now tells me they can’t update the details... I am in a fix,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cowin-to-add-features-to-avoid-double-registration/articleshow/83857643.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Goa||Goa: Mission Rabies’ static point vaccine drive from September 28||PANAJI: Mission Rabies is going to take up a static point rabies vaccination campaign in Goa to ensure that people vaccinate their pet dogs and continue to keep the virus at bay. The campaign will be carried out at government veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, besides key sub-centres across the state for two weeks and will be held every year thereafter. The campaign will be launched on World Rabies Day, on September 28, and will go on till October 14. The proposed schedule for the campaign will focus on one taluka per day. “The static point rabies vaccination campaign is for owned dogs only, which will be free. We will also be joining hands with NGOs and animal rescuers across Goa to help us with the campaign,” said Mission Rabies project manager, Julie Corfmat. For the campaign awareness, the education team will be using a variety of channels such as social media, posters and a speaker vehicle that will make announcements in panchayat and municipal areas. They had earlier carried out the campaign in Africa where they had a record of vaccinating 800 dogs in a few hours, making it 200 vaccine administrations every hour. Given the Covid-19 pandemic, the Mission Rabies team said that they will be taking safety measures as per government norms. TOI had reported on June 23 that Goa has acquired the status of a rabies-controlled state. As of June 2021, there have been zero human rabies cases reported in Goa for over three years. In addition to this, only eight dog mediated rabies cases were reported in the first six months of this calendar year. Thus, making Goa the first state to become human rabies-controlled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mission-rabies-static-point-vaccine-drive-from-sept-28/articleshow/83857613.cms||Nida Sayed

Even the number of daily cases in the city fell to below 30. On Friday, the city recorded 27 cases and one death. The number of patients discharged stood at 85. A senior AMC official said that it was in mid-March that the city recorded less than 1,000 active cases. Thereafter, there was an increase in cases. On May 3, the city had over 65,000 active cases. The officials said, “With a drop in daily count, there’s been a drop in active cases too over the past 52 days. If the city continues to report less than 50 daily cases, the number of total cases is likely to fall below 500 in the first week of July.” AMC officials said it now remains to be seen how Covid-19 cases shape in the days to come. The number of tests conducted in the city too have gone down and hence it was clear that the citya has seen a sharp decline. They said that most cases in the second wave were reported from the western part of the city while the initially outbreak was in the eastern part, which includes the walled city area, central zone and even areas falling under the south zone. The officials added, “Even now, most of the active cases are in western part of the city. About 65% of the 988 Covid active cases are in west Ahmedabad. The remaining have mainly been reported from areas like Maninagar, Danilimda, Behrampura, Vatva and Isanpur in south zone.” Thaltej, Gota, Bodakdev, and Chandkheda in the north west zone and Jodhpur, Vejalpur and Bopal in south west zone account for the highest number of cases.

With mindfulness being a major part of the curriculum, the directorate of education (DoE) has said if any school management wants, teachers could be provided training through State Council of Educational Research and Training. Happiness Curriculum has been running in Delhi government schools since 2018. “Happiness Curriculum with focus on mindfulness has been effective in Delhi government schools since 2018. Following Delhi HC directions, private recognised schools have now been directed to introduce #Happiness Curriculum,” DoE tweeted. The order follows a petition filed in Delhi High Court for directing the Centre to provide online mindfulness classes with meditation/yoga relaxation for all government and private school students to release stress, anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses amid Covid-19. The court disposed it of with a direction to the education ministry to take a decision by treating the petition as a presentation. The ministry then constituted a committee that recommended development of “mini models on breathing exercises, mindfulness, meditation and simple yoga asanas” for holistic well-being of students, stated the DoE circular. It also suggested sharing of these models with schools for interspersing them with other lessons during online classes and also making them available on social media for students to see and practise them at any other time. “All private schools are advised to take appropriate action as per above recommendations,” the circular added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-covid-takes-toll-on-mental-health-doe-tells-pvt-schools-to-start-happiness-classes/articleshow/83853082.cms||---

And Goa saw its worst days during Digambar’s term as chief minister. His comment below shows his short term memory,” said Sawant in a tweet sharing Kamat’s post earlier in the day. However, Sawant didn’t elaborate his point while hitting back at Kamat who was Congress CM from 2007-2012 Kamat’s comments also came under fire from BJP Goa president Sadanand Shet Tanavade. “In fact, Digambar Kamat should have apologised as a responsible leader of opposition for the Emergency that had been imposed by Indira Gandhi in India, by murdering democracy just to stay in office. She did the unimaginable in a democracy at the time. But to hide their faults, the opposition is making the counter allegations. He himself has been elected three times on BJP ticket,” said Tanavade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-saw-its-worst-days-under-digambar-as-cm/articleshow/83857648.cms||---

After being passed by grace, he applied for revaluation, re-checking, but finally an RTI revealed that his answer sheet was torn and on basis of which he was marked. Along with Shreyank, his two other batchmates faced similar problem and both of them were marked failed. These students were not satisfied with their marks, applied for re-checking, then re-evaluation and then RTI. The university has now decided to give these students another chance to take exam, but students are not satisfied with that and want action to be taken against the examiner. “When we filed the RTI, the university organised a committee in which they showed us our torn copies. But still they refused to provide us our answer sheets which is our right .They want us to take exam again or some form of settlement, but we want to know how did the examiner check a copy without noticing that pages were torn,” Shreyank said. Shubham Sharma, another student, said it is not possible to fail students without putting any liability on the teacher who checked the answer sheets. The university administration said that students will be allowed to take exams when they want, but action will not be taken against the examiner. Chief exam controller Vinod Gupta said, “The committee decided that students will be allowed another exam. The examiner wasn’t found guilty in the committee.” The university is citing Section 169 of Rajasthan University Act in which a student is allowed to take re-exam in case answer sheet gets torn, burnt or gets wet. However, the section is applicable before copies are checked by the examiner, not when RTI is filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/answer-sheets-of-ru-law-students-torn-reveals-rti/articleshow/83857641.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Use of RT-PCR tests for unlock process likely to change Maharashtra’s positivity rate||The state government’s decision to rely on RT-PCR test results to decide the weekly positivity rate is likely to raise the positivity rate in many districts and push them into higher levels of restrictions than those at present. District authorities and various government instructions have, over the past few weeks, pushed for rapid antigen tests to increase surveillance, as they yield faster results. But some districts have begun using these rapid tests more than the RT-PCR tests. This is resulting in a skewed presentation of the weekly positivity rate at the state level, a state health official told TOI. Senior state officials said the latest order of ‘Levels of Restrictions for Safe Maharashtra’ issued on Friday was to set out a standard measure for assessment. The decision is likely to affect the unlock process for rural areas that were largely dependent on antigen tests as there are fewer RT-PCR laboratories in these places. The state currently has 235 RT-PCR laboratories and is conducting 60% antigen tests as against 40% RT-PCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-use-of-rt-pcr-tests-for-unlock-process-likely-to-change-states-positivity-rate/articleshow/83857672.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Sawant said that BJP is confident of winning the Porvorim seat next year. “This is only the start ahead of the 2022 state assembly polls. BJP will yet again be elected with a majority in the state. In Porvorim constituency, the lotus will bloom 100%,” said Sawant. After five panch members of Salvador do Mundo panchayat from Porvorim constituency joined BJP on Friday along with their supporters, both the CM and BJP Goa president Sadanand Shet Tanavade took potshots at Porvorim independent legislator Rohan Khaunte. “It is only the start of the change coming in the Porvorim constituency. Many have been complaining in hushed voices about the injustice done to them in Porvorim area. Now they will be emboldened to speak out freely about it. All the injustice will come out in the open now. Our government works for the common people, without any caste or class discrimination, which is evident from the fact that Antonio Fernandes from Salvador do Mundo joined us today,” said Sawant. Tanavade, speaking of Khaunte without naming him, said his dreams of becoming a minister again will never be fulfilled. After the last assembly elections, when BJP had only 13 MLAs, the Porvorim MLa was one of the three independent MLAs who supported BJP to form a coalition-led by Manohar Parrikar. He was minister for revenue and IT in the BJP-led coalition government under Manohar Parrikar (March 2017-March 2019) and later under Pramod Sawant till he was dropped from the cabinet in July 2019. “Some MLAs are dreaming of becoming ministers again. But the chief minister thought it best to remove them seeing their autocratic style of functioning. We are seeing how they are now creating an atmosphere of fear in the panchayats. Today these panchayats have been freed from this terror,” said Tanavade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lotus-will-bloom-in-porvorim-in-2022-cm/articleshow/83857654.cms||---

The enhanced range rockets can fire up to 45km as against the extended range version, which can fire up to 40km. The successful test clears the way for the company to participate in request for proposal (RFP), which may be floated by the Army in coming days for buying the rockets. Solar Group’s defence business is undertaken by its 100% subsidiary Economic Explosives Limited (EEL). This is the first private entity to have co-developed the artillery rocket system along with the ARDE and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL). This means the company has invested into the development of the rockets. Being a co-developer, Solar Group gets first exclusive production right for the system. The company has invested around Rs45 crore in the co-development project, said a source. On Friday, Solar’s 25 rockets of 122mm were fired from a mutli-barrel launcher at the integrated test range in Chandipur in Odisha. The rockets fired in quick succession were aimed at targets at different ranges. “All the mission objectives were met during the launches, the flight articles were tracked by range instruments including telemetry, radar and electro optical tracking system,” said a note shared by the company. Apart from the 25 enhanced range rockets, four of Pinaka extended range rockets, which can destroy a target up to 40km, were fired too. The mission objectives were met, said the note. The two rockets are slated to replace the existing Pinaka MK1 rockets, at present being used by the Army. The MK1 are also made by the ordnance factories. The first stage tests took place during November last year. On Friday, the last stage of the DRDO level tests were completed. Now, the Army can take up its user trials on initiating the procurement process by floating RFPs. The user trials are expected to happen after the RFP is floated. Being a co-developer of the rocket systems gives an advantage to Solar Group. The company, which has emerged as a major private sector entity for making ammunitions, is also expected to hold user trials for 81mm calibre of mortar shell in a week. Solar Group, which has bagged the order to make the latest multimodal hand-grenades for the Army, is also the first private company to make the product. The delivery of the first batch is expected soon. The multimodal grenades will be replacing the World War II design M36 grenades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citys-solar-group-hits-bulls-eye-with-enhanced-pinaka-rockets/articleshow/83853133.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Students’ Canada dreams and Covaxin conundrum||AHMEDABAD: Rajesh Ashara, a resident of Ankleshwar, had to thrice defer his plans for Toronto, Canada to pursue a masters’ degree in environmental engineering due to air travel restrictions imposed amid Covid-19 pandemic. He has managed to book his ticket for this weekend by taking a longer route. His troubles however do not seem to end here. The reason being that he has been vaccinated with Covaxin, the anti-Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech which is yet to get approval from the World Health Organization (WHO). As a result, most countries including Canada treat those administered with Covaxin as ‘non-vaccinated’. “I have booked hotels in Canada where I will be staying for 14 days as part of my quarantine period. For those who have taken two doses of WHO-approved vaccines, the quarantine rules are not applicable,” said Ashara. He is more worried about following another rule that may require receiving another vaccine, approved in that country. “I do not wish to risk my health by taking yet another dose of vaccine and that too of a different make. I am not sure of the health hazards associated with such a decision,” said Ashara. Ankit Mistry, a visa consultant based out of Ahmedabad, says he has been receiving 40-50 inquiries on a daily basis about students planning to go overseas and their concerns regarding vaccination. “I am flooded with all sorts of queries about which vaccination to be taken and which should be avoided. We are also asked if a ‘mix and match’ of vaccines can be taken. We tell them to consult doctors and medical experts. A majority of these queries are from students planning to go to Canada,” said Mistry. The cost of quarantining in Canada can vary from Rs 60,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh depending on the hotel and city. Earlier there were three connecting flight routes apart from the direct flights. They included via Muscat and Ethiopia and another one via Russia and Siberia for reaching Canada. Presently, students prefer to go Canada via Frankfurt and Mexico as the other two routes are closed for now. Dhruvi Patel is keeping her fingers crossed for the direct flights connecting Ahmedabad and Toronto to reopen. She has got her student visa to pursue BSc with biology as the main subject at a university in Canada. Patel has taken two doses of Covaxin and hopes that the prevailing confusion about vaccination ends by the time she takes a flight to Canada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/students-canada-dreams-and-covaxin-conundrum/articleshow/83853060.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Track the pollution level in your citySo far this month, Delhi has had a 34% deficit with less than 30mm of rainfall received. India Meteorological Department has forecast chances of very light rain on both Saturday and Sunday as well, while the rest of the month is unlikely to see any rain. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said the onset of monsoon was unlikely till July 1. “Friday’s rain activity was due to a cyclonic circulation forming at the lower levels, near Haryana. There is already a western disturbance trough from Jammu and Kashmir to Rajasthan and with moisture in the air, most parts of Delhi received thunderstorm activity and rain,” said Srivastava. “So far, there has been a rain deficit as the monsoon has not progressed as expected. There could be isolated drizzle activity over the weekend too, but nothing major is expected,” he added. The normal rainfall mark for June is 65.5mm. Delhi last year recorded 81.8mm of rainfall in June, after an early onset of monsoon. While the normal date for monsoon to hit Delhi is June 27, last year, it reached Delhi by June 25. Delhi’s maximum temperature was recorded at 40.1 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity, meanwhile, oscillated between 33 and 77 per cent. Met officials say humidity will continue to remain high in the next week. Delhi’s air quality is also expected to improve marginally after Friday’s rain with the air quality index (AQI) on Friday recorded at 163, which is classified as ‘moderate’. Agencies say while ventilation is favourable for dispersion, long-range transport of dust may still occur in the next three days. “Isolated rainfall is likely in the next two days. Aerosol washout may influence Air quality index marginally and it is likely to stay in the ‘moderate’ category with PM10 as the lead pollutant for the next three days,” said SAFAR, a body under Union ministry of earth sciences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/34-deficit-as-monsoon-takes-rain-check/articleshow/83857675.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

It has clocked 40% growth in pharma exports at Rs 20,500 crore in 2020-21 and Rs 4,240 crore in just the first two-and-a-half months of the current financial year. The unit approval committee of the VSEZ on Friday also granted approval for the manufacture of several lifesaving drugs and vaccines for Covid-19. VSEZ development Commissioner A Rama Mohan Reddy said approvals were granted to Hetero Biopharma for manufacturing Covid-19 drugs such as Tocilizumab, Tenecteplase, Denosumab at the Jadcherla SEZ on Hyderabad’s outskirts for testing purposes. Also, Hetero Biopharma’s Unit 2 at Jadcherla SEZ has been granted approval to make 120 million doses of Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V that will also later generate exports worth Rs 1,150 crore when the Indian government allows export of the vaccine after the domestic needs are met, ARM Reddy explained. Hetero is currently conducting phase III trials of the made in India Sputnik V drug on around 300 volunteers. Apart from Hetero, Divi’s Laboratories has been granted approval for making 100 mtpa of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of anti-viral drug Molnupiravir at its unit at Yadadri-Bhongir. VSEZ also approved Shilpa Medicare’s manufacture of 26,664 vials of 50mg of black fungus treatment drug Liposomal Amphotericin B for testing purposes at its facility in Jadcherla. Once approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), the drug is slated to go into commercial production. Reddy pointed out that most of the approval sought by pharma units are for testing and analysis, with commercial manufacturing to begin only after they get DCGI approvals. SEZ units need approval from VSEZ authorities to be able to avail import duty benefits on raw materials and for exports of finished goods, he explained. He also pointed out that while earlier there used to be more focus on new pharma units, over the past two to two-and-a-half years there has been primarily expansion of existing projects. Overall exports from VSEZ, crossed the Rs 1 trillion mark in 2020-21 despite the Covid-19 situation, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vsez-emerges-as-major-hub-for-covid-19-drugs-manufacturing/articleshow/83857656.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Level 3 is now base level, no further easing of curbs||MUMBAI: Bracing for a surge in Covid-19 cases brought on by the highly transmissible Delta-plus variant, Maharashtra has rolled back relaxations in districts and cities where theatres, malls, multiplexes had opened and private firms were permitted 100% staffing. This includes Navi Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Pune. The government has effectively done away with the first two levels of unlocking —Level 1 and 2—that offered the most relaxations, citing the potential threat of an “imminent” third wave which is expected to be “more severe”, according to an order by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday. This does not change anything for Mumbai, though, which is at Level 3 despite being eligible for Level 1. All districts and cities in Level 1 or 2 will slip to 3. Irrespective of indicators like weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy, unlocking will now be only at three levels, starting with 3 at the easiest and going up to level 5. Those at level 4 and 5 will continue to face the restrictions applicable. Most cities in MMR will be at level 3, except places in Raigad district which were at 4 last week. Going by indicators last week, there were 25 districts in the state eligible for level 1, 8 at level 3 and 3 at level 4. “This revision has been done in the wake of the emergence of the Delta-Plus variant and the advisory received from the Centre and the state task force. The Delta-Plus variant is a huge cause of concern and we cannot afford to take it leniently,” said Aseem Gupta, relief and rehabilitation secretary. The order says new variants like Delta, Delta-Plus, may precipitate a more severe third wave in 4-6 weeks across a wider geographical area. So far, 21 cases of the Delta-Plus variant have been reported from Maharashtra—nine in Ratnagiri, seven in Jalgaon, two in Mumbai and one each in Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg. “A big problem this time is that the public was just not co-operating. Crowding, no adherence to health norms were being reported on a large scale,” said an official. To make the mechanism stricter, the government will allow ranking to shift to an easier level only after a declining trend is observed for two weeks. Earlier, decisions were based on a week’s data. However, to tighten, a two-week period may not be considered and districts will not require permission from the government to impose fresh restrictions. Also, to determine the weekly positivity rate, only RT-PCR tests will be taken into account and not antigen or other tests, which throw up more false negatives. “We saw that just to bring down the numbers, many districts were doing random mass antigen tests which defeat the purpose. We’ve directed districts to not play around with numbers just to be on a lower level with others,” said an official. Districts have also been asked to make efforts to get 70% of their eligible population vaccinated, especially encourage work place vaccination. Also, to tackle violation of Covid-appropriate behavioural (CAB) norms, flying squads will be sent to places like marriage halls and restaurants. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said the revision in guidelines is not surprising. “The five-point formula to unlock is a dynamic process… at the moment, cases are coming down but not fast enough. There is a threat of the Delta-Plus variant,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/level-3-is-now-base-level-no-further-easing-of-curbs/articleshow/83861751.cms||Bhavika Jain

Hyderabad Metro Rail did not operate train services for several months. Larsen & Toubro CEO and MD, SN Subrahmanyan, and L&THMRL CEO, KVB Reddy, met CM K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday and sought support in view of the losses. A force majeure clause provides temporary reprieve to a party from performing its obligations under a contract.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand officials part of illegal mining, says Maneka Gandhi to CM Tirath Singh Rawat||DEHRADUN: Former Union minister and BJP leader Maneka Gandhi has sent a strongly-worded letter to Chief minister Tirath Rawat raising objections over a community reserve being made for migratory birds in Bailpadav in Nainital and Bajpur in Udham Singh Nagar and accused state government officials of facilitating illegal mining in the area in the name of constructing the reserve. She has asked the CM to immediately institute an inquiry in the matter so that “the truth about the reserve comes out.” In the letter, dated June 22, Maneka Gandhi, the BJP MP from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh, has claimed that the construction of the Migratory Birds Community Reserve is being pushed at the instance of mining mafia and demanded immediate scrapping of the whole project. Accusing the state government officials of being hand in glove with the mining mafia, Gandhi alleged that it is not possible to call migratory birds by digging a lake this way. Thus, it is clear that the purpose of this whole project is to give a money-making opportunity to the mining mafia, added Gandhi. The minister has also thrown several questions at the state government in the letter, including — can migratory birds be brought there by digging a lake, did the officials conduct any survey about migratory birds or even made a list of such birds, which migratory birds come to Uttarakhand, where do they come from and where are they found in the state, and what other locations have been selected to create a community reserve, among others. In her letter, Maneka Gandhi also made a reference to her previous letter, dated October 26, 2020, sent to former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat over the same matter. It is to be noted that the state government, in August 2020, gave sanction to making a community reserve for migratory birds in Bailpadav in Nainital and in Bajpur, Udham Singh Nagar. Subsequently, in October 2020, Maneka Gandhi raised objections over the project and sent a letter to the then CM. In another letter, dated January 5, 2021, Gandhi had alleged financial irregularities of Rs 3,000 crore in the Uttarakhand Sheep and Wool Development Board (USWDB) and compared it to the infamous Bofors Scandal. Later, Trivendra Singh Rawat directed USWDB to initiate a high-level inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/maneka-gandhi-writes-to-ukhand-cm-tirath-rawat-says-many-state-govt-officials-involved-in-illegal-mining/articleshow/83850694.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Covid gains for medicos as average salary rises by 25%||AHMEDABAD: When Dhanvantari Covid Hospital started functioning, the advertisement for various positions indicated monthly salary of Rs 2.5-Rs 3 lakh for specialists and Rs 1.25-Rs 1.5 lakh for MBBS graduates with GMC registration. The pay package was about twice what the doctors were drawing at government hospitals. Similar moves across the health sector also resulted in correction in salaries of resident doctors. Covid pandemic put the healthcare sector in sharp focus, with the first wave marked by fear and second by apprehension. “By mid-April, many were exhausted. There was seemingly non-stop queue of patients. Many were getting serious and needed transfer or midnight assistance. Doctors worked round-the-clock with no other way out,” said a junior doctor at the Civil Hospital on condition of anonymity. Thus, healthcare workers in both government and private sector gained, even as some of the demands are pending and a few agitations are still going on. Babu Thomas, CHRO of Shalby Group of Hospitals, said that the rise in incentives is directly linked to the risks that healthcare professionals are exposed to during the pandemic. “In the first wave, 200 of our staff members were infected with Covid-19. This dropped to 13 in the second wave due to factors like vaccination. The salary parity of clinical staff thus rose 20-25% across the sector. Moreover, those working in Covid wards were also provided additional incentives,” he said. Would the rush for healthcare workers continue? Thomas said that hospitals like his have retained majority of the staff members. “It’s likely that the healthcare workers would be in demand for at least some time. In addition to our existing staff, we have also kept a few fresh nurses on call if we need to scale up the operations at a short notice,” he said. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association , said that from doctors to paramedics, those on Covid duty got 50% incentive of their salary on top of the salary hike. “Not just hospitals, several Covid care centres also opened up, and the state government also launched a major recruitment drive. This increased demand. The salary was also hiked to retain talent,” he said. “I believe that the trend is likely to continue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-gains-for-medicos-as-avg-salary-rises-by-25/articleshow/83853121.cms||Parth Shastri

The BMC’s L Ward has more than a dozen civic vaccination centres located within nursing homes for non-Covid patients, in community centres and in a madrassa. The L Ward, which comprises slum pockets from Zari Mari to Qureshi Nagar, Asalpha and Khairani Road, wanted to ensure people take advantage of the free vaccine drive held in their locality. So far, just over 50,238 people have been vaccinated from a population is around 10 lakh. A similar kind of drive has been undertaken in the F-North ward, which covers slum pockets of Sion. “Many in the slums had issues registering themselves and even when they tried, they said they could not find a slot. Therefore, we have got NGO staff to assist these people and create awareness in the community on the importance of vaccination,” said Manish Walunju, assistant municipal commissioner, L Ward. Civic staff said many a times, the residents gave reasons like not being able to skip work or cited lack of time to avoid visiting a centre, however near. Anil Parmar, vice-president of the NGO United Way Mumbai, which has been sending out its staff to the slums, said they accompany community health volunteers. “We are only attempting to bridge the gap between a vaccination centre and slum pockets. While vaccines are available for them, there is a need to break vaccine hesitancy, which we were surprised to find in an urban area like Mumbai as well,” said Parmar. Another member of the NGO said many get suspicious when asked to share their Aadhaar card or any other personal details, so they tag along with community voluteers. “Most of the volunteers are well known in the community and locals already have a rapport with them. Through them, we help those in the slums register, book a slot and reach a centre, if required. Our staff also speaks to them in their own language, if possible, so they are more comfortable. We have registered 1,589 people so far, of whom 178 have been vaccinated,” said Sheetal Palande from the NGO. A similar drive in Dharavi was undertaken when it started the city’s first vaccination centre in the dense slums in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ngos-help-bmc-get-hesitant-slum-dwellers-to-vax-centres/articleshow/83857689.cms||Richa Pinto

CCP required 11 trucks to remove the trash, CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes said. While the driftwood will be used at the municipal crematorium at St Inez, the remaining trash was taken to the civic body’s sorting centre to be segregated and sent to cement plants in Karnataka to be incinerated. “Around 30 workers of ours and volunteers from the Rotary Club of Miramar helped clean up the beach,” said Fernandes. Several bags of plastic were also collected from the beach. The plastic will be compressed into bales to be taken to cement plants. The vegetation debris was so much that CCP had to use the entire vacant space under the Mandovi bridge near Dvija circle to dump the wood. CCP mayor Rohit Monserrate joined the workers and volunteers. With the onset of monsoons, experts said waste that was floating in the Mandovi and out at sea tends to wash ashore during high tide. As the tide recedes, the garbage stays back. Fernandes said that similar cleanliness drives will be conducted in Ribandar. CCP workers will undertake clearing of drains, weeds and trimming of trees for the second time across the city, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flotsam-to-clothes-plastic-11-trucks-of-trash-collected-from-miramar-beach/articleshow/83857683.cms||---

By evening, Shekhawat tweeted a pic of the meeting between the two Congress leaders and remarked, “Chief whip sir, I learnt that you are in Delhi. For your convenience, I have written here the address of police headquarters (Delhi). The same is written on the summon lying on the table (in the pic). Do comply with it after the meeting.” Reacting to Shekhawat’s tweet, Joshi told TOI, “Neither my name nor any address is visible in the pic of paper on the table. Still, the minister was able to read it. This shows he was the one who got it issued by pressurising the Delhi police.” Joshi added, “Minister sir, you should have at least got the notice issued under a correct CrPC section. I would have then certainly appeared before the Delhi police. But your naivety has rendered your conspiracy unsuccessful.”A day earlier, Joshi was required to appear before the Delhi police’s special operation squad-I for questioning in the phone tapping case lodged by Shekhawat. The chief whip, however, dispatched a reply saying CrPC section 160, under which the notice was issued, required the police to go to the person’s house if his age was 65 years or more. Joshi is 66 years old.The Congress leader had said that Shekhawat was morally a “bhagoda” (absconder) for failing to appear before the Rajasthan police in a similar case related to phone tapping registered here. The Congressmen held a demonstration against the union minister in the walled city on Friday. Shekhawat reacted by tweeting, “Congressmen will protest, raise demands, but they will not tell who is called a ‘bhagoda’? One who is currently moving around in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara and doing his work, or the one who speaks lies on twitter and sneaks to Bangkok?” Shekhawat, who was in Bhilwara on Friday, made the Bangkok remark apparently for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s 2019 trip.In another tweet, Shekhawat said, “From Richard Nixon to Ramakrishna Hegde, many leaders have had to resign when caught phone tapping. It's time the Rajasthan govt too accepts its misdeeds. Where is Gehlot ji's close aide? What 'personal work' is keeping him from responding to the summons? #Rajasthan.

---||Hyderabad||Pay relief to M’Sagar oustees while they are still alive: HC||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Friday told Siddipet district collector P Venkatrama Reddy to sit with nearly 80 farmers, displaced by the emergence of the Mallanna Sagar reservoir, on July 5 and hand over compensation cheques and rehabilitation packages. Most of the farmers are senior citizens. “No more technical objections, clever excuses to avoid payments. We are vexed with such ruses. They lost their land and dwellings for the cause of Mallanna Sagar reservoir. Do not wait for their demise. Pay them when they are still alive,” said a special bench, known as a green bench, of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice P Naveen Rao. The bench was hearing two petitions filed by Y Kamalamma, Nayini Annavva, and eighty others from Vemulaghat and Etigadda Kistapur villages which are getting submerged in the reservoir. The bench asked the state counsel Radhive Reddy why officials were paying different rates to different people in these two villages. The petitioners’ counsel alleged that the officials were waiting for the senior citizens to die to avoid paying rehabilitation benefits. The high court earlier directed the state to treat every major member of the family as a separate family unit and pay rehabilitation benefits separately. The state has a grievance here and is fighting a legal battle against it. But the state conceded that this tussle has got nothing to do with those families that have only one senior citizen. Despite conceding that such people should be paid first, the state failed to pay them citing this litigation, the farmers’ counsel said.  The bench directed the state counsel to ask the district collector to pay them on July 5. “If you have any problem with any of these cases, come back to us on July 9,” the bench said. “Do not dispossess any of the petitioners till then. We are also working in a constructive way where neither the project nor the people suffer. But if you take it lightly, then we have to take harsher steps. Do not force us to a stage of staying the work,” the bench warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pay-relief-to-msagar-oustees-while-they-are-still-alive-hc/articleshow/83853218.cms||---

Nurses, paramedical staff and peripheral staff got their share of limelight in talent hunt launched by several hospitals. At its peak, Ahmedabad city had 107 private hospitals treating over 6,000 Covid patients. “Almost all available nurses – including fresh graduates from some of the nursing colleges – were employed. When there was a sudden demand for Covid beds, talent agencies from other states were approached. Several nurses were brought to the city on the condition of free accommodation and meals,” said a senior HR official. Dr M M Prabhakar, president of Gujarat Nursing Council said that majority of the nursing colleges recorded sharp rise in demand in both 2020 and 2021. “The demand got translated into monetary gain.” A staff nurse gets Rs 40,000 in government hospitals, whereas those on contractual appointment gets Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000. Those on outsourcing job gets Rs 15,000, said industry experts. In private hospitals, the pay varies between Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000 based on nature of duty, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/demand-for-nurses-spikes/articleshow/83853182.cms||---

Leaving early without intimation is also not an option if you do not want a salary cut or face disciplinary action. After receiving multiple complaints about employees coming late for work and leaving before scheduled time, the state general administration department has passed an order saying that such employees will face strict action. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, government employees were given exemption from electronically swiping their cards, which register entry and exit time, till June 30. However, many employees took advantage of the concession and either flouted attendance norms or remained absent from office altogether. GAD issued an order to all secretaries and department heads to watch out for employees bunking office and take necessary action against them by deducting their half-day salary. The GAD circular said, “At a high-level meeting held under chairpersonship of additional chief secretary (finance), the issue of employees remaining absent was discussed and it was decided that action would be takena against such people.” As per the new instruction, any employee who comes to office 10 minutes later than scheduled time or leaves 10 minutes earlier than scheduled time for three days in a month, will lose half a day’s salary. The GAD circular also states that employees will have inform immediate superior and department head in advance and take permission if they happen to be late for office. GAD has directed the concerned section officer, under and deputy secretaries to ensure that the employees report to work on time and do not leave before 6pm time limit set by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/late-for-office-govt-staffers-will-face-pay-cut/articleshow/83853233.cms||---

Revealing this, additional civic commissioner Suresh Kakani said BMC was considering more options but would wait for the police report. “If the vaccine was not genuine, we will also need to approach the Centre to nullify vaccination certificates issued to these people,” said Kakani. Even as police unearth newer victims, the BMC has launched a drive to monitor the health of those vaccinated. BMC staff have been calling up Hiranandani society’s 390 residents, who took the vaccine on May 30, to enquire about their health. BMC officials said around 50 victims could be reached so far, and they had no health complaints. When the society registered complaints, most victims confessed they were worried about what was injected into them. A civic doctor who didn’t want to be identified said there are three possibilities. “They could have got genuine vaccines, though it is seeming unlikely as probe progresses. The second possibility is they got something unsafe but then, some residents would have had some side-effect,” he said. The third possibility is saline water or glucose was injected, and they won’t suffer any side-effects. Dr Prince Surana of the Surana group of hospitals involved in Covid vaccination said that as most complainants have completed four weeks of vaccination, special consideration could be made for them to get a fresh shot. “The previous gap between two shots was 28 days, so it is not unscientific to give them a fresh shot,” he said. Twelve weeks thereafter, they should undergo an antibody test. “If they haven't developed adequate antibodies by then, they should be given the second shot as well,” said Dr Surana. The BMC enquiry report had suggested expert opinion be taken on re-vaccinations, the partially-vaccinated status cancelled and an antibody test done if required. A resident from Hiranandani Heritage CHS, Dinesh Zala, whose wife and brother were part of the drive of May 30, said, "We feel investigations are not moving right as BMC is checking with the vaccine manufacturer about the batch number on the vaccine certificates, but these certificates were given several days later. This means it’s unlikely the vaccine from that vial was administered.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-may-re-vaccinate-victims-of-fraud-if-jabs-are-found-bogus/articleshow/83857719.cms||Richa Pinto

Over 60,000 government teachers were given tablets in 2018-19. Deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia said, “The vision of the government is to provide excellent education to each child, and disseminating tablets to teachers is a step in this direction. Usage of tabs by teachers will enable better teaching and learning.” The tabs have necessary teaching and learning materials to ease the process of online teaching for educators.“In the 21st century, it has become supremely important to incorporate various novel techniques in teaching.

He also quashed speculations that he was keen on returning to local politics. “I won’t come to local politics. I have three more years as MP,” he said in reply to a query. Sardinha further said that Congress wouldn’t accept any of the 10 rebel MLAs who switched over to BJP. “Let them go anywhere,” he said to another query. He also voiced his opinion against the Congress-NCP alliance. “Is there NCP left in Goa? The only NCP MLA is in the lap of the BJP. It’s interesting that though he has claimed to have given issue-based support to the BJP-led government, he didn’t find any issue over the last many years to take on BJP,” he said. Pointing out that the present BJP government in Goa hasn’t been elected by the people, Sardinha said BJP came to office only because of (mistakes committed by) Congress leaders. He also voiced his disapproval over the public meeting on Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) scheduled to be held on July 8, saying he favoured village-wise meetings instead. “The third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to hit us. During the second wave you didn’t apply your mind and you are the cause of the deaths of thousands of Goans. Don’t repeat the mistake,” he cautioned the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-congress-needs-leadership-change-to-win-2022-polls-sardinha/articleshow/83857698.cms||---

For the tiger safari at the Sariksa Tiger Reserve (STR) including morning and evening, only six vehicles with 24 tourists went on Friday. A senior official informed, “In morning safari, three gypsies having 12 tourists entered from Tehla gate. Similarly, one safari gypsy in morning and one in evening went for the safari from Sariska gate. Total 10 tourists went by these two gypsies. Also, one gypsy with two tourists went on a safari in Alwar buffer zone.”Though turnout was less, tourists, nature guides and gypsy drivers who were missing safari since April 17 were elated.Dinesh Kasana, a nature guide at STR, said, “The pandemic has hit the livelihood badly and we are hoping the situation will be soon normal as queries have started flowing. On morning safari, we did not have tiger sighting, but safari in forest and seeing other wildlife was peace to mind.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tiger-reserves-reopen-a-few-tourists-turn-up/articleshow/83857711.cms||---
---||Goa||Calangute panchayat takes lead, sterilises 2,500 stray dogs||PANAJI: In a bid to control the stray dog population within their jurisdictions, about 20 civic bodies in Goa have tied up with the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services (AHVS). Among these, the Calangute panchayat has sterilised 2,000 dogs in its jurisdiction. “We have signed an MoU with Noah’s animal care shelter in Calangute and with the help of state government funding, we have managed to sterilise dogs in the entire coastal belt of the jurisdiction. As a result, we have seen a substantial decrease in puppies in the village,” Calangute sarpanch, Shawn Martins told TOI. Simultaneously, the anti-rabies dog vaccination drive by Mission Rabies is ongoing in the village. Calangute has a total of nine vaddos and has a population of roughly 2,500 stray dogs. While majority of these are territorial, about 500-600 dogs migrate to and from the neighbouring villages of Arpora and Candolim. Being a coastal region in north Goa, the village of Calangute and its coastline is frequented by tourists and therefore sees a heavy motor-vehicle population during the peak season. Road accidents due to stray cattle and bovines on the beach are a common sight in the area. The panchayat has also decided to control the stray cattle population by lifting the animals and handing them to Gomantak Gosevak Mahasangh, a cattle-shed in Sikeri, Bicholim. The panchayat will start this initiative beginning from Sunday. In another such drive held last year they had handed 200 stray cattle to the cattle shed. “The panchayat is committed to reduce the population of stray dogs and to see that the number of accidents and nuisance caused by stray cattle on roads and beaches reduce. There will be a substantial reduction in both these menaces in the next tourist season.” Martins said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-panchayat-takes-lead-sterilises-2k-stray-dogs/articleshow/83857708.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC reunites intercaste couple forced to seek divorce||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has reunited a couple who were forced to sign divorce papers by the woman’s family members who were not happy with the inter-caste marriage. They were separated within two weeks of declaration of their marriage. The case involved a 32-year-old doctor serving in a public health centre in Deodar taluka and a staff nurse working in another government health centre nearby. They fell in love and got married in 2017. Since the woman’s family was against such union, she kept her marriage a secret for four years and both of them continued to stay separate. The doctor belongs to Thakor community, while the nurse is from Chaudhary community. It was on May 12 that they got their marriage registered. The declaration of their marriage agitated the woman’s family members who did not approve it. In two weeks, the extreme pressure exerted by the woman’s family forced them to sign a divorce deed, which was notarised on May 26. The woman was taken to her parental home and was not allowed to see the doctor. According to the doctor’s advocate Jigar Gadhavi, barely a week passed after their separation and his client received a message from the nurse informing him that she was forcibly kept apart and that she wanted to join him again. She requested him to free her from the family’s confinement. This led the doctor to file a habeas corpus petition in the high court on June 10 narrating the facts on how they were separated and made to sign a divorce deed. The bench of Justice R M Chhaya and Justice Nirzar Desai asked for presence of the woman, who appeared before the court through video conferencing. She told the court that she was 26 years of age and expressed her desire to reunite with the doctor. The court permitted her to join the doctor and “live her own life as per her own wish”. The court directed the Banaskantha police to provide security to the couple till they reach the doctor’s village, Tervada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-reunites-intercaste-couple-forced-to-seek-divorce/articleshow/83853356.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Prakash Raj throws his hat in Movie Artistes Association ring, eyes president post||HYDERABAD: A battle royale is on the cards as bigwigs of Tollywood prepare to fight for supremacy in the Movie Artistes Association (MAA). The elections are to be held in September but the poll bugle was sounded by none other than national award winner Prakash Raj, who is vying to become the president. That Prakash Raj was planning to enter the fray was known and on Friday, he made it official flanked by his supporters. He, however, dismissed questions about him not being from the Telugu states. “I cannot be called an outsider. Neither are there any groups in the industry based on caste. So, do not drag us into unnecessary issues,” Prakash Raj, who hails from Karnataka, said. On Friday, he announced the names of 27 artistes who would be in his panel, including actress and former MLA Jayasudha. Prakash Raj camp comprises former president of MAA K Nagendra Babu and producer-actor Bandla Ganesh. It is obvious that Prakash Raj camp has the support of megastar Chiranjeeevi. There are nearly 900 artistes who are members of MAA and they will vote for various posts. Prakash Raj’s main rival will be Manchu Vishnu who has also made his intentions of running for the president’s post clear. His father Mohan Babu had served as president of MAA before. Despite the camaraderie they show, Chiranjeevi and Mohan Babu’s off-screen fights are legendary. In a sense, it is going to be a clash of both the senior actors in the MAA elections. “Even if we may seem like we are fighting, the fact will always be that we are a family and any rivalry is only for the elections. That is also because one group may feel that it can do a better job than the good work that has been done previously,” Bandla Ganesh said. Actor Jeevitha Rajasekhar is also said to be keen on throwing her hat in the ring but before she does that, a panel with a substantial list of names of people who will support her will have to be ready. It is also being speculated that actress Hema is likely to enter the fray. If she does, it would mean that there would be four contestants in the fray for the post of president of MAA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prakash-raj-throws-his-hat-in-maa-ring-eyes-prez-post/articleshow/83853240.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

This is the first death linked to the emerging variant in the state. Almost all other patients have recovered, officials said. The deceased was an 80-year-old woman from Ratnagiri whose son, too, was detected with the new Sars-CoV-2 variant. The son, in his late 50s, has recovered; none of their other family members had Covid. The octogenarian was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric condition and turned out to be positive when she was tested. The woman passed away at the civil hospital in Ratnagiri, where doctors said it was challenging to feed her or put her on oxygen support. Her son was moved from a Covid Care Centre to the hospital to stay close to her. Her oxygen levels had plunged critically towards the end. Delta-Plus or ‘AY.1’ has mutated from the highly transmissible Delta variant (B.1.617.2) that was first isolated in India and is currently the predominant strain world over. Of the 21 cases found in Maharashtra, Ratnagiri has reported the highest (9). Three of the nine were children and two were senior citizens. None of the affected adults were immunised. The variant was found between May-end and early June from a batch of 157 samples sent for genome sequencing as a routine exercise. At least six cases were from three different families, unlike the case with Delta where entire families were affected. “Also, none of the affected patients had symptoms drastically different from other classic Covid cases,” Ratnagiri civil surgeon Dr Sanghmitra Phule said. The district has since intensified tests and is screening nearly 8,000 people daily. Despite the district accounting for more Delta-Plus cases, district collector Laxminarayan Mishra said people were reluctant to come forward for testing. The district is awaiting results of another 117 samples sent for sequencing to Delhi’s CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology) lab. The Union health ministry on Friday said 48 cases of Delta-Plus have been found in the country with Maharashtra reporting the highest, followed by seven in MP which includes two deaths. Though there is limited data to link Delta-Plus to high transmissibility or virulence at the moment, Dr Rajesh Pandey, principal scientist at New Delhi’s CSIR-IGIB, said it does hold potential for immune escape and virulence since it has emerged from the Delta variant, which was the major driver of the last surge. “Delta-Plus is already detected globally. More than 10 countries including the UK, the US and Europe have it,” he said, adding that genome sequencing, aggressive contact tracing, local containment and infrastructure build- up will be the main ways to control its spread. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, an advisor to the state, said Delta-Plus should not create unnecessary panic but there shouldn’t be complacency either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/80-year-old-states-1st-death-linked-to-delta/articleshow/83859540.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Rampant encroachments on roads, pavements and river sides have adversely affected vehicular traffic and created bottlenecks. On Friday, Tiwari convened a meeting in this regard with NMC’s enforcement department and traffic police. Recently, leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve had raised the issue in the general body meeting and demanded action against automobile workshops operating along the roads and on footpaths. Wanve also raised the issue of second-hand vehicle dealers displaying vehicles on footpaths and roads, especially between Baidyanath Chowk and Jagnade Chowk. The mayor pointed out that vehicle repair and denting-painting workshops have been set up all over the city. He also cited example of footpaths on both sides of Agrasen Chowk to Chitnis Park road that have been occupied by dealers of old two-wheelers. NMC has no authority to take action against such vehicles. But Nagpur police can take joint action with the NMC against those selling vehicles from footpaths, the mayor said. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, deputy commissioner Mahesh Moroney, police inspectors (traffic) Deepak Sakhare, Sanjay Jadhav, PSI Umakant Jadhav, ARTO Martand Nevaskar, assistant municipal commissioners Prakash Warade, Ashok Patil, Ganesh Rathod, Ghanshyam Pandhare, Kiran Bagade, Sushma Mandge and Sadhana Patil attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-traffic-police-to-launch-drive-against-encroachers-next-week/articleshow/83857704.cms||---

Vision Estates firm bought the properties for Rs 22.5 crore. AP CID additional DG P V Sunil Kumar filed an affidavit stating that they verified the deal and certified that the buyer of the properties is not a Benami or frontman of the scam-hit company. This is the second biggest auction sale of the properties of the company. Earlier, the corporate office of AgriGold in Punjagutta was sold for Rs 14 crore. AgriGold depositors and agents welfare association, the petitioner in the case, however, raised doubts about the auction. Its counsel K Sravan Kumar said that in both these auctions only a single bidder has come and the sale was confirmed. He brought to the notice of the court the practice in Bombay high court where the details of properties put for auction are displayed on the high court website itself. “Here we are not aware of the details. We are not aware of the advertisements given in AP newspapers inviting bidders for the auction,” he said. The bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Amarnath Goud said that the banks have been trying to attract more auction purchasers. Earlier, the auction was cancelled due to the lack of bidders, but the subsequent auctions too turned out to be no different. As the banks are left with no other option than to realise atleast a part of their money, the bench said that it would not be wiser to dodge the issue anymore. “Even the petitioner association could not bring in any better bidders,” the bench reminded. The bench directed the AP registration department and the sub-registrar concerned to register the properties in favour of the auction purchaser.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-agrigold-properties-sold-for-rs-36-crore/articleshow/83853276.cms||---

---||Mumbai||ED on Rs 4 crore ‘hafta’ trail, arrests Maharashtra ex-minister Anil Deshmukh’s 2 aides||MUMBAI: The ED searched multiple properties of former home minister Anil Deshmukh here and in Nagpur and arrested his personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde past midnight on Friday as part of its probe into a money laundering case tied to a CBI FIR against Deshmukh for corruption. They are the first arrests in the bribery allegation against Deshmukh. The ED had earlier conducted searches at the premises of Palande, of additional collector rank, and Shinde, besides interrogating at length Deshmukh’s son Salil who was at their Nagpur GPO chowk home. The ED is following a trail of Rs 4 crore that it believes is part of money collected by dismissed cop Sachin Waze from 12 bars and passed on to Deshmukh. “The money from the bar owners was deposited into accounts of shell firms and then diverted to an entity linked to the Deshmukh family,” said a source. After hours of grilling ex-min’s aides, ED makes first arrestsFormer home minister Anil Deshmukh’s official bungalow, Dnyaneshwari, at Malabar Hill, his residences at Worli in Mumbai and Nagpur, and the houses of his aides Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde were among those searched on Friday. The ED officials directed Palande and Shinde to accompany them to their Ballard Estate office for questioning. They were arrested past midnight, after hours of questioning. They will be produced in court on Saturday for remand. Friday’s action came on the back of searches of premises linked to Deshmukh by CBI as well as ED. The arrests were the first in the corruption allegations case. Deshmukh, who was present in his Worli home during the search, later told reporters: “After his transfer from Mumbai police commissioner’s post, Param Bir Singh made baseless allegations against me. There is no truth in that and I will cooperate in the investigation.” Deshmukh has been accused by Singh of asking sacked cop Sachin Waze, now in jail over planting explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house and murdering a businessman, to collect Rs100 crore from bars and restaurants every month for him. A day before the searches, the ED had recorded the statement of DCP Raju Bhujbal, a key witness. Deshmukh allegedly repeated the Rs 100 crore demand after calling Bhujbal, along with ACP Sanjay Patil, at his official residence. Lashing out at Singh, Deshmukh alleged on Friday that all the officers involved in planting of explosives and murder of Mansukh Hiren were directly reporting to him and so he can’t escape responsibility. “When we found that the role of Param Bir Singh was suspicious and that all the officers involved in the serious crime were his trusted men, we shunted him out. So long as he was Mumbai police commissioner, he had maintained a discreet silence. A day after he was shifted, he made baseless and false allegations. My contention is that if he was so serious about corruption, he should have made the allegations when he was CP,” said Deshmukh. In March, the state government had shunted out Singh due to unacceptable lapses in handling the planting of explosives case. After the controversy, the CBI has registered a corruption case against Deshmukh on the direction of the Bombay high court, following which he quit as minister. Subsequently, the ED also registered a money laundering case to investigate the trail of the money illegally collected from bar owners.

The BJP observed June 25 as Black Day to mark the anniversary of national Emergency. “The government must free the people from the undeclared emergency causing hardships, pains and sufferings to the citizens of Goa. BJP government should stop raking up the Emergency which is already put to rest by the people of India.” the Margao MLA said. The leader of opposition said former prime minister Indira Gandhi had publicly apologised for the Emergency of January 24, 1978 and that “the nation had forgiven her and brought her back to power. He further said that the “the complete failure” of the BJP government resulted in “health emergency” in Goa with almost 74 patients dying due to shortage of oxygen. “There is financial emergency in the state with BJP government pushing Goa into bankruptcy. There is no sign of revival of mining, and tourism industry is hit badly due to faulty policies of the government,” the Margao MLA added. He further said that the BJP government has also imposed social emergency in the state by using high handedness to suppress the voice of the people. “Three linear projects - railway double tracking, highway expansion and laying of power lines are imposed on the people against their wishes. There will be huge destruction of environment, wildlife and identity of Goa will be destroyed,” he said. He said that the National Security Act invoked by the government in South Goa was “to create fear in the minds of the people and restrict their participation in public hearings on Coastal Zone Management Plan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/undeclared-emergency-in-goa-by-bjp-govt-voices-suppressed-kamat/articleshow/83857716.cms||---

The nala is located in Begumpet and several areas in Begumpet were inundated due to the floods last year. Rama Krishna alleged that even though the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is getting enough funds to develop the nalas, the Cantonment areas are not granted funds for development. Meanwhile, locals joined in the protest and expressed their anguish over the SCB officials’ apathy in the Cantonment areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cantt-bjp-demands-rs-100cr-for-development-of-nalas/articleshow/83853307.cms||---

They are the first arrests in the bribery allegation against Deshmukh. The ED had earlier conducted searches at the premises of Palande, of additional collector rank, and Shinde, besides interrogating at length Deshmukh’s son Salil who was at their Nagpur GPO chowk home. The ED is following a trail of Rs 4 crore that it believes is part of money collected by dismissed cop Sachin Waze from 12 bars and passed on to Deshmukh. “The money from the bar owners was deposited into accounts of shell firms and then diverted to an entity linked to the Deshmukh family,” said a source. After hours of grilling ex-min’s aides, ED makes first arrestsFormer home minister Anil Deshmukh’s official bungalow, Dnyaneshwari, at Malabar Hill, his residences at Worli in Mumbai and Nagpur, and the houses of his aides Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde were among those searched on Friday. The ED officials directed Palande and Shinde to accompany them to their Ballard Estate office for questioning. They were arrested past midnight, after hours of questioning. They will be produced in court on Saturday for remand. Friday’s action came on the back of searches of premises linked to Deshmukh by CBI as well as ED. The arrests were the first in the corruption allegations case. Deshmukh, who was present in his Worli home during the search, later told reporters: “After his transfer from Mumbai police commissioner’s post, Param Bir Singh made baseless allegations against me. There is no truth in that and I will cooperate in the investigation.” Deshmukh has been accused by Singh of asking sacked cop Sachin Waze, now in jail over planting explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house and murdering a businessman, to collect Rs100 crore from bars and restaurants every month for him. A day before the searches, the ED had recorded the statement of DCP Raju Bhujbal, a key witness. Deshmukh allegedly repeated the Rs 100 crore demand after calling Bhujbal, along with ACP Sanjay Patil, at his official residence. Lashing out at Singh, Deshmukh alleged on Friday that all the officers involved in planting of explosives and murder of Mansukh Hiren were directly reporting to him and so he can’t escape responsibility. “When we found that the role of Param Bir Singh was suspicious and that all the officers involved in the serious crime were his trusted men, we shunted him out. So long as he was Mumbai police commissioner, he had maintained a discreet silence. A day after he was shifted, he made baseless and false allegations. My contention is that if he was so serious about corruption, he should have made the allegations when he was CP,” said Deshmukh. In March, the state government had shunted out Singh due to unacceptable lapses in handling the planting of explosives case. After the controversy, the CBI has registered a corruption case against Deshmukh on the direction of the Bombay high court, following which he quit as minister. Subsequently, the ED also registered a money laundering case to investigate the trail of the money illegally collected from bar owners.

---||Nagpur||Shops, malls, restaurants in Nagpur city to remain open till 4pm||NAGPUR: The district, which had been in Level 1 since the unlock system was introduced in June first week, has moved into Level 3 — that allows only a few relaxations — due to the revised guidelines issued by the state government on Friday. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector Ravindra Thakre told TOI that from June 28 essential, non-essential shops, private offices, gyms etc will have to shut at 4pm and not 8pm. Restaurants and bars will be impacted the most as they too will have shut at 4 pm as against 11pm. Home delivery will be allowed till 10 pm. According to sources, though malls are not allowed under level 3, authorities here have permitted them till 4pm citing weekly test positivity rate (TPR) of below 1% as on June 24. The final orders are expected on Saturday. President of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT) Dipen Agrawal told TOI that the latest decision is not good for traders. “Government should continue with relaxations given as per the level system. It was introduced after a scientific study following repeated demand from us to lift restrictions,” he said. Agrawal said the administration has taken a decision without any proper study. “Traders cannot survive if shops are not allowed till 9pm and restrictions continue for more months even when weekly test positivity rate is below 5%. Restrictions can be imposed if cases increase,” he said. Hotelier Jasbir Singh Arora said it is a big blow to the industry. “When cases had started rising here, lockdown was imposed in the district. At that time there were no restrictions in other parts of the state. Now, when mutant variant was found and cases increased in some parts of the state, the government has imposed restrictions across the state,” said Arora. He wanted markets to be allowed to can remain open till 4pm and restaurants from 4pm to 12 midnight. “This will ensure staggering of rush. Staff of many of the restaurants are vaccinated and also promptly going for tests in case of any symptoms,” he said. The state had introduced the levels of restrictions/relaxations based on two parameters — weekly TPR and occupancy of oxygen beds — in the beginning of June. The district’s weekly TPR was 3.86% and occupancy of oxygen beds was 8.13% between May 28 to June 3, making it eligible for full relaxations under level 1. But the district continued with some restrictions and allowed commercial activities till 5pm from June 7. In second week between June 4 and 10, weekly TPR declined to 3.13% and occupancy of oxygen beds to 3.93%. Still, timings were not increased in the subsequent week. After weekly TPR further dipped to 1.25% and occupancy of oxygen beds to 2.17% between June 11 and 17, the civic chief and collector increased timings of commercial activities till 8pm and also allowed coaching classes to reopen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shops-malls-restaurants-in-city-to-remain-open-till-4pm/articleshow/83857645.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Her mutilated body was found 1km away from her home in the morning. The body was partially eaten and hence the villagers fear the big cat had turned into a man-eater. A week ago, a leopard killed another woman in the area. The villagers staged a protest and refused to shift the body. They demanded to shoot the wild cat. After much persuasion and assurances to take swift action, the forest department managed to control the situation and the body was shifted to the hospital for autopsy. The department has also sought permission from the state government to shoot the leopard. DFO Mukesh Saini said that a week ago, a woman was mauled by a leopard and hence the department had installed five cages to trap it. On Thursday night, after the second death, additional five cages have been installed and monitoring has been increased in the entire area. “Though it is not confirmed whether it is the same leopard that had mauled the women, teams have set out to track the leopard and find out if there is one or more animal, by studying the pugmarks. A tranquillising team is also stationed in the area,” the officer said. Three deaths, eight attacks in six months: The leopard-human conflict is frequent in this area as reports of the wild cat attacking cattle and human beings are common. According to DFO Mukesh Saini in past six months, at two locations, eight attacks have been reported on the villagers and three casualties have taken place including, Amari Bai wife of Mangla who was dragged away past midnight when she was sleeping in the courtyard of her home. The forest department had not sought permission to shoot the leopard but since the villagers were adamant, they demanded to shoot the leopard and hence we have forwarded their demand to the government, Saini told TOI. He also said that teams are stationed at different spots and cameras have been put up at several locations, hoping the big cat would be caught soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/woman-mauled-to-death-by-leopard-in-udaipur/articleshow/83857717.cms||---

Officials of the health department have attributed the rising awareness level among recipients in urban, semi-urban and rural pockets for the rush at Covid vaccination centres (CCC).

While 6,70,250 beneficiaries have taken the first dose, 1,30,337 recipients have also received the second shot. “On an average, we are increasing our daily target and efforts are underway to cover more crowd between 18 and 44 years in villages and blocks,” said additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO) Dr Teerath Lal. A total of 19,263 vaccine shots were administered to people of all age groups in the past 24 hours, which included 18,218 recipients of the first dose and 10,45 of the second shot, he said.

Rural vaccination centres also include panchayat bhawans, ANM centres, anganwadi centres, prominent rural bazaars, primary schools and gram sabha bhawans. These rural sites have been selected to cover the maximum rural crowd, particularly those who could not reach community/primary health centres for vaccination under Near Home Vaccination drive, he said. As around 60 percent of the eligible recipients stay in rural areas, more health teams have been pressed into service in rural pockets. With cluster plan to be launched from July 1, at least 10 -12 additional teams would be roped in to achieve the target.

Shack owners in the Calangute-Candolim tourism hub, which comprises more than half of all the beach shacks in the state, have decided to seek an extension of the existing three-year shack licence, which expired at the end of May, for at least one more year because of the disruption in the tourism season for the last couple of years due to the Covid pandemic. Talking to TOI recently, Lobo said that with tourism set to be revived in the next few months, there definitely will be shacks on the beaches. “I will speak with the chief minister about their problems and ensure that their demands are met,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-may-relax-shack-policy-lobo/articleshow/83857720.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Court grants pre-arrest bail to rape survivor||COLVA: In a new twist in the alleged rape case filed against a police officer, the additional sessions court on Friday granted anticipatory bail to the survivor, who apprehended arrest by police in connection with a complaint filed against her by her parents at Vasco police station. She told the court that her parents had filed a complaint at the Vasco police station on February 15 against her and the police officer whom she married by performing religious rituals. Fearing arrest in the case, she approached the court. “Police came looking for her, and even telephonically called her to Vasco police station for investigation, and was informed that her mother had lodged a false complaint against her and her husband for cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust,” the applicant stated. The survivor said that police officials are not summoning her husband for investigation in the case. The applicant claimed that the officer was already married prior to marrying her. On June 18, she was called to the Vasco police station by lady PSI Pramila at 4pm and was kept waiting at till 7pm, she said. In her anticipatory bail application, the applicant stated that on April 21, she filed a complaint of alleged rape, cheating, fraud and criminal breach against a police officer. However, on May 4, she submitted an application to police regarding withdrawal of complaint against theofficer due to his threats. She claimed that she had married the officer in January 2021 by performing religious rites. Vasco police, in their reply, submitted that the applicant was called for enquiry upon the complaint lodged by her parents and there is no offence registered against her. Her arrest is not required and hence the application may be dismissed, police said. During the hearing, the applicant’s advocate Savio Noronha pointed to the court that the wording in the police reply is very suspicious and could be interpreted that in future they will arrest her, and hence anticipatory bail be granted. Additional sessions judge Dvijple Patkar granted her application on condition of furnishing a bond Rs 15,000 and a surety in the same amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/court-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-rape-survivor/articleshow/83857748.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Metro rake trials on Vanaz stretch likely next month||PUNE: The preliminary trials of the Metro rake on the elevated Vanaz-Garware stretch are likely to begin next month. The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) is planning to conduct initial trials on the small stretches near the Vanaz depot. MahaMetro said the rake that will be used in the trials has arrived at the depot and that the viaduct off the depot is ready. MahaMetro said currently, the work of laying the tracks and installing overhead traction cables is underway and trials will be held in July if things go as planned. This would be the second stretch to host trials, after tests were successfully conducted on the elevated Pimpri-Dapodi stretch on the other corridor. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro said work has been sped up. “We expect the trials to be held next month. The construction of the depot too has been expedited. A viaduct connecting the depot and the Vanaz station is nearly ready,” Sonawane said. “We will check the alignment of the tracks, the gradient, curves and other factors related to the movement of the rake in the initial trials. The trials will be extended towards Anandnagar in a phased manner,” an official said. The Vanaz-Garware stretch — part of the fully elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor — is one of two priority stretches in the city. All infrastructure work pertaining the Metro operations would be completed on priority on this stretch. Sonawane said that it could take time to conduct rake trials across the entire priority stretch as work is pending in some stretches. The viaduct is incomplete at two locations — near Paud Phata and near Shivtirthnagar on Paud Road. “We have installed girder launchers at these locations. The work at Paud Phata is in its final stages, while the viaduct near Shivtirthnagar should be ready by next month,” Sonawane further said, Of the remaining portion, an official said work on the double decker flyover, coming up at Nal Stop on Karve Road, has progressed significantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-rake-trials-on-vanaz-stretch-likely-next-month/articleshow/83853368.cms||Sarang Dastane

This year, under the ISAC cities were adjudged in various categories including social aspects, governance, culture, urban environment, sanitation, economy, built environment, water, sustainable business model of integrated command and control centres, urban mobility, innovative idea award and Covid innovation award. The awards were announced to commemorate six years of the Smart City Mission. This is the first time when the housing and urban affairs ministry has given awards to states for the overall performance of the smart cities and for their proactive role. Nagpur failed to figure in any of the single categories. Indore and Surat bagged the award for their overall performance in 2020, while Uttar Pradesh won the state award. Kalyan-Dombivli was the only municipal corporation from Maharashtra to get the award in Covid innovation category. Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Ltd (NSSCDCL) is implementing several projects under the Smart City Mission. It is working on Rs650 crore tenderSure and Rs220 crore Home Sweet Home projects. Almost on all fronts, the progress of NSSCDCL is going at a snail’s pace in various proposed projects including area-based development of 1,730 acre land in Pardi, Bharatwada and Punapur in East Nagpur. The NSSCDCL is yet to start the Home Sweet Home project. Even the work of 52km roads to be developed in area based development (ABD) under tenderSure project is also going on at a snail’s pace though the job started around three years ago. Consequently, the NMC had slipped to number 44 in Smart City rankings in January this year. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari was not available for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-fails-to-figure-even-in-top-100-of-isac/articleshow/83853361.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

However, members of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Congress and Shiv Sena sought a detailed discussion before approving the proposal. As per the revised proposal, the Union government will contribute 10% instead of the earlier 20%, while PMC and the state government will each share 15% of the cost — up 5% from the earlier contribution. The rest of the funds would be raised via loans. The extension has been proposed underground and is estimated to cost Rs4,200 crore. Gopal Tiwari, senior Congress functionary, said the burden on PMC has increased under the revised proposal. “The PMC will have to spend at least Rs 500 crore more. The civic body is already facing a financial crisis due to the pandemic, as its income sources have shrunk,” Tiwari said.Tiwari claimed that the Union government, when led by the Congress, had provided significant funding for urban development in many cities. “The BJP-led central government must not reduce funds to fast-growing cities. Pune is going see many extensions of Metro services and the civic body’s expenses will increase if the Union government continues to contribute lower amounts towards the project,” he said.Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar said, “We want Pune Municipal Corporation and MahaMetro to explain the extension proposal to the general body. Metro is an important project and more clarity is needed.”The MahaMetro submitted the detailed project report for the extension to the civic administration in 2019. This March, the general body approved the extension. The revision in funding was proposed last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-general-body-to-discuss-swargate-katraj-extension/articleshow/83853394.cms||---

The Central Board of Direct Taxes said that in case of ex-gratia payment, tax exemption will be provided without any limit for the amount received from the employer, while exemption up to Rs 10 lakh will be available in case of amount received from other persons. The benefit will be available for funds received during fiscal 2019-20 and subsequent years, with the government proposing to amend the law. Aadhaar-PAN linking deadline extendedFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the two moves will benefit several taxpayers and their families who have received financial help as it will ensure that no income tax liability arises. "This is a welcome and much needed relief. Taxpayers genuinely faced several difficulties whenever they were hospitalised or otherwise subject to rigorous medication. Covid treatment has also turned out to be a costly affair for a lot of people," said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner at AKM Global. Several tax professionals and individuals had petitioned for relief. "It will be useful if the government also clarifies if reimbursement for post-Covid complications, such as black fungus and other issues, is covered to avoid any difficulty to individuals," said Kuldip Kumar, partner at consulting firm Price Waterhouse. He said for those who have paid tax on reimbursement or ex gratia payments received during 2019-20, the government may need to issue instructions as the deadline for filing returns, and revising them, is over. "Employers can heave a sigh of relief as in the absence of such clarification the said spending or reimbursement would have been taxable as employment income and employers were required to withhold tax on the same. From the clarification one would note that it is not only hospitalisation, even treatment at home etc reimbursed by the employer or any other person should not be taxable," Kumar said. The CBDT also extended the deadline for complying with several requirements — including linking of PAN and Aadhaar, which has been extended by another three months to September 30. Those who have to invest in residential property or specified instruments to avoid paying capital gains tax arising from sale of another property also have time till September to complete the transaction. The last date of payment of amount under Vivad se Vishwas, which was earlier extended to June 30 has been further extended to August 31, and the additional amount under the dispute resolution scheme can now be paid up to October 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tax-relief-given-for-covid-treatment-ex-gratia-payment/articleshow/83861394.cms||---

Vendors’ presence in narrow lanes will make implementation of Covid-19 protocols tough, they say. An order issued by the Vasant Vihar district administration on June 25 stated that “All malls and markets are allowed to open from 10 am to 8 pm as per the DDMA direction. Director enforcement (New Delhi Municipal Council) will need to ensure that a minimum distance of 10 feet is maintained among all vendors.

And the officials shall liaise with the shopkeepers’ associations to form a mechanism for enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour.” “When vendors will sit at a distance of 10 feet in front of shops in narrow lanes, crowding is bound to happen.

The government should issue the guidelines for the Bakrid festival at the earliest,” said NCP member Salim Sarang who led the delegation of Qurbani Coordination Committee to senior NCP leader and minister Jayant Patil on Wednesday. Patil told the delegation chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar would soon meet Muslim leaders and discuss the Bakrid issue. Sarang also opposed SP leaders Abu Asim Azmi and Rais Shaikh for protesting against Thackeray for allegedly not granting them an audience to discuss Qurbani issues. Other than Patil, community leaders have so far met Congress state president Nana Patole and guardian minister Aslam Shaikh. Former minister Baba Siddiqui, too, attended the meeting with Patole. Since several traders had found it difficult to bring goats into the city, resulting in many community members unable to sacrifice them during the Bakrid last year, community leaders are seeking the government’s guidelines on it, including on the arrival of goats at Deonar, so that arrangements can be made in advance. “Since the Deonar abattoir is already open, we want its mandi to be fully operational by adhering to all protocols for the pandemic,” said activist M A Khalid. Gulrez Qureishi of All India Jamaitul Qureish said he has suggestions on the SOP for Bakrid ready. “The government must ease the confusion and declare its guidelines. We are ready to make suggestions on the SOP if we are called for help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/allow-deonar-market-to-operate-at-full-capacity-for-bakrid-community-leaders/articleshow/83850325.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 19-year-old granted bail in Khar’s New Year Eve murder case||MUMBAI: Six months after 19-year-old Santacruz student Diya Padalkar was arrested in the New Year’s Eve murder of her childhood friend, Jhanvi Kukreja, a sessions court on Friday granted her bail. Lawyers of the victim’s mother, Nidhi Kukreja, moved a plea seeking a stay on the order. Rejecting the plea, additional sessions court Judge M M Umar said, “Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, so also considering that the prosecution case against the applicant is based on circumstantial evidence, it is not desirable to stay the bail order.” The court, though, rejected the bail plea of Padalkar’s co-accused, Shree Jogdhankar (22). The accused, both close friends of Kukreja (19), are accused of assaulting her on the staircase and murdering her after they attended a New Year’s party on the terrace of a Khar building. Kukreja’s final post-mortem report shows she had suffered 48 injuries. The Khar police chargesheet said while Padalkar stayed back in the house of the host with a cut lip, claiming she did not know how she suffered the injury, Jogdhankar left the party, met another set of friends, and subsequently sought treatment at Sion Hospital. Padalkar’s earlier plea for bail was rejected. Seeking bail for the second time, soon after the chargesheet was submitted in March, Padalkar’s lawyer, Ashok Mishra, told the court the document did not show that she had committed the murder, especially when there was “no ocular evidence” to prove even her participation. Cops had alleged the accused had attacked Kukreja after she was upset over them being intimate. Padalkar’s bail plea, though, said the witnesses present at the party had instead seen the victim and Jogdhankar together in a dark corner area of the terrace and on the staircase of the building where the alleged crime took place. “However, none have witnessed any unusual or intimate acts between accused number one (Jogdhankar) and the applicant (Padalkar),” the bail plea said. Padalkar’s plea also said the witnesses at the party had seen her highly drunk, “wobbling” and continuously vomiting. “...if we go by the statement of witnesses at the party, at the alleged period of time, that is, 1.30am to 2.15am when the alleged offence took place, the applicant was either found sleeping on the terrace or in the bedroom of the host Yash Ahuja’s flat, which is situated in the same building,” the plea said. The prosecution had strongly opposed the bail pleas of both the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-19-year-old-granted-bail-in-khars-ny-eve-murder-case/articleshow/83850594.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Pune||Resettlement in focus after Ambil Odha drive||Pune: Rehabilitation of slum dwellers has gained strength after the controversial anti-encroachment drive at Dandekar Pul along Ambil Odha on Thursday. The residents, who were displaced after the drive, want to be resettled at the same place. Nearly 80 houses were demolished in the drive. These residents claim that a private builder is eyeing the land and the civic administration is helping him build a slum rehabilitation project on this plot. The civic body on the other hand said the slums were removed for clearing the nullah to ensure smooth evacuation of rainwater and prevent any flooding in these areas. As many as 97 out of 130 slum dwellers have been shifted to a transit camp. As per the PMC, the civic administration has completed the process of the rehabilitation. People who were living in the disputed slum have been allotted flats at the transit building. But some have moved, insisting on staying in their houses along the stream. “Since the land has to be used for clearing the nullah, people cannot be rehabilitated at the same site,” a senior PMC official said. “The civic administration has taken the responsibility of all eligible slum dwellers who need to be resettled after the demolition drive. They will be shifted to a transit camp. A majority of them have already been shifted,” mayor Murlidhar Mohol said. He said that an inquiry has been ordered into the manner in which the demolition was carried out. If needed, action will be taken against the civic staff or others after studying the inquiry report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/resettlement-in-focus-after-ambil-odha-drive/articleshow/83853450.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Deshmukh’s secy, PA grilled by ED till late night, arrested||Mumbai: Former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s official bungalow, Dnyaneshwari, at Malabar Hill, his residences at Worli in Mumbai and Nagpur, and the houses of his aides Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde were among those searched on Friday. The ED officials directed Palande and Shinde to accompany them to their Ballard Estate office for questioning and they were arrested past midnight. They will be produced in court on Saturday for remand. Friday’s action came on the back of earlier searches of premises linked to Deshmukh by CBI as well as ED. Deshmukh, who was present in his Worli home during the search, later told reporters: “After his transfer from Mumbai police commissioner’s post, Param Bir Singh made baseless allegations against me. There is no truth in that and I will cooperate in the investigation.” Deshmukh has been accused by Param Bir Singh of asking sacked cop Sachin Waze, currently in jail over planting explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house and murdering a businessman, to collect Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants every month for him. A day before the searches, the ED had recorded the statement of DCP Raju Bhujbal, an important witness. Deshmukh allegedly repeated the Rs 100 crore demand after calling Bhujbal, along with ACP Sanjay Patil, at his official residence. Lashing out at Singh, Deshmukh alleged on Friday that all the officers involved in planting of explosives and murder of Mansukh Hiren were directly reporting to him and so he can’t escape responsibility. “When we found that the role of Param Bir Singh was suspicious and that all the officers involved in the serious crime were his trusted men, we shunted him out. So long as he was Mumbai police commissioner, he had maintained a discreet silence. However, a day after he was shifted, he made baseless and false allegations. My contention is that if he was so serious about corruption, he should have made the allegations when he was CP,” said Deshmukh. In March, the state government had shunted out Singh due to unacceptable lapses in handling the planting of explosives case. After the controversy, the CBI has registered a corruption case against Deshmukh on the direction of the Bombay high court, following which he quit as minister. Subsequently, the ED also registered a money laundering case to investigate the trail of the money illegally collected from bar owners.

---||Nagpur||Chandrapur: Tribal school says its 70% students to fail as per CBSE Std X marks policy||NAGPUR: A CBSE-affiliated tribal school in Chandrapur district finds itself in a spot of bother due to the Std X marks tabulation policy, as almost 70% of its students won’t pass, says the school if it follows the guidelines. This problem is unique to the Dewada-based Eklavya Model Residential School because its first batch for Std X appeared in 2020 and their performance was dismal with less than 10% students passing. This school, however, faces other unique challenges because of students coming from remote areas with not much exposure. Since theory exams have been cancelled this year, CBSE has adopted a comprehensive marks tabulation policy which aims to provide a fair assessment of students, in which past performance of the school’s Std X results is a key part. As a rule of thumb, the past three years results are looked into and the best performing year becomes the ‘reference year’. RS Borekar, principal of the school, claims that’s where the problem lies for them. “The marks we give now cannot deviate much from the reference year. But our last year batch’s performance was not good and I find it unfair that the 2021 batch has to suffer because of that. If I implement the guidelines mentioned by CBSE, then 70% of my students won’t pass,” said Borekar. She is convinced that CBSE’s policy to provide fair assessment has made it difficult for a unique case such as her school. “Those schools whose first batch is in 2021 can avail of the ‘district average’ marks. Those with two or more batches have a choice in reference year. The worst off are people like us who have just one year as part of the academic history,” said Borekar. Even though last year only four students passed (out of 53) during summer exam, Borekar’s team worked with the remaining ones. “Another 20 students then cleared the compartment exam which was held later. So, effectively, almost 50% of the students cleared the exam,” said Borekar. The school tried to reach out to CBSE through email and phone. Borekar said, “I spoke to the Pune regional office but they said no changes can be done as it’s a national-level policy. I have sent an email to CBSE but did not get response. They had sent numbers about help desk but I was unable to get through to anyone there.” Borekar hopes that CBSE responds to her mail as she does not want to be the one who sees majority of her students not making the cut. “I don’t think I am ready to fill the marks in the form and upload it in the online portal,” said Borekar. TOI tried to reach CBSE officials in this regard but didn’t get any response till filing of this report. CBSE has given an option to students that they can reappear for a theory exam if unhappy with the marks received as a result of the policy. So, technically, all students from the school can opt for a theory paper later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tribal-school-says-its-70-students-to-fail-as-per-cbse-std-x-marks-policy/articleshow/83853481.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Vadodara||One Delta+ variant case each in Surat, Vadodara||VADODARA/SURAT/AHMEDABAD: Two cases of Delta Plus variant have been reported from Gujarat, according to union health ministry officials. Local government officials confirmed on Friday that one case each was reported from Surat and Vadodara. Those infected include a 22-year-old medical student of Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) SMIMER Hospital and a 38-year-old woman from Jarod village of Vadodara’s Waghodia taluka. Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health & family welfare), told TOI that the state is currently sending almost 25-30% of its daily positive Covid-19 samples for sequencing. “We are relying heavily on timely input on the variants based on genomic sequencing data from Gujarat Biotechnology & Research Center and National Institute of Virology (NIV). We have already carried out detailed contact tracing of both cases, and have not found further cases of Delta-plus variant,” he said. The ACS health said surveillance has been intensified in both Surat and Vadodara.” With regards to the two cases, the presence of the Delta Plus variant was confirmed by the NIV, Pune. The samples of Surat students were sent on April 10. He had already recovered but was not vaccinated when nasopharyngeal swab was collected, official sources said. “The strain can be confirmed only through genome sequencing and we sent 5% of the total samples collected during surveillance. The samples are randomly selected,” said Dr Ashish Naik, deputy commissioner, health, SMC In the Vadodara case, the woman’s family has roots in Maharashtra. “We have received the information from the state government that genome sequencing of samples of 38-year-old female resident of Jarod who had tested Covid-19 positive in April in Maharashtra is a case of new Delta plus variant of coronavirus,” said Dr Uday Tilawat, district immunization officer and additional district health officer. “The female is completely healthy,” he said. Tilawat added neither the female resident nor her family members had tested positive in Vadodara nor were their samples collected here. “The family has four members. Her husband works with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). They had gone to Maharashtra where their samples were tested. The woman had tested positive there and recovered as well. They are residing here since May 8. Currently, all members in the family including the female resident are in good health,” he said, adding that earlier the case was not reported to local authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/one-delta-variant-case-each-in-surat-vadodara/articleshow/83854762.cms||---
---||Surat||​Gujarat: Opioid addict doctor now 'unhooks' others||SURAT: Removing his shirt, Dr Amit Sardesai, 46, showed multiple surgery scars on his body while trying to convince a female post graduate medical student to quit opioid pain medicine addiction and embrace life. The homeopath doctor’s therapy worked and the woman chose to lead a normal life and today, practices as a doctor in Mumbai along with her doctor husband. Opioid injections are also used for anesthesia purposes. “I shudder when I look back at those days of addiction. But now, I will not let others pass through the same pain. After fighting a long battle against drugs for my own life, I feel that I have been chosen to help others,” Sardesai told TOI. As an outreach worker at Nashabandhi Mandal’s drop-in centre in Pal, Sardesai not only treats addicts for illness but helps them quit the addiction. Sardesai’s journey as an addict started in 1998 when he was a college student at Ahmedabad and later also in the city. He used to consume liquor and after studies, started taking Pentazocine (opioid pain medicine and anesthetic) injections to get a higher kick. “As the addiction worsened, I took 28 injections in a day. It led to abscesses in the body where I took multiple shots but that did not stop me,” said Sardesai. His family bungalow was sold and later his apartment too in which they lived due to expenses on Sardesai. His clinic was closed and his wife migrated to another city with their son. After almost 14 years and losing every precious things in his life, Sardesai successfully quit opioid addiction in 2013. But he continued to consume liquor. He met with a life-threatening road accident in an inebriated condition that left him with serious permanent damages on both hands. “I lost everything dear to me in life due to addiction. But with a hope for survival, I quit it all with help of de-addiction counselling,” he said. “Sardesai is totally addiction free today and there can be no better example than the man himself working with us to encourage others in the grip of drugs. This is one of the reasons why we hired him,” said Vinay Solanki, project director, Parivartan Vyasan Mukti Kendra. Sardesai’s son is about to complete his college studies and the doctor hopes to reunite with his wife soon. He is also looking forward to starting a de-addiction centre in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/opioid-addict-doc-now-unhooks-others/articleshow/83855806.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Rajkot||Jamnagar: Wife among seven persons booked for electrician’s suicide||RAJKOT: Seven persons were booked for abetting the suicide of a 31-year-old electrician in Jamnagar on Friday. The accused include wife and four in-laws of the deceased Haresh Solanki, a resident of Jalaram Chowk who had hanged himself to death at his residence on May 29. Haresh’s brother Subhash Solanki alleged in his complaint that Haresh had married Priyanka about a year ago, but soon they developed differences and started quarrelling over even small issues. A few months ago, Priyanka’s family took her back to their home in Upleta Rajkot. “After some time Haresh came to know about Priyanka’s affairs with Imran Piparvada. So he asked her to give him a divorce. But Priyanka demanded Rs 3 lakh for giving divorce,” Subhash stated in his complaint. He further alleged that a few weeks ago Imran and his aide Samir Piparvada came to Haresh’s house and threatened to kill him if he did to give money to Priyanka. A few days later Haresh ended his life. According to police, those accused of abetting the suicide of Haresh include his wife Priyanka, father-in-law Babu Parmar, brother-in-law Hardik Parmar, mother-in-law Rama Parmar, sister-in-law Mansi Parmar, Imran and Sameer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/wife-among-seven-persons-booked-for-electricians-suicide/articleshow/83856646.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Couple booked for bid to commit culpable homicide||MUMBAI: A doctor and his wife from the western suburbs are the latest to be arrested in the fake vaccine scam, where police now believe that saline water was administered to people at some of the camps. With the arrests of Dr Shivraj Pataria, 61, and Neeta Pataria, 60 on Thursday, the total number of arrests have gone up to 10. A fresh FIR-- the eighth so far-- was recorded at Thane's Naupada police station on Friday in connection with 116 people from an insurance company being given jabs. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by a DCP-rank officer has been formed as the case now spans two police commissionerates. The Patarias run Shivam Hospital at Charkop. Between March 3 and April 28, Shivam Hospital was a designated private Covid vaccination centre (PCVC). They were allotted 17100 Covishield doses and 6250 Covaxin doses, a majority of which they administered to people in an official capacity. But the hospital has not been able to provide an explanation as to what was done with the balance stock. "Even after the hospital ceased to be a PCVC on April 28, camps were carried out without any MOU nor any intimation to the BMC. One such camp was carried out at Malad's Bank of Baroda branch in association with a key accused, Mahendra Singh. Another such camp was at a stocks advisory in Borivali," said additional commissioner Dilip Sawant. Police have accused the Patarias of supplying used vials or fake doses to another key accused, Dr Manish Tripathi, who ran a training institute out of Shivam Hospital. Tripathi, yet to be arrested, has been accused of refilling empty vials with saline water and supplying them to Singh for the bogus camps. "Based on the statement of one of the accused, Karim Ali, we prima facie believe that saline water was used," said joint commissioner Vishwas Nangre Patil. Ali, who was a student at Tripathi's institute, said nine other students were trained in giving saline water shots. They were all promised good grades in their practical exams if they joined the bogus camps. Two other students, Roshni Patel and Ajit Benwasi, have been booked but not arrested. "All vials have been procured from a single source. We are yet to ascertain if any of the vaccine doses were adulterated," said Nangre Patil. Police said the Patarias have had several meetings with Tripathi and Singh and that financial transactions have occurred. Investigators have seized a sum of Rs 12.44 lakh and frozen Singh and Tripathi's bank accounts. A car used for ferrying vaccines has been seized and 114 forged vaccine certificates have also been recovered. "We have applied stringent sections such as section 308 IPC (attempt to commit culpable homicide) as people's lives have been put at risk. Another section applied attracts life imprisonment," said Nangre Patil. The bogus camp at Thane was reported on May 26 for employees of two branches of an insurance company. A sum of Rs 1000 each was charged from beneficiaries and Rs 1.16 lakh collectively was swindled. Four fake certificates were also given out. Singh, Gupta, Ali along with two others were involved in the camp. The ninth FIR will be registered soon in connection with 220 employees of talent management platform Kwan Talent being given shots at a fake camp. The gang had roped in low rung data-entry operators from BMC's Nesco centre and private hospitals for misusing the hospital logins and keying in data of beneficiaries for generation of forged vaccine certificates. "No senior doctor from these hospitals is involved," a police officer clarified.  —Inputs by Nishikant Karlikar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaidoctor-couple-booked-for-bid-to-commit-culpable-homicide/articleshow/83857951.cms||Nitasha Natu

The opposition parties had raised objection against the tender, saying it was drafted keeping the interest of specific contractors in mind. They have approached the court, demanding that the tender be scrapped. The civic administration has prepared a detailed project report for sewage treatment in these villages. Altogether 150km-long pipeline will have to be laid. The project also includes building two sewage treatment plants (STPs).“We have received four bidders till the deadline on Tuesday. Now, the process of their scrutiny will be carried out after which the firm that qualifies will be finalised,” said a senior Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official. “Though four bidders have filed bids, we have some suspicion about their entry. We will approach the state urban development department to raise our concerns,” said Prithviraj Sutar, Sena leader in PMC.“Three tenders should have been issued to save public funds.

---||Nagpur||Man posing as FDA officer to cheat Nagpur city chemist held||NAGPUR: As a Std IX student, Rahul Sarate got away unpunished after hacking his school principal’s computer. Sarate, now 27, and living in Mumbai, has been accused of duping a city chemist of Rs30,000 by posing as a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officer. He had used a similar trick to cheat chemists in Mumbai before being caught. Bajaj Nagar police arrested him from Colaba police custody recently and brought him to Nagpur. Bajaj Nagar police station senior PI Shubhangi Deshmukh told TOI that Sarate, a former merchant navy staffer, had committed at least eight similar offences. Deshmukh said Sarate was glib-tongued and could speak in different voices – even a female voice. He chose his targets carefully, and would accordingly pose either as a FDA officer, official from consumer forum, or even a female customer. Shashank Agrawal, whose chemist shop is situated in Dhantoli, lodged a complaint earlier this month about being duped of Rs30,000. Agrawal said that on May 29 he received a phone call from Sarate, who posed as an FDA official using the pseudonym Swapnil Bhosle. The accused told Agrawal that a customer (again a fictitious identity), Surekha Patil, had lodged a complaint against the shop owner of selling medicines that were beyond expiry date. The accused threatened to arrest him and seal his shop. Sometime later, Agrawal received another phone call – this time from Surekha Patil. Initially, she threatened Agrawal that the FDA will seal his shop. After Agrawal’s repeated requests to her against taking the complaint any further, she offered a settlement if he agreed to deposit Rs30,000 in a particular bank account. Agrawal deposited the amount. However, Agrawal sensed something fishy and on June 12 he lodged a complaint with Bajaj Nagar police station. Before Nagpur city police could arrest him, Colaba police had already arrested Sarate after a similar complaint was filed against him on June 7. Deshmukh said Sarate used different SIM cards and simple mobile phones to make calls to his targets. Even the bank account he used to make gullible targets deposit ‘settlement money’ wasn’t his and belongs to one Swapnil Patil, the investigation revealed. Deshmukh said, “When Sarate was in the ninth standard, he had committed his first crime. He hacked the school principal’s computer to give himself more marks in examination but was caught. As he was a minor, the school let him off with a warning. After procuring some technical qualifications, he worked for some years in the merchant navy.” Sarate got married and settled down in Mumbai. Later, he took to making easy money and started duping chemists posing as an FDA officer. “Given his criminal antecedents, Sarate’s relatives, including father, who works as a sanitary worker in Pune, his mother and sister – a medical practitioner – distanced themselves from him. Even his relationship with his wife was not cordial,” said Deshmukh. On Friday, the district court remanded Sarate to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-posing-as-fda-officer-to-cheat-city-chemist-held/articleshow/83853563.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

After a gap of 15 months, the government has granted permission to commence in-person classes to all educational institutions. Ahead of it, higher education department officials are now in the process of framing guidelines for the ensuing academic year. The department is exploring adopting a blended mode of learning, wherein students would be given the flexibility to attend both online and offline classes. “At a given point of time, only 50% of the total number of students shall be allowed within the college premises. Students may have to submit negative Covid-19 reports as they begin in-person classes. Not just that, parents’ consent will also be sought,” an official from the higher education department said. According to sources, a proposal has been submitted to the government on drafting the guidelines, which might be on the lines of those issued in September last. Colleges are expected to make necessary arrangements to commence physical classes. The department has also proposed a shift system, wherein students might be called as per their courses and year. “We may introduce two shifts — morning and evening — wherein students will be called as per the course. The undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students may have to attend college on alternate days. Staggered timings may be maintained for entry and exit too,” another official said. The higher education department is likely to consult all vice-chancellors of all state universities on conduct of classes as well as UG and PG final semester examinations. They might also deliberate on attendance requirement as well as the exam pattern. Customized seating plans, sanitisation and emergency plans would also be chalked out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/colleges-may-open-with-50-capacity-but-learning-could-be-in-blended-mode/articleshow/83857894.cms||Preeti Biswas

Admissions to first-year law courses were marred by technical glitches leading to the admission process extending till mid-April. Most colleges had started their academic year in the first week of April and were holding classes every day to complete the syllabus. The contents of the 70% syllabus have been published on the university’s website. Vasundhara, a first-year student of the three-year course at MMCC’s Shankarrao Chavan Law College, said, “Our college has been conducting 50-minute lectures per subject from Monday to Saturday, almost every day. The teachers tried their best to complete all the topics well. We have also submitted our assignments and even the internal exams are over.” Ubaid Hashmi, a first-year student of the five-year law course from ILS Law College, agreed that the students would be able to appear for the examination based on 70% of the syllabus. “My admission was completed in February but the classes started in April. We completed the syllabus declared by the university today. The teachers have said they would try to finish off the remaining 30% of the syllabus in time. We need to start preparing for the examination. It would be good if the university declares the dates for our first semester examinations,” he said. Director of examination and evaluation at SPPU Mahesh Kakade said, “We will take the first-year first semester examinations for law students along with the second semester examinations of the other courses, starting tentatively from July 15, so a week later, we will conduct the first semester examinations for first-year law students too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/70-syllabus-for-first-year-law-studentsof-pune-univ/articleshow/83853547.cms||Ardhra Nair

Shrivastava said, “The mission is to create 10,000 health workers as part of the 3-4 lakh additional health workers that the Prime Minister has the country needs. A robust mapping system has been introduced to determine the specific areas of training required and a prompt delivery mode to enable the trained workforce to join hospitals and the healthcare and emergency systems.” The aspirants will be trained on the basis of their educational background, interest and aptitude. The trained personnel will work as home patient care assistants, general duty assistants, emergency medical technicians, ambulance drivers, domestic Covid health workers, etc. To augment the capital’s effective healthcare workforce and to wean young people away from despair and crime, Delhi Police had begun to train the unemployed and needy youth under the Yuva scheme early this year. Yuva is a flagship community policing initiative that provides job-oriented training and skill development to the underprivileged youth to create employment avenues. Delhi Police has since trained around 1,100 youngsters and secured placements for over 125 of them after collaborating with hospitals and private companies. Those who have been placed are getting Rs 15,000-25,000 per month in salaries, depending on their skill set and job profile. Shrivastava had asked district deputy commissioners of police to identify youths for training so they could not only find employment but also act as force multipliers during the pandemic. The police commissioner said on Friday, “There is a dual objective: provide employment and create resources and talent which can contribute to the healthcare sector during the pandemic.” He added, “Noting that the services of the Yuva trainees could be utilised as primary healthcare workers, special arrangements were made to impart basic training to them in collaboration with reputed hospitals and companies engaged in healthcare, the aim being to harness talent and create human resources." On the successful completion of training, the learners are given certificates to help them secure placements. In coordination with premium hospitals and companies engaged in healthcare, Delhi Police is also organising job fairs to facilitate placement of these newly skilled youngsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-to-train-10000-health-workers-for-war-on-covid/articleshow/83853727.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Illegal schools’ data will be out by July 1||PUNE: The data on unrecognised schools in the district will be released by July 1. The deputy director’s office has told all education officers in the district to collect the data and submit it by then. Deputy director of education Audumbar Ukirde said, “There was a meeting between the education officers on Thursday and we have told them to collect the data on unrecognised schools in their jurisdiction immediately. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) education officer will find out about such schools in their areas, and the same will be done by Zilla Parishad and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.” Ukirde blamed the pandemic for the delay in compiling the list. “I took over the department during the pandemic and due to Covid-19, all surveys and activities were on hold. But now we have told the officers to submit the data by July 1. Once we get to know the schools, they would be told to pay a fine, shut down, and children studying in these schools will be enrolled in the nearby schools,” he said. Jyotsna Shinde, education officer of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, said the supervisors in her department have already been told to survey all schools in the area. “A school needs the permission of the state. Our supervisors visit them and check their documents. If we find that they do not have the requisite permit, we declare them as unrecognised. The department does not have any powers regarding pre-schools or playschools, hence they are not surveyed. But, any school offering education from Std I comes under our purview and need our permit to operate,” Shinde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/illegal-schools-data-will-be-out-by-july-1/articleshow/83853588.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sachin Waze faces an open inquiry by the ACB||MUMBAI: The ACB has initiated an open inquiry against dismissed API Sachin Waze for allegedly amassing assets disproportionate to his known income. Sources said the ACB on Wednesday initiated the inquiry after prima facie finding "some truth in the discreet inquiry". ACB officials will now investigate Waze's movable and immovable assets as well as the sources of his wealth. Sources said that the ACB started the inquiry after Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale granted sanction as Waze already stands dismissed from service; in such inquiries, permission is not needed from the competent authority. Interestingly, the NIA, probing the planting of gelatine sticks near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence at Carmichael Road and the subsequent murder of Scorpio owner Mansukh Hiran, had found Rs 1.5 crore in the bank account of a company floated by Waze during his suspension. Waze who joined the force in 1990 as a PSI had just served in the department for 12 years before he was suspended in the alleged custodial death of 2002 Ghatkopar blast suspect Khwaja Yunus. He was reinstated in the force after 16 years in June last year by the then police commissioner Param Bir Singh on grounds of manpower shortage because of Covid. Waze served for nine months before getting entangled in the Hiran case and was arrested by the NIA. Sources said that in his nine-month stint, he had amassed huge amounts from various accused and their relatives in the name of investigations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-faces-an-open-inquiry-by-the-acb/articleshow/83857923.cms||---

The court has remanded him in eight day custody of ED. Baheti was arrested in a multi-crore scam involving a section of Food Corporation of India (FCI) officials. Though the initial amount of embezzlement was pegged at Rs four crore, the scam may go up to almost Rs100 crore. The scam involved 3,000 ration shops and 28 FCI and private godowns in Nanded and Hingoli. It’s learnt Baheti, a law graduate, was booked by Nanded police before ED registered an offence against him in May after his involvement in misappropriating subsidized grains came to fore. The grains, released by the FCI for control shops, were allegedly diverted in bulk quantities to his firm M/s Agro Anaj Limited before being dispatched to different markets, retail chains, malls and such places at higher prices. The latest arrest is the fourth this year by the ED which had taken three more into custody in another case. It is leant, ED had issued a summon to Baheti for interrogation and recording statement but later placed him under arrest as he was not cooperating with the probe team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nanded-businessman-in-ed-net-in-multi-crore-scam/articleshow/83853654.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Patna||NIA team in Darbhanga to investigate parcel blast case||PATNA: A National Investigation Agency (NIA) team headed by one SP-rank officer reached Darbhanga from Delhi on Friday to take over the case of parcel blast at the railway station, which is being suspected to be a terror plot with conspirators owing allegiance to banned organisations or foreign agencies. The case was being investigated by the government rail police (GRP) at Darbhanga following an FIR registered after the blast on June 17 this year. It’s suspected that the explosion took place due to some complex inflammable chemical kept inside a 100ml glass bottle, wrapped with adhesive tapes and placed in several layers of clothes parcelled from Secunderabad in Telangana on June 15. It was booked in the name of one Mohammad Sufiyan in Secunderabad by two suspects. The parcel recipient’s name in Darbhanga was also mentioned as Mohammad Sufiyan. The parcel had exploded soon after it was dumped on the ground at platform number one of Darbhanga railway station on June 17. State police headquarters sources said experts at the forensic laboratory in Muzaffarpur expressed their inability to ascertain what chemical was used in the explosion after which the bottle was sent to central forensic science laboratory (CFSL) in Kolkata on Wednesday. “They will analyse the molecular composition and ascertain the type of components kept in it. It can’t be said yet if temperature, pressure or shock acted as a trigger for the blast,” a senior IPS officer said. When contacted, ADG (railway) Nirmal Kumar Azad said the NIA would take over the case and no one was arrested in Bihar yet. “Our teams went to Hyderabad and Uttar Pradesh for investigation,” he said. Azad said they were working with different agencies of the central government as well as UP and Telangana police in the case. “The bottle inside which the chemical was kept has been deposited at CFSL Kolkata for forensic analysis. Our team from Secunderabad is expected to return by night,” he added. State police headquarters sources said the GRP, in coordination with anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of Bihar, UP and Telangana police, were working together in the case and were in constant touch with NIA and the Intelligence Bureau at higher level. Another senior IPS officer of Bihar said the GRP in Telangana traced and quizzed the taxi driver who had driven the two suspects to Secunderabad railway junction for parcel booking. “Several CCTV camera footages were scanned to ascertain where both suspects had started. The taxi was booked using a mobile based application. We have a few suspicious cellphone numbers as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nia-team-in-darbhanga-to-investigate-parcel-blast-case/articleshow/83851007.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||ED action is political revenge out of frustration, says Sharad Pawar||MUMBAI: Sharad Pawar led a frontal attack on the Enforcement Directorate (ED) by NCP and Congress on Friday after the agency’s action against former home minister Anil Deshmukh, calling it political revenge out of frustration. “We are neither scared nor worried over ED’s politically motivated raids and searches… We are not new to these kinds of raids. CBI and ED have chosen a new path to take revenge against political rivals. ED had once targeted me also,” Pawar said in Pune. He added: “Earlier, Deshmukh’s son and his business had come under the scanner of some central inquiries. But I do not think anything came out of them. The frustration of it is showing in the searches against Deshmukh. There is no need to talk more about it.” Deshmukh is among the trusted aides of Pawar. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said if the ED is serious, it should first search the office and residence of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh and dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze. “Since there was no actual transaction of money, how can the ED book either Deshmukh or his staff under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act? It’s gross abuse of power. ED must establish that Waze and Param Bir Singh paid money to Deshmukh,’’ said Sawant. State home minister Dilip Walse Patil, water resources minister Jayant Patil, Supriya Sule and other top NCP leaders too spoke out. Walse Patil said at a juncture when it was expected that the NDA government would give top priority to tackling the pandemic, it was indulging in petty politics. Jayant Patil said ED’s action reflects gross abuse of power by the NDA government. Sule called it politics of revenge, worse than the Emergency. Sawant said all national investigation agencies have surrendered their independence to the Modi government and are being used as political weapons against the opposition. “All 3 constituents of the MVA government must unitedly oppose the ploy of the Modi government to defame the MVA government,” he added. In Nagpur, NCP workers held protests outside Deshmukh’s home as the search was on. A mixed force of CRPF, with women commandos, was in place at the bungalow alongside city police personnel. After one group was taken away by cops, another lot of protesters came from rural areas and raised slogans against the ED team.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops oppose doctor’s pre-arrest bail plea, say he filled saline water in vials||MUMBAI: Opposing the anticipatory bail plea of a doctor accused in the fraudulent vaccination drive at Kandivli’s Hiranandani Heritage society, police told the sessions court on Friday that instead of performing his social responsibility of saving lives in a pandemic, the highly-educated 26-year-old was involved in acts with co-accused that adversely impacted the lives of people. Seeking rejection of Dr Manish Tripathi’s plea, public prosecutor Usha Jadhav submitted that instead of administering genuine vaccines, the accused had deliberately given them some other substance. Hence the charge of attempt to commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder has been invoked, police said in their reply. The prosecution told the court preliminary investigations had established Tripathi had filled saline water in vials with broken seals and administered it with his student Karim Ali’s help at nine vaccination camps. The court is likely to pronounce the order on the plea on Monday. Cops have been directed not to arrest him until then. Tripathi was also directed to co-operate with investigations. Tripathi claimed he had been made a “scapegoat.” He is director of KCEP Group that offers training and placements in various industries, including healthcare. Police have accused him of sourcing vials for camps and roping in students from his institute for administering shots. One student, Karim Ali (19), has been arrested for transporting the vials. Police said Ali had revealed he became acquainted with Tripathi in February 2021. It is alleged that for the drive at Shivam Hospital, Tripathi had recruited eight girls from his institute. Cops said in March, Ali got a call from one of his teachers who informed him and others about having to undergo vaccine practical training at Shivam Hospital. There, Tripathi gave them information about vaccination. The trainees then practised administering vaccines on each other by using normal saline. Vaccinations were done at Shivam hospital from March 4. Cops alleged that after vaccinations, Tripathi would take empty vials. It was alleged he once handed over to Ali 30-35 vaccine vials with broken seals. Police said when Ali asked about broken seals, Tripathi allegedly replied all vials were coming in such a manner. - Rebecca Samervel||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-oppose-doctors-pre-arrest-bail-plea-say-he-filled-saline-water-in-vials/articleshow/83858103.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||BMC expected to revise doorstep vax policy, finds multiple certificates in fake drive||MUMBAI: In light of rising cases of fake vaccination camps in Mumbai, the BMC is likely to revise its doorstep vaccination policy, which lays down guidelines for private camps in housing societies, institutions and corporate offices. A BMC probe has revealed around 10 certificates at a fake camp were generated from the Nesco centre. “But the centre had already administered vaccines from those batches. This means that either fake certificates were generated or the vials were refilled,” an official said. “We have received a report from SII (that manufacures Covishield). We have checked if multiple certificates were issued on the vaccines from the same batch numbers. We have found this in some certificates. We have batch numbers from 120 certificates issued in the Kandivli vaccination camp,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health). He said the BMC will share its findings with the police. Meanwhile, senior civic officials said the BMC was thinking about making the guidelines for doorstep vaccination more stringent and ensure more regulation. So far, at least five fake camps have been reported in various parts of Mumbai.  In May, the BMC had issued detailed guidelines for vaccination drives at workplaces and housing societies by private Covid vaccination centres (PCVC). “The BMC is only intimated and the vaccination is carried out through the PCVC. Societies and corporate tie up with PCVCs and get their staff and residents vaccinated. We will examine if making a BMC no objection certificate (NOC) and site inspection mandatory will be feasible as there are thousands of housing societies in each ward,” said Kakani. According to the policy, one PCVC can be linked with one or more workplaces or societies but information about the same has to be given to the local ward office. “If an NOC from the BMC or a site inspection is made compulsory, it may slow the pace of vaccination and lead to red tape. But it will be safer,” said a civic official. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said the policy must be revised to make it stringent. “A high level special investigation team (SIT) must be set up to probe the fake vaccine scam,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-expected-to-revise-doorstep-vax-policy-finds-multiple-certs-in-fake-drive/articleshow/83851012.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||Murder of Sr citizen in riots: Court rejects bail plea of accused||New Delhi: A Delhi court has rejected the bail plea of a man accused in the murder of an octogenarian related to the violence in northeast Delhi in February 2020. The court said that an analysis of witness statements prima facie indicated that the accused was a member of the unlawful assembly that set the elderly woman’s house on fire. “From the videographic description of the place of incident demonstrated by the special public prosecutor, it is prima facie evident that the house of the complainant was targeted by the riotous mob. The house caught fire and large-scale destruction took place along with the unfortunate death of Akbari Begum (mother of the complainant),” noted additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav. The counsel for Prakash Chand sought bail, arguing that only because he was a resident of the same locality, he couldn’t be blamed for the riots under Section 149 of IPC as he never shared any “common object” with the unlawful assembly, even if he was present at the spot. The counsel further argued that Chand’s call data record (CDR) location, which was relied upon by police, was of no help to it because he resided in the area and the same didn't show the real time location of the user, but only the approximate location. The special public prosecutor, however, pointed out that in the video clippings in question, a huge crowd was clearly visible stone pelting, ransacking, etc, in and around the scene of crime. Three of those clips had reportedly shown Chand to be part of the “riotous mob” that set the complainant’s house on fire. The court in its order noted that Chand was clearly visible in a six-second clip. “It is quite apparent from the CDR details of the applicant/accused that he was in constant move/shuffle and no cogent/plausible explanation on this account has come forth from his side. Be that as it may, this is not the appropriate stage to dwell upon the said issue and the same will be taken care of during the course of trial,” the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/murder-of-sr-citizen-in-riots-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-accused/articleshow/83853908.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Gheware is accused of forging government records in 17 properties, where he manipulated records, obtained forged signatures and issued fake Urban Land Ceiling certificates and in some cases also back-dated the same. The certificates were used to obtain exemption from parting with land as mandated by provisions of the Act.

---||Delhi||Tribulations over, trials on Delhi Metro's Trilokpuri section from July||NEW DELHI: Preliminary train trials are all set to begin from next month on the Trilokpuri section of Delhi Metro’s Pink Line (Shiv Vihar-Majlis Park). The ‘missing link’ of Delhi Metro’s longest corridor, which led to the line functioning as two separate corridors for two and half years, was bridged around three months ago and track laying and other ancillary work like overhead electrification is also expected to be completed by the end of this month. “The track laying work is expected to be completed by the end of June and preliminary trials are expected to start thereafter. All efforts are being made to further expedite the progress of work on this particular stretch,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said. “The section shall be operational immediately after receiving the mandatory clearances from all concerned authorities,” he said. Once completed, this section will connect two ends of the Pink Line and will provide seamless connectivity to a long range of localities, he said. Dayal said that Important transport hubs such as Nizamuddin Railway Station, Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, Anand Vihar railway station, Anand Vihar ISBT, Delhi Cantonment railway station and prominent markets like Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and Dilli Haat-INA will get direct connectivity through this corridor. “To expedite work on the Trilokpuri section, DMRC adopted a unique construction method by using steel girders instead of the conventional concrete ones. Construction of concrete girders would have required establishment of a casting yard and it would not have been feasible to set up a casting yard for such a small stretch within a short duration of time,” Dayal said. A total of 40 steel girders have been placed on 10 spans to bridge the 290-metre-long section. “These steel girders have been fabricated and brought from a workshop at Ambala in Haryana. This has not only saved time but also there was no need to create a separate casting yard,” he said. The length of these girders varies from 16 to 38 metres. The height of the viaduct stands at about 8 to 9.5 metres. A curved span of radius 200 metres is also a part of this stretch. When extended from Majlis Park to Maujpur in Phase IV, the corridor will become India’s longest corridor at approximately 70 kilometers and also the only ‘ring corridor’ of Metro in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tribulations-over-trials-on-trilokpuri-section-from-july/articleshow/83854226.cms||Sidharatha Roy

All eight children have been cured and discharged,” an NMC official said. Although making a separate pediatric ward will take some time, the NMC has made arrangements of 150 beds to treat the children. “We have made temporary arrangement at one of the floors in the hospital to treat children infected with the coronavirus. Earlier, we would not treat children with Covid positive, but for the first time we have started their treatment at Bytco hospital,” the official said. “We have plans to set up a special pediatric ward that will have 100 beds with oxygen support at Bytco hospital.

---||Mumbai||Couple from Charkop arrested in vax camp fraud||MUMBAI: A couple from Charkop are the latest to be arrested in the fake vaccine scam, and police now believe saline water was administered to people at some of the camps. With the arrests of Dr Shivraj Pataria (61) and Neeta Pataria (60) on Thursday, the total arrests have gone up to 10. A fresh FIR -- the eighth so far -- was filed in Thane’s Naupada on Friday in connection with jabs given to 116 people from an insurance company. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by a DCP rank officer has been formed as the case now spans two commissionerates. The Patarias run Shivam Hospital in Charkop. Between March 3 and April 28, it was a designated private Covid vaccination centre. They were allotted 17,100 Covishield and 6,250 Covaxin doses, most of which they administered to people in an official capacity. But the hospital has not been able to explain what was done with the balance stock. “Even after the authorisation ended on April 28, the hospital carried out camps without any MoU or intimation to BMC. One such camp was carried out at Malad’s Bank of Baroda branch in association with key accused Mahendra Singh. Another camp was at a stocks advisory in Borivli,” said additional commissioner Dilip Sawant. Times ViewVictims of the fraud must get all the support they need from the authorities to check their health status, re-vaccinate or cancel certificates. The probe must establish the truth, and if healthcare practitioners named are proved to be involved, punishment must be exemplary as it would then be a case of great betrayal of the trust people place in doctors and of playing with human lives in a pandemic.Police have accused the Patarias of supplying used vials or fake doses to another accused, Dr Manish Tripathi, who ran a training institute out of their hospital. Tripathi, yet to be arrested, has been accused of refilling empty vials with saline water and supplying them to Singh for the camps. “Based on statement of an accused, Karim Ali, we prima facie believe saline water was used,” said joint commissioner Vishwas Nangre Patil. Ali, who was a student at Tripathi’s institute, said nine other students were trained in giving saline water shots. They were promised good grades in practical exams if they joined the bogus camps. Two other students, Roshni Patel and Ajit Benwasi, have been booked but not arrested. “All vials have been procured from a single source. We are yet to ascertain if any doses were adulterated,” said Nangre Patil. Police said the Patarias had several meetings with Tripathi and Singh and financial transactions occurred. Investigators have seized Rs 12.44 lakh and frozen Singh and Tripathi’s bank accounts. A car used for ferrying vaccines has been seized and 114 forged vaccine certificates recovered. “We have applied stringent sections such as Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of IPC as people’s lives have been put at risk. Another section applied attracts life imprisonment,” said Nangre Patil. The bogus camp in Thane was held on May 26 for employees of two branches of an insurance firm. “Rs 1,000 each was charged from beneficiaries and Rs 1.16 lakh collectively swindled. Four fake certificates were given. Singh, Gupta, Ali and two others were involved. The ninth FIR will be filed soon about 220 employees of talent management platform Kwan Talent being given shots. The gang roped in data-entry operators from BMC’s Nesco centre and private hospitals for misusing hospital logins and keying in data of beneficiaries for generating certificates. No senior doctor from these hospitals is involved,” a police officer said.

---||Nagpur||Earlier with Sena, Congress and Swabhimani Shetkari Saghtana, Subodh Mohite now joins Nationalist Congress Party||NAGPUR: Former Union minister Subodh Mohite on Friday joined Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the presence of party chief Sharad Pawar, and said his next step was to work for “the well-being of Vidarbha farmers”. Mohite had started his electoral politics journey with Shiv Sena when he was elected as member of Parliament from Ramtek in 1999. He later moved on to Congress and then joined Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana. When asked why he did not prefer to return to his previous parties, considering they too are part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, Mohite said it was Pawar’s charisma which drew him to the NCP. Speaking with TOI, Mohite said, “Everyone knows that (Sharad) Pawar is leader who the entire nation looks up to. The experience, knowledge and acumen which Pawar possesses is not visible in anyone. When it comes to debating on issues, nobody can speak like him.” Mohite says he has no electoral ambitions to nurse by joining NCP. “My only role as of now is to strengthen the party in Vidarbha. My focus will be on farmers and issues faced by them. There are many problems which farmers are facing and resolutions have to be found from the ground level and that’s where I will be spending my time,” said Mohite. The veteran politician is best known for wresting Ramtek Lok Sabha seat, which was for long known as a Congress bastion. “When I contested the Lok Sabha polls in 1999, all MLAs in the constituency were from opposition parties. Still I was able to win the seat for Shiv Sena. It’s this ground level strategizing skill which I will bring to the NCP and strengthen it in Vidarbha,” he said. He was Union minister for heavy industries in Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/earlier-with-sena-congress-and-sss-mohite-now-joins-ncp/articleshow/83854214.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

KDMC and the Varanasi administration bagged the award for innovative efforts to deal with Covid during the first wave. A total of 100 smart cities participated in the competition held on August 25, 2020, under various categories. The selection criteria were mainly related to the quality and innovative work done by the smart cities during the first wave.  For the competition, Smart Kalyan Dombivli Development Corporation had submitted the nomination under the group ‘Covid Innovation Award’ on behalf of KDMC. Out of 40 cities in the second phase, only Varanasi, Kalyan-Dombivli, Vadodara and Agra were shortlisted. On Friday, the sixth anniversary of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (Amrut), Smart Cities Mission and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Scheme, Hardeep Singh Puri, minister of state for housing and urban affairs, declared KDMC and Varanasi winners. An emotional KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryawanshi, who participated in the online ceremony on Friday, told TOI: “I am very happy that despite limited resources available with us, our entire civic staff fights Covid-19 in a very innovative way and the Central government has appreciated our efforts by honouring us with an award, which will motivate us in future too, to fight Covid-19 in an innovative way.” Suryawanshi said in the first wave, KDMC set up a ‘Private Doctors’ Army of the IMA (Indian Medical Association)’ that gave free service at Covid hospitals. KDMC gave real-time patient information on its portal. It started a ‘Family Doctor Covid Fighter Campaign’ to distribute antigen testing kits to physicians across the city for free testing of patients because it was seen residents believe in their family doctors. KDMC live-streamed talent programmes of citizens during the lockdown on its Facebook page too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kdmc-varanasi-jt-winners-of-covid-innovation-award/articleshow/83858078.cms||Pradeep Gupta

The move has come after instructions from district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal during the Covid review meeting that took place on Thursday. The officials have also been asked to take precautionary measures in view of the possible third wave. NMC medical superintendent Bhausaheb Nagargoje said, “The NMC would start taking strict action against people who are found moving in crowded places without masks or observing social distancing. Currently, the NMC is conducting around 7,000 Covid tests daily this would continue even in the future.” During the second wave, the NMC and police started taking joint action against people not following Covid norms. From March 1 to June 4, Rs 61.57 lakh were collected in the form of fine from 14,931 people for not wearing mask and over Rs 12.45 lakh were recovered from 2,114 people for not observing social distancing. SP (Nashik rural) Sachin Patil said after meeting it has been decided to take action against people moving unnecessarily in the public and not following Covid appropriate behaviour. “We will also ensure that people do not move out in public places unnecessarily after 4 pm. Senior officials of all police station have been instructed to intensify action against people violating Covid-norms,” he said. “We are also appealing to the people to ensure they wash their hands regularly and maintain personal hygiene to prevent getting infected from Covid-19,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/strict-action-against-people-found-flouting-covid-norms/articleshow/83848808.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kochi||Kerala Forest department to acquire 51 hectares private land to save mangroves||KOCHI: The state forest department is set to acquire private lands where mangroves are grown in order to conserve them from further degradation under the Rebuild Kerala initiative. The department will acquire around 51 hectares of private land with mangroves in Thrissur, Kollam, Malappuram and Kannur districts. The acquisition will be done by bringing them under ecologically fragile land (EFL) sections and valuation committees have been constituted in Kollam and Thrissur districts to discuss compensation and other procedures. The range forest officials have already submitted details of owners who are willing to relinquish their land, where mangrove is growing. “The mangroves on private lands are facing massive destruction. The move by the forest department is to bring it under the conservation effort of the government. We have roped in Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) to conduct a study on long-term conservation strategy of mangroves based on livelihood of locals,” said a forest official. In Kerala, mangroves are largely seen near estuaries and backwaters as they need salinity and clay soil to grow. “Mangroves in Kerala are mostly on private and revenue lands and 90% of it have already been destroyed for individual needs. It is very important for coastal restoration and marine habitat. In many countries, mangroves are planted as bio shields,” says KFRI senior scientist Dr P Sujanapal. Dr T V Sajeev, another senior scientist in KFRI, said people should take up conservation efforts of the ecosystem for their survival as they are closely linked with it. “Fishermen and tribespeople, who are closely associated with ecosystem, will find it very difficult to cope with displacement. They cannot survive in the new place which will suffocate them. We need to take them on board for ideal conservation efforts of the ecosystem for their survival and conserving the ecology as well,” he said. Meanwhile, a social forestry official said the effort of the forest department to acquire private lands, where mangroves grow, has been lagging even after they submitted details of the owners and the private lands to be acquired months ago. “We submitted the list months ago. We are awaiting the approval of the department. We will have to take a list once again of the areas where mangroves grow as there is fluctuation in growth of mangroves. More mangroves might have grown in that place by now as against when the list was prepared. As per earlier studies, mangroves were on 700 sqkm area in Kerala in the 1950s. Now, it has shrunken to 25sqkm, thanks to massive destruction,” said a social forestry official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/forest-dept-to-acquire-51ha-pvt-land-to-save-mangroves/articleshow/83851056.cms||T C Sreemol

The NMC has started post-Covid OPD facilities at its six hospitals- one each in the six divisions of the city. The OPDs have been started to examine the health of recovered Covid patients and provide them with proper treatment if they have any health issues post-Covid. NMC officials said footfall is very low at the post-Covid OPDs. On average, two to three people visit each of the OPDs. The facilities mainly have patients coming with complaints of body pain, breathing problems and weakness. They are provided treatment in the facilities. Vijay Deokar, the medical officer of NMC and head of the post-Covid OPD in Panchavati, said, “We are providing treatment to recovered Covid patients as per their health complaints.” Jitendra Dhaneshwar, the medical officer and in-charge of Bytco hospital, said they have examined 55 patients at the post-Covid OPD at Bytco hospitals and all of them had minor health issues like body pain and weakness. “We are also contacting the recovered patients and enquiring of their health post-Covid.

Om Prakash’s son, Vinay, had married Kiran against the wishes of both the families, though his own had later reconciled. On Thursday, a group attacked the couple in their Dwarka home, killing Vinay and injuring Kiran. “I had never met Kiran,” continued Om Prakash. “She said, ‘Papa, my brother, uncle, cousin and other relatives are behind the shooting. I will be operated upon. Please come and see me’.” The father-in-law met Kiran on Friday morning and put his hand on her head for the first time. “She is my son’s wife. She had been pregnant but due to some complications the pregnancy had to be terminated. I can’t take her back to my home because the villagers will object. I don’t know what I should do,” he told TOI. In tears at the hospital mortuary, Om Prakash disclosed that Kiran’s uncle often talked of avenging the familial insult. “Her uncle did what he threatened to do,” Vinay’s father said. “I work as a postman and have a wife and younger son who has cleared Class X. This shooting has scared us and we don’t know if we too will be left alive. If they can come to Delhi to kill my son, how can I feel secure in my village?” Om Prakash said the family learnt of Vinay’s relationship with Kiran in June 2020. “I went to the girl’s house and told her parents about it. I warned my son against it, but he was adamant. So, I cut off my ties with him,” said the grieving father. Lovers since high school, Kiran and Vinay, a taxi driver, had decided to ignore the objections of their families arising out of them both being of the same Dahiya gotra. The two eloped and got married in a Chandigarh court on August 13 last year. Recalling the events of last year, Om Prakash said, “Around 1pm on August 12, Vinay told me that he had to go to Ghaziabad and then to the airport. I let him go for what I thought was his work, but the two got married the following day. We never spoke after that or knew where he lived. I only resumed talking to him about two months ago. I don’t know if he tried calling me in between because I don’t have a phone.” The youngsters’ relationship had been discussed by the village panchayat three weeks after the marriage. “The panchayat said no one from the two families should contact each other or fight with each other. But I am a postman and my work requires me to go to all the houses in the village,” said Om Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-take-her-to-my-village-says-father-in-law/articleshow/83855348.cms||---

The blueprint, which primarily includes the Ayodhya vision document, will be presented by principal secretary, housing and urban development, Deepak Kumar. Officials of Ayodhya Development Authority and district administration will also participate in the digital presentation. The vision document envisages a grand new Ayodhya across the river Saryu, straddling adjoining districts of Gonda and Basti, linking the 1,200acre sprawling Smart Vedic City in the proximity of Ramjanmabhoomi and connecting the 300km peripheral pilgrimage route (84 Kos Parikrama) that carry the footprint of Lord Ram. Chalked out by Ayodhya Development Authority along with three consultant firms — Canada-based multinational firm LEA Associates South Asia Private Ltd and two Indian firms, L&T and Kukreja Architects — the New Ayodhya blueprint earmarks world class tourist facilities, including 5-star and 7-star hotels, 15km off the upcoming international airport. Talking to TOI, principal secretary, housing and urban development, Deepak Kumar, said, “New Ayodhya will also house offices of foreign countries, guesthouses of state governments and offices of key shrine boards in India. Development projects will range from the Ram temple to beautification of Saryu banks, installation of a giant statue of Lord Ram and turning Ayodhya into a solar city with renewable energy facility. However, the intrinsic spiritual character of the city will be kept intact.” Vice-chairman of Ayodhya Development Authority, Vishal Singh, told TOI that opinion of Ayodhya citizens has also been included in the vision document, which also envisages developing areas which carry the legacy of religious austerity practised by Hindu seers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-modi-to-review-ayodhya-vision-docu-with-yogi-today/articleshow/83858171.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi: NCB busts global drug racket operating via darknet; 8 held||NEW DELHI: The Narcotics Control Bureau has busted a drug trafficking syndicate operating over the darknet. The cartel operated in the form of an online pharmacy having nine websites, all registered outside India. According to deputy director (NCB) KPS Malhotra, 22 lakh psychotropic tablets, 70,000 Codeine-based cough syrups and 245 kg of psychoactive drugs have been seized and eight traffickers arrested by the Delhi zone. “The drugs were being packed as herbal supplements and shipped to customers. The syndicate was spread across Delhi, UP and Uttarakhand in India and had tentacles in USA, UK, Europe, Canada and Philippines. Most transactions happened via cryptocurrency,” Malhotra said. This module, cops said, had adopted the modus operandi of getting the orders through darknet market hosts. The websites were created for interaction and drugs were delivered through dedicated shippers to create anonymity between the receiver of the order and logistic persons. The two-month-long investigation was conducted based on a specific input that a trafficking network was involved in exportation of psychotropic drugs from India to various parts of the world. Few consignments were seized and their prints traced backwards. It came to fore that shippers were primarily in Delhi-NCR and using fake identities. Using deep technical surveillance, the sleuths nabbed one of the shippers, K Aggarwal, who disclosed that he got the consignment from one of the suppliers in Agra. That supplier, A Goyal, was also arrested. “They revealed that they were getting the psychotropic drugs from a Haridwar- based pharmaceutical company, which was involved in legal production and in that garb, was diverting these psychotropic drugs to these traffickers,” deputy director Malhotra added. A raid was conducted at Haridwar on the premises of the said pharmaceutical company and their distribution centre based in Agra, which led to massive seizures. Four other suspects—A Sharma, P Sharma, J Prasad and G Kumar—were arrested as well. Probe indicates that the syndicate members are very tech-savvy. They were using VoIP methods to communicate with each other with the cover of VPN, to avoid the surveillance of drug law enforcement agencies. They had listed these websites out of India and all the footprints of these websites were cleverly camouflaged by using outside India IP addresses. For financial transactions, they had maintained international accounts based outside of India. To gain the confidence of clients, who were primarily based in North America, they had opened these accounts in those territories. The cartel members have their counterparts in the USA and Canada, who are under probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ncb-busts-global-drug-racket-operating-via-darknet-8-held/articleshow/83879485.cms||Raj Shekhar

StaTwig based in tech hub Gachibowli has won joint third prize in the UK-based Trinity Challenge for its product VaccineLedger which tracks vaccine vials and other products on their journey from manufacturer to beneficiary anywhere in the world. The platform, which uses blockchain technology and the Internet of Things, is able to track the location and condition of vaccines as they pass through different touchpoints at places like airports and hospitals. Sensors monitor the temperature of the vaccine to see if it is about to be spoiled and users at touchpoints can send information about its condition too when they scan it. “Three out of 10 vaccines do not reach their destination due to a failure in the supply chain. We have reduced vaccine spoilage by at least 25% so far,” said 34-year-old founder CEO of StaTwig Sid Chakravarthy. So far the platform has tracked nearly 20 million vaccines globally. In India it is being used it to track vaccines in Telangana and he hopes to roll it out to other states and other countries. “Blockchain is a decentralised network, so the manufacturer, government figures, implementation partners, donors can track every single product and find out exactly where it is. If the temperature is increasing we send out alerts immediately– or if it is damaged we send out alerts to prevent costs of shipping it,” he explained. His team of 25 staff had been working on the blockchain-supply chain solution for two years, thanks to funding from UNICEF. At that time they were focused on the availability of vaccine to children. “As soon as the pandemic hit and vaccines were coming out ,we realised our solution was in the right place at the right time,” added Chakravarthy, who obtained a bachelors degree from Osmania University and masters at University of Maryland, College Park. He worked in the San Francisco Bay area for a few years before moving back to India in 2016 to start this company. The prize money will be used to scale the solution up in other countries where it is needed. VaccineLedger was one of 16 finalists in the Trinity Challenge, launched by Dame Sally Davies, master at Trinity College Cambridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-start-up-wins-rs-4-9-cr-in-uk-contest/articleshow/83860047.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The revenue department had earlier registered four cases and seized 36 pieces of timber from four plots at Krishnagiri. But inspection by the team in the area on Friday found stumps of two huge rosewood trees hidden by dumping soil over it. “We are checking the number of registered trees in the plots by comparing it with the tree register. We have found that two trees have been cut from an 11-acre assigned land and more inspections will be carried out in the coming days,” a revenue department official said. There have been efforts at destruction of evidence by taking away the remains of felled trees, he added. Revenue officials will be submitting a report to the police after the estimation exercise and cases will be registered for theft and cheating. Forest department registered a total of 46 cases in connection with the felling of rosewood trees in revenue land at Muttil south village in Wayanad. Besides the forest department probe, a multi-agency special investigation team (SIT) is also probing the illegal tree felling by charging cases under various sections including theft, cheating, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/more-trees-felled-on-revenue-land/articleshow/83851077.cms||---

DCP (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said Rs 64.3 lakh in cash and 93 laptops being used by the employees have been seized. Police were acting on a tip-off that illegal call centre was being run near Tiles Market in Jagatpuri. This information was further developed and surveillance mounted around the premises located in A block. After inputs were confirmed, a team led by inspector Vikash raided the premises and found an office set-up in place. The employees were caught red-handed trying to dupe people on calls. “The people at the call centre were pretending to be employed by Amazon Inc and used illegal techniques like VOIP calling, bypassing the legal international long-distance gateways,” the DCP said. According to police, the accused were extorting Amazon customers based in USA by claiming their social security details had been hacked. During enquiry, it came to fore that one Rakesh was running the set-up on behalf of one Mannu Singh Tanwar. Tanwar is at present in Bhiwani Jail, Haryana for his involvement in a murder case. He worked as a liquor vend contractor and was previously arrested by Gurgaon police in September 2020 for running another fake call centre in Gurgaon. “On being asked about any license and authority to run the call centre, no documents could be produced. Mobile phones were recovered from the possession of Rakesh and others, which contained various US mobiles numbers in a Whatsapp group,” the DCP added. The accused told police that they would send fake messages to phone numbers and email IDs of Amazon customers, telling them that 1,000 USD had been credit to their accounts. When the customer would call back to know more about it, the accused would threaten them saying their security number had been hacked. The target would be made to pay up in form of gift vouchers from Amazon store, which the accused would redeem later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fake-call-centre-duped-american-citizens-84-held/articleshow/83854542.cms||---

Most of the senior leader were moving in Ameenagatta, Jappagatta, Battugudem, Abujhmad, South Bastar in the past few months. ``Actually, cases of Covid-19 among Maoists started before the Silger protest. But it spread at fast pace due to the mass gatherings. Due to the meetings organized by Maoists and their interactions, tribals in forest areas in Chhattisgarh paid a price as the virus spread among them,’’ a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5-maoist-cc-members-have-covid-19/articleshow/83860062.cms||Srinath Vudali

Mumbai also reached a milestone by crossing 50 lakh vaccinations, according to the CoWin portal. Overall, the state has administered 3,02,78,260 doses, which includes 51,28,087 doses given in Mumbai, the highest among districts since the drive started in January. Despite the record, the state has fully vaccinated only 7% (58.2 lakh) of its adult population estimated to be around 8.5 crore. Around 22% or 1.8 crore have been partially vaccinated. As for Mumbai, barely 10% of its adult population is fully vaccinated while roughly 32% has had one jab. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a technical advisor to the state, said Maharashtra must aim to vaccinate 70% of its population with both doses before August if it wants to beat the third wave. “We need to pick up speed in light of the Delta-plus detections and wide circulation of the Delta variant,” he said. State assured of 1.1 crore doses in July, vax hesitancy now a hurdleThe state government has been assured of 1.1 crore vaccine doses in July, which includes the share for the private sector, said public health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday as Maharashtra became the first state to reach the milestone of administering three crore doses. The minister said Maharashtra can complete immunising the rest of the adult population within 3 months if it receives adequate doses from the Centre. “We have done the highest vaccinations in the country. Our capacity is to do 10lakh vaccinations per day. We have already given three crore doses and can deliver another six crores in 2.5months to 3months. That way we can finish vaccinating 9crore,” he said. Tope said that the queues and the eagerness for vaccination have diminished. Figures underscore the absence of eagerness even in the most vulnerable groups. The above-45 years lot accounts for more than 70% deaths in Maharashtra, but less than 10% of them have taken both doses. Only one-third (1.22crore) are partially vaccinated in this bracket. In the younger category of 18-44 years, around 7.6% have taken the first dose and less than 1% (0.43%) is fully vaccinated. The drive for the 18-44 group resumed at government-run centres last week after being suspended since May 12. The trend in Mumbai is no different—merely 40% of senior citizens are completely vaccinated while 45% are partially vaccinated. The data suggests an estimated 15% in this group may not have taken a single dose. In the 45-59 age group, 53% have taken the first dose and 11% have taken both. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said Mumbai has a long road ahead as merely 10% of the estimated adult population of 93lakh has completed immunisation. “We can vaccinate more than 1lakh people daily, but supply has to be consistent,” she said. Among healthcare workers, 4.38lakh are partially inoculated and 8.25lakh have taken both doses. They are estimated to be around 15 lakh, but the number is being constantly as more recruitments are made during the pandemic. Among frontline workers, a staggering 11.89lakh are still partially vaccinated, which has become a matter of concern. The drive to immunise health workers and other frontline staff began in January. State officials said double registration in Co-Win could be pulling down the second dose coverage numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-1st-to-top-3cr-jabs-22-adult-popn-covered/articleshow/83866385.cms||Sumitra Debroy

It has also called for a crackdown on the practice of selling PoP idols with an outer layer of clay. Ganesh Chaturthi will be celebrated on September 10. “In spite of the persistent yearly ban, PoP idols are available for sale in many parts of the state before Ganesh Chaturthi. It has been observed that these idols float in water after immersion. This amounts to extreme denigration of the deity.

Haribushan alias Yapa Narayana had died of Covid-19 recently. Sources said another leader Koyyada Sambaiah alias Azad is also seen as a potential candidate to head the Maoist party in Telangana. Both Damodar and Azad are Telangana State Committee members currently. Bhadradri Kothagudem district superintendent of police Sunil Dutt said Damodar has 70 cases filed against him in Venkatapuram of Kothagudem alone. “He carries a reward of Rs 25 lakh on his head in Telangana,” the SP said. He is facing cases in Warangal, Mulugu, Bhupalpally and Kothagudem. A native of Mulugu district, Damodar has studied up to Intermediate. A senior police official involved in anti-Naxalite operations said this is a crucial phase for Maoists as the party has been on the decline in Telangana. “Whoever takes over the leadership, will face a tough challenge. The cadre strength is declining and recruitments are done at a slow pace. The party has sympathisers and mass support only in some urban areas and help from militia members in tribal strongholds,” he said. Police said Azad, who has studied up to class V, is junior to Damodar in Maoist ranks. “He was elevated to the State Committee recently. His wife Sujata, who was arrested, is currently in jail,” said a police official. A native of Govindaraopet in Warangal district, Azad oversees Maoist operations in Bhadradri Kothagudem district and East Godavari district in neighbouring AP. Sources said there are around 140 underground cadres of CPI (Maoist) party from Telanagana and most of them operate from Chhattisgarh side of the border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/damodar-to-take-over-as-maoist-state-chief-after-haribushan/articleshow/83860046.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Arrested Chinese national was in Hyderabad for two years||HYDERABAD: A fortnight after a Chinese national identified as Han Junwei was arrested by the Border Security Force at Sultanpur Indo-Bangladesh border in Malda on June 10, startling revelations have emerged. Junwei was in Hyderabad for two years and he even had a PAN card and a bank account here. Telangana police are waiting for an interrogation report from West Bengal Special Task Force (STF) on Junwei to decide on future course of action. Three days after his arrest, a BSF team found some documents thrown in Sultanpur border area by Junwei. “We found an SBI ATM card of an account belonging to a branch in Telangana and PAN card. The evidence was handed over to West Bengal police,” BSF DIG Surjeet S Guleria said. Junwei (36) was caught while trying to illegally enter India through Bangladesh. A Chinese passport with Bangladesh business visa was found in his possession. Junwei was intially interrogated by Malda district police before the STF took over the probe recently. Malda district SP Alok Rajoria said Junwei confessed that he was connected to a private company registered in Hyderabad. “We had very little time talking to him. During the interrogation, he mentioned that he has links to a Hyderabad-based company,” the SP said. Meanwhile, Telangana Intelligence sleuths verified the status of the private company Junwei had mentioned to West Bengal police. “The company was registered with Pahadisharif area address. It is a shell firm. We knew Junwei was in Hyderabad for about two years,” a senior state police official said. His associate Prashant Kumar Pottelli of Vikarabad was arrested by Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), Lucknow. “We suspect that they were involved in some financial fraud. Once we get details of interrogation from West Bengal police, we will decide about the future course of action,” the police official added. Meanwhile, ATS Lucknow sleuths are also trying to take Junwei into their custody in connection with a financial fraud case registered in January 2021. The ATS has already arrested 19 persons, including Prashant Kumar and three other Chinese nationals.  “We have arrested Prashant Kumar from Telangana. He is currently in judicial custody in a case pertaining to financial fraud. Once West Bengal STF’s custody is over, we will seek Junwei’s custody in our case,” Lucknow ATS inspector general GK Goswami said. Police said Junwei was involved in procurement of 1,300 pre-activated Indian SIM cards through forged documents from SIM card sellers in Chandausi and Hasanpur towns of Uttar Pradesh to carry out financial frauds in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/arrested-chinese-national-was-in-hyderabad-for-2-years/articleshow/83854414.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The number of passengers deboarding the trains and testing positive in the city has increased to 15 in the past one and a half month.  “The number of passengers tested positive has increased as out of the 15 patients, eight of them have tested positive in the past eight days,” said Dr Jitendra Dhaneshwar, the medical superintendent of NMC’s Bytco Hospital. The people who tested positive were admitted to the hospital as they did not have a proper residential place where they could isolate themselves without the one they came to Nashik with. The teams comprising healthcare professionals from the NMC screen the passengers deboarding the trains for health issues like Covid symptoms. Only passengers with symptoms have to undergo rapid antigen testing (RAT). On average 200 RAT are conducted daily, especially with the focus on the people coming from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, the officer added. The railway authorities said there were large numbers of people coming back to Nashik from the various areas of north India and even Odisha and West Bengal. “The workers are coming to work in Nashik in various sectors including the real estate and the industrial sector,” said Rakesh Kuthar, the Nashik Road railway station manager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/8-passengers-test-positive-at-nashik-road-railway-station/articleshow/83848960.cms||---

NCB, after taking custody of Kaskar from Central Jail in Thane, produced him before joint civil judge M M Mali in a Bhiwandi court. NCB demanded two days’ custody for interrogation in the case. But Kaskar’s lawyer Zain Kuwari argued in court that since a drug substance was seized in the case, only Kaskar’s interrogation was required by NCB, for which one-day custody was sufficient, to which Mali agreed. Kaskar was brought amid tight security from Thane to NCB’s office here. Till late evening NCB officials were interrogating him. Shabbir, from whom NCB recovered 12kg hashish from his second house in Padga district in Thane, is also a distant relative, and both were arrested by JJ Marg police in Mumbai in 2015 in an extortion case. A complaint was lodged by Salim Shaikh that Kaskar and his accomplice demanded Rs 3 lakh as protection money. Shabbu was also with Kaskar when Chhota Rajan men had fired at Kaskar at Damarwala Lane at Pakmodia Street in 2011, in which Kaskar had a narrow escape. “Shabbu also used to visit Kaskar when arrested by Thane anti-extortion cell.

The court said while the accused, Rajesh Thakur, had hit his brother with a pan, the post-mortem report showed the victim died after he hanged himself soon after the fight. “If this overall situation is compared with the immediate FIR and the statements of witnesses, prima facie this court finds that this is the case of suicidal death.

The state has so far given 1,00,53,358 doses. The state also achieved another feat of administering two lakh doses in a single day on Friday. Director of public health, Dr Srinivasa Rao, said that 86,06,292 people in the state have so far received their first dose, while 14,47,056 have got both the doses. According to the figures released by the health department, Hyderabad has the highest number of vaccinated people (22,30,655), with 19,19,321 getting their first doses. Narayanpet district, the smallest in Telangana, saw the lowest number of doses (50,818) being given. “We take this opportunity to promise vaccine to people who are yet to get their first jab,” Rao said. Telangana began its vaccination drive on January 16 by inoculating health workers on a priority. It subsequently added people from other categories depending on availability of doses. While Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha have given more than one crore doses, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and Rajasthan have crossed the two crore-mark. Maharashtra has so far given more than three crore doses. Notwithstanding the changes in the vaccine strategy several times — even halting the vaccination drive at one point — Telangana, unlike many other states, has vaccinated more people in the age group of 18-44 years. Around 40 lakh jabs were given in this age groups, as against 23 lakh in above 60 group, and 36.97 lakh for 45-60 years category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-administers-over-1cr-doses-hyd-leads-with-22l-vax-jabs/articleshow/83860120.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

However, a police department’s initiative has brought him into the mainstream and he will now undergo training at Delhi Police’s centre for skill development. Rohit was among 53 young rehabilitated drug addicts who were enrolled into Delhi Police’s ‘Yuva’ programme on Saturday. These men will undergo skill development training to be able to earn their living, senior police officers said. The induction was done on the occasion of ‘International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking,’ which is observed every year on June 26. The commissioner of police, SN Shrivastava, welcomed these youths into the programme in a virtual ceremony. “For the event, five skill training centres in five different districts, where these new trainees are enrolled, were linked, while the commissioner joined from the police headquarters. He spelt out the ill impacts of drug abuse on youth and exhorted the youngsters to choose life with fighting spirit, not take recourse to drugs or psychotropic substances ever. Stating that drug abuse experiences are unreal and imaginary where one loses control and suffers loss, Shrivastava urged the youth never to fall in the tentacles of drugs, stating— never even try once,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal. The commissioner further said that police officers should identify the youth falling prey to drug addiction and help them come back to mainstream, besides taking tough action on the supply networks of narcotics. “Delhi Police has taken a big step in integrating them with skill development programmes and job training by enrolling them in Yuva in which 10,000 youngsters are going to be trained in skill development.” On this occasion, various programmes were also organised by the narcotics cell of the Crime Branch to highlight the ill-effects of drug abuse and to create awareness among the public. Among these, an online painting competition on drug abuse was held in which students of classes 9 to 12 of Happy Public School from Daryaganj and Abhinav Public School, Pitampura took part and submitted their entries, Biswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-drag-youths-out-of-drug-net-to-now-help-them-find-jobs/articleshow/83879505.cms||---

He also asked the DGP to dismiss officers and police personnel from service if they are found guilty in the inquiry. The CM’s decision comes a day after the high court ordered a probe into the alleged lockup death of Mariyamma. In fact, the CM — for the first time in seven years — gave an appointment to a Congress delegation to meet him in Pragathi Bhavan and represent the matter to him. The CM said the government will not tolerate such incidents. He promised a government job to Mariyamma’s son Udaya Kiran along with Rs 15 lakh compensation, a house and Rs 10 lakh each to Mariyamma’s two daughters. KCR directed chief secretary Somesh Kumar and the DGP to visit Mariyamma’s house in Chintakani in Khammam district and meet her family. He also asked minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar, TRS MP Nama Nageswara Rao and CLP leader, Madhira MLA Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka to visit the family on June 28. He said it was unfortunate that such an incident had happened. The Congress team consisting of CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, MLAs Komatireddy Raj Gopal Reddy, Jagga Reddy and D Sridhar Babu and Congress SC cell chairman N Preetam urged the CM to take stringent action against the police officials responsible for Mariyamma’s death. She died in Addagudur police station in the early hours of June 18. She was brought to the police station in connection with a theft case. KCR has not given appointment to leaders of Congress and other opposition parties for reasons unknown for years. Congress leaders sought appointment of the CM on various occasions, including during the Nerella incident when Dalits were harassed in Rajanna Sircilla district a few years ago. The meeting of Congress leaders with KCR assumes significance at a time when former minister Eatala Rajender alleged that the CM does not give appointments to his ministerial colleagues, party MLAs and MPs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-kcr-orders-probe-into-dalit-womans-death/articleshow/83860081.cms||Koride Mahesh

Justice Ashok Menon considered a petition filed by Aisha through senior advocate P Vijaya Bhanu seeking pre-arrest bail in the case registered by Kavaratti police for sedition (124A IPC) and promoting religious enmity (153A IPC). In the judgment, the court said the offences alleged by prosecution are prima facie not attracted. The court said, “After having considered the submissions made on both sides, and also the transcript of the discussion, it would suffice to say that prima facie, the applicant did not have a malicious motive to subvert the government established by law by merely using the strong word ‘bio weapon’ to express her vehemence in disapproval of the subject under discussion. Her intention is explicitly in criticism of the modification of the SOP, introduced by the administrator, forgoing the mandatory provision of subjecting the persons entering the island to quarantine. This allegedly led to exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the island. The decisive ingredient for establishing the offence of sedition under S.124-A IPC is the doing of certain acts which would bring the government established by law in India into hatred or contempt, etc. In this case, there is not even a suggestion that applicant did anything as such against the Government of India.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-sedition-case-against-aisha-unsustainable/articleshow/83851136.cms||---

The rural areas of Nashik district, excluding the Nashik and Malegaon cities, witnessed 440 cases in last two days — Wednesday and Thursday. “The total number of positive cases across the rural areas jumped from an average of 60 per day to more than 200 per day in the last two days,” taluka health officer Dr Kailas Boye said. According to an analysis, talukas like Niphad and Chandwad reported maximum growth in new patients and was followed by Malegaon and Baglan. The health authorities are also puzzled with the sudden rise in the number of new patients and are ascertaining the reason behind the same. “We are trying to figure out the reason for the increase in positive cases. One of the reasons can be the mandatory antigen testing of beneficiaries before vaccination to ascertain if they are negative. A sizeable numbers of positive cases are coming from here,” the officer said. On Niphad and Chandwad showing maximum rise, the officer said Niphad is an agriculture hub with good number APMCs while Chandwad is a junction for major vehicles coming in from Dhule, Ahmednagar, Nandurbar. Boye also pointed out that the office was further ensuring if the number of new cases were part of any kind of reconciliation being carried out by the private laboratories. He, however, added testing had already been increased across the district. “Over 5,000 people are tested per day to curb the spread of the disease,” Boye said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/four-talukas-in-nashik-report-surge-in-fresh-covid-cases/articleshow/83848993.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||Celebrating team effort in these times of distress||New Delhi: The tough times faced by people during the second wave of the pandemic not only brought them together to extend a helping hand to neighbours, but even strangers. It’s been a year of uncertainty for Delhiites. Many residents’ welfare associations (RWA) and communities in the city not only resolved regular civic and safety issues through the authorities, but also managed to find solutions in helping people deal with the devastating effects the novel coronavirus brought to the region. From setting up local Covid care centres or quarantine spaces to creating oxygen cylinder or concentrator banks, helping in arranging medicines and medical help, and making sure that families in home isolation received timely nourishing meals, many RWAs and housing societies went way above their normal duties to keep people safe. Team efforts are inspiring and need to be celebrated. This is what #MySocietyPride, a TOI initiative, intends to do during its third edition. Tell us about the welfare measures that your society has implemented during the lockdown and we will feature the best ones in The Times of India. Scan the QR code or visit www.toi.in/mysocietypride to share the details. The cities we live in draw their identities from the many societies and condominiums that are home to working women, corporate professionals, teachers, doctors, tech entrepreneurs and social workers, the young and the old. Since the beginning of the lockdown in April, residents across Delhi-NCR endeavoured to do their bit and look out for each other, acting as a community to keep people safe. Even now, when the number of Covid-19 cases have gone down, many RWAs are helping residents and housing staff to get vaccinated, while providing assistance to the family of deceased staff. The TOI campaign intends to celebrate the team efforts undertaken by communities to control the spread of the virus, provide treatment support, ensure safety measures, hold testing or vaccination camps and provide other help to their staff members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/celebrating-team-effort-in-these-times-of-distress/articleshow/83854663.cms||---

On Friday, the cops had brought Kiran’s father and uncle to Delhi for questioning. Police are trying to ascertain who were involved in the shooting on Thursday that killed Kiran’s husband, Vinay, and left her with bullet wounds. On Saturday, Kiran, 19, was shifted to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital for treatment. Purportedly an act of vengeance for going against the gotra traditions and the family’s resistance to their marriage, the shooters who killed Vinay, 23, according to Kiran, were her elder brother Aman, a cousin and some relatives. The young couple knew of the danger they faced in marrying despite being from the same Dahiya gotra. They addressed a complaint to SSP, Sonipat, on the day of their wedding on August 13 last year, stating that they did not believe in this old system of marriage where gotra played a big role. In it, Kiran had stated, “I am getting married on my own wish. On getting a chance I ran away from my house and got married to Vinay as per Hindu rites and ceremony. We are living as husband and wife of our free will. However, my family has been threatening us and may also lodge false complaints against us.” On Thursday, a group entered the couple’s rented house in Amberhai village. They chased Vinay and pumped bullets into him. Kiran, who also received bullet injuries, ran up to the terrace and jumped to the adjoining house, from where some neighbours took her to hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/honour-killing-cops-to-quiz-more-kin-of-girl/articleshow/83879525.cms||---

The health department was in a tizzy after they received confirmation from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, that the sample of a 65-year-old woman from Bikaner had tested positive for the variant. The woman has already taken two doses of Covid vaccine before she was found positive on June 1. Her sample was randomly sent by the Bikaner Medical College to NIV. With this, Rajasthan has entered the list of states found with cases of this variant. So far, 20 cases have been found in Maharashtra, nine in Tamil Nadu, seven in Madhya Pradesh, three in Kerala, two each in Punjab and Gujarat, and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jammu and Karnataka. The chief medical and health officer(CMHO) of Bikaner has been informed of the development. “She is a resident of Bangla colony in Bikaner and is living with her husband,” said an officer with the health department. “The sample of the woman was sent to NIV on June 1 and found positive for Delta plus,” said Ravi Prakash Sharma, director, rural health. “The husband of the woman was found positive for Covid on May 30. As a part of contact tracing exercise, we took her sample. Both were under home isolation and had very mild symptoms. Her sample was randomly sent to NIV. She has told us that she received her second dose of vaccine on May 19,” said Dr O P Chahar, CMHO, Bikaner, to TOI after visiting the woman on Friday evening.“She is doing fine and has gone to a hospital for normal follow-up on blood pressure and other medical issues.

It warned the authorities of punishment under the Contempt of Courts Act if they continue to dodge the issue. “Do not show any discrimination on pensioners basing on narrow consideration of nativity,” the court said. A bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman turned critical towards the government and the state counsel while hearing two contempt cases filed by 230 retired employees seeking pension and arrears. Brushing aside the argument of the state counsel that the housing board is facing a fund crunch, the bench asked the state government to make use of the assets of the board to realise money and pay the pensioners. The bench said it would pronounce its order within four weeks in the contempt case and posted the case to July 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pay-pension-to-housing-board-retirees-hc/articleshow/83854587.cms||---

The value of the seizure is estimated at several lakh rupees. The illegal trade came to light after the district forest officer S Shantaram received a tip-off from an informer in Bihar. “We got a call from a reliable source that a person had put the pangolin scales for sale on social media. On receiving this information and a contact number, we immediately decided to conduct an undercover operation to arrest the accused. Our team was able to locate one of the poachers within a short period of time but it took us about four to five days to complete the entire operation,” said Shantaram. After receiving orders from the DFO, a 10-member team of the forest department headed by forest range officer B Purnima took part in the undercover operation. “We were just given one phone number to investigate the case. We posed as potential buyers and negotiated the price for 35 scales which the accused were planning to sell. After several phone calls, price negotiations to gain their trust and finalizing a place to meet, we were able to nab three persons on the national highway near Rebenna mandal,” said Purnima. Out of six people who came to the location on motor bikes to sell the scales, the forest officials arrested three persons, while the remaining three escaped. The police and forest offciers, who are on the lookout for three more members, say that the gang might also have links in other states. “We seized 35 scales on the spot and another 205 scales from one of the poacher’s houses in Golleti village. People must remember that Pangolin scales have no proven medicinal value and that it is a punishable offence under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” the FRO added. Indian pangolins are an endangered species and are given the highest level of protection by including them in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Hunting and trading of is a serious offence and punishable with minimum punishment of seven years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of not less than Rs 5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/240-pangolin-scales-seized-three-poachers-arrested/articleshow/83860117.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Jaipur||Top labour officer, 2 others arrested by ACB while taking Rs 3L as bribe||Jaipur: State labour commissioner Prateek Jhajharia was arrested after he was caught red handed while taking a bribe of Rs 3 lakh from two agents at his Gandhi Nagar residence late Friday evening. An Indian Postal Service (IPoS) cadre officer, Jhajharia is currently posted at the labour department on deputation. The two agents who came to deliver the money have been identified as Amit Sharma, a resident of Jaipur, and Ravi Meena, currently working as OSD (officer on special duty) with the state economic advisory council. DG (ACB) BLSoni said that the bribe money was collected by Sharma and Meena from a district labour official in Karauli on behalf of the labour commissioner. “The two had come to Jhajharia’s house to deliver the money when our teams caught them red handed,” he said. Additional DG (ACB) Dinesh MN said that searches were underway at different places. “The investigation in the case is underway, we have to check and examine a lot of things,” he said. Besides Jhajharia, labour officials posted at certain districts are also under the ACB scanner for their alleged involvement in collecting money from places where labour is employed overlooking labour rights. ACB officials informed TOI that searches were underway at different districts, including Sawai Madhopur, Chittorgarh and Karauli. Similar searches were launched late in the evening at two other places in Jaipur too. Labour official of Karauli district Ramesh Meena and labour welfare official of Chittorgarh Shiv Charan are under ACB scanner too. Sources said that local labour officials posted in districts have to take care of labour rights, including, PF, pension, workplace safety, insurance, etc. “Nodal labour officials at district level overlook labour exploitation when a company or factory management pays them a bribe. These complaints had recently become fairly regular,” said an official, adding that the ACB learnt that money was collected in the Karauli district by the labour inspector which was eventually delivered to a top-ranking official in Jaipur. ACB officials had begun close surveillance which further confirmed their suspicion that money collected from Karauli was heading to Jaipur. Officials said that Jhajharia’s arrest may just be the tip of the iceberg. “We are probing the involvement of Karauli labour inspector since the money was collected from that district,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/top-labour-officer-2-others-arrested-by-acb-while-taking-rs-3l-as-bribe/articleshow/83858322.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Give plan about doorstep vaccine for disabled: Bombay high court||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has issued directives asking state health secretary as well as the union government to file an affidavit giving out details of the plan to vaccinate people with disabilities. A 40-year old completely blind lawyer Sachin Chavan from Latur has filed the PIL through lawyer Swapnil Tawshikar, raising the issue of difficulties faced by visually impaired persons as well as other disabled. The petitioner has pleaded that ‘persons with physical disabilities should get priority in vaccination, including inoculation services at doorstep”. The petition also seeks financial assistance for such disabled people, who have lost their livelihood due to the pandemic and frequent lockdowns. The division bench of HC comprising Justice SV Gangapurwala and MG Sewlikar, after going through the affidavit filed by Aurangabad region’s deputy director of health services, observed ‘in the affidavit, we do not find the details viz the data with regard to the number of the differently abled persons tested/vaccinated/treated. It should not be difficult for the state to collect the said data. The Union has also not filed the affidavit as yet with regard to the claim made in the Public Interest Litigation.’ Assistant solicitor general AG Talhar, while representing the union, assured the HC that the union government will file the affidavit by next date. The HC while asking principal secretary of the state health department to file the affidavit, observed that ‘We also do not find that the affidavit on record sets out the details of plan of action within the limitation of the state’s power, to secure the interest of persons with disabilities in consonance with the mandate of 2016 Act.’ On the request of lawyer Tawshikar, HC has allowed adding commissioner disabilities as well as National Disaster Management Authority as parties to the PIL. During the earlier hearing, HC directed that health authorities to file affidavit by June 23, indicating the details of drives which have been initiated for the purpose of testing, vaccination and treatment of persons with disabilities, number of such persons who have been tested/vaccinated/treated in terms of office memorandum dated April 26, and the circulars referred to in the said order. The State was also directed to file affidavit detailing the plan of action, within the limitation of the State’s power, to secure the interest of persons with disabilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/give-plan-about-doorstep-vax-for-disabled-hc/articleshow/83849070.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur seeks 50,000 doses of vaccine daily||KOLHAPUR: Collector Daulat Desai has sought daily 50,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine for Kolhapur district to ensure smooth conduct of immunization drive. The district, which was at top of the vaccination chart in the state, is currently lagging in the drive due to shortage of doses. The district is yet to re-start vaccination for beneficiaries in the 18 to 44 age group. With the available doses, the district administration is currently focusing on vaccinating citizens above 45 years of age, especially comorbid ones. The vaccination of such citizens, too, has been slowed down due to vaccine crisis. Around ten days ago, during a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state health minister Rajesh Tope, the district administration authorities had demanded vaccines based on the positivity rate. They said that the positivity rate of Kolhapur district is quite high and vaccination is the only key to avoid high mortality rate. Desai said, "The district has always been at the forefront in terms of vaccination. However, in the last few days, the district is getting less supply of vaccines. I have written to chief secretary of health department Pradip Vyas to daily provide 50,000 doses of vaccines for Kolhapur district." The district has over 200 vaccination centres. These centres have been opened in the far-flung sub-centres of health care system. Also, the administration has taken up the task to vaccinate other priority groups such as people with disabilities and students going abroad. "I have asked vaccination authorities to focus on completing the second dose of the frontline and health care workers," said Desai. Meanwhile, around 250 doses of Sputnik V vaccine have arrived at a multispeciality private hospital in Kolhapur city. Only the employees of the company marketing the Russia-made vaccine are eligible to get it and soon it will be rolled out for public at large, a top official of the hospital said. The Sputnik V vaccine is a two-dose vaccine and is made available in ampoule and not in vials like other vaccines. One ampoule serves one dose unlike vials which serve up to ten doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-seeks-50k-doses-of-vax-daily/articleshow/83849120.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: MC Josephine stepped down, not removed, says A Vijayaraghavan||T’PURAM/KOTTAYAM: CPM acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan here on Friday said Women’s Commission chairperson M C Josephine was not removed from the post by CPM. She stepped down from the post after she expressed her willingness to quit the post and the party accepted it, he said. “Josephine is a leader who generally intervenes in women’s issues and stands for the protection of their rights. But a comment she made during a television programme has not gone down well with the general public. She has also expressed regret. The party state secretariat discussed the issue. She explained her part and expressed willingness to resign. The party accepted it,” Vijayaraghavan told reporters at AKG Centre here on Friday. Vijayaraghavan refused to say whether or not the party asked Josephine to relinquish the post after her crude and unsavoury reaction to a woman who spoke to her during a live television programme on domestic violence and harassment against women. “I have clearly said that Josephine has expressed willingness to resign and the party secretariat approved of the same. It’s very clear. People can very well understand what I said. There is enough clarity in that,” he said. On whether the party would take further action against Josephine for her insensitive comments that put the government in defence, Vijayaraghavan said that the issue was over with her resignation. Vijayaraghavan said that CPM would run a house campaign from July 1 to 7 to sensitize people on the rise in domestic violence and atrocities against women. Opposition welcomes moveMeanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan hailed Josephine’s decision to quit the women’s commission chief post as proper, but said that it should have been done earlier. “Women’s commission is expected to infuse self-confidence in women. However, the words by Josephine ruined the credibility of the commission. Even after that, a few people tried to justify her,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/josephine-stepped-down-not-removed-vijayaraghavan/articleshow/83851193.cms||---

Initiated by the member of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board and chief of Islamic Centre of India (ICI), Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahli, the announcements, started after Friday prayers, will continue to spread awareness on the need to stay vigilant against new strains of coronavirus and the importance of vaccination. “New strains of the virus are being reported in the country and vaccination is the only way to stay safe against the disease. Not just our family, we should also motivate our friends and acquaintances to get vaccinated quickly,” said the cleric, who is also the Imam of Aishbagh Eidgah. An audio message in the cleric’s voice has been recorded and circulated among different mosques of the city to ramp up sensitization programme. During Ramzan last year, when the country was under lockdown, a similar activity was carried out by the ICI where a mobile audio announcement unit made rounds of the Old City areas asking people to follow Covid guidelines. The ICI premises in Aishbagh Eidgah was also the first religious place in the city to double up as a vaccination centre in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vaccine-awareness-messages-follow-fri-prayers-at-mosques/articleshow/83858295.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Technician blackmails couple using intimate CCTV clips, arrested||NEW DELHI: When 30-year-old Rohit Bhalla (name changed) hired a technician to repair CCTV cameras at home, he had little idea about the horror he and his wife would have to live through soon. Bhalla, who lives in south Delhi, works as a consultant at a private firm while his wife is employed with a multinational company. The couple recently had a daughter, and as they resumed work after paternity and maternity leaves, a nanny was hired to take care of the baby. They had got CCTV cameras installed to cover the entire house. A few months ago, the cameras had stopped working following which the technician was called. A few weeks later, Bhalla was shocked to receive CCTV clips showing him and his wife at an intimate moment. It was followed by a call in which a man demanded money for not releasing the clips on social media and pornography sites. Shocked, Bhalla initially made some payments and asked for the clips to be deleted. However, the demands kept increasing. After the caller demanded an immediate payment of Rs 3 lakh, the couple decided to approach the cops. Delhi Police analysed the details of the phone number from which the calls were made. The IP addresses were scanned and the victim was interviewed for clues. Finally, police zeroed in on the technician, Mohammed Rashid, and tracked him to Bengaluru. Rashid told the cops that he had taken the access of the cameras during the repair and diverted the feeds to his phone. He had made around 100 objectionable clips of the couple, of which around 80 were found on his phone. Rashid, from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, earlier worked at a firm in Delhi, but recently shifted to Bengaluru and started blackmailing the couple. Cautioning people against such crooks, the cops have advised people to get CCTVs at home repaired only through authorised service personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/technician-blackmails-couple-using-intimate-cctv-clips-arrested/articleshow/83854710.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Covid-hit Hyderabad cabbies lose 45,000 cars, struggle to make ends meet||HYDERABAD: A year ago, Gyaneshwar B was zipping across the streets of Hyderabad in his new sedan cab earning enough for his family before the Covid-19 pandemic shattered his dreams of decent city life. Road Transport Authority officials and the taxi associations confirm that an estimated 40,000-45,000 cab drivers have lost their vehicles due to the Covid-induced lockdowns. “The situation is such that during the last four weeks, 97 cabbies lost their vehicles for defaulting on loans, many of whom were recovering from Covid-19 when the recovery agents came knocking. We have verified this while we are now in the process of drawing a comprehensive list of all cab drivers who lost their vehicles since the pandemic,” said one senior official. “Across the state, easily 80,000 cab drivers lost their vehicles,” added Shaik Salauddin, founder state president, Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union. Now, Gyaneshwar is often sighted at the Neredmet crossroads selling bananas to eke out a living after his cab was seized by the bank for defaulting on three instalments of loan repayment. “I had taken Rs 2.5 lakh loan for down payment and paid 13 instalments, but it has all gone down the drain. Now I am so much in debt that I can’t even think of paying Rs 75000 to get my vehicle back,” Gyaneshwar said. From driving their newly-purchased cab one day to cleaning up lorries and rearing cattle in a remote village, life has taken an ugly turn for many cabbies in the city. Their fortunes took a dip after the onset of the pandemic with many going through a long phase of no income, defaulting on loan payments and neck-deep debt. Another such victim happens to be Raju Yadav. After earning a decent living for two years, 45-year-old Raju Yadav shifted to his ancestral home in a remote village in Husnabad to rear goats. “There was no work due to Covid-19 and no one was ready to give me work as a personal driver too. I couldn’t feed my family and had defaulted on loan instalments for three months. The bank seized my cab and slapped a case against me. I was unable to pay the rent, leave alone fighting the case, so I shifted to my village along with my five-member family,” he said. Cab drivers have been one of the worst-hit during the pandemic with recovery agents not even ready to give two weeks’ time to families of drivers who fell to Covid-19. Another cabbie attempted suicide, while there are others who succumbed to Covid-19 leaving behind widows who are now haggling with banks to get some more time. “After my husband’s death, two months of EMI is pending. I don’t have money to pay and they are saying if you don’t pay we will take the vehicle and recover the remaining amount by selling it,” said 33-year-old Bhavani Taraka, who has a two-year-old kid and elderly parents to look after. “I am hoping to clear the loan, sell the vehicle and start a kirana shop,” added Bhavani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-hit-city-cabbies-lose-45k-cars-struggle-to-make-ends-meet/articleshow/83860181.cms||Amrita Didyala

Two of the friends of the accused were also arrested by the police. According to the police, the accused were returning home after attending a function in the city. However, the Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) test was not conducted as he was arrested more than 24 hours after the accident had taken place. The main accused, Mohammed Adil, 20, a student from Jahangir Nagar in Talabkatta along with his friends, had gone out on a joyride in a high-end car from Jahangir Nagar. While returning home, at 6.40 pm, Adil lost control over the vehicle and hit an autorickshaw, two bikes and a pedestrian near Rajesh Medical Hall in Shalibanda. M Salamma, 40, died in the accident while auto driver Mohammed Salauddin, an MBA student Ch Karthik and catering worker Yeshwant suffered injuries. While escaping from the accident spot, the car driven by Adil hit another pedestrian, Mohammed Khasim at Moghalpura. After reaching home, Adil parked the car and fled along with his two friends Althaf of Talabkatta and a minor. Adil has been arrested along with two of his friends from Shaheen Nagar area in Old City on Friday.  “Adil has driving license. The youngsters had attended a function on Wednesday but claimed they did not consume liquor. As they were arrested almost a day later after the accident, we did not conduct blood alcohol test. A case was registered under relevant sections of the IPC. The accused were also booked under Section 179 of the MV Act for not stopping the car when a traffic constable asked him to,” south zone DCP Gajarao Bhupal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-accused-held-in-hit-and-run-case/articleshow/83854735.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Curbs for Kolhapur to be finalised today||KOLHAPUR: The decision to fix the level of restrictions for Kolhapur district will be taken on Saturday. District collector Daulat Desai said that the administration will study the new state government order regarding the level of restrictions in the meeting on Saturday. The government order states that the weekly positivity rate will be determined by RT-PCR test results only and it will be considered for relaxation of restrictions. Over the past few days, the district had ramped up antigen tests. Over 70,000 antigen tests were carried out in the district. The government has instructed that the positivity rate for last two weeks must be considered, not just for one week, to get one level down from existing level. This could probe a problem for the authorities, who are facing backlash of traders. If the positivity rate for two weeks is to be considered, then the average effective positivity rate for Kolhapur district is expected to remain above 10%. This could put Kolhapur district in Level 4 Covid restrictions for another week. Minister Hasan Mushrif said he understands the traders’ pain due to closure of shops. “However, saving lives is more important. Kolhapur district has 9,000 active cases. The testing has been increased; however, it may led to further rise in positivity rate. We are trying to get as many vaccine doses as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/curbs-for-kolhapur-to-be-finalised-today/articleshow/83849156.cms||---

The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine —NVX-CoV2373 — developed by American biotechnology firm Novavax has been branded as Covovax in India. It will be the fourth Covid-19 vaccine to undergo clinical trials for children in India. SII, partnering with Novavax, expects to launch Covovax for adults in India by September and for children by the end of this year. “We plan to begin the paediatric trials in 920 children across 10 sites next month after seeking permission from the DCGI (Drug Controller General of India),” SII’s owner and chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla told TOI. Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch in Pune are among the10 sites where the children will undergo advanced trials. They would be followed up for six months after inoculating with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart. Read AlsoVaccine shortages compounded by component shortagesA shortage of key components used in the manufacture of vaccines — such as large plastic growbags and filters — is hampering a full-scale vaccine rollout across the world. Growbags are large containers in which vaccine cells are grown, after which they are poured out and filtered — the filters usedAccording to the trial design, enrolment of children in the 12-17 age group would be done first, followed by the 2-11 age group, Poonawalla said. “We shall commence the trials in the reverse order of age. Children in the 12-17 age group will be given the shots first and later the 2-11 age group,” he said. SII will submit the interim trial findings on safety and immunogenicity after three months of the advanced clinical trial for licensure. According to the latest guidelines of the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), the company can apply for a licence of the vaccine before the completion of the trials, based on the global test results.

Healthy volunteers will receive two doses of Covovax 21 days apart. Seven days after the first dose for 25 participants (12-17 age group), safety data would be reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Based on its recommendation, the study would progress by recruiting the remaining participants. The same process would be repeated for the 2-11 age group. Read AlsoIndia is the world’s largest producer of vaccines. So why a shortage today?Various reasons, such as the Centre not ordering vaccines on time, haggling over the price, a shortage of ingredients required in the manufacture and export restrictions from sourcing countries may have brought us to this pointNiti Aayog (health) member V K Paul said during the briefing of the health ministry on Friday, “We have to understand that the child cohort is not a small one. My rough guess is that if it is between 12 to 18 years, this itself is about 13 to 14 crore population, for which we will need about 25-26 crore doses. We can’t have some getting the vaccine and others not. We will have to take this into account when we strategize and make a decision based on how many doses of which vaccines are available.” Covid-19 vaccine makers are conducting trials for children at a fast pace. An approved candidate vaccine for kids is likely by September-October. In the US, Pfizer’s Covid vaccine has been approved for use in children as young as 12 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sii-to-start-covovax-trials-on-920-children-in-india-in-july/articleshow/83854706.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Attempt to encroach Ranthambore forest land unearthed by department||JAIPUR: Ranthambore forest authorities have found unscrupulous villagers from surrounding areas encroaching and farming on tiger reserve land. According to sources, there is an ongoing attempt to encroach 250-300 bighas of land in the Khandoj area of RNP. Trees have allegedly been cleared in the area using earth-moving machines. “This is the largest attempt to encroach recorded to date in Ranthambore. This has created disturbance in the tiger habitat as tigress T-102 had given birth to her cubs in this area. Due to anthropogenic pressure and human disturbance, the cubs have moved to another part,” sources said. The encroachment was started for agricultural activities by villagers living on the periphery of the park. The village had gained notoriety in the past for attacking forest officials. DFO Mahendra Sharma said, “After the matter was brought to our notice, forest and police teams were pressed into action. A case will be registered against people who attempted to encroach the land. Last year in August, the villagers tried to encroach the land. However, because of timely action by our team, their efforts failed.” While Sharma admitted the attempt to encroach forest land, he refuted the claim that it came to 250-300 bighas. “We have sought a report and the land chunk size is not more than 25 bighas. Moreover, tigress T-102 has never inhabited that area as claimed,” he said. Sources further claimed that the area was a crucial area and could be turned into an additional tourism zone. Green activist Tapeshwar Singh Bhati alleged that officials did not follow the various laws that gave right to state governments to evict encroachments, including the Indian Forest Act, 1927; Wild Life Protection Act, 1972; and Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. ”A strong political and bureaucratic will is required to remove encroachments from the tiger reserve. The forest department should take strict action to discourage such activities as there would be huge impact on the tiger reserve if they let land to be encroached by villagers,” Bhati said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/attempt-to-encroach-rbore-forest-land-unearthed-by-dept/articleshow/83858354.cms||---

In a press conference, Singh asked why investigation agencies have not started a probe into the alleged scam. Singh said the BJP-led central government was silent on the “scam” in Ayodhya land deals. He alleged that the “scam has been carried out by the leaders of the BJP and the members of the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust”. “Today, the PM convened a meeting with the members of the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust working for the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya. I want to ask the PM, did you ask them why they failed to pay the dues for the construction of the temple yet? The construction work has halted due to the corruption carried out by the BJP in alliance with the trust day and night,” Singh claimed in the press conference. AAP recently alleged that a piece of land for the construction of the temple was bought at an inflated rate, which benefitted some individuals. “I have written a letter to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and have asked for time to meet him. I will hand over all documents as proof of the scam related to land and corruption by the BJP and the members of the trust to him. I would like the RSS head, who claims himself to be the upholder of Hindutva, to take note of it and objectively answer the questions. Crores of Ram bhakts cannot be cheated, their faith cannot be injured,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/temple-land-row-aap-mp-writes-to-rss-chief/articleshow/83879530.cms||---

Pangri village is in the vicinity of Gopinathgadh of Parli, the constituency represented by social justice and special assistance department minister Dhananjay Munde in the Assembly, in Beed district. Video clips and photographs of the women bringing the drivers down from the vehicles and hitting them with footwear for refusing to sweep the roads went viral on various social media platforms. The drivers of the trucks subsequently gave in to their demand and cleaned up the road with their shirts. Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) records revealed that the Parli Thermal Power Station has a capacity of 1,170 MW and generates 7,55,167 tonnes of ash a year. Every day, hundreds of heavy vehicles loaded with fly ash ply through the streets of Parli, spilling ash all over the streets. Villagers living along the roads have been complaining for long that the fly ash reduces visibility in the area. Beed is one of the largest fly ash brick markets in the country. Parli rural police station assistant inspector Maruti Munde told TOI, “The issue needs attention from pollution control authorities. Residents of villages and towns on Beed, Ahmedpur and Ambajogai roads are among the worst sufferers.” Local residents claimed that despite written representations to the administration, there has not been any change on the ground. “We have not been able to keep the doors and windows of our houses open. we are forced to continuously clean and sweep our houses to remove the layers of fly ash,” said Vimal Nagargoje, a local resident. Another woman said it’s difficult to breathe because of the large amount of fly ash in the air. “The worst sufferers are children and the senior citizens. We have been compelled to take the measure. If the issue is not addressed, we will not allow movement of heavy vehicles carrying fly ash,” said Arti Munde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/women-intercept-trucks-with-ash-from-power-plant-make-drivers-sweep-streets/articleshow/83849224.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Lucknow||Aryabhatta, Brahmagupta to be part of Lucknow University science course||LUCKNOW: Ancient Indian scientists and their discoveries will be taught in undergraduate courses of Lucknow University from the new academic session. As suggested in the New Education Policy 2020, science students will learn about how a number of scientific concepts taught today were given by Indian mathematicians, botanists, physicists and astronomers centuries ago. The nine science departments are busy drafting a curriculum for the four-year undergraduate course that is a mix of modern and traditional concepts. The physics department has already finalized the syllabus that offers knowledge of both modern and ancient scientific concepts. “In the first year of the UG course, we have introduced a section that will completely be devoted to ancient Indian scientists like Baudhayan, Aryabhatta, Brahmagupta, Bhaskaracharya and ancient texts and geometry. It is for the first time in physics that we will teach about them. The aim is to make students feel proud of their country and let the world know about our glorious past through our students,” said head of the physics department and dean student welfare Prof Poonam Tandon. She also mentioned some of the ancient concepts proposed to be taught at UG level. These include Surya Siddhanta, which describes rules to calculate the motion of various planets, the moon and the orbits of various astronomical bodies and Aryabhatiyam, a Sanskrit astronomical treatise which is the magnum opus and the only known surviving work of 5th-century Indian mathematician Aryabhatta. These will be taught along with modern concepts like nanotechnology, fibre optics, computer simulation, plasma and space science, which offer high employability, Tandon said. “We have introduced this in the first year of the course so that even if a UG student leaves a course after taking a certificate, he or she has both modern and traditional scientific knowledge,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aryabhatta-brahmagupta-to-be-part-of-lu-science-course/articleshow/83858362.cms||---

The former Indian captain hit back. “I put John Manoj to establish the position of ‘interim president’ in the HCA rules and regulations 2018. I once again reiterate and wish to put John Manoj and all concerned on notice that all these meetings are illegal and in violation of the HCA rules and regulations that govern the functioning of the Apex council,” Azhar told TOI on Friday and added, “You (Manoj) are requested to desist from performing any actions that are in violation of the HCA rules and regulations.” Manoj said he has nothing against Azharuddin but the administration cannot come to a standstill. “The members on Thursday decided to make me the president and I took charge today. I have also called for an ‘Emergent Apex council meeting on Sunday to discuss various issues,” he told TOI. “Azharuddin says everything is illegal but we just cannot sit back and do nothing. The cricket season has to start and a few decisions are pending. I have taken charge to ensure that everything runs smoothly in the association. We will strictly go by the rule book.

---||Lucknow||Delta variant could have been rampant in Uttar Pradesh during second wave, says report||LUCKNOW: Nine of 10 people testing positive for coronavirus infection in Uttar Pradesh during the second wave could have been infested with the Delta variant. The finding was officially released during a presentation made by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) on Friday. A conglomerate of 28 laboratories brought together by the Union health minister and department of biotechnology with the Council for Scientific Research and Indian Council of Medical Research, INSACOG was formed in January 2020 to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2. It also works to correlate whole genomics sequencing data with clinical/epidemiological data for advance preparedness for public health interventions and better understanding of disease transmission, clinical severity, re-infections/immune escape, vaccine efficacy and available diagnostics tests. The INSACOG data sheet for Indian states indicated that of 355 samples from UP, 327 were of Delta type while the remaining 27 were of alpha type (associated with first wave). INSACOG is of the view that lack of adherence to appropriate Covid-19 behaviour aids and accelerates viral mutation through random replication and immune pressure of the virus besides strengthening it in general. In fact, this is what is being seen as the reason for growth and mass spread of Delta variant. “Mutations act in advantage of the virus and impact human health. The outcomes include clustering of infections, increased transmission, immune escape capability, neutralization escape from monoclonals, improved binding to lung cells and increased severity of infection,” explained a microbiologist at SGPGI. On what makes Delta a variant of concern, experts said that variants are characterised by mutations or alterations in the virus’s genetic material. An RNA virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, is made of about 30,000 base pairs of amino acids, placed like bricks next to each other. An alteration in any of these pairs causes a mutation, effectively changing the shape and behaviour of the virus. Delta variant contains multiple mutations in the spike protein and at least four mutations have been identified. Viral mutations alter behaviours which appear as changes in disease presentation, making diagnosis tougher. Besides having an impact on diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, the mutated strain of Delta is known for increased transmissibility, stronger binding to the receptors of the lung cells, potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response and potential post- vaccination immune escape, explained an MHA official. Experts, however, believe that data is too limited to speak with confidence for a state like Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/delta-variant-could-have-been-rampant-in-up-during-second-wave-says-report/articleshow/83858385.cms||Shailvee Sharda

In June 2020, ZACL, the flagship company of the Adventz Group, announced its intention to sell its Goa-based fertiliser plant to sister concern Paradeep Phosphates for $280 million or around Rs 2,135 crore. The proposed combination envisages acquisition of the Zuarinagar plant and as a result of the acquisition, Paradeep Phosphates shall acquire the business of developing and manufacturing urea and non-urea fertiliser products presently being carried out by ZACL at the Zuarinagar plant. Paradeep Phosphates is also part of the Adventz Group and manufactures non-urea fertilisers, namely, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and NPK fertilizers. It also imports and sells muriate of potash (MoP).  Shut for maintenance and repairs after Cyclone Tauktae, ZACL has resumed production at its ammonia and urea plants in Zuarinagar from June 13. An extra-ordinary general meeting scheduled on June 23 to discuss concerns raised by a minority group of shareholders was cancelled after the required quorum could not be met. A group of ZACL shareholders had questioned the transfer of the Zuarinagar plant and had even threatened to file a petition before the National Company Law Tribunal in order to stall the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/paradeep-phosphates-set-to-acquire-zuaris-fertiliser-plant/articleshow/83858390.cms||---

This was the outcome of the new order issued by the state government considering the cases of Delta-plus variant found in some districts. Following the directives of the state, all districts in Vidarbha are now taking cautious steps towards the unlock. Akola was the first district to announce the comeback of the Level 3 restrictions in Vidarbha.

Justice K Haripal granted anticipatory bail to 31-year-old Abhilash R Chandran of Umbernadu in Mavelikkara, who is on probation and deputed to Kochi Metro. He is presently under suspension. The court said custodial interrogation is not required in the case and that, prima facie, it does not seem that anything requires to be elicited by his custodial interrogation. Prosecution has no case that he will flee from justice, the court added. However, the court said it is unfortunate that medical officers and health workers have to suffer such indignation that go to the extent of suffering physical and verbal assault. But such isolated incidents cannot be generalized, the court said, while noting that the incident occurred in a charged atmosphere. Even if there was negligence, it cannot be addressed by showing muscle power and manhandling the doctor in charge, the court said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-cop-who-thrashed-doctor/articleshow/83851263.cms||---

As many as 90 persons, including representatives of various firms and developers, participated in the pre-bid meeting. The meeting was held both in physical mode (in the morning session) and virtual mode (afternoon) for the benefit of people and firms outside Hyderabad. While 56 persons took part in the physical meeting, 36 participated in the virtual mode meeting. The government notified auctioning of 65 acres at Neopolis and Golden Mile projects at Kokapet and Khanamet. Of the total land, 49 acres belong to the HMDA. The e-auction of the plots will be held on July 15. Addressing prospective bidders in the pre-bidding meeting held in the Financial district, HMDA metropolitan commissioner and principal secretary of municipal administration and urban development Arvind Kumar said the HMDA’s layout Neopolis would be the first greenfield project in the country. For the benefit of the bidders, the land has been earmarked as a multi-use zone where the land can be used for residential, commercial, office space and even for recreational purposes. “The layout has good infrastructure with a 100 ft road, underground electric cables, special water pipeline for the layout from Kollur by allocating nine acres for construction of a pump house. A sub-station with 400 kV capacity has been planned in 5.3 acres to meet power requirements of the layout,” Arvind Kumar said. As Kokapet is emerging as one of the fastest growing areas, plans are afoot to reach the layout directly from the outer ring road, he said. This would be useful for people working and residing in multi-storey buildings that will come up in the layout, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pre-bid-meeting-on-kokapet-land-sale-conducted-power-sub-station-planned/articleshow/83855011.cms||Koride Mahesh

Fatorda PI Kapil Nayak said that the police were trying to verify the copies of sale deeds produced before the mamlatdar for effecting mutation entries with those registered with the Salcete sub-registrar. “Besides, as some of these files have gone missing from the mamlatdar office, we are conducting some prior checks before registering the complaint. The offence will be booked in day or two,” Nayak told TOI. The offences were committed between 2018 and 2019 and came to light a few months ago after the original landowners applied for information under the RTI Act pertaining to the mutation cases, as they maintained that they had not sold their properties in question to anybody. The complaint pertains to mutation cases involving 11 properties, two of which had mutations carried out twice within a short time. The mutations in the above cases were carried out before the incumbent mamlatdar Gaonkar, the complainant in the case, who took assumed office in February 2019. Records accessed by TOI reveal that the properties in question are located at various places across Salcete – three in Curtorim, two each in Cuncolim, Davorlim and Raia, and one each in Dramapur, Sao Jose de Areal, Utorda and Gaundaulim. The size of the properties ranges from 40,000sq m to several lakh sq m, valuation of which could run into crores of rupees, sources said. When the original land owners realised that they were victims of the land-grab scam, they appealed against the mutations carried out before the court of the deputy collector. Following conclusion of the proceedings in some of the cases, five of the properties in question were reverted to the original landowners, sources said. A victim of the alleged scam TOI spoke to said that in some of the 13 cases in question, mutations were done by bypassing the procedure. Sources familiar with police investigations in earlier land-grab scams said the modus operandi of the fraudsters entailed targeting properties whose original owners were dead and whose kin had migrated overseas or hadn’t cared to look after the ancestral properties. In the current case pertaining to a property in Curtorim, a sale deed was fraudulently executed, impersonating the landowner who had died years ago. The fraud came to light when the heirs, after executing a succession deed, applied for mutation only to realise that the land ownership records were fraudulently changed. Sources said that in several cases, the sale deeds were not registered with the sub-registrar’s office, while in other cases, though the documents were found to be registered, copies submitted for mutation were manipulated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fake-sale-deeds-properties-worth-crores-of-rupees-spread-across-salcete/articleshow/83858444.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The incident occurred in the Civil Lines area of Bareilly on Friday and a purported video has gone viral.  Rajesh Rathore, who works with the telecom department of Indian Railways, has been admitted to a private hospital. Inspector general (Bareilly range) Ramit Sharma along with SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan and additional SP (city) Ravindra Kumar rushed to the spot and carried out an investigation. Rajesh’s wife Priyanka told TOI, “My husband had gone to the Bank of Baroda branch where he holds his account to update his passbook. He was not wearing a mask and was denied entry. After some time, he returned with a mask, but the same guard again denied him entry, saying it was lunch time. It was 11.30 am then. He then pushed my husband and shot him with his gun. No one at the bank helped my husband who made a call on my daughter’s mobile phone and informed us about the incident. I rushed to the bank where my husband was lying on the floor while none of the bank officials bothered to help him. I took him to hospital in an e-rickshaw.” Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said, “After scanning all the CCTV footage and probing the matter, we found that after an altercation over the ‘face mask’, the guard lost his cool and shot Rajesh in his left thigh. The guard has been booked under section 307 (attempt to murder) and sent to jail. Police scanning CCTV footage of the incidentIn a statement issued later in the day, the Bank of Baroda said, “We deeply regret the unfortunate firing incident that took place at Station Road branch, Bareilly, today as a result of a reported altercation between the guard and the victim. The injured has been immediately admitted in the district hospital and is reportedly out of danger. The bank has extended every support (financial and otherwise) to the aggrieved family. The guard, who was deployed by a private security agency, has been immediately relieved of his duties and has also been arrested by the police. The bank is working with the police authorities in their investigations. We are also conducting an internal investigation through the Bank's security officials in order to ensure that any such incident does not happen in future and customer safety is always ensured.” Later, members of Northern Railway Mazdoor Union (NRMU) also reached the bank and demanded strict action in this case. Union’s leader Musarrat Khan said, “Rajesh is a dedicated employee of Indian Railways. The guard deliberately misbehaved with him even when he returned to the bank with a mask.” Watch UP: Railway employee allegedly shot after argument over 'face mask'||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/trigger-happy-security-guard-at-bank-shoots-rly-employee-in-leg-for-not-wearing-face-mask/articleshow/83849397.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

This is the second FIR registered against the builder in a week. The Jalna police said the 41-year-old businessman Gopal Goyal was allegedly lured to invest Rs 1.5 crore in a real-estate scheme floated by the builders and he was assured of Rs 5 crore by way of interest. After the builder failed to fulfil the promise, Goyal started taking follow up with them for seeking the assured amount but in vain. The suspects later settled the matter with Goyal and assured to pay him Rs 3 crore and issued him four cheques of varying amounts. On Goyal’s FIR, the Chandanzira police in Jalna town has booked the builder on the charge relating to cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal intimidation under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, 1999 (MPID Act). Additional superintendent of Jalna police Vikrant Deshmukh, while citing content of the complaint, said, “The businessman Goyal was given two cheques each of Rs 50 lakh payable on March 31, and two more cheques of Rs one crore and Rs 1.13 crore payable on July 17.” Inspector Yashwant Jadhav from Chandanzira police said after Goyal visited the bank and deposited the cheques on March 31, the cheques were dishonoured due to technical reason ‘payment stopped by drawer’. “Goyal realised that he was duped by the builders,” Jadhav added. A police officer privy to the investigations said that the Jalna police will move an application before the special court in Pune to seek custody of Amit Lunkad, who is judicial custody remand after being arrested by Pune’s economic offences wing for allegedly duping the complainant a Katraj resident and 38 others investors to the tune of Rs 48 crores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jalna-cops-book-pune-builder-for-duping-bizman/articleshow/83849353.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Banerjee and Ghatak had dismissed the allegations and moved the SC alleging that the HC was not accepting their affidavits, thus violating the principles of natural justice.Neither the CM nor the law minister is an accused in the Narada case. For the CBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the bench that the HC had issued notices to all respondents on the agency’s petition on May 27 in the presence of Bengal’s advocate general and that the arguments commenced on a day to day basis from May 31. Mehta said that by June 9, the arguments of the CBI and all accused were completed before the HC.The bench told senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the CM and the law minister, that since the arguments had started and were at an advanced stage without the respondents seeking leave to file counter affidavits, the HC could have formed a prima facie view that the two respondents were either not interested in filing responses or had waived their right to do so.“But this can be resolved without much argument. As fairly submitted by Mehta, the petitioners can move the Calcutta HC with fresh applications requesting the affidavits be taken on record and we will set aside the HC’s June 9 refusal order. The HC will hear the applications de novo and take a decision,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/accept-cm-state-law-mins-fresh-pleas-sc-to-cal-hc/articleshow/83858449.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Officials from the Tuticorin district administration sought help from the Pudukottai district administration to quiz the boy’s parents. Preliminary inquiry by the Childline revealed that the boy hails from Selatur village near Aranthangi. Three months ago he was brought to the house of H Hariraj, 40, a shepherd near Ettayapuram. He told the villagers that he is his son. Hariraj took the boy to take care of his 150 sheep. On Tuesday, the villagers found him crying and upon inquiry, they found that he was beaten up by Hariraj’s 10-year-old son. When they asked the son, he revealed that his father bought the boy for Rs 5,000 through a man hailing from Ramanathapuram district. Alerted by the villagers, the boy was rescued and produced before the child welfare committee and taken to a home. The rescuers came to know the role of Ganesan, a middleman from Ramanathapuram. Ganesan shared the details of the boy’s parents and distanced himself. The boy’s parents who came to Tuticorin claimed that they did not sell the boy and did not suspect that he was engaged as a bonded labourer. They also claimed that they spoke with him regularly over phone facilitated by Ganesan. Police said that a case is yet to be registered. As the issue was taken to the notice of the district collector, he ordered a probe. Officials said that a probe will be conducted by the Pudukottai DCPO and police with the boy’s family to identify the culprits and ascertain the role of his parents, Ganesan, Hariraj and others before a complaint is lodged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/boy-7-forced-into-child-labour-rescued/articleshow/83851306.cms||---

The bench directed the Ayodhya DM as well as the SDM concerned, and tehsildar to appear before it on June 29 through video-conferencing to explain their factual version on the allegations levelled against them in the petition. A bench of justice Rajan Roy and Justice Saurabh Lavania passed the order on the writ petition filed by Panchram Prajapati and others. The petitioners alleged in the petition that their land was being forcibly taken without acquisition or without their consent. The bench has asked the officers concerned to explain the criteria on the basis of which the land was being taken from the locals in bulk for construction of Airport. "If the land of the petitioners has not been acquired, they cannot and would not be compelled to sell their land unless they consent to it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/explain-criteria-for-acquisition-of-land-for-ayodhya-airport-hc/articleshow/83858454.cms||---

Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup ordered notice to the accused cops in the criminal revision petition filed by the CBI challenging the order of the first additional district court at Madurai. In the petition, the CBI had stated that on March 10, the trial court said that there was no material available to frame charges under Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC against all the accused. Charges were framed under IPC Section 342 (2 counts) against A1 to A9, Section 201 against A1 to A7 and A9, Section 182 against A4, 193 against A3, Section 211 and 218 against A3 and A4, Section 302 (murder) r/w 34 (2 counts) of IPC against A1 to A7 and A9 and Section 302 r/w 109 of IPC against A8. The CBI had stated that charges were not framed under sections 182, 193, 211, 218 of IPC for two counts against A1, A3 and A6. Similarly, charges were not framed under sections 201, 302 r/w 34 of IPC for two counts against A8 and charges were not framed under Section 193 of IPC for two counts against A4. When a petition was filed by CBI before the trial court seeking to add the above offence, the same was dismissed on March 24, stating that if necessary, charges would be altered or added anytime before the pronouncement of the judgment. The CBI stated that charges have to be added or altered before the beginning of the trial since the present case is time bound as per the order of the HC Madurai bench and that too when the accused are police officials. Though sufficient materials and witness statements were available on record to prove the charges against the accused, the trial court had failed to consider the same. The CBI further stated that if the offences are not altered or ordered at the initial stage of the trial, it would cause prejudice to the case of the prosecution. Hence, the CBI sought to set aside the trial court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sathankulam-case-cbi-moves-hc-challenging-trial-court-order/articleshow/83851280.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||India||Oxygen audit of Delhi: Draft report was shared on May 30, response received next day||NEW DELHI: Before submitting the interim oxygen audit report of Delhi to the SC, the court-appointed panel sent the draft report to the Delhi government on May 30 and received principal secretary (home) Bhupinder S Bhalla's detailed response on May 31 suggesting changes and recording comments and objections, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The Centre filed its affidavit in the SC on June 22 with reports of the SC-appointed National Task Force, which expressed satisfaction with the manner in which the Centre allocated oxygen to states during the second wave. The central government’s counsel, G S Makker, had mailed the affidavit, along with reports of the NTF and the oxygen audit team, to Delhi government counsel Gautam Narain on June 22. The interim draft report said the actual consumption of oxygen in 183 hospitals in Delhi was only 209 MT (against a requirement estimate of over 1,140 MT by the Delhi government). To this, Bhalla, in his communication on May 31, had said the following should be added, "The revised data for 183 hospitals showed total actual oxygen consumption of 390 MT against 209 MT calculated earlier." The draft interim report of the panel headed by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria had said, "Lot of apprehensions were placed regarding the quality of data and collated data for oxygen requirement through drafted pro forma cannot be relied upon for arriving at requirement. Reliability of data is low because of error in calculation." Dr Sandeep Budhiraja of Max Hospital too sent in his one paragraph comment. He wanted the following paragraph to be added to the report, "After repeated corrections (as hospital medical superintendents used a different format), the total calculation of oxygen consumption (based on actual consumption data of 214 hospitals) came to be around 490 MT. This did not take into account oxygen cylinders refilling and non-Covid requirements of hospitals. It was suggested on the basis of actual consumption and not on the basis of formulae, the oxygen allocation for NCTD be kept at 500 MT (for May second/third week) and then reviewed twice weekly. In the last sub-group meeting, it was decided not to discuss this agenda in the sub-group as an oxygen commissioner would be taking decisions regarding oxygen allocation to states."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-audit-of-delhi-draft-report-was-shared-on-may-30-response-received-next-day/articleshow/83861471.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Parents against increased screen time for online classes||HYDERABAD: In the absence of guidelines to conduct online classes from the state, schools are said to be holding virtual classes for about six to seven hours daily. Even for primary students, classes are said to be conducted for about 4 hours. Parents demanded the state to release guidelines for online classes and implement them strictly. “My sons are in class 8 and class 6. The school is asking them both to attend seven periods every day. We have decided against taking these classes and instead make them study textbooks and material provided by the school,” said K Srujana, a parent. She said that it doesn’t make any sense to make children sit in front of screens for longer durations as it is going to do more harm than good. Parents said that schools should be asked to not conduct more than two to three periods every day. “They should instead send material or ask students to read a page or two from the textbooks to limit screen time,” said Lakshman B, a parent of class 5 student, adding that he is even encouraging his child to skip few classes and attend only those he is really interested in. Although the Union human resource department (HRD) ministry has issued guidelines on limiting screen time during the last academic year, they are not being strictly implemented in the state. As per the guidelines, schools should not conduct more than two sessions of 30-45 minutes duration for class 1 to class 8 students. For students in Classes 9-12, they can be part of up to four sessions a day of 30-45 minutes each day. Parents even took to Twitter to raise the issue. “Dear Telangana Education Department, please send guidelines to schools on online classes for primary class. 1st class students having 3.5 hrs online classes and then homework. Stress for children and parents with 5 subjects.,” tweeted Durga Prasad with handle @TheMdprasad to @SabithaindraTRS @TSEduDept, and@TelanganaCMO.

She was awestruck as her dad used to say she would be a ‘collector’ one day and here she was in front of a real collector. However, destiny has been cruel to the little girl who lost her father, Deepan, 47, about two months ago to Covid-19. She had come to the collectorate with her mother Sona Deepan to apply for the Rs 5 lakh government relief for children who lost a parent to Covid-19. Child Welfare Committee member B Pandiarajan said he saw the child looking upset at the collectorate. ``I asked her how she was as I could see she was depressed. She told me that she had seen the collector’s car outside and was reminded of her father, who had always told her she would be a collector one day,’’ he said. Pandiarajan communicated the child’s request to Dr Aneesh Sekhar and the girl was summoned to his office. ``When the collector asked her, she told him it was her wish to become a collector and fulfil her late father’s wish,’’ he said. The collector told her that she should work towards that goal, and that he too would like to see her in the very chair he was occupying now. He also made the officials give her a tour of the collectorate. Dita and her sister were brought up in Bangalore where her father worked in the IT industry, till they returned to their native Madurai during the first lockdown. She was enrolled in Mahatma Global School as she was enthusiastic and studious. Her family contracted Covid-19 when the second wave struck in March. Deepan was admitted to a private hospital but lost the battle after 30 days of hospitalisation on April 17. His two daughters and wife recovered in home isolation. Sona says Dita often gave ‘advice’ to her father on important matters so much so that Deepan used to say she was acting like a collector, and that she should strive to become one. Meanwhile, Child Welfare Committee has received applications from 75 children who lost a parent to Covid and is processing the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/collector-gives-pep-talk-to-girl-who-wants-to-be-like-him/articleshow/83851316.cms||---

We got to know that this issue comes under four departments and we will do a survey of the river in the next week with the officials of these departments and form a committee to find a solution to this issue,” Vaingankar said. At the meeting, a local, Praveen Asolkar, said the river has turned black due to lechate flowing from accumulated garbage and from the sewage water flowing from commercial establishments. He suggested that the sewage could be diverted to the sewerage treatment palnt at Acoi. Another local suggested that the mangroves on the banks of the river be trimmed to imprve the flow of water as dirt gets accumulated in them, emanating foul smell. President of Rashtriya Samaj Pakaha (RSP), Goa unit, Kishor Rao said that the water used for washing fish, meat and vegetables in the Mapusa market, is directly released into a gutter that connects to the Tar river. The river is also used for immersion of Ganesh idols, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panel-to-be-formed-over-tar-pollution-issue/articleshow/83858476.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Second year running: Restrictions bring down March-May pollution level in Kolkata||KOLKATA: In the March-May period last year as well as this year, the air pollution level in Kolkata recorded the sharpest dip against 2019 among the four most-polluted cities — Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai. Researchers compared the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) air quality data of these four cities over the three months in 2019 when there was no lockdown and 2020 when there was complete lockdown as well as 2021 when there were restrictions in these cities. Track the pollution level in your cityAn analysis by climate communications initiative ClimateTrends shows pollution levels remained above permissible limits in the cities of Lucknow and Delhi while Mumbai’s PM 2.5 concentration only increased year on year during the months of March, April and May from 2019 to 2021. Also part of the study was Kolkata, which was the only city to show the maximum improvement in air quality. The study revealed that except Mumbai, all cities showed a dip in the average PM 2.5 levels during the three months in 2020. Mumbai’s average concentration of PM2.5 between March to May in 2019 was 21.6µg/m3, which increased to 31.3µg/m3 in 2020 and 40.3µg/m3 this year. The safe limit for PM2.5 (particulate matter measuring less than 2.5 microns) as prescribed by the CPCB is 40µg/m3. Kolkata’s PM2.5 concentration swayed from 41.8µg/m3 in 2019 to 27.9µg/m3 in 2020 and 37.3µg/m3 in 2021. While there was a complete lockdown in 2020, the restrictions this year saw high movement of people seeking health-care facilities due to incre-ased Covid-19 cases and the state elections. “Lockdown-related reduction in air pollution is neither consistent nor uniform. Thus, the contribution of anthropogenic activities do not totally explain the high pollution level. Thus, we should stay alert about the continuing health hazards of high pollutant levels, especially in metropolitan cities. And this is not the right time to let the guards down,” said Society for Indoor Environment president Arun Sharma. Any relief from lockdown-resultant pollution levels cannot be rejoiced, felt experts. Since the unprecedented nationwide lockdown in 2020, experts have claimed that it gave them a first-ever opportunity to understand background pollution levels in India when the majority of the polluting sources were not at play. In 2020, out of the eight primary pollutant sources in India, four were completely closed during the lockdown period — construction and industrial activity, brick kilns and vehicles. Meanwhile, sources like household emissions, open burning, diesel generators and dust remained operational along with coal-fired thermal power plants at reduced capacity. CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research chief scientist (environmental toxicology) G C Kisku said: “The complete lockdown during 2020 and partial one in 2021 reduced vehicular movement and led to reduced consumption of fossil fuels. Closure of industrial establishments during lockdown periods also added to it. But the levels are still relatively higher this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-year-running-restrictions-bring-down-march-may-pollution-level-in-city/articleshow/83851325.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

This is the second C&D processing and recycling facility with a capacity of 500 tonnes per day (TPD) in Hyderabad. The first facility came into operation in Jeedimetla in November 2020. According to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Hyderabad is the third city in India to set up a C&D processing and recycling facility after Delhi and Ahmedabad, and the first city in south India. Launching the 500 metric tonne C&D waste recycling plant at Fathullaguda on Friday, the minister for municipal administration and urban development KT Rama Rao said, “By increasing the collection efficiency of waste, we increased the amount of waste collection from 3500 tonnes to 7000 tonnes in the city. Apart from door-to-door collection of waste, we also increased number of collection and transfer points (CTPs) from 17 to 70 to reduce the distance travelled by Swachh Auto Tippers to CTPs so that they have enough time to make more trips and collect more waste by covering more houses.” An exclusive system has been set in place for transportation of construction debris in city, he said, lauding the newly inaugurated Fathullaguda plant as one of the largest and the most modern in entire South India. “As part of the concept to generate wealth out of waste, we have set up a Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plant to generate 20 MWs of power through dry waste,” the minister said. Both the Fathullaguda and Jeedimetla recycling plants are set up in association with Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyds-2nd-construction-waste-recycling-plant-inaugurated/articleshow/83860313.cms||---

Both proposals have been drafted into bills — UP Shri Chitrakoot Dham Teerth Vikas Parishad Bill, 2021 and Vindhya Dham Teerth Vikas Parishad Bill, 2021 — for tabling in the Assembly. A government spokesperson said, the boards would work towards preserving cultural, ecological and architectural ethos of the two areas, hammer out development schemes, develop holistic tourism facilities, coordinate with agencies and monitor implementation of schemes. “The Vindhya finds mention in Puranas. Housing the Vindhyavasini shrine, it’s a key pilgrimage centre and one of the 51 peeths in the country. The temple is in the middle of the Ganga and lakhs of devotees visit the area during chaitra and shardiya and navratra. The proposed scheme will give international recognition to Mirzapur and boost tourism,” he said. Also, the government set a target of planting 30crore saplings this year. Free saplings will be provided to state and Central government departments, courts, farmers, organisations, individuals, private and government educational institutes, local bodies, gram panchayats and nagar panchayats. Of the target of 30crore, 10.8crore saplings will be planted by the forest department and the remaining by other institutions. The cabinet also cleared a proposal to modernise 6,600 borewells and replace allied equipment. The total cost of the project is Rs 28.80 crore. The project will be rolled out over three years from 2020-21 to 2022-23. Once the project is complete, it would help irrigate 76,082 hectare land and benefit 70,000 farmers and families. The Cabinet also approved transfer land to the culture department for setting up Dr Ambedkar Cultural Centre. The 5,494sqm land is near Aishbagh Eidgah, Lucknow, and the will have an auditorium with seating capacity of 750 persons, a library and research centre, a photo gallery, museum, multipurpose hall and offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cabinet-approval-to-vindhya-chitrakoot-development-boards/articleshow/83858503.cms||Neha Lalchandani

According to the FIR, Thirunavukarasu was stabbed multiple times in front of the public toilet he was maintaining by S Prakash and his accomplice T Karthick, both from TTV Dinakaran Nagar in Cumbum, following a petty quarrel. A Kathir, executive director of Evidence who conducted a fact finding visit at the scene of crime on Thursday told TOI that the victim was a key Tamil Puligal Party functionary. “He was a fighter for dalit rights and has waged legal battles against sexual harassment and usury that were faced by dalits over the years,” he said. Thirunavukarasu is survived by his pregnant wife Jothimani, 31, daughter Jeevitha, 6, parents Mookaiah, 65, and Rajammal, 62. Evidence suggested the government to provide a government job for Jothimani, an additional compensation of Rs 15 lakh and bearing the educational expenses of his children. Stating that a majority of human right defenders who are murdered in Tamil Nadu are dalit politicians or activists, the NGO pressed for a special act in the state to protect all types of human right defenders. The fact finding report and recommendations are sent to the chief minister, chief secretary and director general of police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-transfer-dalit-activists-murder-case-to-cb-cid/articleshow/83851358.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccine conman took advantage of pandemic to spread web of lies||KOLKATA: Debanjan Deb, the 28-year-old con artist, who went around claiming to be the joint commissioner of KMC, and functioned out of a place that he passed off as a civic office, took advantage of the pandemic to strengthen the charade. His office even sported billboards and stationery that sported the KMC insignia. Though Deb had been calling himself an IAS officer in certain quarters for some years now, it was only in the past six months that he began to openly flaunt his “position”. He initially organized camps to distribute sanitizers and masks with the KMC insignia printed on them. During the recent vaccine supply shortage, Deb launched vaccine camps that targeted the poor, those who did not know about CoWin registration and weren’t too concerned about post-vaccination certificates. Senior civic officials said Deb would not have got away with the impersonation for so long had the situation been normal. While he had been hobnobbing with senior politicians and police officers, it was only after the pandemic that he stepped up his activity in the public domain. “Since March 2020, everyone in the civic body has been in fire-fighting mode, battling the pandemic. The attention has been on enforcing restrictions and containment zones, preventing crowding at markets, holding fever clinics, providing ambulance, augmenting infrastructure at KMC clinics, bolstering crematoriums, setting up vaccination centres and managing the vaccination drive. Deb appears to have taken advantage of the civic body’s busy schedule to carry out his illicit activities,” said a KMC official. What has become embarrassing for KMC is to justify how Deb could operate a fake civic office for months without eliciting any query or suspicion from the nearby ward coordinator’s office. Officials have now asked cops to alerts them if any “suspicious” KMC officer attended a vaccination camp. Kolkata Police also finds itself confronting difficult questions on how Deb managed to operate in the open without raising suspicion of local cops. It was only by chance that actor-MP Mimi Chakraborty decided to get her vaccine at a camp organised by Deb, and when she failed to get her vaccine certificate, she alerted the police. Both KMC and police will be hard-pressed to explain why no one realised that at 28, a person was too young to occupy a joint commissioner’s post. Or why Deb, who claimed to be from KMC, moved around in a state I&CA department car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-conman-took-advantage-of-pandemic-to-spread-web-of-lies/articleshow/83855425.cms||Saikat Ray

According to a notification issued by the Manuu on Friday, distance mode annual examination-2020 for undergraduate, postgraduate, certificate and diploma courses shall be held from August 4 to August 25, 2021 at all the examination centers of the university. “Students of certificate, diploma programmes up to 2020 batch (regular and backlog), UG programmes up to 2018 batch (regular and backlog) excluding Arabic paper of second year 2018 batch and PG programme up to 2020 (regular and backlog), excluding MA in Arabic of 2019-2020 batches may appear for the examination,” read the notification. While it comes as a relief to close to 70,000 students, the delay in conducting the exam by two years has cost many students their future. “If the exams were held on time, I would have finished my masters by now and would have been able to seek employment. But now, I will be appearing for my first year masters exam and I’d finish the course only by 2023 now, a delay of two years,” said Mohammed Imran Saifi, a first year student of MA Urdu. The pandemic hit these students hard as they are neither able to complete their course nor able to pursue employment or opt out of it. “We had written multiple letters to the university administration seeking conduct of the exams.

---||Aurangabad||Bombay high court asks Maharashtra state to file affidavit over the use of remitted Rs 100 stamp papers||AURANGABAD: A 24-year old law student has filed a public interest litigation pointing out that despite the state remitting the Rs 100 stamp paper in the year 2004, different government departments continue to seek affidavits on these papers. Taking cognizance of the same, division bench of the HC comprising Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice MG Sewlikar issued notices to the state and has scheduled the next date of hearing on August 4. Law student Bhushan Mahajan has filed the PIL through lawyer Pradnya Talekar and contested that in violation of the notification, the Rs 100 stamp paper is being used for caste claims, income certificates, domicile certificate or nationality certificate. Talekar contested that even she was made to file an affidavit on a stamp paper of Rs 100. Citing the details obtained through Right To information Act, the lawyer pointed out that ‘since the remitting of Rs 100 stamp paper on July 1, 2004, a total of 39.06 crore stamp papers of Rs 100 have been sold till January 2021’. Talekar contested that the sale of these papers, since being remitted, has generated revenue of Rs 100 to Rs 400 cr annually. “This revenue cannot be legally justified,” she said. The petition also pointed out that despite the State Election Commission issuing a circular on January 8, 2015 directing all offices in the state to strictly implement the notification dated July 1, 2004, and not to insist execution of affidavit on stamp papers of any denomination, it continues to be violated by making several people’s representatives filed affidavits on Rs 100 stamp paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-asks-state-to-file-affidavit-over-the-use-of-remitted-rs-100-stamp-papers/articleshow/83849458.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Strategies change fast to beat Covid waves||PUNE: The Maharashtra government’s decision to rely on RT-PCR test results to decide the weekly positivity rate is likely to raise the positivity rate in many districts and push them into higher levels of restrictions than those at present. The Maharashtra government on Friday announced a “state-level trigger” for imposing restrictions in administrative units irrespective of weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy percentage in view of the emerging cases of the Delta-plus variant of Covid-19. The weekly positivity rate regarding levels of restrictions will now be determined on the basis of RT-PCR and not rapid antigen or other tests. District authorities and various government instructions have over the past few weeks pushed for rapid antigen tests (RAT) for increasing surveillance, as they yield faster results. But some districts have begun using the rapid antigen tests more than the RT-PCR diagnosis. “This is resulting in a skewed presentation of the weekly positivity rate at the state level,” a Maharashtra government health official said. Senior state officials said the latest order of the “Levels of Restrictions for Safe Maharashtra” issued on Friday was to set out a standard measure for assessment. The decision is likely to affect the unlock process for rural areas that were largely dependent on the antigen tests as there are fewer RTPCR labs in these places. The state currently has 235 RT-PCR laboratories and is conducting 60% antigen tests as against 40% RT-PCR tests. “We have increased the antigen tests for better surveillance, as many areas cannot be covered by RT-PCR. Moreover, the turnaround time for RTPCR reports is longer. The Centre has also issued directions that authorities should increase antigen tests. These reports should have been considered in the weekly positivity rate. The new decision is majorly going to affect areas that are doing more antigen tests,” said the official. State relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta told TOI that they had to set out a standard measure for assessment due to the huge variation in the positivity rate in many districts that were using more antigen tests than the RTPCR procedure. “This is only to ensure that we take positivity based on RT-PCR tests in the weekly review by administrative units. However, we are not saying that antigen should not be done. In fact, the antigen test result is immediate and thus useful. But it is not very reliable and positivity on the basis of antigen tests gives the wrong picture,” he said. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also pushed for more antigen tests and even home-test kits. An official from the state government said that when the rapid antigen tests are being validated and are being considered for assessing the positivity level in all states, there is no reason why it should not be considered in Maharashtra. A senior health official said some districts have the RTPCR facilities are also preferring the antigen tests. “On Friday, Parbhani conducted 2,051 rapid antigen tests as against 227 RT-PCR tests. The positivity rate for the day was 1.7%. Jalna conducted 1,834 RT-PCR tests as against 566 antigen tests. We have to have a standard measure, else we will have skewed positivity rates with many districts even conducting up to 90% antigen tests,” the official said. According to data shared by a public health official, almost over 50% of the 35 districts in the state conducted more antigen tests than RTPCR tests. In June so far, RTPCR tests account for 41% of all tests in the state, as against 59% antigen tests. Mumbai has done 82% RT-PCR tests, Pune 60% and Nagpur 73%. Former state health director Dr P P Doke said with the current decline in cases, the RT-PCR tests reports may be generated sooner. “But if the numbers were to rise, it would impact all districts in their assessment. If the orders are stressing on RT-PCR tests, then necessary infrastructure should be increased proportionately for the entire state. In the rural areas, transportation of swab samples to laboratories may be difficult if the numbers rise,” he said, adding that the RT-PCR was still the gold standard test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rt-pcr-tests-for-unlock-process-may-change-positivity-numbers/articleshow/83855305.cms||Nisha Nambiar

State home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Friday morning said schools and colleges would remain shut in the district till July 15. He conducted the district’s weekly Covid review meeting because deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was busy in another meeting. Walse Patil said, “There was a fear of third wave in our country. The administration is preparing to handle the situation. Citizens should not move out unnecessarily. The number of patients and the positivity rate have reduced, but the experts have predicted an increase in patients in the coming days.” The fresh order of the state government mandates all administrative units, irrespective of weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy percentage, to remain at a level not above 3 till further orders. State relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta told TOI that it was so because of an emergent new “Variant of Concern” as per the advisory of the task force and the Centre. He said it would remain in force till the situation eased. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar told TOI, “We shall be issuing the revised orders according to the level 3 norms on Saturday.” Echoing Kumar, his Pimpri Chinchwad counterpart Rajesh Patil said he would also release the revised order on Saturday. The status quo would be maintained in Pune rural areas, currently at level 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/schools-shut-till-july-15-civic-bodies-to-issue-new-orders/articleshow/83855326.cms||---
---||Nashik||Jalgaon administration ready to handle over 20,000 active cases at any time: Collector||NASHIK: The entire team of healthcare and frontline workers of Jalgaon have turned around things for the better during the two waves of the Covid-19 pandemic in a short span of time. “Jalgaon can now take pride in its robust healthcare system. We have been constantly upgrading the number of Covid-19 beds and availability of medical oxygen and ventilators in our hospitals. During the second wave of the pandemic, the private and government hospitals handled over 14,000 active cases at one point of time. Since there is a fear of a third wave, we are further ramping up our health facilities. We will be able to handle over 20,000 active cases at any given point of time,” district collector Abhijit Raut told TOI. A 2013 batch IAS officer and an alumnus of IIT, Roorkee, Raut completed one year as the Jalgaon district collector last week. When he took over the charge, the situation on the Covid front in Jalgaon was altogether different. It was one of the “hotspot” districts in the state with the local administration grappling to contain the rising cases of Covid. There was a death of an elderly Covid woman patient at a toilet of the government medical college hospital where she was undergoing treatment. She was missing for a few days from the hospital. People became fearful and refused to get admitted to the hospital for treatment. Raut admitted that the initial phase was a challenging one. “People’s perception towards the government healthcare system in the district was not encouraging. People feared to get admitted and treated for Covid-19 at government hospitals. But our zealous teams of healthcare and frontline workers laboured overtime to combat the situation. We also received wholehearted support from district guardian minister Gulabrao Patil and all other elected representatives in the initiatives,” added Raut. “As the cases rose, we started increasing the Covid beds at a rapid pace. By the end of July last year, over 2,500 beds were available, which was thrice than the number when I joined in the middle of June. Moreover, we scaled up and improved our contact tracing and testing to break the chain of the infection,” recalled the engineer-turned-bureaucrat. For two days at a stretch, Raut conducted workshops for all healthcare workers across the district making them understand the need to have an aggressive contact tracing to break the chain.“The efforts started yielding results, as the contacts who tested positive were isolated and treated for Covid. This led to a gradual decline in cases. We are still focussing on the contact tracing of the positive cases,” he said. Raut, along with a few other senior district authorities, started making surprise visits to Covid hospitals, including the Jalgaon GMCH as its image was tarnished by the death of the patient in a toilet. “Our visits to the hospitals helped in instilling confidence among the people that the administration is alert about the functioning of the health hubs. Covid patients once again started getting admitted to the government hospital. We also provided better facilities for Covid patients at the hospitals. Jaiprakash Ramanand, who took over the charge of Jalgaon GMCH in June last year, and his team worked overtime to streamline operations at the hospital,” said Raut. As the Jalgaon GMCH became overburdened with Covid patients, Raut gradually started boosting the health infrastructure in rural parts of the district by introducing medical oxygen availability at all Covid facilities. The aim was to ensure that the patients need not travel to Jalgaon city for treatment. “Various social organisations in the district helped us in setting up these medical oxygen facilities at Covid treatment centres in rural Jalgaon,” he said, adding that the district police had a big role to play in curbing the infection by strictly enforcing the restrictions. “I have been working closely with Raut for the past year on the Covid front and have found him to be a very good listener. He will allow others to share their plans in meetings. And he does not take any hasty decisions. Moreover, he always has an alternate plan up his sleeve ready if the original one does not work out,” said district civil surgeon N S Chavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/jalgaon-administration-ready-to-handle-over-20000-active-cases-at-any-time-collector/articleshow/83849513.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

According to police sources, the phone number mentioned on the parcel which was booked from Secunderabad was that of one of those detained from Kairana, named Mohd Kafeel. Shakeel Ahmad, Kafeel's father, said, "My son is into spice trade. He was picked by the police on Wednesday from Jhinjhana. Ever since, none of the officials have provided any information about my son. He is innocent." The other person picked up by the security agencies is Mohd Kasim from Kairana. A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, revealed that the two will be handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which is probing the Pakistan terror link in the case. Notably, the parcel was booked from Secunderabad in the name of Mohd Sofian on June 15. The parcel, carried a bundle of clothes in which was hidden a bottle filled with some chemical that exploded when the consignment reached Darbhanga railway station on June 17. It was being shifted from a train coming from Secunderabad. After the explosion, the parcel caught fire. No one was injured. The officer told TOI, "The two have been under detention for a couple of days and since central investigative agencies are involved in this case, it will not be appropriate for us to speak on the issue." According to reports, the Home Ministry has directed the NIA to investigate the case. Until now, ATS of three states - Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - had been jointly investigating the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-police-detains-2-shamli-based-suspects-in-darbhanga-blast-case/articleshow/83849508.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Madurai||Abolish NEET in Tamil Nadu, say outfits||MADURAI: Many organisations have sent their suggestions to the Committee to Assess the Impact of NEET, demanding that the examination be scrapped. State coordinator of Save Higher Education Movement, Dr R Murali, said that undertaking a common examination is against the rules of social justice due to the big disparity between students in urban areas and villages. NEET does not give importance to the marks obtained in the 11th and 12th standards, when the children put in a lot of effort. Instead, it gives the admission based on NEET only. It deprives hardworking students of a chance. The 7.5% quota for government students is not social justice. The centre is trying to deprive the state’s right in higher education and it should be abolished, he said. Advisor to Denotified Tribes Welfare Association, Dr Panneerselvam, said NEET deprives students among a two-crore population of 68 denotified tribes from having access to medical education. The right to life under Article 21 includes right of a student life. No student can be burdened with double preparation . The state government should pass a special act to abolish NEET and other such examinations, he said. Save the Nation movement has said that NEET is against the rights given under articles 14, 15, 16, 19, 21 and 21A of the Indian constitution. Though education is under general category, all policy decisions should be taken only by the state government, movement coordinator C J Rajan has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/abolish-neet-in-tn-say-outfits/articleshow/83851374.cms||---

Close to two weeks after the Rs 84-crore project was awarded to a company which was allegedly penalised in the penguin enclosure project at Byculla zoo and an oxygen plant manufacturer who was allegedly blacklisted for shoddy work by Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Medical College in November last year, installation of the plants is not over yet. Shaikh has sought a probe by Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) against BMC officials if the plants are not installed in 30 days. BMC standing committee had on June 8 approved the proposal to award the work to construct 16 oxygen plants at 12 locations in Mumbai to Highway Construction Co. While tenders were floated in April, and the plants were to be constructed in 30 days, the project was stuck after BJP’s Vinod Mishra raised objections on tainted companies being in the fray. Shaikh wrote to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal demanding an audit by BMC’s test audit and vigilance officer into the contract. “I’m told that Highway Construction Co is know to forge documents as it has been penalised for it in the past, and that parts of the oxygen plants may be installed that are not manufactured by Unissi India, as claimed in the bid. I urge you to direct officials of Mechanical and Electrical department to verify the parts and equipment of all plants at all 16 locations before installation. In the light of the above, I urge you to direct the TAVO to carry out an audit of all the plants that are installed under this contract,” Shaikh said in his letter. Shaikh said that he would visit the 16 sites 30 days after work orders are issued to check if the plants have been installed. Shaikh said he was expecting financial irregularities in the project and demanded that no payments should be released to the company till an audit is carried out. RTI activist Anil Galgali said BMC had not appointed any consultant or experts before allotting the contract. “BMC is spending money on oxygen plants, no expert advice was taken,” Galgali said. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said, “The letter of acceptance (LoA) was issued on June 14 and all sites were handed over to the contractor on June 16.” Romin Chedha of Highway Construction and Unissi India did not respond to queries from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-min-seeks-probe-into-bmc-rs-84-crore-oxygen-plant-project/articleshow/83858591.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

As per directions of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, rooftop rainwater harvesting has to be set up in government and semi-government buildings in six major cities, including Meerut, Bareilly, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur and Jhansi. A government spokesperson said that the Jal Jeevan Mission section of the minor irrigation department has been entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating this project. “Rooftop rainwater harvesting facility has to be installed at 2,19,376 government and semi-government buildings in these six cities. Out of these, work is in progress at 2,07,876 buildings while it has already been completed in 11,500 buildings,” he said. In rural areas, water harvesting facilities are being installed at both private and public places under MNREGA. This includes setting up of rooftop rainwater harvesting systems at government schools, digging ponds and recharging pits in a beneficiary farmer’s field. “The campaign for compulsory installation of roof top rainwater harvesting systems in all government and semi-government buildings in metropolitan cities is going on at war-footing. Executive engineers have been designated as nodal officers at the district level to monitor the progress in the implementation of the action plan,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-to-promote-rooftop-rainwater-harvesting-in-state/articleshow/83858561.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Fearing Covid, 12 Maoists escape from Chhattisgarh forests||HYDERABAD: Telangana police claim that a manhunt has been launched by the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) to trace some of their own lower rung cadre who allegedly escaped from the forest area in Chhattisgarh fearing that they might contract coronavirus. “Though it’s been more than a year since the spread of coronavirus, CPI Maoists recently appealed to their cadre to use masks, sanitisers, maintain social distancing and avoid meeting villagers and hold mass gatherings in tribal areas of Chhattisgarh,’’ top sources in Telangana told TOI. Sources said most of the Maoist cadre from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been in neighbouring Chhattisgarh, where many of them, including some of the top leadership, are suffering with Covid-19. Telangana police have been on their toes hoping that Maoist cadre and its key leaders in distress might secretly come to Telangana for treatment. Police officials said that the rampant spread of coronavirus among the Maoist cadre was reportedly due to their recent participation in mass protests at Silger in Chhattisgarh against a newly-built CRPF camp. They are now getting allopathy medicines into the forest for their cadres through their couriers, instead of their earlier experiments with quacks and their own team of doctors. Police also suspect that some doctors, who are sympathisers of Maoists and living in nearby towns, might be guiding them through their couriers. So far, the CPI Maoist leadership was in denial about the spread of coronavirus among its cadre, but on Thursday, they admitted that Telangana Maoist State Committee secretary, Haribushan, and Indravathi area committee member Sarakka alias Bharatakka, had Covid-19 symptoms at the time of their death a few days ago. Police accuse CPI Maoists leadership of denying their cadre medical treatment. “Some 12 lower rung cadre fled from the forest fearing Covid-19. We know the leadership is searching for the missing men,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fearing-covid-12-maoists-escape-from-chgarh-forests/articleshow/83860397.cms||Srinath Vudali

---||Lucknow||BJP MPs & MLAs to escort candidates to nomination centres||Lucknow: After formally announcing its candidates for zila panchayat chairman elections, BJP is set to make a fresh bid to turn rural local bodies polls into a full-blown political show by asking MPs and MLAs to accompany party-backed candidates to nomination centres on Saturday. Keen to escalate its presence at the grassroots, the BJP leadership has asked party representatives to escort candidates along with their followers while adhering to Covid protocols. This will apply even to candidates who received BJP support after they won as Independents. “The decision to support other independent candidates was taken at district level after due consultation,” said a senior BJP leader. Talking to TOI, state BJP general secretary and in charge of zila panchayat chairman election, JPS Rathore said, “The idea is to win maximum possible zila panchayat chairman seats. The party decided to field and support independent candidates in all districts after consulting district-rung committees. These candidates wield influence in their districts,” he said. Polling and counting for ZP chairman elections, which is an indirect electoral exercise, will be held on July 3. The 75 ZP chairpersons would be elected by 3,050 ward members. BJP’s decision to back Independents, who managed to register a win in their respective wards, is a key pointer to saffron party’ strategy to create a fresh set of functionaries who can consolidate support in the run-up to the crucial assembly elections next year. The BJP move, unsurprisingly, has stoked a frenzy in Samajwadi Party that threw a formidable challenge to the saffron party in the recently held elections for rural local bodies’ wards. Party MLC Udai Bir Singh, who also happens to be a key aide of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav expressed apprehension about free and fair elections. Two days ago, Akhilesh accused the BJP of using fear and greed to grab posts of chairpersons of zila panchayats. “BJP is hell-bent on insulting democracy and throttling the voice of people, who defeated BJP in the panchayat elections. BJP is now fraudulently trying to regain lost ground,” he said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-mps-mlas-to-escort-candidates-to-nomination-centres/articleshow/83858583.cms||Pankaj Shah

P Sivaraman, a tutor, said their organisation `Maram Seiya Virumbu’ is an unstructred body with a group of temporary volunteers. ``Passion to plant and nurture trees is our driving force, and like-minded people continue to vulnteer,’’ he said. During the lockdown, they nurtured saplings, and also planted 250 of them around the Mariamman teppakulam. They also have a nursery where they grow plants. “We do not buy hybrid or specially developed seeds, instead all of us collect seeds whenever we find them under trees on roadsides, or in forests during treks,’’ he said. All of them carry a bag to collect the seeds. They have grown over 20,000 trees till date and planted about 5,500 trees. They grow native tree species such as pungai, neem, naval, and illupai. Their volunteers include a large number of school and college students. “Though we started four years ago, it was only recently that we started keeping track of the trees we give, with the help of a google spreadsheet. We keep details of the people,’’ said Sivaraman. They distribute the saplings on the condition that they will visit the places and monitor the growth of the trees. The saplings are given after a brief interaction with those who take the saplings to verify if they are commited to the cause, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/volunteers-distribute-saplings-to-enhance-green-cover-in-madurai/articleshow/83851421.cms||---

Map Beach Resorts has sought the MoEF’s clearance for its resort project. The company is planning to invest Rs 142 crore in developing the beach resort in the forest land of Thimmapuram on the coastal beach corridor of Vizag-Bheemili adjoining the sea. The project will consist of a bar and restaurant, high-end shopping facilities, convention centre, a health arena, wellness spa, entertainment zone, aqua sports, landscaping, parking area and a hotel. However, the firm’s proposal is strongly opposed by environmentalists who said forest land diversion in the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) violates all green norms. Former IAS officer EAS Sarma said any land diversion should be for public good and not for setting up bars and restaurants. “The Supreme Court has clearly insisted on compensatory afforestation in case of diversion of reserve forest land. Even in a non-notified forest land, compensatory afforestation is a must,” he said. He alleged that compensatory afforestation was never done in Vizag even in instances of forest land being taken away. Map Beach Resorts, however, said the land falls in a degraded forest. “We will follow all CRZ norms. Due to non-availability of private land in the surrounding area, we are planning the resort project in the forest area,” it said. The firm said tourist attractions like Thotlakonda Buddhist Complex and Rama Naidu Film Studios are all located close to the sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-firm-eyes-forest-land-close-to-sea-for-vizag-beach-resort/articleshow/83860423.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

She was his second. The woman, who was arrested on Friday, told investigators that she pounced upon him with a sharp-edged kitchen knife while he was asleep. According to police sources, the man's desire for a third wife led to a scuffle. She bobbitised him and the man "bled to death". Hazra, the local cleric Wakeel Ahmed's second wife, had earlier pleaded with him not to marry for a third time, but the man had made up his mind. The incident occurred in Shikarpur village on Thursday night. His first wife was not at home, sources added. A team of cops from Bhorakalan police station reached their house and the man's body was sent for postmortem. Deputy SP of Phugana, Sharad Chad Sharma, said, "The woman has confessed to her crime. Her husband wished to marry yet again. And she wanted to prevent him. Their argument turned into a major scuffle." Bhorakalan SHO Jitender Singh said she has been booked under section 302 [murder] of IPC and sent to prison.

Slender lorises are facing habitat loss which may affect their population in the years to come. This mammal is protected under Schedule – I of the Wildlife Protection Act. According to forest officials, a conservation reserve for the mammal will be the first of its kind in India. The grey slender loris are native to the southern peninsula and northern part of Sri Lanka. Slender lorises could be found till Palani hills but the thick vegetation in the 6,000 hectares Kadavur reserve forest offers it an ideal habitant and climate. A detailed proposal was submitted to the government by forest officials after carrying out a sample survey three years back, but it is yet to be considered. Making farmers take up organic farming in adjoining areas was also part of the proposal as slender lorises feeds on small insects and pest found on agriculture land. Usage of pesticides and insecticides has been affecting such insects. K Pushpavanam, a law student from Madurai who filed a PIL for the conservation of slender lorises, welcomed the move to expedite the work on declaring Kadavur as a sanctuary. “Habitat destruction has been a major reason for their dwindling population and protecting the forest by declaring it as a sanctuary will immense help in conservation of these endangered species,” he said. Karur range officer R Ravichandran said that they will be meeting the collector next week with all supporting documents to take the project to the next level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bid-to-speed-up-declaration-of-slender-loris-sanctuary/articleshow/83851490.cms||Sampath Kumar

The school has planned an online meeting with 70-odd parents to stress the need to make use of the education channel to help their children learn from home with the help of textbooks. Perhaps the first government school in the district to conduct an online parent-teacher meeting, the school also plans to send teachers to visit children to monitor how effectively they are making use of Kalvi Tholaikatchi. Speaking to TOI, headmistress of panchayat union middle school at Pirattiyur, K Asha Devi said online meeting was the only option to connect to the parents during the pandemic. It was indeed a challenging task to orient parents for the online meeting as most of them are not educated and aren’t well-versed in handling online classes, she said. “We came to know that many of the students are not watching the audio-visual classes on Kalvi Tholaikatchi. As some of the parents said they were unaware of the timings of the classes, we decided to give separate chart to parents of each child with the timing of classes telecast for their children,” said K Marudhanayagam, block education officer, Manikandam block. While the online meeting was a success, we are planning to do the same in other government schools in the block, he said. Not all parents were having smartphones or the data required, said Marudhanayagam adding that they asked teachers to visit the places of parents whom they know and who have smart phones. “There are over 650 students in the school now. We will reach out to all the parents through personal visits wherever required,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/school-goes-extra-mile-to-better-learning-via-kalvi-tholaikatchi/articleshow/83851512.cms||---

Overall, Agra was adjudged the best performer in the state for implementation of the smart city project. Under the smart city project, four skill development centres were set up in the Tajganj locality last year. The smart city project team helped develop 104 women self-help groups involving 10 to 15 women in each. At present, 1,350 women from weaker sections of society are actively working on seven different traditional skill sets and earning their living. These skills are zardozi work, marble inlay work, carpet-making, brush-making, flower bouquet-making, paper craft and crafting ornamental items. Vice-president of the Agra Smart City Project Anand Menon said, “Through our skill development initiative, we have managed to empower 1,350 women from weaker sections of society. These women are a part of 104 self-help groups who were provided entrepreneurship development training. They were taught the basics about banking and e-payments. Overall, we helped them to establish a profit-making business. Now, they are also selling products on e-commerce websites. Since February, they have done online business worth Rs 4.64 lakh. Even during the peak Covid-19 period, two international orders for marble inlay products were received.” Menon added, “We are constantly mentoring the operations of the self-help groups and working on strategies to attract more business. The Agra smart skill development initiative has not only succeeded in women empowerment but also in contributing to the growth of families suffering from financial crisis,” he said. Agra was selected for the smart city development in September 2016.

The survey to identify buildings in the poor condition is on in different parts of the city, and thus, we may issue more notices.” According to Section 33(1) of the UP Municipal Corporations Act, 1959, if any structure is in a ruinous condition or is likely to fall and is dangerous to any person occupying it, the municipal commissioner may, by written notice, require the owner or occupier to pull down, secure, remove or repair such structure to prevent all causes of danger.  In case of non-compliance to the notice, the municipal corporation has the right to order demolition of a dilapidated structure putting lives in danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/civic-body-issues-notice-to-owner-of-117-identified-dilapidated-buildings-in-agra/articleshow/83849660.cms||Deepak Lavania

The airport authorities welcomed the passengers and the flight crew with bouquets. With this service, Trichy airport added yet another international destination. Aviation experts have said that the service must be regularised. Maldives has restricted the arrival of Indians due to Covid, due to which AIE could not operate flight services. But, it could bring passengers from Maldives. The flight went to Male carrying six tonnes of cargo and returned with 146 passengers. Speaking to TOI, S Dharmaraj, airport director, Trichy airport said it was a single flight operated by AIE. “It will have significance if the service is regularised. If AIE feels that load factor is good as it was in the case of this flight with over 80% occupancy, they may continue the service,” he said. “There is sufficient existing traffic between Trichy and Male. But previously it was not addressed due to lack of representation. This time, passengers from various parts of Tamil Nadu who are working in Male approached AIE through social media to represent their requirement,” said aviation analyst H Ubaidullah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aie-flight-from-maldives-to-trichy-gets-water-salute/articleshow/83851553.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Lucknow||Sero survey tracks Covid antibodies in 55% Uttar Pradesh population||LUCKNOW: Every second person in Uttar Pradesh had developed antibodies against the coronavirus during the second wave, suggest preliminary data of the Covid-19 Sero Prevalence Survey, undertaken in the first week of June. The findings of the survey were tabled before chief minister Yogi Adityanath during the meeting of the Covid crack team here on Friday. Official sources told TOI that about 55-60% of the people in the state had developed immunity against the coronavirus as per the survey. This is less than the trend of about 78% people developing immunity indicated in the WHO-AIIMS, New Delhi survey a week ago. Launched on June 4, the survey, conducted in all 75 districts of UP, was supervised by the microbiology department of King George’s Medical University. It aimed at quantifying the proportion of people in the state’s population who have developed immunity against the pandemic virus. When contacted, additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal said: “The initial findings of the sero survey were placed before the government, however, any kind of conclusions or policy changes will follow only after the detailed results are out. This will take a week or so.” Sehgal also urged people not to depend on chance factors when it comes to protection from the pandemic virus and adhere strictly to the Covid-19 prevention norms especially at a time when the virus is mutating fast. “Whether or not someone is having antibodies against coronavirus, the risk of contracting the infection remains there. Prevention protocol is highly recommended even after one gets both the doses of the protective vaccine,” he said urging people to wear masks, follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and avoid movement without reason. A health department official said that the sero prevalence survey involved testing the blood serum of a group of individuals to determine the presence of antibodies against coronavirus infection. “Samples were collected from rural and urban areas in three primary categories – slums, general population, people who tested positive for Covid-19. An additional category of those with sero-positivity (or those who developed antibodies in the first wave)," said an officer engaged in the exercise. Different teams led by a doctor and comprising an ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife) and an ASHA worker of that particular area and one technician collected the blood samples. The CMOs of each district coordinated the transportation of the samples to KGMU Lucknow for assessment. Those associated with the survey said that the data would reveal district-wise trends, male-female distribution besides throwing light on the category-wise sero prevalence. Based on the outcome, the policy-makers will tweak the strategy to combat the anticipated third wave and draw localised prevention plans. During the first wave of Covid-19 in September 2020, the health department carried out sero survey in 11 districts -- Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Agra, Prayagraj, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Kaushambi, Baghpat, and Moradabad. The result showed that 22.1% of people had developed antibodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sero-survey-tracks-covid-antibodies-in-55-up-population/articleshow/83858688.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Health officials pointed out that the total number of doses administered in the state reached 2.98 crore. Of them, 2.55 crore have taken at least one dose while 42.58 lakh are fully vaccinated in the state. In terms of categories, the total number of persons with at least one dose in the 18-44 years reached 1.08 crore while the number of those vaccinated in the 45 to 60 years age group reached 1.10 crore. In the elderly category, 80.09 lakh persons have taken at least one dose. This is for the fifth day in a row that UP has been able to undertake more than seven lakh vaccinations. Health officials attributed the success to the cluster approach. Under the cluster approach, focused and intensified vaccination drives are being taken in small geographical units. Also, the camps are being organised inside the villages along with the health centers to make it easier for the people. In addition, the issue of digital divide was addressed by elimination of the necessary prerequisite of registration through app. Instead, the electoral rolls are being used to identify the eligible persons and vaccinate them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/with-over-8-37cr-jabs-on-fri-up-nears-3-cr-mark/articleshow/83858725.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The state government’s five-day work plan in its offices till July 31 has only added to this phenomenon because the state government employees, who form a sizeable chunk of Bhopal’s population, have holidays on all the Saturdays of the month. “I don’t know whether it’s intentional or an act of omission when the order for 100 per cent attendance of employees was issued, the order for six-day a week work except for 2nd and 3rd Saturdays was not issued. It has allowed us to go for outings on Saturdays. Last Saturday, we went to Van Vihar and this Saturday, we are planning to go to the Boat Club and Tribal Museum”, said an under secretary in the Mantralaya. Last Saturday, which was the first Saturday after the unlocking of tourist and picnic spots in the city, saw a huge crowd at these places. Not only the favourite hangouts of Bhopalis, like Kerva and Kaliyasot dam site attracted huge crowds but also Van Vihar, Boat Club and other places of tourist interest on Shyamala Hills as well saw a surge in visitors. More than 3000 people visited Van Vihar that day and even the entertainment park of the MPT- Sair Sapata- which had only a few visitors on last Friday attracted 350 visitors the next day. Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sanghralaya (IGRMS), which was closed last Saturday, has also opened, giving people another place to go to on weekends. . PRO, IGRMS, Ashok Sharma, said that the museum is ready to welcome guests even if there is more crowd on Saturday. “We have all the provisions to ensure that Covid-19 guidelines are followed and visitors have a good time at the museum”, he said. Sharma said, vaccination certificate is also seen at the gate in compliance to district collector’s order to keep a record including the phone numbers of persons visiting the museum who are not vaccinated, which the district administration could use to contact them for vaccination. Besides, Oxygen level of persons coming to the museum is also checked, he said. At the Boat Club, Van Vihar, Tribal Museum or IGRMS, visitors are allowed only after thermal screening, wearing masks is of course compulsory and physical distancing has to be maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/weekend-fever-peaks-revellers-unlock-saturday-plans/articleshow/83851593.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

It counters the ASI plaque at Rakhta Talai (Rajsamand) that states that Pratap’s forces retreated in the battle. The board reads: Pratap won the battle of Haldighati on June 18, 1576 CE. Mughal ruler despite ruling most of India was scared of Pratap to wage a war with him in person and thus sent his Hindu military ruler Man Singh of Jaipur...royal forces retreated for 6 km. “We put our board to restore the honour of our great warrior Maharana Pratap. Similiar acts will be done at all places in Mewar where a distorted version of history is being presented to visitors,” said Hemant Singh Mojawat, member of Khastriya Samaj Mewar and president of Haldighati Navyuvuk Mandal. Chetak Smarak Samiti, Balichi head Jagdish Raj Srimali, part of the team that put up the board, said the content was prepared after a detailed discussion with historians. “All places associated with Pratap are pilgrimage sites for every nationalist. The writeup on the board is reflection of the emotions of locals backed by evidence,” said Srimali, while clarifying that they have used their right of freedom of expression. It has names of Ram Tanwar, Rana Punja, Bhahashah, Jhala Man, Hakim Khan Sur, aides of Pratap claiming to have played a role in the victory of the battle.Locals further objected to the Badshah Bagh (Rajsamand) named after the royal forces of the Mughal emperor that stayed there while heading for the battle of Haldighati. All three places—Haldighati, RakhtaTalai and Badhshah Bagh are located in a radius of 7-km and are protected sites under the ASI.Chandra Shekhar Sharma, an assistant professor at Meera Girls College, who drafted the board said Maharana withstood against the Mughals due to his opposition to the idea of imperialism. “Naming a place related to the Mughals in Mewar is disrespectful for Maharana Pratap. As a historian, the place was known for the cultivation of flowers under the Rajput rulers and twisting it to ‘Badshahi’ is nothing but Mughalization of history,” Shekhar, who has done a PhD on Pratap, said.Reacting to the move, ASI superintendent Jodhpur Circle Bipin Chandra Negi said his officials will visit the area. “If the locals have any dispute related to the present plaque at Rakhta Talai or at any place, it will be addressed properly,” said Negi. Responding to another demand of changing the name of Badshani Bagh, he said it cannot be ruled out that Mughal forces stayed at some places before and after the battle. “Still, if historians and locals have any issue, the historical texts will be reviewed,” said Negi. He asserted that history is determined through facts not run through the emotions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajput-groups-place-board-at-haldighati-contradicting-asi-claim-on-the-battle-result/articleshow/83855851.cms||Shoeb Khan

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 11 coin moulds of Malavas dynasty found at Nagar Fort in Tonk district||JAIPUR: The state archaeology and museology department has discovered 11 coin moulds made up of terracotta dating back to 100 AD to 200 BC from an empty pond at Nagar Fort in Tonk. The coin casting mould is in five different sizes with symbols inscribed on it belonged to Malavas dynasty (4 BC to 7 CE) is first of its kind tool discovered in the state is seen as connecting the dots to the discovery of 3,701 coins found from the same place in 1937 and 1942. The moulds are different from each other in their size, depth, diameter and symbols but what has amazed the archaeologist that the weight of every coin recovered earlier was the same. “The five symbols inscribed on one side of the mould, sun, moon, six arms, a tree, horns of the bull. The shape of the coins varies from pentagonal, square, round and rectangle,” said Zaffarullah Khan, retired excavation superintendent, department of archelogy and museology. Khan, author of eight books on numismatics, called it a shattering discovery. The primary study says that these were not the only sites where the dynasty once ruled from present Punjab to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. “The discovery of 3,701 coins earlier includes 573 copper coins are similar to the mould discovered from the site. Another recovery of bricks walls, the size and composition has led us to conclude its period from 100 AD to 200 BC,” said Khan. The discovery of fragments of tuyere which are airflow pipe used to flow air in the furnace, leading to strong speculation of the presence of iron furnaces here. “The three-layered soil with the middle layer composed of ash deposits used in the furnace. The huge chunks of iron ore confirm the area to be a hub of metallurgy,” said Neeraj Tripathi, Neeraj Tripathi, circle superintendent, state archaeology and museum department. Earlier studies have confirmed the place doesn’t have iron mines which says that the sole use of iron ore was for metallurgy. “Our next aim is to trace the iron furnaces which will be the biggest discovery of my life,” said Tripathi. He speculates that the entire areas have to excavate as the possibility of that period weapons and other metallurgical tools can be established. Notably, the area is barely a kilometre away from an ASI protected site where the studies have established that habitat exists. Here so far no signs of habitat were found gives rise to a new discovery that the concept of industrial towns did exist during that period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/coin-moulds-of-malavas-era-found-in-tonk/articleshow/83855896.cms||Shoeb Khan

After she was sent home, additional amount of Rs 75,000 has been given to the village sarpanch who will ensure that she gets Rs 5,000 every month. This was done because although at present she is residing with her son, at times she also stays with her daughter.”On the day of the incident, Sukhi and her granddaughter had left their village to see a family member in Roda village on foot around late afternoon. On the way, they felt thirsty due to the scorching heat.

Mohite had started his electoral politics journey with Shiv Sena when he was elected member of Parliament from Ramtek in 1999. He moved on to Congress and then joined Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana. Asked why he did not prefer to return to his previous parties, considering they too are part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state, Mohite said it was Pawar’s charisma which drew him to the NCP. Speaking to TOI, Mohite said, “Everyone knows that [Sharad] Pawar is a leader who the entire nation looks up to. The experience, knowledge and acumen which Pawar possesses is not visible in anyone. When it comes to debating on issues, nobody can speak like him.” Mohite says he has no electoral ambitions to nurse by joining NCP. “My only role as of now is to strengthen the party in Vidarbha. My focus will be on farmers and issues they face. There are many problems which farmers are facing and resolutions have to be found and that’s where I will spend my time,” he said.

---||Ranchi||Now, seven more kids rescued at Ranchi railway station||RANCHI: With the lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic causing acute financial hardship in rural areas, middlemen and traffickers have become active in these areas. The glaring example of the traffickers’ audacity was brought to the fore when 15 trafficked children were rescued from the city airport on Thursday. On the same day, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) also rescued seven minors from being trafficked to Delhi from the Ranchi railway station. According to officials, the RPF personnel were carrying out a routine checking drive under their initiative for women and children’s safety, when they saw three minor girls entering the station with a man. During interrogation, the man identified himself as Vikas Manjhi and said he was taking the girls to Delhi for work. The girls, who belonged to Simdega district, said Manjhi was not their blood relative. Meanwhile, a woman also entered the railway station with five girls and was stopped for questioning. Police found that the woman, Sunita Tirkey, was also taking the girls, including four minors, to Delhi. The minors belonged to Dungri police station area of Gumla and Jaspur area of neighbouring Chhattisgarh. On Friday, the RPF handed over Manjhi and the three minors to the Simdega police while the woman and the five children to the anti-human trafficking unit in Gumla. RPF officials said several cases of trafficking, particularly children, have been detected at the Ranchi station. Between June 19 and 25, 15 minor girls, most of them from Gumla district, were also rescued. Sanjay Mishra of Bal Kalyan Sangh, which runs the state resource centre to help trafficked children, said the lack of livelihood in rural areas is forcing many youths, including minors, to migrate from the villages. He said, “Though authorities have rescued several children from railway stations and the airport, a large number youths have left the state in private vehicles.” Mishra said even parents and close relatives are sending the children away for work due to the prevailing situation in rural areas. More than Covid, they fear hunger and death, he said, adding that there is a high demand for young people in other states for various kinds of work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/now-7-more-kids-rescued-at-ranchi-railway-station/articleshow/83855771.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The court of Justice Ananda Sen issued a notice to the director general of police, directing the latter to explain why the survivor in a sexual assault case was not made a witness by the investigating officer. Despite the fact that the trial court had issued letters to the investigating officer, Sahibgunj superintendent of police, DIG, Dumka and even to the DGP, no action was taken by the police. The high court ordered the DGP to furnish an explanation in the matter and explain why the survivor was not examined and who is responsible for the same. The court also questioned the top police brass to inform what action has been taken by his office against the erring police officers and why should the police officials not be hauled up for contempt for non-compliance of orders of the trial court. Justice Sen while hearing the bail application of Anil Kunwar, an accused in the case, under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act was informed that the survivor of the case was not examined and it would be detrimental to the interest of the survivor. Justice Sen observed in his order that the statement of the 13-year-old girl was recorded by the magistrate, but strangely she was not put up before the court for recording her deposition. Her non-examination as a witness will only help the accused to come out free from the case, the court observed. The Justice also noticed from the records of the case that several letters have been written by the trial judge to the police officers, including the top cop of the state, yet no action was taken nor a follow-up was done with regards to putting the survivor up for examination as a witness. The high court mentioned in its order: “The letters of the trial court are not mere documents of correspondence, they are a judicial order which has to be complied by the authorities at all cost. Any dereliction in the same is a matter of contempt and will be dealt with severely.” A copy of the order has been sent to the Union home ministry also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-pulls-up-dgp-for-faulty-probe-in-sex-assault-case/articleshow/83851902.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand liquor sellers seek excise transport duty waiver, cite lockdown losses||RANCHI: Retail liquor sellers of Jharkhand on Friday submitted a memorandum to Vinay Kumar Choubey, the secretary of the state department of excise and prohibitions, and sought a waiver in the monthly excise transport duty (ETD) citing poor sales figures due to the curtailed business hours. Under the banner of Jharkhand Khudra Sharab Vikreta Sangh (JKSVS), the umbrella association of retail liquor sellers of the state, the retailers reached the excise department’s office in Kanke Road and handed over the memorandum seeking necessary action in this regard. “As per the conditions of the licence, liquor shops are supposed to be open from 10am to 10pm on normal days. But from April 23 this year, shops were allowed to remain open till 2pm. Although the lockdown orders were modified on May 28, the liquor shops were allowed to operate till 4pm but had to be shut on Sundays due to the complete lockdown. In this fashion, the shops were allowed to open for six hours on average, which resulted in a drop of sales by around 65%,” the JKSVS said in its memorandum. “The department gave us a waiver of 50% in the ETD, which compelled us to file a writ petition in the Jharkhand high court. The court directed us to file a petition with the excise commissioner. When we visited the excise department’s headquarters, there was no one. We filed an email with the excise commissioner on Thursday, but nothing has moved in that direction. Due to lockdown, the sales are poor than expectation and on the other hand, the government wants full revenue,” JKSVS president Achintya Saw said. As per the existing policies, a retail seller has to pay anywhere between Rs 25-32 lakh a month to the excise department in excise transport duty. With reduced business hours, the retailers said they cannot recover the ETD payout due to low sales. Saw said: “When we did not find the secretary in the excise department, we met him at Project Building. However, there was no assurance from his side. If the government does not take a call on the revenue, we will hand over the keys of our shops to the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/liquor-sellers-seek-excise-transport-duty-waiver-cite-lockdown-losses/articleshow/83851835.cms||---

The move comes in the wake of reports that many districts haven’t been able to achieve their daily targets. In his letter to the DCs, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “After conducting a review of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, it has come to my notice that the coverage is low in comparison to other states. In order to increase the coverage, daily targets have been changed and deputy commissioners are directed to take appropriate steps for their compliance.” He has also ordered the DCs to personally monitor the situation to improve the coverage. The state has set a target of vaccinating 2.5 lakh people on a daily basis, however, as per health department records, 7,56,982 people were vaccinated between June 18 and 24, with the highest number of shots being given on June 20 (1,25, 824) and the daily average being 1.08 lakh. As per the review of state health department, Palamu, Chatra and Khunti have lagged behind in the drive with a coverage of 19, 23 and 28%, respectively, in the past week. Even a few blocks under Ranchi district are struggling to improve the coverage. Upon contact, district officials said that even after a series of awareness programs, people from rural areas aren’t turning up for taking the shot for various reasons. As per a district administration report, only 33% of the total beneficiaries have been administered the first dose while a mere 9% have been given the second dose across 15 blocks. Upon contact, Bundu SDM Sameera S said, “We have been conducting awareness programs, doing door-to-door visits and are also taking the help of community leaders but people from rural areas aren’t interested. Although last week’s coverage wasn’t satisfactory, there has been an increase in the last two days with more than 290 beneficiaries taking the jab on Thursday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/prepare-roadmap-for-better-vax-coverage-dcs-told/articleshow/83851974.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Man suffering from constipation undergoes life-saving operation in Ranchi||RANCHI: The sadar hospital in Ranchi on Thursday performed an emergency surgery on an 85-year-old man and removed a part of his intestine after it was that it had developed gangrene. The patient is currently stable and is still recovering and he is out of danger. The three-hour-long surgery was led by general surgeon Dr Ajit Kumar, who performed the operation with anaesthetist Dr Alakh Narayan Mishra. Aditya Nath Pathak had come to the hospital on Tuesday with complaints of bowel obstruction and constipation. He was referred to Ranchi from Palamu after his suffering did not subside for 10 days at a stretch. Talking to TOI, Dr Ajit said, “Following a preliminary examination, I suspected that his stomach has swollen. So I had suggested a few pathological tests and admitted him to the hospital.” A CT scan revealed that the patient’s stomach has developed swelling. “The reports confirmed the presence of a large bowel obstruction and it was turning gangrenous. We immediately decided to operate on him as it had become life-threatening,” Dr Ajit said. The doctors removed one-and-a-half feet of the infected intestine which was followed by an end colostomy. “If we hadn’t performed the surgery, the gangrene would have spread to the whoel body,” Dr Ajit said. The deputy superintendent of Ranchi district hospital, Dr Sabyasachi Mandal, congratulated the team and said: “This is for the first time that our doctors have conducted a sigmoid volvulus surgery successfully with limited resources. I congratulate all the doctors and we will continue to support them so that such surgeries continue to be performed.” Meanwhile, Dr Ajit happens to be the same doctor who had performed the first laparoscopic surgery at Ranchi district hospital earlier this year and according to hospital sources, he had to bring in additional equipment from outside for conducting that surgery as the hospital did not have the necessary equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-suffering-from-constipation-undergoes-life-saving-op-in-city/articleshow/83851761.cms||---

All seven BJP candidates in the fray won while only one of the two candidates from AAP was victorious. Of the 12 seats, four BJP candidates Swati Sosa, Ranjan Goswami, Rajendra Kapadiya and Vinod Gajera were declared uncontested winners earlier. Election for the remaining eight seats was held on Friday. In SMC, BJP has 93 councillors against 27 from AAP. For the 12 NPSS seats, BJP had initially fielded 10 candidates while AAP had two candidates. But Rakesh Bhikhadiya, a BJP councillor, jumped into the fray as an independent candidate. AAP had earlier expressed fears of an attempt by BJP to ensure the victory of their additional candidate. On Friday, the voting took place between 3 to 5 pm and the counting started at 5.30 pm. Soon after counting as AAP’s Ramesh Parmar lost, his party members started a protest. Cops even detained a few AAP leaders. “The election officials refused to hold recounting on our demand. They also refused to show us the ballot papers. Since our demands were not accepted we started a protest,” said Dharmesh Bhanderi, leader of opposition in SMC. “AAP leaders used abusive language and misbehaved with women. Voting and counting was held by AAP leaders. They were shown all ballot papers and after all agreed two ballot papers were cancelled. The process was held in a transparent manner,” said Hemali Boghawala, city mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ruckus-at-smc-after-npss-election/articleshow/83855886.cms||---

Thirty-seven-year-old Seema, who had 96% lung infection, had a miraculous escape from death, not once but thrice over the last 59 days that she has been under treatment. Thanks to the doctors and a benevolent crowdfunding effort that raised lakhs of rupees for her treatment, Seema, mother of 20-month-old twin daughters, has won a long battle and may be back home soon. “These have been the most difficult days of my life as my wife was in a very critical condition. I thought I lost her when she was on a ventilator and her oxygen levels kept dipping. But due to the efforts of the doctors and many donors, Seema is now recovering well,” said Suresh, who drives a taxi for a living. Seema had tested positive for coronavirus on April 27 and was admitted to two different hospitals over the next 12 days before being brought to Bhailal Amin General Hospital (BAGH) on May 9. “When we did CT scan, her lungs appeared all white as there was 96% infection. She was in critical condition and used to feel drowsy when kept on ventilator. We even did tracheostomy as she was unable to breathe. There was bleeding in her lungs so we couldn’t give her blood thinner too,” said Dr Manish Mittal, MD (physician) who treated her along with Dr Haresh Shah, consulting pulmonologist at BAGH. Whenever doctors thought that she was stable, Seema’s condition suddenly worsened. “Her health deteriorated for the third time a couple of weeks ago and we thought that she won’t survive. But Seema later responded well to the treatment and her oxygen requirement has come down to two litres now. She may be discharged within a week,” Mittal told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mother-of-twin-toddlers-with-96-lung-infections-beats-death-thrice/articleshow/83854692.cms||Tushar Tere

They were booked in Rajkot Taluka police station following a complaint lodged by 71-year-old Kanti Patel, a resident of Panchsheel Complex. The complaint was lodged against Milan Makwana (27), Dolubha Somania (49), Jitendra Gajera (42), Harshukh Chauhan (45) and one unknown person for the grabbing the land that was registered in Patel’s father Bhurabhai’s name. “An unknown person forged the documents of the land owned by Bhurabhai in the year 2001 and sold it to Makwana. Later, Makwana sold this land to Rajiv Godhania in 2018. We have arrested Makwana, Somania and Chauhan.

---||Ranchi||Saryu Rai seeks inquiry into Jharkhand's Foundation Day ‘scam’||RANCHI: Jamshedpur (East) Independent MLA and former BJP leader Saryu Rai, who had vowed to make public the corrupt activities of the then chief minister, Raghubar Das, has written to incumbent chief minister Hemant Soren to order a probe into the alleged “scam” during the Statehood Day celebrations in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, when Rai was with BJP, the then saffron party government under Das had spent Rs 9.5 crore for the Statehood Day celebrations. During an event of the celebrations, ‘prabhat feri’, the government had spent Rs 5 crore on T-shirts and Rs 35 lakh on toffees for distribution to the participating school students. Rai, who is demanding a probe either by the anti-corruption bureau of the state government or the CBI, said the expenditure of Rs 5.35 crore on T-shirts and toffees is not only extravagant but also grossly mismatched the volume of the claimed purchases and the actual number of participants. The Independent MLA had already raised the issue in the last budget session after which an assembly committee is looking into it. He had also filed a writ petition in the Jharkhand high court, which is hearing the matter currently. Rai said that there is no rule preventing the state government from referring it to a competent investigating agency despite the matter being heard in court. “The government need not wait for the direction of the court to order a probe,” he claimed. Elaborating on the issue, Rai in his letter to Soren said in 2016, the then government had placed an order to buy toffees and T-shirts to Jamshedpur-based traders — Lalla Enterprises and Prakash Sharma respectively — without floating tenders. “Lalla Enterprises never purchased stocks or sold toffees to the government either in 2016 or 2017 but was paid Rs 35 lakh out of which the firm paid a GST of Rs 4 lakh to the commercial taxes department. To further cover up the matter, the commercial taxes department slapped a fine of Rs 17 lakh on Lalla Enterprises later,” Rai’s letter reads. He further said a similar bungling occurred in the matter of T-shirt purchase as Prakash Singh, the local agent for Ludhiana-based Kudu Fabrics, received payment of Rs 5 crore but the commercial taxes department neither issued any road permit nor is aware of the consignment being ferried by road or railways. “How was this huge consignment brought to Jharkhand from Ludhiana is not known to anyone,” Rai said. During the same ceremony, the government had organized a musical night by Sunidhi Chouhan for which she was paid Rs 55 lakh. Rai said the event was approved by Das in a meeting held on November 9, 2016, on the recommendation of his senior personal secretary. “During the meeting, Rs 44 lakh was proposed as the cost of the event but later the singer was paid Rs 55 lakh,” Rai said, drawing attention to another musical night of Chauhan organised by Surya Mandir Samity, Jamshedpur, on the occasion of Chhath on November 9, 2016. “Das happens to be the convener of that temple committee and whether the payment for that event was made from the government fund and resulted in the escalation of the cost of the Statehood Day celebrations, needs to be checked,” Rai said. His letter claims that while Rs 9.5 crore was spent in 2016, the budget went further up to Rs 12 crore in 2017. “These expenses should be audited and verified by a competent authority and since some purchases involve other states, CBI should be assigned to handle the probe,” Rai demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/saryu-seeks-inquiry-into-state-foundation-day-scam/articleshow/83855863.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The deceased was identified as P Rama Rao. The incident happened at around 11 am on the Durga Agraharam main road. Suryaraopet circle inspector NV Suryanarayana said three persons hacked Rao to death following a heated argument and fled from the spot. As per preliminary investigation, the accused — identified as Kukkala Ravi, Kukkala Hemanth Kumar and Shaik Kareem Jaan — happened to be friends with Rama Rao for several years. Dispute cropped up between Ravi and Rao over the former’s extramarital affair with the deceased’s cousin. Despite several warnings, Ravi continued with the relationship. Two days ago, the four of them reportedly had some argument over the issue. On Friday, Ravi came prepared with his two friends and after another heated argument, stabbed him repeatedly, killing him on the spot.

---||Amaravati||Row over Amaravati lesson in SSC syllabus||AMARAVATI: A lesson on capital city Amaravati and efforts of the then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu to make it a world class city has put the school education department in a spot as it has been struggling to remove the chapter from SSC Telugu text book for the past two years. The syllabus for the SSC was revised and new chapters were included in 2018 and the department could go for another revision after 2023. However, the decision of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government to downsize the capital city Amaravati to just legislative capital city has led to the confusion among academicians in the education department as how to handle the sensitive chapter on Amaravati. Sources said several YSRC legislators have expressed their displeasure with the education department for continuing the lesson even a year after enactment of a law about three capital cities. The lesson Amaravati went on to describe the capital city as one of the best cities in the world. “Amaravati means that it has no death. Once lit as capital city of Satavahana Kings, Amaravati is going to become another lifeline of Navyandhra,” it said. It also said that Amaravati is going to be one of the top cities in the country thanks to the efforts being made by the government. The lesson says the foundation laying ceremony of the capital city was held on a grand scale with national and international representatives attending the ceremony. The government collected water and soil from rivers and holy shrines from across the country and performed pujas at the foundation laying ceremony. Interestingly, the writer of the lesson went on to tell the students that (the then) chief minister Chandrababu Naidu vowed to put Amaravati on the global map as the best city and make it a pride of Telugu people across the world. The lesson details the plans of the then state government to build nine cities within Amaravati to make it unique in the country. “Undavalli will become tourism city, Krishnayapalem as health city, Bethapudi as electronic city, Sakhamuru as knowledge city, Inavolu as education city, Rayapudi as administration city, Nelapadu as justice city, Abbarajupalem as sports city, Uddandarayunipalem as finance city, Ananthavaram as temple city,” the lesson explained. In reality, the YSRC government had brought all the works in the Amaravati to a grinding halt about two years ago. When contacted, educationn minister Dr Adimulapu Suresh said that they would take corrective measures on the issue. “It is an optional lesson for the SSC students. We are looking into the issue,” said Dr Suresh. YSRC MLC Lella Appireddy demanded that the lesson should be immediately dropped from the text book. He said that it was ridiculous to include such an issue as a lesson in textbooks. “It is nothing but misleading the young brains with false information,” said Appireddy.

---||Goa||TTAG: Need to space out events through yr||Panaji: Module five and six of the tourism master plan were discussed last week wherein members of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) suggested that tourism events be planned and spread over the year as they are otherwise mostly scheduled during peak season. One suggestion was that Goa tourism must have a statistical centre so that the actual tourist arrival numbers are known, a member of the trade body said. “Currently, we do not know the exact arrivals as even inbound locals are counted. We need to have a statistical centre,” the member said. Stakeholders and officials of the tourism department discussed the last two modules of the 25-year vision document of Goa tourism that has outlined the areas on which the destination should concentrate and develop. Deliberations veered towards ways to proceed post-pandemic, an official said. Goa’s tourism policy was approved in October 2020. It has outlined that the destination has to focus on eco and hinterland tourism rather than only on beach tourism. “Some also pointed out that we need to increase the spending of the current tourists and focus on raising value rather than volume,” he said. Prior to the pandemic, domestic tourism was on the rise while the number of international travellers had dropped. While there has been a drop in charter tourist arrivals for the last few years, tourism department data shows an overall rise in international tourists, though marginal, for the last five to six years. “Even as charter tourist arrivals have dropped, the number of FITs has risen,” a tourism official said. TTAG has disputed the department’s statistics. Stakeholders suggested that whenever any new project is proposed by the department, locals of the area must first be taken into confidence, and informed what the project is about and how it will benefit them, a TTAG member said. “In the past, several projects have been shelved following people’s opposition. Some go to court opposing a project and in the bargain much time and resources are wasted. If people of the area don’t want a proposed project, this has to be known earlier,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ttag-need-to-space-out-events-through-yr/articleshow/83856307.cms||Bindiya Chari

We need to ensure that our borders are secure to prevent the variant from entering Goa. Till date, no delta-plus case has been detected in Goa,” he said. While Delta-plus has not been detected in Goa so far, reports of over 80 samples sent to the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), over a month-and-a-half ago, are yet to be received. Following directives of the Centre, every fortnight 15 samples drawn from Goa Medical College (GMC), North Goa district hospital and a private hospital in South Goa, that conducts conventional RT-PCR, are sent for genome sequencing. Two more hospitals — Sub-district hospital, Ponda and South Goa district hospital, Margao — will also send samples for genome sequencing. “It is necessary that Goa has its own facility for genome sequencing and doesn’t have to wait for months,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-ensure-strict-checks-at-border-rane/articleshow/83856385.cms||---

Union ministry of housing and urban affairs released the results of CSCAF 2.0 during an online event on Friday to commemorate six years of the three transformative urban missions — Smart Cities Mission, Atal Mission for Urban Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (urban). CSCAF 2.0 was launched in September last year. Intended as a tool for cities to evaluate their current performance and build on the same, the framework has 28 diverse indicators covering 96 data points across five thematic areas. A total of 126 cities, including 100 smart cities and 26 cities with population of over 500,000, participated in the 2020 assessment cycle. The framework provides an assessment of both mitigation and adaptation measures. The ministry of housing and urban affairs conducts the assessment on an annual basis. Of the 126 cities, the top nine performing cities have been awarded 4-star rating, including Surat, Indore, Ahmedabad, Pune, Vijayawada, Rajkot, Visakhapatnam, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Vadodara. Meanwhile, Tirupati has got several awards in the India Smart Cities award contest (ISAC). Under the ‘social aspects’ theme, Tirupati got first place for its ‘health benchmark for municipal schools’ project. The temple city stood in third place for its ‘renewable energy generation’ project under ‘urban environment’ theme. Tirupati and Indore are the joint winners in the sanitation category, while the temple city shared the second place with Agra in the economy category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-vij-get-4-star-rating-in-climate-framework/articleshow/83849987.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The state government asked district collector to hand over land required to the AP Maritime Board to begin the first phase work. The government noted that it would require at least 800 acres in the first phase and about 3,200 acres for the second phase. The state government also instructed the district collector to acquire about 50 acre land for resettlement and rehabilitation of oustees. The state government is taking up Ramayapatnam port as non-major port with a cost of Rs 3,736 crore. Although the state government wanted to launch the works last November itself, it got delayed due to Covid-19. Amidst fierce bidding, the Hyderabad based Aurabindo Reality and Infrastructure-Navayuga Construction Company (NCC) joint venture emerged lowest bidder-1 as they quoted well below the Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) benchmark value during the reverse tendering process. Initially, Aurabindo-NCC JV quoted about 4.5 per cent higher than the EPC while the other bidder Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (Meil) quoted 4.9 per cent higher than the base price. However, the Aurabindo lowered its bid during the reverse tendering to snatch the deal. Interestingly, Aurabindo recently took over the Kakinada Seaports Limited in the state and Ramayapatnam port would be its second port asset if the bids were cleared. Following the instructions from the state government, the district administration swung into action to complete land acquisition for the Ramayapatnam port. Sources said that about 800 acres would be acquired in Ravuru and Chevuru villages of Kandukur assembly constituency. The district administration has identified 323 acres government land for the first phase and started taking over the land. However, the locals who had occupied the government land have demanded compensation before evacuation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/land-acquisition-begins-for-ramayapatnam-port/articleshow/83850043.cms||Samdani MN

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy revision petitions: HC to examine admin panel report||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Friday said it will pass orders in the suo moto criminal revision petitions against chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy after examining the administrative committee report. Justice K Lalitha directed the court’s registrar (judicial) to place the report before the bench in a sealed cover. Earlier on Wednesday, advocate general S Sriram contended that the process adopted by the high court in taking up suo moto cognizance of criminal revision petitions was based on the administrative committee report. He argued that the decision must be taken by the judicial side of the HC, not the administrative side. The high court had taken suo moto cognizance into either dropping of cases or filing closure reports by police in as many as 11 cases against the chief minister. The court observed that the cases were dropped in a hurried manner and without application of judicial mind, soon after the Supreme Court’s directions to expedite disposal of cases against public representatives. Justice Lalitha said the report by the administrative committee of the high court will be verified before passing any orders in the matter. Sriram requested to have a copy of the report, to which the judge said that a copy would be supplied if any notices are given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-revision-petitions-hc-to-examine-admin-panel-report/articleshow/83850087.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The court earlier took suo moto cognizance of the letter written by Ramakrishna’s son complaining that his father faced threat to his life in jail. Government pleader Maheswar Reddy argued that the grievance of the petitioner was addressed and the accused was shifted from Chittoor sub-jail to Pileru sub-jail. As he has also been released on bail, the petition can be closed, Reddy said. However, the bench said the suo moto petition was taken up to decide whether the police followed Supreme Court guidelines while arresting a judicial officer. The bench also asked why the government did not file an affidavit even after the orders of the high court. Reddy said the apex court guidelines are applicable to judicial officers in service but in the present case the accused judicial officer was in suspension and hence no prior permission was taken. He sought time to file the counter with all details pertaining to the arrest, following which the matter was posted for further hearing on July 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/high-court-quizzes-govt-on-judicial-officers-arrest/articleshow/83850124.cms||Srikanth Aluri

ED arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande, of the rank of additional collector, and personal assistant Kundan Shinde past midnight Friday. It quizzed Deshmukh’s son Salil who was at their Nagpur home. The ED is following a trail of Rs 4 crore that the agency believes is part of the money collected by dismissed cop Sachin Waze from12 bars and passed on to Deshmukh. ‘Param Bir’s charges baseless’The money collected from bar owners was deposited into accounts of shell companies and then diverted to an entity associated with the Deshmukh family,” said a source. Anil Deshmukh’s official bungalow at Malabar Hill, his residences at Worli in Mumbai, Nagpur, and the houses of Palande and Shinde were among those that were searched on Friday. Friday’s action came on the back of earlier searches of premises linked to Deshmukh by the CBI and ED. Deshmukh, who was present in his Worli home during the search, later said, “After his transfer from Mumbai police commissioner’s post, Param Bir Singh made baseless allegations against me. There’s no truth in that and I will cooperate in the probe.” Lashing out at Param Bir, Deshmukh alleged on Friday that all officers involved in planting of explosives and murder of Mansukh Hiran were directly reporting to him and so he can’t escape responsibility. “When we found that the role of Param Bir was suspicious and that all the officers involved in the serious crime were his trusted men, we shunted him out. So long as he was Mumbai police commissioner, he had maintained a discreet silence. A day after he was shifted, he made baseless allegations. My contention is that if he was so serious about corruption, he should have made the allegations when he was Mumbai CP,” he said. He said, “ I’m not involved in corrupt practices. Param Bir levelled charges of corruption against me only after he was shunted out from the Mumbai CP post.” (With inputs from Prafulla Marpakwar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-on-rs-4cr-hafta-trail-searches-maharashtra-ex-mininsters-properties/articleshow/83861580.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||India||Narada case: SC sets aside HC’s order refusing to accept Didi reply||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday set aside the Calcutta high court’s order refusing to accept affidavits of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and law minister Moloy Ghatak in the ongoing proceedings relating to grant of bail to four Trinamool leaders arrested in the Narada scam. The SC allowed the two to make a fresh request to the HC to accept their affidavits. A bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari said the CM and the law minister could file fresh applications by Monday requesting the HC to take on record their affidavits, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Banerjee and Ghatak were accused by the CBI of impeding the production of four leaders before a Kolkata trial court. Banerjee and Ghatak were accused of obstructing the production of TMC leaders before the trial court in Kolkata on May 17 by allegedly leading hordes of TMC workers to the CBI office and the trial court and attempting to obstruct the process of law. The duo had dismissed the allegations and moved the SC alleging that the HC was not accepting their affidavits, thus violating the principles of natural justice. For CBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the bench that the HC had issued notices to all respondents on the agency’s petition on May 27 in the presence of West Bengal’s advocate general and that the arguments commenced on a day to day basis from May 31. Mehta said by June 9, the arguments of the CBI and all accused were completed before the HC. The bench told senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the CM and the law minister, that since the arguments had started and were at an advanced stage without the respondents seeking leave to file counter affidavits, the HC could have formed a prima facie view that the two respondents were either not interested in filing responses or had waived off their right to do so. “Petitioners can move the Calcutta HC with fresh applications requesting the affidavits be taken on record and we will set aside the HC’s June 9 refusal order. The HC will hear the applications de novo and take a decision,” the bench said. This was acceptable to Dwivedi but senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the West Bengal government, said if the court could allow the CBI to file affidavits on June 2 without an application, why should there be a separate norm for Banerjee and Ghatak by asking them to file applications for placing affidavits on record. The bench brushed aside the arguments. In her petition, Banerjee said, “There is no evidence of her holding a dharna or gherao outside the CBI office, and are thus false allegations. She did not visit the CBI office in her capacity as CM, but as a citizen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/narada-case-sc-sets-aside-hcs-order-refusing-to-accept-didi-reply/articleshow/83861629.cms||---
---||India||‘Home emissions cause 25% pollution deaths’||NEW DELHI: One-fourth of air pollution-linked deaths in India are due to residential emissions where solid biofuel combustion contributes to the ambient fine particulate matter PM2.5, the first global source apportionment study said. The study, published in Nature Communications, analysed number of deaths, which could be attributable to exposure to air pollution from specific sources in 2017 and ’19. It identified 15 polluting sources with residential emissions from biofuels burning (indoor air pollution due to emission from cooking, heating) resulting in one-fourth of the PM2.5 share, followed by industry (14.8%) and energy (12.5%) in 2017 and 2019. The total attributable deaths due to PM2.5 in the country are estimated at 866,566 and 953,857 in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The analysis underlined that one-fourth of these deaths could be avoided by eliminating solid biofuel combustion, primarily used for residential heating and cooking. The study claimed that globally, 1 million deaths were avoidable in 2017 by eliminating fossil-fuel combustion, with coal contributing to over half. It also noted that China and India with 58% of total global ambient PM2.5 mortality burden together accounted for the largest numbers of attributable deaths. The analysis has been done based on a global chemical transport model with newly available high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) satellitederived PM2.5 exposure estimates, and national baseline burden estimates updated from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. “This study provides both a global perspective of the relative importance of different sources and a starting point for the many countries of the world who have yet to address air pollution as a health concern,” said Michael Brauer, lead researcher on the study. The study also noted that sources vary at the sub-national scale, highlighting the importance of developing regional air quality mitigation strategies. Citing examples, it said while residential emissions are the largest source of average PM2.5 exposure and attributable mortality in China and India, areas surrounding Beijing and Singrauli (Madhya Pradesh) have relatively larger contributions from the energy and industry sectors. Though India had always expressed doubt over such air pollution-linked death figures saying these were the estimates based on “models, simulations and extrapolations”, it did not deny air pollution as “one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases”. The government in India had on a number of occasions said that there was no conclusive data available in the country to establish “direct correlation” of death/ disease exclusively due to air pollution. Reacting on such studies throwing an estimated number of deaths, it said, “Health effects of air pollution are a synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc. of the individuals." As far as indoor air pollution is concerned, India had in 2016 launched ‘Ujjwala Yojana’ – a scheme to provide deposit free LPG (cooking gas) connections to poor households. The scheme has been recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the decisive interventions by the government to address the issue of residential emission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/home-emissions-cause-25-pollution-deaths/articleshow/83861641.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The move follows a prod from the state government, which has announced a series of measures at the state hospitals to improve paediatric care infrastructure. AMRI Hospitals has set up a four-member paediatric task force to oversee a dedicated paediatric Covid unit at its Mukundapur branch. The 100-bed unit will be housed at the hospital’s new building. “The committee includes a paediatric surgeon apart from experts in neonatal, paediatric care and critical care. They will meet regularly to formulate a definite strategy in case a large number of children get affected and have to be admitted during the third wave,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. He added that out of the 100 beds, 60 will be for critical care. This apart, AMRI is ready to use 40 beds on two floors at its Salt Lake annexe building for Covid-affected kids. The 42-bed paediatric unit at Belle Vue will be converted into a paediatric Covid unit if patients start coming in, said CEO P Tondon. “We have already attended a virtual meeting with state health officials and received the guidelines. We are ready with all arrangements and have also kept paediatric ventilators, oxygen and other equipment ready,” added Tondon. He said even orders for hospital robes for children have been placed. At Peerless Hospital, five cabins have been ‘tentatively’ identified to accommodate mothers and children. A ward with more than a dozen beds, too, have been earmarked for Covid-affected children and their mothers. “We need more space for paediatric Covid patients since most can’t be here alone. We need more space for a parent or a caretaker which will squeeze the space available. But we will utilize every inch possible of our area if necessary,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, 150 beds have been identified for Covid-affected children and their mothers. This includes double-bed facilities to accommodate both mother and child “We have already trained 100 doctors and 100 nurses for the purpose,” said chairperson Alok Roy. Apart from keeping equipment ready, Medica is making arrangements for smaller beds for children. “The whole system will be geared to attend to children since there could be a larger number than we usually treat,” added Roy. AMRI is ready to scale up paediatric facilities if necessary. “To begin with, we will have 140 beds. But we are ready to add more beds if the situation demands,” Barua said, adding that paediatric ventilators are being kept ready. “We are also in talks with some manufacturers to help us convert some adult ventilators into paediatric ones. We will buy some paediatric ventilators, too. Bipaps, too, are being kept ready,” said Barua. Charnock Hospital – which has converted the Haj House into a Covid hospital – plans to use 50 beds at the centre for children and their mothers. The cnetre has 200 Covid beds. “We will have separate arrangements for male and female children,” said managing director Prashant Sharma. Hospitals, however, are not sure if non-Covid mothers will be allowed to stay with infected children. “We are waiting for direction from the ICMR and government on this,” said Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-ready-paediatric-covid-infra-after-govt-nudge/articleshow/83858541.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Delhi||Girl’s brother, cousin fired on couple: Delhi cops||NEW DELHI: Runaway couple Vinay Dahiya and Kiran Dahiya, of Gopalpur village in Haryana, were attacked in their rented home in Amberhai village in Dwarka, on Thursday night. Vinay, 23, died on the spot and Kiran,19, is battling for life in hospital. On Friday, police said Kiran’s kin, including her brother and cousin, had rained bullets on the pair for having defied gotra traditions and married against the family’s wishes. The girl’s father and uncle were taken into custody for questioning. Probes revealed the uncle was bitterly opposed to his niece’s marriage, leading them to seek protection from Punjab and Haryana HC last year. Girl was a major at time of marriage, HC had cancelled case against boyKiran told police that her elder brother, Aman, cousin Vicky and some other men from Gopalpur village were among the group of six armed attackers. She also named some other persons and the cops are verifying this. So far, police said, it was unclear if her uncle had been present during the incident. On Friday when TOI visited the Dahiyas’ rented accommodation, landlady Jyoti said, “The two shifted here on June 20 last year after we gave them the house on rent for Rs 2,000 a month. Around 8.30pm on Thursday, Vinay had gone to buy cold drinks and bread from the store nearby. Fifteen minutes later, we heard loud sounds and screams coming from their house. I initially thought it was a cylinder blast, but I realised these were gunshots. The men chased Vinay, who ran screaming, “Meri biwi ko bachao!” We were frightened and shut ourselves in.” In the CCTV footage of the incident, Vinay can be seen being chased by at least four men. He knocks on some doors for help, but the doors do not open. As he tries to escape, Vinay is shot and collapses opposite a grocery store. He is later found dead with four bullet wounds. Kiran walked up two floors after being shot thrice. She jumped to the adjacent building and called for help. Basanti, a resident of the ground floor of that building, told TOI, “She was drenched in blood and said, ‘Bacha lo.’ I was shivering with fear because I had never seen such a sight in my life. In panic, I rang the doorbells of the other residents. One man came down from the second floor and helped take her to the hospital. The police had arrived by then.” The girl’s father and uncle have been brought to Delhi from Gopalpur village in Sonipat district for interrogation. Santosh Meena, DCP (Dwarka), said, “We are questioning the family members and have also identified the suspects. Various investigative teams are working on the case. Haryana Police had been instructed by Punjab and Haryana High Court to give the couple protection.” The couple had eloped in August 2020 as their families were against their relationship, both being of the same Dahiya gotra and residents of the same village — an absolute taboo for matrimony in Haryana. Gopalpur village is dominated by the Dahiya community and marrying within the clan is prohibited, a panchayat member toldTOI. Apparently, a panchayat was also held when it was learnt that Vinay and Kiran wanted to marry. As per custom, when the couple couldn’t be dissuaded, the village cut off all relations with them and barred them from the village. The couple got married with the help of an NGO at a temple in Panchkula’s Mansa Devi Complex on August 13, 2020, as per court records. Threatened by her family, Kiran filed a plea in Punjab and Haryana High Court a day later, seeking protection. Kiran alleged in her petition that the Sonipat police had colluded with her family and harassed them, naming in particular her mother, Shila Devi, father Jai Bhagwan, brother Aman and seven relatives, Mahabir, Vicky, Mukesh, Sandeep, Shribhagwan, Sunny and Himanshu. Justice Rajmohan Singh ordered the Sonipat SP to ascertain the threat to the couple and take suitable action within a month. However, according to advocate Abhimanyu Kalsy, who represented the couple in the high court, police did not provide adequate security but registered an FIR against Vinay. Kiran’s mother also lodged a complaint in Kharkhoda police station that Vinay had kidnapped her daughter, leading police to register a case for kidnapping a minor girl under sections 363 and 366A of the Indian Penal Code. Vinay approached the high court to seek the quashing of the FIR registered against him, arguing that Kiran, born on May 22, 2002, was a major at the time of their marriage. Responding to Vinay’s petition, sub-inspector Sri Niwas of Sonipat police told the high court on October14 that a case cancellation report had been prepared. On Friday, Sonipat SSP Jashandeep Singh Randhawa told TOI that the high court had issued two directions: cancellation of the case registered against Vinay and police protection for the couple. “We cancelled the case after the production of age proof. The families declared they had severed ties with Vinay and Kiran and the couple could live elsewhere. That is when they moved to Delhi,” said Randhawa. Vinay’s family later accepted their son’s marriage.

Its capital Mumbai also reached a milestone by breaching 50 lakh vaccinations, according to the CoWin portal. Overall, the state has administered 3,02,78,260 doses, which includes 51,28,087 doses given in Mumbai, the highest among districts since the drive started in January. Despite the record, the state has fully vaccinated only 7% (58.21 lakh) of its adult population estimated to be around 8.5 crore. Around 22% or 1.8 crore have been partially vaccinated. As for Mumbai, barely 10% of its adult population is fully vaccinated and roughly 32% has had one jab. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a technical adviser to the state, said Maharashtra must aim to vaccinate 70% of its population with both doses before August if it wants to beat the third wave. “We need to pick up speed in the light of the Delta-Plus detections and wide circulation of the Delta variant,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maha-1st-state-to-administer-3-crore-jabs/articleshow/83861709.cms||Sumitra Debroy

It is the dreaded coronavirus that hangs over their heads like a sword of Damocles in the red corridor spread across Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha. Though vector-borne chikungunya, dengue and malaria had claimed several lives of left-wing extremists operating from the jungles, the deadly effect of Covid-19 on top Maoist guns and cadres in the second wave was deep and stark. Sources in Special Intelligence Branch, the anti-Naxalite intel wing, said several Maoist leaders who are aged and suffering from viral arthritis post chikungunya are now ravaged by Covid-19, resulting in deaths and prolonged hospitalisation. Confirmation by the Maoist party of recent deaths of Telangana State Committee secretary Yapa Narayana alias Haribhushan and party leader Siddaboina Sarakka alias Bharatakka due to Covid-19 is just the tip of the iceberg, say police. Bhadradri Kothagudem district SP Sunil Dutt told TOI, “At least eight Maoist leaders and cadres have died of Covid-19 in the second wave.” Police said around 15-20 others have severe Covid-19 infections, while some Maoists left the cadre due to fear of contracting the virus. A senior officer of anti-Naxalite intelligence told TOI, “Couriers or militia members may have met Maoists in the jungles due to which the virus has transmitted.” Lack of access to medical treatment, consumption of expired food, snake bites and constant exposure to vagaries of nature also add to Maoists’ health woes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/invisible-killer-stalking-maoists/articleshow/83861711.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The ED’s case is based on the UP police FIR that has alleged cross-border support to the accused in their conversion drive. Earlier, the anti-terrrorist squad (ATS) of the UP police arrested two accused from Jamia Nagar in Delhi. The accused, Mufti Qazi Jahangir Alam Qasmi and Mohammad Umar Gautam, ran an outfit called Islamic Dawah Center which had received funds from Pakistan. The police have alleged links of the accused with the Pak's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The ED will carry out its own probe into financial transactions and involvement of others in the case. After the arrest, UP ADG (law & order) Prashant Kumar had told reporters that Gautam, himself a convert to Islam from Hinduism, boasted of having converted at least 1,000 people to Islam, luring them with marriage, money and jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-to-look-into-financial-angle-of-alleged-up-conversions/articleshow/83861740.cms||---

This is because the system is broken. To sell stakes and bring the cash into a broken system is not a good idea. Right now, we will get only 50%-60% benefit for every rupee sold,” he said in reply to a question at a webinar, ‘Tamil Nadu: The Road Ahead’ organized by IIMBAA Chennai on Friday. Thiagarajan also said nothing was on the table. From a timing perspective, it is not the right time and we need a better understanding of several issues at hand. TN has the luxury of several market valuable, tradable, non-core assets which do not have any politically sensitive tag attached to them. These are assets where there is no government management or control, he added. The entire land management system must be fixed and the biggest barrier to get large industrial development is large land parcels, which need efficient management, the finance minister said. On bringing petrol under the GST (goods and services tax), he said, “Would not bring a single thing under GST till the system is restructured. The GST system is very badly designed and constituted and requires restructuring.” He stressed logical people must evaluate if the initially set goal was achieved, and if not, restructure the GST itself. I will write my own budget speech, says finance minister: Finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan said he would write his own debut budget speech, due in August. “We will concentrate on the fundamental changes -- on revenue and expenditure management, asset management, audit and accountability -- in the budget in the next year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-plans-for-divestment-in-tamil-nadu-says-finance-minister-ptr-palanivel-thiagarajan/articleshow/83861739.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The bill seeks to provide further right of review and reconsideration in giving effect to the judgment of the International Court of Justice. However, India recently expressed that it is not convinced with Pakistan National Assembly passing a bill to give the right of appeal to Kulbhushan Jadhav in Pakistani high courts.

---||Kolkata||Vaccination drive in top gear as Kolkata Municipal Corporation goes from 24,000 to 50,000 jabs in 24 hours||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Thursday set a record by vaccinating 50,000 citizens across Kolkata — the highest single-day vaccination carried out by the civic body and more than double the previous highest of around 24,000 just a day earlier. Sources said the figure was a distant dream even a week ago and it could be reached after the inclusion of the 18-plus group in the drive. Starting with around 5,000 jabs a day when vaccination was opened up for senior citizens and those above 45 years with co-morbidities, it had been increased to 8,000 when the vaccination ambit was increased to everyone above 45 years. The number had then inched up to 10,000 and stayed at that level till the beginning of May. Sources said the daily vaccination count increased to 15,000 and then 20,000 once vaccine supply eased. “Now that the vaccines are easily available, we will further ramp up the vaccination at the clinics,” a KMC health department official said. The vaccination for the 18-44 category, though, isn’t official and is being carried out by word of mouth at some of the centres. “The ward coordinators have been helpful in roping in people from their areas,” said a civic official. Officials said if more vaccines were available to the civic authority, it could increase the numbers further at its 200 vaccination centres in clinics and community halls and aim for 1 lakh jabs a day. “Right now, we have identified 32 vaccination centres across 16 boroughs where we have started registering members of the 18-plus group. The number of such centres in each borough will be increased steadily, subject to availability of vaccines. Once there are more supplies, we will officially announce the inclusion of the 18-plus group,” said a KMC health department official. Initially, the KMC health department had decided to invite the 18-plus group to register through a chatbot service. Five centres were opened for them, including Bidhan Sishu Udyan, Roxy Cinema and South City International School. In Kolkata, around 24 lakh people have received the first dose while around 6 lakh have received both. In the rest of the state, over 2 crore people have been jabbed till date. Of this, 1.6 crore have received the first dose and around 45 lakh have received both doses. While it had taken the state 120 days to reach the 1 crore milestone, the second crore was achieved in 39 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-drive-in-top-gear-as-kmc-goes-from-24k-to-50k-jabs-in-24-hours/articleshow/83851192.cms||Saikat Ray

Private hospitals used to place indents for about 15,000 to 20,000 doses a day with the health department during the presumed peak in May, which has now dropped to negligible numbers. Andhra Pradesh accumulated about 5.9 lakh Covid-19 cases in May alone, equivalent to 35% of the cumulative cases surfaced in the state by then. Due to the same, the drug became a scarce commodity during the catastrophic second wave. There were several instances of black-marketing with police registering criminal cases against several offenders. The drug used to fetch about 10 times its original price for the touts during the peak in May. But with improving Covid-19 conditions in the last three weeks, Andhra Pradesh has 1.75 lakh Remdesivir doses as of Thursday. The state is currently recording 4,000 to 5,000 daily Covid-19 cases a day. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh drew only 190 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen on Thursday against its daily allocation of 590 MT. For instance, only 23.4 tonnes of oxygen availed from RINL Visakhapatnam Steel Plant on Thursday against the allocation of 135 MT. Similar was the case with other oxygen plants. The state could now manage with the nearby oxygen plants rather than sending the tankers to far-off locations in Odisha and other states. During the first wave last year, Andhra Pradesh had not drawn more than 260 metric tonnes of oxygen on any given day. But the daily consumption crossed the 600-MT mark for several consecutive days in May. In fact, Andhra Pradesh had to get about 4,000 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen through oxygen expresses over and above its daily quota due to the unprecedented demand. The health department had to constitute a state- and district-level oxygen war rooms to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply to the consuming points. However, the increased consumption during the second wave can be explained by the number of patients requiring ICU care. At the peak of the first wave in September last year, only some 1,600 critical cases had required ICU facility, while some 7,000 patients were treated with supplemental oxygen. But during the peak of the second wave in May, about 6,300 patients received intensive care and 22,000 patients were on oxygen beds for several consecutive days, leading to increased oxygen demand. As the daily cases reached manageable range for the state, more than 14,000 oxygen beds and about 2,650 ICU have remained vacant as of Thursday. In all, more than 75% beds at the 329 designated Covid-19 treating facilities are unoccupied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/consumption-of-remdesivir-oxygen-nosedive-in-andhra/articleshow/83849635.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The chief minister addressed the officials on the Covid-19 situation at his Tadepalli camp office on Friday. He said that people were going to other states for treatment and wanted the officials to identify such cases and see that those facilities are made available in the state. When the officials informed him that people were going to other places for treatment for cancer, cardiac and paediatric surgeries, the chief minister directed the officials to invite investment in these sectors in the state. The chief minister said that the construction of 16 new medical colleges, revamping the existing 11 medical colleges and bringing up health hubs will strengthen the health sector in the state.  He said that a special officer must be appointed to see that all hospitals have access to infrastructure, proper sanitation, and to monitor attendance of doctors, nurses, and other staff. On Nadu-Nedu in hospitals, the chief minister said that maintenance should be prioritised in all the works that were taken under Nadu-Nedu initiative and ensure that patients receive better services. He said that all the Aarogyasri, 104 and 108 bills must be paid within 21 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ensure-meds-meet-gmp-who-standards-cm/articleshow/83849653.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Rebel MP K Raghurama Krishnam Raju writes to LS speaker, justifies ‘dissent’||VIJAYAWADA: Narsipatnam MP K Raghurama Krishnam Raju on Friday wrote a letter to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, requesting him not to entertain the disqualification reminder sent to him by YSR Congress Parliamentary party leader V Vijayasai Reddy. The MP said his acts of dissent on various policies and programmes of the AP government were not to be considered as dissidence as his acts do not come under the provisions of anti-defection or any other law. He also cited provisions of the Constitution and judgments of Supreme Court and other courts to justify his stand in criticising the policies and programmes of the government. “If free dissent is construed to give up membership of a political party, it would tantamount to invasion over the right of free speech and expression enshrined in Article 19 (1)(a) of the Constitution,” the MP said in his letter. While stating that denying a member of the assembly a right of ‘dissent’ would itself tantamount to throttling Parliamentary democracy, the MP added that “dissent itself cannot be treated to be defection until and unless the act of floor crossing occurs”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rebel-mp-writes-to-ls-speaker-justifies-dissent/articleshow/83849671.cms||Gopi Dara
