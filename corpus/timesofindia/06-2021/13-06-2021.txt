However, some of the Indian government's actions have raised concerns that are inconsistent with India's democratic values,” Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Dean Thompson told a Congressional panel hearing testimony on democracy in the Indo-Pacific region. “This includes increasing restrictions on freedom of expression and the detention of human rights activists and journalists,” Thompson told the sub-committee, adding the US regularly engages in and on these issues, including the important work of civil society. Increased detention and prosecution of journalists and civil liberties activists in India is drawing attention of their counterparts in US who have found voice in the Biden administration after such issues were sidelined during the Trump era. Administration officials and lawmakers too have raised the issue tactfully and in context. Although the panel heard testimony on poor human rights record in the region, including in China and Pakistan, India is held to a higher standard given its democratic credentials. Thompson told lawmakers the US has been concerned with civil liberties in countries of region, including restrictions on journalists in Pakistan and Bangladesh, but the same thing was now happening in India too, despite the country's very vibrant press that reports very freely on its government. Lawmakers also raised concern about the situation in Kashmir citing constituent inquiries. “Kashmir is one area where we have urged them to return to normalcy as quickly as possible, including we've seen some steps taken: The release of prisoners, the restoration of 4G access, things of that nature. There are other electoral steps we'd like to see them take and that we have encouraged them to do and will continue to do so,” Thompson told the panel. The broader sentiment at the hearing though remained in favor of a strong US-India partnership particularly in the light of China's belligerence, a view Thompson concurred with. “We are, right now, through our global comprehensive strategic partnership with India looking at areas where we can work together to strengthen across the region the effects of the ability of countries to push back on malign influence and through the Quad initiative where we brought in Japan and Australia, as well,” Thompson told the panel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/biden-mandarins-twit-india-on-human-rights-even-as-they-talk-up-broader-ties/articleshow/83469187.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

This month, with states lifting restrictions that were put in place amid the second wave, the number of cases reducing and people stepping out, many have started flouting the mask rule yet again. <p>Over 9 lakh fined in one year in NCR for not wearing mask</p><p><br></p>Whenever there is a drop in the number of coronavirus cases, people tend to stop wearing masks: DoctorsDoctors say that a false sense of security in people who have either been vaccinated or already infected is a major reason for them not following rules like wearing masks. Dr Sandeep Vohra, Senior Consultant, Mental Health & Psychiatry, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, says, “There are various reasons that explain the non-compliance of COVID rules, especially wearing a mask. Whenever the news of dipping COVID numbers has surfaced, we have observed laxity on the part of people. They start engaging in social gatherings and become careless about COVID safety protocols. People also start feeling lethargic about repeatedly following rules, especially when it restricts them in some way or the other, hence, the lack of masks.” 50% of people in India don't wear masksMany experts have said that the sudden and widespread lack of precautions when the number of cases dropped earlier this year was one of the factors behind the deadly second wave in the country. Dr Samir Parikh, Director, Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Science, Fortis, Delhi, adds, “The key aspect comes from social learning. If more people are seen wearing masks, others will also follow, and the opposite also works. Also, the need to restart life as it was before the pandemic makes people not wear masks, without realising that it could be more dangerous and make the current situation last longer.” Dr Sandeep Vohra adds, “People who are not used to restrictions of any sorts often find loopholes that overlook the rules, and hence, in this situation they can find multiple excuses to not wear masks.” Levy heavy penalty on those who flout the mask rule||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-9-lakh-fined-in-one-year-in-ncr-for-not-wearing-mask/articleshow/83464370.cms||Niharika Lal
---||India||Govt says Covid data transparent, junks international media report||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday said it has been transparent in Covid data management and has been urging states and Union Territories to maintain robust reporting mechanism for monitoring district wise cases and deaths on a daily basis. Referring to an article published in Economist which claims that India has suffered “five-to-seven times” excess deaths than the official number, the government said the article — it did not name the publication — in the international magazine is “speculative” and without any basis. It “seems to be misinformed” as it is relying on estimates that are not validated, non-peer reviewed studies and analysis by psephology groups like “Prashnam” and “C-Voter” that were never associated with public health research, the government said. “By their own submission, the magazine states that ‘such estimates have been extrapolated from patchy and often unreliable local government data, from company records and from analyses of such things as obituaries’,” the health ministry said in a strongly worded rebuttal. “The so called ‘evidence’ cited by the magazine is a study supposedly done by Christopher Laffler of Virginia Commonwealth University. An internet search of research studies in scientific database... did not locate this study and the detailed methodology of this study has not been provided by the magazine,” the ministry said. Raising concerns over “unsound analysis” in the article, the government said it is based on “extrapolation of data without any epidemiological evidence”. “Studies used by the magazine are not validated tools for determining mortality rate of any country or region,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-says-covid-data-transparent-junks-international-media-report/articleshow/83470642.cms||---
---||Business||Covid-19 treatment cost to fall as GST rates cut||NEW DELHI: The GST Council on Saturday slashed the levy on several goods used for treatment of Covid-19 – ranging from key medicines and oxygen to hand sanitizers, pulse oximeters and ambulances – while leaving the rate on vaccines unchanged at 5%. The new rates will be applicable for a limited period – until September. The reduction, which will include medicines, such as remdesivir and tocilizumab apart from black fungus drug Amphotericin B, will translate into lower prices for patients who have been hit by the deadly virus. In addition, the Council, comprising state and Union finance ministers, decided that in future any medicine for Covid treatment recommended by the health ministry or pharma department will have a GST rate of only 5%. The move follows recommendations by a group of ministers comprising state finance ministers. While states had sought to push for zero duty on vaccines, something that the Centre had repeatedly said was not feasible, their interest level on the issue seemed to have diminished after the vaccine formula was changed. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the move will not put any pressure on the common man. “Central government is purchasing 75% and is paying GST also. But the impact of this GST on people will be nil since people would be getting vaccines free of cost at government hospitals. Centre is purchasing, and it is given free to people,” Sitharaman said after the Council meeting. The government said that it was not looking at the tax implications of the decisions. “The rate cut has not been done with any cost implications in mind, it has been done so that people get some ease... the decision has been taken to provide ultimate ease to patients,” revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj told reporters. Abhishek Jain, a partner at consulting firm Ernst & Young, said a majority population will not be affected as most people are opting for free-of-cost vaccinations from the government. “For the limited few considering getting vaccinated at private hospitals, the 5% GST will continue to be a factor,” he said. Deloitte India partner Mahesh Jaising said a 5% levy will ensure that the chain for giving credit for tax paid on inputs is intact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-19-treatment-cost-to-fall-as-gst-rates-cut/articleshow/83471071.cms||---
---||India||Digvijaya Singh sets off storm with Article 370 remarks||NEW DELHI: Congress functionary Digvijaya Singh found himself in the middle of a fresh controversy over comments on the Clubhouse platform during a conversation with a Pakistani journalist, where he said the party can consider reversing the Article 370 decision if it returned to office. Dubbing the "Clubhouse" conversation as part of Congress "toolkit", BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that Singh was a "stage manager" for the discussion and he had himself asked the Pakistani journalist to ask such a question. "I request the Congress party to change its name and change INC to ANC (Anti-National ClubHouse). People who hate Modiji have also, in turn, started hating India," Patra said at a press conference. Singh seemed to clarify his comments and also hit back, calling his critics a "bunch of illiterate people" who were unable to identify the difference between "shall and consider", one indicating intent and the other possibility. "A bunch of illiterate people probably do not understand the difference between 'shall' and ‘consider’," he said. Answering a query on relations between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, Digvijaya Singh said, "Democracy was not there in Kashmir when they (Centre) revoked Article 370. Insaniyat (humanity) was not there because they put everyone behind bars. And Kashmiriyat is something which is basically the fundamentals of secularism." "The decision of revoking Article 370 and reducing the statehood of J&K is an extremely, I would say, sad decision, and the Congress party would certainly have a relook on the issue," Singh said, according to excerpts of the Clubhouse conversation available on social media. Singh found support for his views in National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah. "I’m very grateful to Digvijaya Singhji. He has realised sentiments of people as other parties who have also spoken about it... hope govt will look into it again," he said. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said, "The Congress party has clearly stated its position on Jammu & Kashmir in its CWC resolution dated August 6, 2019. This is the only official stance of the party. I urge all senior leaders to refer to the same." He alleged BJP was looking for a controversy to steer the attention away from the government’s poor handling of the pandemic and the havoc it had wreaked. This is, however, not a controversy the party was keen on, given BJP's bid to tag it as a supporter of fringe and extremist causes. Patra said it was Singh who had earlier termed the Pulwama attack just an accident and had called the 26/11 attack a conspiracy of the RSS and also tried to give clean chit to Pakistan at that time. "It is all part of that toolkit. Digvijaya Singh said if Modiji is out of power and Congress's government comes, it will restore Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir," Patra said as BJP looked to again pin Congress as siding with "secessionist" forces. "Congress is speaking the language of Pakistan. By restoring Article 370, does he (Digvijaya Singh) want to fan the flames of terrorism and separatism in Kashmir? Sonia Gandhi, this country needs an answer from you," Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said. Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said rather than instigating Kashmiri brethren, Digvijay Singh must take a lesson in patriotism from average Kashmiris. "Instead of playing to the gallery across the border, Congress must come to terms with the abrogation of Article 370. Jamuriyat was only in the hands of the ruling elite. Insaniyat died when instigators of violence sent their own kids abroad and gave stones to children of common folk," tweeted Puri.

---||India||PM Modi seeks support for TRIPS waiver for Covid tech||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday sought G7's support for the proposal moved at the WTO by India and South Africa for a TRIPS waiver on Covid-related technologies while also committing to India's support to collective efforts at improving global health. Official sources said the PM’s emphasis on keeping open supply chains for raw materials and components to help enhance vaccine production in countries like India received widespread support. Speaking at the first outreach session on health at the G7 summit on Saturday evening, Modi said there is a need for a message of "One World One Health" to be sent out from the meeting. He said there should be "global unity, leadership, and solidarity to prevent future pandemics". In this regard, Modi acknowledged the "special responsibility of democratic and transparent societies" while looking to deepen India's connection with G7 and the Quad formulation. The session, titled "Building Back Stronger — Health", focused on global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and on strengthening resilience against future pandemics. According to an official readout, Modi expressed appreciation for the support and assistance extended to India during the recent Covid surge. The PM said India had adopted a "whole of society" approach to fighting Covid-19, bringing together efforts of the government, industry and civil society. Highlighting India’s use of technology during the pandemic, he added that the country used open source digital tools for contact-tracing and vaccine management. He also conveyed India’s willingness to share its experience and expertise with other developing countries. On Sunday, Modi is expected to speak at two other outreach sessions.

---||World||Biden leads infrastructure plan to rival China’s BRI||LONDON: G7 leaders have pledged to adopt a bold new US-inspired global infrastructure initiative as a rival plan to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to offer an alternative option to low- and middle-income countries, including India, to finance their infrastructure needs. US President Joe Biden and the G7 announced the new plan, called "Build Back Better for the World", on Saturday after the leaders met for a working session on China to discuss "strategic competition" with the communist country. The G7 plan is likely to be welcome news to India, which is concerned about BRI initiatives in its neighbourhood, including in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other small South and Southeast Asian countries. India views the BRI as a way for China to expand its economic and political influence. New Delhi has in the past refused to join the Chinese initiative and objects to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of the BRI, as it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Led by major democracies, the infrastructure partnership will help narrow the over $40 trillion infrastructure need in the developing world, which has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the White House said. A US senior administration official said that Build Back Better for the World "won’t just be an alternative to the BRI, but we believe will beat the BRI by offering a higher-quality choice". Through the scheme the G7 and other "like-minded partners" will coordinate in mobilising private-sector capital in four areas of focus — climate, health & health security, digital technology, and gender equity & equality — with investments from their respective development finance institutions. The investments will be made in a manner consistent with achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement. "Infrastructure investment by a responsible and market-driven private sector, paired with high standards and transparency in public funding, is crucial for long-run development effectiveness and sustainability," the White House said. "This is not about making countries choose between us and China; this is about offering an affirmative, alternative vision and approach that they would want to choose. The needs in the developing world for high-quality infrastructure — whether it’s physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure, health infrastructure, or a way to deal with gender disparities — are large and growing, and made especially worse after the pandemic," the official said. The idea of the Build Back Better World — which stemmed from a conversation between UK PM Boris Johnson and Biden — is to offer an alternative to countries so they won’t have to take on incredible debt, which has happened through the BRI in the past. The US official said the two leaders "recognise that a lot of partners in the developing world are being taken advantage of in some ways through investments that they received with the Belt and Road and other financing deals. The US and many of our partners and friends around the world have long been sceptical about China’s Belt and Road Initiative. We’ve seen the Chinese government demonstrate a lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and a course of approach that’s left many countries worse off. There remains a huge infrastructure gap globally — this is an opportunity to do something meaningful in a way that is different than the current leading option that many countries are resorting to." Biden is also pushing G7 leaders to take stronger action against China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. "The ‘Build Back Better for the World’ plan will bring together G7 countries under the UK’s presidency to develop an offer for high-quality financing for vital infrastructure, from railways in Africa to wind farms in Asia," the UK foreign office said. "The new approach is intended to give developing countries access to more, better and faster finance, while accelerating the global shift to renewable energy and sustainable technology." UK PM Boris Johnson added: "As democratic nations we have a responsibility to help developing countries reap the benefits of clean growth through a fair and transparent system."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/biden-leads-infrastructure-plan-to-rival-chinas-bri/articleshow/83471632.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Congress MLA from Jaipur district’s Chaksu seat, Ved Prakash Solanki, a vocal supporter of Sachin Pilot, claimed on Saturday that some legislators had told him about their phones being tapped. Solanki, however, declined to name these MLAs. He also had no idea who was tapping the their phones and on whose orders. “I do not know if my phone is being tapped or not. I am also not aware if the state government is involved in phone-tapping or not. But some legislators told me about their phones being recorded,” Solanki told TOI. Quick Edit: Jitin Prasada gone, Congress must guard bigger prize Sachin PilotSolanki said these MLAs used an app to check if their phones were being tapped. The Chaksu MLA also claimed that some of these MLAs had even informed the CM about their phone-tapping fears but the latter had laughed off the matter. Read AlsoRajasthan: Over 12 legislators met CM Ashok Gehlot in last three days ahead of cabinet reshuffleChief minister Ashok Gehlot has begun consultations with legislators and party leaders for a cabinet rejig expected by June end or early July, Congress sources said on Saturday.Solanki said the same MLAs informed him that police and intelligence personnel were watching them. “The MLAs also shared (information) about how some government officials had cautioned them against being trapped by the anti-corruption bureau,” Solanki said.  On being asked whether these MLAs belonged to the Sachin Pilot camp, Solanki replied, “They are Congress MLAs.” Reacting to this, Congress chief whip in the assembly Mahesh Joshi said, “These are baseless charges. A responsible person like an MLA should make a public statement after verifying things on proof (sic).” BJP state president Satish Poonia tweeted, “Today again a Congress MLA is saying that many MLAs say their phones are being tapped, spying is happening. Congress should tell who these MLAs are? (sic) Congress is intimidating its own MLAs on the lines of ‘so jaa beta, Gabbar aa jayega’ (dialogue from a Bollywood classic). Congress should tell when will Gabbar come? (sic)” Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, “This is a BJP and RSS ploy to divert public attention from the corruption charges against their members in the bribery deal connected with Jaipur’s sanitation issues (sic).” Last July, when Pilot and 18 Congress legislators had rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot, one of the accusations they had levelled was about illegal phone-tapping.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/turmoil-in-rajasthan-as-pilot-camp-fires-fresh-phone-tap-salvo/articleshow/83471709.cms||---

Two other civilians and three police personnel, including an ASI, were injured in the ambush, which started with grenades being hurled in the direction of the cops on duty before a pair of terrorists emerged from their hiding place to fire several rounds, witnesses said. Slain Sopore residents Manzoor Ahmad Shallah and Bashir Ahmad were part of the morning hustle and bustle in the town's marketplace and the police team had been deployed there to ensure Covid-safety compliance, DGP Dilbag Singh told TOI on the sidelines of a ceremony in honour of the two cops killed in the attack. Constables Showkat Ahmad Parray of Budgam and Waseem Ahmad of Srinagar died of their injuries before they could get medical attention, he said. Inspector general of police (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar, who visited the ambush site, said the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists involved in the attack had been identified as Fayaz War and Mudasir Pandit. Among the injured cops, ASI Mukesh Kumar was moved to a Srinagar hospital for specialised treatment. One the other injured police personnel was identified as SPO Danish Ahmad. DGP Singh said that despite suffering casualties in Saturday's terror attack, J&K police remains in control of law and order across the Valley. "Terrorism is on the decline, with security forces swiftly launching operations in any area the moment they receive inputs about the presence of terror operatives there." The Sopore ambush comes less than two weeks after terrorists shot dead Rakesh Pandita, a BJP municipal committee chairperson from the Kashmiri Pandit community, at Tral in south Kashmir's Pulwama. The killing broke a lull in terror attacks targeting political functionaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-civilians-cop-duo-killed-in-jk-terror-attack/articleshow/83471947.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Among those who tendered resignations include senior leader Syed Mohammed Koya, Andrott Island party district general secretary E K Khaleel and president B C Cheriyakoya. “I resigned in protest against the draconian policies introduced by administrator Praful Khoda Patel who has become a threat to Lakshadweep. These policies which are undemocratic and anti-people need to be rejected,” Khaleel said.  The 12 BJP members who on Friday gave up the party’s primary membership include Abdul Hameed, Wakf board member Ummul Kulus and Khadi board member Saifulla Pakkiyoda. All 12 of them are residents of Chetlat Island, from where Aisha also hails. Earlier, P P Mohammed Hashim, the general secretary of the BJP’s Yuva Morcha in Lakshadweep, and eight other party members had resigned, protesting the draft laws proposed by the new island administration. The eight others include former state vice president MC Muthukoya. Patel is scheduled to visit the islands from June 14 to 20. Besides conducting a field visit to the proposed site for a hospital in Kavaratti, Patel will also inspect presentations on the proposed smart city and eco-tourism projects. The visit has been scheduled at a time when the islanders are up in arms against the policies of Patel. Meanwhile, Kerala general education minister V Sivankutty on Saturday called Sultana over phone and promised support to her fight against the “oppressive” administration in Lakshadweep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lakshadweep-bjp-netas-quit-over-aisha-sedition-case/articleshow/83472570.cms||---

While he was into backchannel talks with Ghosh at his residence, posters were put up at Bankra by Bankra TMC against his possible reinclusion into Trinamool fold. Banerjee timed the “courtesy call” after his controversial post on social media against BJP’s “overdependence” on Delhi on the day when Bengal BJP had called a state office-bearers’ meeting. He didn’t attend it. On Saturday, he reached Ghosh’s residence around 5.30pm. Sources said the two spoke at length on the current political scenario. “The government has come with a huge mandate just a month back. If anyone tries to dislodge this government or tries to create disturbances on communal lines, people will reject that,” he said after the meeting. “I came to North Kolkata to meet an ailing relative. I thought of dropping by at Kunal da’s residence,” he added. “Don’t interpret my visit as a step towards any political decision,” he said.

Gold shops that used to draw thousands of consumers every day now lie deserted. As per statistics from the Vijayawada Bullion Merchants Association, buyers from six districts in the state visit the gold market in the city. The market registers a turnover of Rs 15 crores per day on regular days and as much as Rs 25 crores during the festival and wedding seasons. The situation changed overnight with Covid-19. Around half of all traders stopped their operations with the second wave of Covid-19 and the surge in cases in May. “We usually register huge sales in May, which is the biggest wedding season. But weddings now are low-key events due to Covid-19 and people have minimised gold purchases. It is getting tough for us to continue our daily activities on account of poor sales,” said Prakash Jain, a gold merchant from Main Bazaar in One Town. The skyrocketing price of gold is another factor for the sudden fall in sales. “Gold had become an investment option after stock markets crashed with Covid-19. It created a sudden demand for gold as investment. But no retail consumer is coming forward to buy gold jewellery,” said K Ramesh, a functionary of Vijayawada Jewellers Association. Meanwhile, 6,800 workers dependent on the gold market in the city are bearing the brunt of the curfew and the partial lockdown. “The situation of gold workers is pathetic. Sales of jewellery have come down and 60% of jewellery marts in the city are closed. Workers from Rajasthan are the most affected. The government should step in,” said V Bhavanarayana, chief functionary at Kamakshi Swarnakara Sangam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bullion-market-in-vij-loses-sheen/articleshow/83467318.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Allahabad||HC grants bail to Mahoba man accused of forceful conversion||Revised (Name of the victim and her husband removed) Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Friday granted bail to a person accused of abduction, rape and forceful conversion, while doubting the ‘conduct’ of the victim, a married woman, who has alleged that the bail applicant used to physically exploit her and was compelling her to change her religion. "The bail applicant and the victim were in a relationship for the last four years when there was no UP’s anti-conversion law. All of a sudden, after the coming of this Ordinance into existence, she got aware about her rights. Her mental thinking exposed her conduct,” the court observed while pronouncing its judgment on June 11. However, while passing the above order, the court made it clear that observations made while granting bail to the applicant should not in any way affect the trial judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses. Granting bail to one Munna Khan of Mahoba district of UP, who is accused of abduction, rape and under Section 3, 5(1) of UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance-2020, Justice Rahul Chaturvedi observed, “She (victim) was a willful and active participant in all actions faced by her during last four years. Cumulative effect of all above factors clearly indicate that the victim was interested to remain in the company of the applicant, and even after her marriage she wanted to maintain the relationship with him.” The applicant’s counsel said that the present FIR was lodged by the woman against the applicant and his sister on March 4, 2021, under sections of IPC and UP’s anti-conversion Ordinance at Kotwali police station of Mahoba district, alleging that she and accused Munna Khan reside in the same mohalla of district Mahoba. "It is further alleged in the FIR that the applicant had taken certain obscene photographs and videos of the victim and used them as a tool of blackmailing her to maintain physical relationship. This relationship continued for the past four years without any objection, resistance or complaint to anyone," the counsel said. "Thereafter, on December 8, 2020, the victim got married with another man and went to Delhi. It is stated by the victim in her statements recorded under sections 161 and 164 of CrPC that she came back from Delhi to Mahoba on February 18, 2021. Thereafter, from February 18, 2021 to March 2, 2021 she remained in the company of the applicant at Orai along with her sister, where the applicant used to ravish her and started compelling her to change her religion," the applicant's counsel further said. While directing the applicant to be released on bail, the court further observed, “From the ossification test it is clear that the victim is aged about 19 years. She has not received any formal education. She resides in the same locality where the applicant resides. In such circumstances, it is unswallowable proposition that in a small city like Mahoba, she was not aware about the background of the applicant or about his religion for four good years. Besides this, there is no recovery of any obscene still photograph or video, which is said to have been used for blackmailing, by the police during the course of investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-grants-bail-to-mahoba-man-accused-of-forceful-conversion/articleshow/83468721.cms||---
---||Patna||Minister Mukesh Sahani reminds NDA allies of 19 lakh job promise||PATNA: VIP chief and animal and fisheries resources minister, Mukesh Sahani, has reminded the constituents of the ruling NDA in Bihar of their poll promises to provide jobs to 19 lakh youths after coming back to power. Reacting to a recent spat between the NDA coalition partners over some issues, Sahani suggested the NDA allies to concentrate on the promises made to the people before the state assembly election. “I would request all the NDA allies to work on fulfilling the promise to generate 19 lakh jobs for youths rather than wasting time in making statements against each other,” Sahani wrote on his Twitter handle. The VIP is part of the NDA government led by the chief minister (CM), Nitish Kumar. The party has its four MLAs in the 243-member legislative assembly. Sahani was sworn in as a cabinet minister after the formation of the government in November last year. Sahani, popularly known as the ‘son of mallah’, said there was nothing wrong in reminding ruling coalition partners of the promises made to the people during elections. He further said, “We all are accountable to the people, who elected their representatives in the hope that something better would happen. We should not forget it.” Asked about his conversation with a senior leader of the RJD over the phone, the VIP chief said it was not for public consumption. “Ise parde mein rahne dijiye (let it remain under wraps),” he asserted. Sahani also wrote a letter to the CM requesting him to restore the previous system of expenditure by MLAs in their respective constituencies. “The power should be vested with the legislators,” he opined. Sahani’s statement assumed significance in the wake of a meeting between former CM and HAM (S) chief, Jitan Ram Manjhi, and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad’s elder son, Tej Pratap Yadav, in Patna on Thursday. Sahani had also called on Manjhi recently to endorse the demand of the functionaries of the three-tier panchayati raj institutions to extend their term till the polls were held in the state. HAM (S) has four MLAs in the assembly. What is more important is the fact that Manjhi has been critical of the BJP of late.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-mukesh-sahani-reminds-nda-allies-of-19-lakh-job-promise/articleshow/83468548.cms||Ramashankar

The investigators have got evidence that the accused had been trying to woo the girl, who worked in a business process solutions company, over last couple of months and they took advantage of her circumstances. “The rape seems to be a planned one. Nazeem Mirza and Dishant Kahar, who were colleagues of the girl, had been prying on her for the last couple of months. All the three had become good friends so the accused knew that she stayed alone and wasn’t getting along with her father,” said a senior police official. The accused are in police custody. “Both Kahar and Mirza had been trying to woo her and even coaxing her to give into their demands. During investigations, we came across the chats that the duo had with the girl. They knew that she was feeling lonely and had psychological issues. So, they thought of taking advantage of her situation,” the official told TOI. On Tuesday evening, Nazeem and Dishant went to the girl’s residence when her friend Radhika (name changed) was also present. After Radhika left, the duo left only to return after a while. “Nazeem brought liquor with him. The idea was to get the girl drunk and then commit rape. The crime wasn’t a spur of the moment decision but a pre-planned one,” the official added. Dishant forced himself upon the girl who tried to resist but failed as she was in an inebriated condition. Nazeem too is suspected to have raped her in a drunken state. When the girl’s boyfriend Shivam (name changed), came to her residence he spotted the accused there along with the girl. Seeing the girl’s condition, he immediately called her father but Dishant and Nazeem had left by then. Shivam took the girl to her father’s residence where she committed suicide on Thursday morning. The girl’s father knew that she was raped but he didn’t file any complaint. “Had the suicide not happened, the rape incident wouldn’t have come to light too. It’s very unfortunate,” said Shamsher Singh, Vadodara police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/accused-duo-had-pre-planned-teens-rape-cops/articleshow/83468861.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat sees rise in diabetes cases triggered by corona||AHMEDABAD: Anil Mehta, 48, a real estate broker, had never tested positive for blood sugar in his biannual medical checks. He did not have risk factors like hypertension or even obesity and lived a medicine-free, healthy lifestyle including one hour walk daily. A severe Covid-19 illness which required hospitalization due to 80% lung involvement however saw him testing positive for uncontrolled sugar levels over 500 mg/dl. Six months after surviving Covid-19, Mehta is now a diabetic who pops two pills a day to keep his sugar levels in check. “Covid has given me diabetes as a parting gift,” says Mehta who has struggled hard with diet and exercise to finally get his sugar in check. Gujarat, the diabetes capital of India, seems poised for a jump in number of diabetics post Covid-19 as experts report a perceptible rise in diabetes either triggered by or detected during Covid-19 infection period. “A global analysis published in Journal of Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism last year demonstrated that 14.4% of patients hospitalized with severe Covid-19 developed diabetes. Nationally, experts are estimating 1 crore diabetics will be added due to Covid pandemic,” says senior endocrinologist Dr Sanjeev Phatak who has personally treated 80 patients who were diagnosed with diabetes after a Covid infection in the pandemic year. “Covid may attack insulin-producing beta cells of pancreas either resulting in cells to fail or impair their function triggering high blood sugar levels — diabetes. Steroid use may also trigger diabetes, though it is generally temporary and reversible,” says Dr Phatak. Experts say pre-existing risk factors like obesity, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle and stress induced by the pandemic may also be trigger-points. “In many patients with risk factors, Covid fast-tracked manifestation of diabetes. In many cases, it is possible diabetes was present but undetected,” said diabetologist Dr Bansi Saboo. Dr Saboo said that a national study including patients in Gujarat is underway to study the role played by Covid-19 infection in precipitating diabetes and if it was a permanent disease or a temporary metabolic alteration which resolved as inflammation resolved or effects of steroids wore off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-sees-rise-in-covid-triggered-diabetes-cases/articleshow/83470267.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Ahmedabad||Political activity in Gujarat gains pace as Covid ebbs||AHMEDABAD: Amid a steady drop in Covid-19 positive cases in Gujarat, there has been a flurry of political activity in the state with speculation of major changes in the state BJP. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is set to up the ante with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s visit on Monday. The ebbing of the deadly corona wave apparently has given way to a flood of political action with eyes on the 2022 assembly polls. And although the BJP took pains to stress that the visit of national leader and Gujarat in-charge Bhupender Yadav was a “party building” exercise as organizational meetings could not be held during the pandemic second wave, speculation refused to die down that Yadav was in Gujarat to prepare groundwork for a change in guard in the state leadership.” Coinciding with Yadav’s visit and adding further fuel to the speculation fire, a meeting of five Patidar religious and community organizations, held in Kagvad at Khodaldham on Saturday, also took a bold step towards erasing the underlying schism within the community. It decided to abolish separate identities for Leuva and Kadva factions uniting both under the broad umbrella of ‘Patidar only’. Naresh Patel, head of Khodaldham indirectly expressed the desire to find a next chief ministerial candidate from among the Patidar community, while talking to media persons. “The Patidar community is very big and the meeting is organized to see that the community gets more importance politically and also in administration,” Patel, who had hosted the meeting, said. Parrying a query on political ambitions, Patel said: “All communities desire to have a chief minister from their own. So, definitely we too desire that a Patidar becomes the next CM,” adding, “After Keshubhai (Patel) the community did not get the leader of the same level.” He also lambasted the present administration for failing to manage the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Adding to the bubbling political cauldron, AAP on Saturday announced that party president and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will visit Gujarat on Monday. Party leaders said Kejriwal will set the tone for the 2022 Gujarat assembly election by spelling out the party’s plans for the state. AAP registered a decent showing in the recent local body election, winning seats in the municipal corporation, municipality and panchayat polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/flurry-of-political-activity-in-guj-as-covid-ebbs/articleshow/83470273.cms||---

The holy shrine, which is visited by lakhs of devotees from across the country round the year, is struggling to pay salaries to its staff owing to the temple staying closed for several months over the last two years owing to the lockdown curbs in place due to the pandemic. The temple management is yet to clear the salary arrears for the month of May, and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming days considering fears over the impending third wave of Covid-19. Officials say the temple — which requires around Rs 5 crore per month to pay salaries to its regular staff, contract employees, priests and others — has already suffered a revenue loss of over Rs 30 crore this year so far. “The temple has remained closed since May 2. Even during March and April, it was open only during the morning hours, duly following Covid-19 protocols. All poojas and sevas are being conducted online only, which has hit our revenue big time,” a temple official said. The official added that the daily revenue of the temple used to be around Rs 30 lakh, which would go up to Rs 50 lakh during special occasions and festivals. “Now the daily revenue hardly crosses Rs 2 lakh. The salaries are now being paid from the interest earned from the deposits, but it is hardly enough. We have managed to pay half month’s salary to the priests and the class IV employees. We hope to pay at least half month’s salary to the remaining staff in a week or two,” he added. Temple executive officer Trinatha Rao said the temple management is planning to request the district collector to accord permission to gradually reopen the temple for devotees. “The Covid-19 cases are reducing across the state. If the collector gives us permission, we will open the temple following all Covid-19 protocols,” he said.

On Saturday, many from the community turned up to take the jab at the ‘vaccinated with pride’ campaign organised this pride month. “The pandemic has hit the community hardest in terms of livelihood. In such scenario, how many will even think approaching a vaccination centre if it was not for a camp like this?” said make-up artist Dipankar Chanda, a leading organiser of Pride March, who took the first dose on Saturday. Organisations like Calcutta Foundation and Ek Packet Umeed extended hands to sponsor the vaccine for the community. “This vulnerable minority group is largely left out. We are happy that we could do something for them,” said Ayush Sarda, founder of Ek Packet Umeed. This was second special camp aimed at reaching out to the community members with the vaccine. More such camps would come up later-.“We hope such vaccine inclusive programmes will encourage more community members to take the jab,” said Bappaditya Mukherjee of Prantakatha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/camp-to-get-vaccinated-with-pride/articleshow/83469085.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Patna||Patna ranks 13th in spreading infectious diseases||PATNA: Patna has been ranked 13th when it comes to vulnerability of cities in spreading infectious diseases, including Covid-19, through transportation networks, according to the ‘hazard map’ prepared by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. A team of researchers devised this map of Indian cities, including 446 cities with over 1 lakh population, to understand the spread of infectious diseases from a host city reporting an outbreak and its spread. The institute used different modes of transportation, such as air, rail and road between cities to create this hazard map. They opined that infections can travel out from cities because of the well-connected transport hubs. From Bihar, 26 cities were included in the study and five figured on the list top 100 vulnerable cities. Haveli Kharagpur stood at 61st position, Gaya 66, Muzaffarpur 73, Bhagalpur 81 and Ara 87. Chhapra, Buxar, Danapur, Hajipur, Begusarai, Darbhanga, Katihar and Kishanganj figured in the rank between 101 and 200. Siwan, Sasaram, Dehri and Jamalpur, on the other hand, figured in the rank between 201 and 300. In the rank between 301 and 400, six Bihar cities – Bagaha, Bettiah, Motihari, Purnia, Jehhanabad and Saharsa found their mention. Munger got 425th rank to emerge as least vulnerable city in the state as far as spreading infectious diseases is concerned. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Jhansi, Pune and Jaipur occupied the top 10 positions. Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, former president of Bihar unit of Indian Medical Association, said the state was in danger as far spread of infectious diseases was concerned due to reverse migration of the poor. “Experts have predicted third wave of Covid. It is time for the state government to expedite vaccination drive to save lives,” he said. “The ISSER study is kind of a warning signal. It’s time for the state to prepare in advance to tackle infectious diseases. Sanitation is still not up to the mark in public transport. Safety protocols should be followed, free vending machines for face mask should be installed at transport hubs and proper disposal system should be in place. Awareness is also important to curb the spread of the infection,” Dr Rajiv added. Dr Arun Shah, a Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician and former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics-Bihar, said only vaccination could interrupt the chain of transmission. “Every eligible person should be vaccinated with two doses in order to break the transmission chain. A large part of the population is still not immune in the state,” he said. Dr Shah said Covid should be treated as influence-like disease. “Strong surveillance system is important to trace, test and treat the Covid-infected people,” he added. Dr A K Ashu, joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC), said all the waves of pandemic started from metro cities, especially from the slum areas which are densely populated and people live there in unhygienic conditions. “These are the reasons why spread of Covid started from metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. To curb the spread, the government should target the slums and ensure proper screening at railway stations and bus stands,” he said. “Quarantine and isolation centres should be developed well in advance with all facilities. Vaccination should be expedited to cover at least 50-60% population before the third wave hits the state and the country,” Dr Ashu added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-ranks-13th-in-spreading-infectious-diseases/articleshow/83467133.cms||Faryal Rumi

He also claimed that normal classroom teaching in schools and colleges was likely to resume next month if the present declining trend of Covid cases continued. Excerpts: Now that fresh Covid cases are declining, when can schoolstudents expect resumption of normal classroom teaching?If the existing trend continues, educational institutes may resume normal classes from July. They will, however, have to religiously follow all the Covid safety protocols. What steps will the government take to compensate for the academic loss due to the prolonged closure of schools?The education department will initiate some special measures to compensate for the loss of classes due to Covid-19. When schools reopen, some crash courses will be organized to help the students before regular classes begin. What did the government do to ensure regular dissemination of knowledge to students during the pandemic?All the educational institutes conducted online classes and uploaded study materials to their websites. Some special classes were also held on YouTube, Doordarshan and VidyaVahini app. Another app called e-LOTS was launched that contained soft copies of all the textbooks from the primary to the secondary level. Do you think school students in the state have been able to take full advantage of online classes?To be honest, the online mode of education cannot replace normal classroom teaching. A large number of students still do not possess smartphones or tablets as a result of which a knowledge divide has been created in the state. Has the government initiated any steps for helping such underprivileged children?The education department has urged the Union government to sanction necessary funds under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan so that electronic devices are made available to all the children belonging to BPL families. Educational institutes have been facing acute shortage of teachers. Will fresh appointments be done against the vacant posts?The government has already initiated necessary steps for expediting the process of appointment of teachers in schools and colleges. Nearly 1.25 lakh teachers will be appointed in elementary and secondary schools within the next three months and another 30,000 in the next phase. Besides, more than 4,500 posts of assistant professors in colleges and universities have been advertised by the Bihar State University Service Commission. So far as the scarcity of non-teaching staff in universities is concerned, the government has already decided to constitute a separate commission for their appointment. Half of the universities in Bihar do not have full-time vice-chancellors (VC). One person is officiating as the VC of four universities simultaneously. How does the government plan to improve the situation?All the vacant posts of VCs have been advertised by the chancellor’s secretariat. The process of their selection was delayed due to the pandemic, but now the process of their appointment will start soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expect-classroom-teaching-from-next-month/articleshow/83467082.cms||B K Mishra

Excerpts: In the light of the explosive situation owing to surge in Covid cases recently, what preparations are being made by the state government to tackle any third wave in the state?Learning lessons from the second wave, the government has already started making arrangements of all the required infrastructure and equipment in all the health centres so that not a single patient suffers. To ensure the availability of oxygen round the clock, cryogenic oxygen tanks are being installed at all the hospitals. The Union petroleum ministry has started installing oxygen generation plants of 2000 to 5000 litres per minute (lpm) capacity in all the 10 government medical college and hospitals in the state. AIIMS Patna has already got one such plant. Besides, 54 Sadar and sub-divisional hospitals are getting pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generators of 300 to 500 lpm capacity. Oxygen pipelines are also being installed at different sub-divisional hospitals. The state industries department has already installed oxygen refilling plants in as many as eight hospitals and is in the process of installing such plants in more hospitals of the state. The third wave is supposed to be more dangerous for children. What special arrangements are you making for the treatment of children, in case of some getting seriously infected?All the necessary arrangements for the treatment of children in case of being infected with Covid virus are being made by the government. Special wards for children with necessary facilities are being created in all the hospitals. Facilities of ICUs and ventilators and beds are being strengthened at all the hospitals and healthcare centres. All the hospitals have been directed to get the infrastructure of paediatric intensive care units (PICU), neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and special newborn care units (SNCUs) in their children wards improved without any further delay. The process of procurement of essential equipment has already started. The department has already placed orders for the purchase of all essential equipment and medicines for the children wards. BiPAP (bilevel positive air pressure) machines for children are being installed at all the PICUs, neonatal NICUs and SNCUs of different hospitals. Besides, special mother child hospitals (MCH) are also being set up in 20 districts of the state. Do you feel that our hospitals have got the desired number of doctors and paramedical staff to treat the ever-increasing number of patients?The government is already seized of the problem and, hence, the process of appointment of doctors and other technical staff, both on regular basis and on contract, has been initiated. As many as 1000 floating posts of doctors have been created for one year and the appointments are being made. Nearly 700 of them have already been appointed. Hospitals have been advised to appoint sufficient numbers of ANMs and GNMs as per their requirements on contract. Altogether 30,000 doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff are being appointed. Posts of about 9800 doctors, including 2632 general doctors, 3883 specialists and 3270 Ayush doctors, have been advertised for regular appointment and the process is just to begin. What is the status of vaccination in the state? Would the state be able to get its entire population vaccinated before the onset of the third wave?Vaccination is already going on in full swing at all the centres in the state. Besides, 839 mobile vaccination vans named Teeka Express have been launched by the state government for doorstep inoculation of the people. The state is hopeful of achieving its target if it continues to get regular supply of vaccines from the central government. What about the facilities for the treatment of people getting infected with black fungus?The government has made all the necessary arrangements in various hospitals for the treatment of people infected with black fungus. Constant efforts are on to ensure regular supply of essential injections and medicines to save the lives of patients. The government is spending an amount varying from Rs4 to 5 lakh on the treatment of a black fungus patient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/preparations-afoot-to-face-third-wave-of-coronavirus-save-lives-of-people/articleshow/83467106.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bhagalpur people show interest in oxygen generator plants||BHAGALPUR: Keeping and nurturing oxygen generator indoor plants has gained momentum in Bhagalpur region, especially in the backdrop of Covid-19. Residents are buying and keeping indoor plants, including peace lily (Spathiphyllum), snake plant (Sansevieria Green), areca palm, signonium, monstera, seflora, snow ball and fern among others, which are considered to be scientifically air purifiers at homes and offices. “The phenomenon of keeping and cultivating indoor plants at home and and in offices has increased amazingly. Residents living in urban settings are now acknowledging the importance of oxygen and pure air amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” said environmentalist Deepak Jha. Jha, postgraduate in Information Technology (IT) and employed at Bhagalpur collectorate for the past 29 years, enjoys being identified as ‘nature activist’ and spends his free time at plant nursery before and after the office hours. “In addition to absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis, many indoor houseplants have been found to remove organic pollutants like benzene, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, trichloroethylene, xylene, toluene, ammonia and several other chemicals in gas forms, thereby, increasing the inside air purity and healthy breathing,” he said. Dr Hem Shanker Sharma, associate professor in the department of medicine at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH), said the impure air inside homes, clinics or offices can cause headache, lack of coordination, toxicities from chemicals emitting from inside paints, lethargy, various allergies besides triggering of asthma and lungs disease with the fungal molds growing in damp areas inside the buildings. “Oxygen generator indoor plants help reduce the chances of many such diseases as they release oxygen even in night hours and absorb harmful fungal molds,” he said. Chandra Bhanu Singh, head of botany department at Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) said indoor plants are ‘sciophytes’ that need very less sunlight (nearly 20% or even less) for photosynthesis to release oxygen in the atmosphere. “Oxygen generator plants needing less sunlight are money plants, peace lily plants etc,” Singh said. IT professional Sushma Kumari said oxygen generator indoor plants are also known to eliminate harmful radiation from computers and television. Hence, she is not only keeping it inside the rooms but also gifting it to her acquaintances as it is a perfect gift on auspicious occasions. “It is also a perfect Feng Shui -- an ancient Chinese philosophy that seeks to find ecological balance as well as harmony, as it brings positive energy and is stated to bring good fortune, peace, hope, prosperity and wellness that everyone seeks,” said former president of Eastern Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Shailendra Kumar Saraf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhagalpur-people-show-interest-in-oxygen-generator-plants/articleshow/83467113.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The closed-door meeting at Prabhunath’s ancestral house in Barharia village under Masrakh subdivision lasted for about an hour. His son, Randhir Singh, was also present on the occasion. “He (Osama) had come to meet my father, who has been released on parole from the Hazaribagh central jail to attend a wedding ceremony in the family,” Randhir, a former MLA, told this newspaper over the phone on Saturday. Prabhunath is currently serving sentence in connection with the murder case of a former MLA from Masrakh, Ashok Singh. He was convicted in the case by a Hazaribagh court about three years ago. Randhir, however, parried questions on the conversation between Osama and his father. “We have been close to the departed leader’s (Shahabuddin) family for a long time. Osama came here on a personal visit,” he said. Sources close to Shahabuddin’s family claimed that earlier Randhir had visited Pratappur in Siwan district when the family returned from New Delhi after the former MP’s death last month. Shahabuddin was lodged in the Tihar jail. On Friday the MLAs of the AIMIM led by Akhtarul Iman met Osama at Pratappur and consoled the family. “A beeline of leaders cutting across party lines suggests that Shahabuddin still matters in the politics of Siwan,” said Harishankar Yadav, an RJD MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/osamas-meeting-with-former-mp-creates-ripples-in-political-circles/articleshow/83468688.cms||Ramashankar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Congress, BJP seek to regain lost ground in Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: The state presidents of the two national parties, BJP and Congress, are facing the challenge of winning the ensuing by-poll to Huzurabad assembly constituency. A bypoll has become imminent as the seat fell vacant following the resignation of former minister Eatala Rajender being accepted by the assembly speaker. Eatala has won the Huzurabad seat in every election held since the constituency was created in delimitation in 2009. For Bandi Sanjay, the BJP state president, the bypoll is crucial as he cannot afford to lose another election after the saffron party failed to retain its Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar graduate MLC seat, failed to win even the Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam graduate MLC seat and also lost Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll. In fact, the party lost the deposit in Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll upsetting the huge expectations on it after its good performance in GHMC polls and Dubbak bypoll. What is even more prestigious for Bandi Sanjay is the fact that Huzurabad constituency is part of his Karimnagar Lok Sabha seat and he wouldn’t want talks among the people that the state president of a national ruling party failed to ensure victory of a party candidate from an assembly segment in his own parliamentary constituency. However, political analysts said though it would be an initial embarrassment for Bandi Sanjay and BJP if the saffron party loses Huzurnagar bypoll, both the state president and the party will ultimately benefit as the party will expand its base in a constituency in which it hardly has any presence. For the Congress state president, multiple challenges are in store ahead of the bypoll. The Congress is most likely to go to the hustings with a new state president for whom winning the first election after taking charge of the party would be top priority. For a party which has been losing every election in the last few years, it won’t be an easy task for the new incumbent to regain the lost ground and prove his or her mettle in a bypoll. On its part, a regional party like TRS is making all moves to continue its juggernaut and prove that the two national parties are no match to the ruling party in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-bjp-seek-to-regain-lost-ground-in-huzurabad/articleshow/83469103.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Allahabad||First case of yellow fungus reported in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: City’s first case of black/yellow fungus case has been reported at United Medicine Hospital. The 73-year old patient has been operated and is doing well. Prayagraj has witnessed 20 cases of black fungus till date. However, this is the first confirmed case of black/yellow fungus here. Besides, doctors at the hospital have diagnosed black fungus in a 32-year-old female patient. According to hospital authorities, the 73-year-old, who is a beneficiary of the Ayushman scheme, had suffered and also recovered from Covid in the past. He underwent treatment for Covid in April-May at this very hospital (United Medicine Hospital) located at Jhalwa. However, after a few days, he reached the hospital again and complained of heaviness on the left side of his face, informed principal and ENT specialist of the hospital, Dr Mangal Singh. Dr Singh and another ENT specialist, Dr Prabhat Srivastava, examined the patient and conducted vital tests. The patient was examined by endoscopy and MRI on June 8 which confirmed black and yellow fungus in his nose. “We examined the patient and detected black and yellow fungus in his nose. Operation was performed, and the fungus was removed. The patient is feeling better now,” said the principal. He added that there had been cases of black fungus in Prayagraj, but it was for the first time that a case of black and yellow fungus was detected in the district. Sources told TOI that although the elderly patient had been operated on June 8, he has not yet been administrated with Amphotericin B, a vital injectable medicine which should have been given to him right after the surgery. Even though the hospital had listed the dire need of this injection immediately after the surgery and had been trying their best to procure it, it has not received the vital injection even after four days. The medicine is needed to prevent further growth of fungus, if any. Likewise, another patient suffering from black fungus was admitted at the hospital on May 29. She had an abscess on her right cheek, and the doctors suspected that she might be suffering from black fungus. Biopsy was done, and the hospital received the report on June 10, which confirmed the infection. “Later, we did the MRI which indicated the infection had spread from one side of the jaw to the cavernous sinus. She will be operated soon. However, we are in dire need of Amphotericin B injection for this case as well,” said Dr Singh. Meanwhile, Prof Singh also advised Covid-infected and diabetic patients to remain cautious, as black and yellow fungus could be fatal for them. “If they have symptoms like toothache, jaw pain, watery or bleeding nose, difficulty in breathing and blurred visions, they should contact ENT doctors immediately in order to get the disease detected at an early stage,” he added. He said that if the fungus is not detected or treated at an early stage, it could be life-threatening as it could affect the jaws, eyes and brain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/first-case-of-yellow-fungus-reported-in-city/articleshow/83468729.cms||---

Local MP Satyadeo Pachauri inaugurated the facility on Saturday. Founded in 1937, the Shri Guru Singh Sabha has spent the last almost eight decades focusing on community-based development initiatives. Earlier, during the second wave of the pandemic, the Shri Guru Singh Sabha, had organised ‘Oxygen Langar’ for Covid patients, who were unable to arrange oxygen for themselves. Harvinder Singh Lord, the ‘pradhan’ (head) of Shri Guru Singh Sabha said that the initiative has been launched in coordination with various social organisations and the hospital will offer its services to patients with financially weak backgrounds free of cost. “The purpose of Shri Guru Singh Sabha is to serve humanity, the free of cost treatments are open to people of all faiths,” he said. “All services equipped with advanced and modern measures will be provided totally free of cost in this hospital. There will only be a reception counter and no billing or payment counter. The Shri Guru Singh Sabha will take services of several city-based social organisations,” said Lord further. The capacity will soon be increased to 20 and then to 50 beds from the current 10 beds, he added. Talking to reporters on the occasion, Pacahuri hailed the efforts of the Shri Guru Singh Sabha for launching an initiative that will offer free services to the poor. “We have been seeing Shri Guru Singh Sabha serving mankind for the last 80 years. Such an initiative will hopefully serve as an inspiration for others,” Pachauri added. Locals too lauded the efforts of the Shri Guru Singh Sabha for dedicating the ward at the GTB hospital to the poor. “We all congratulate Shri Guru Singh Sabha for this noble cause. A great service to mankind,” a group of locals of Lajpat Nagar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sikh-community-dedicates10-covid-19-beds-to-poor/articleshow/83468615.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Anish took Ritesh into confidence by showing him some photographs in which he (Anish) could be seen with top leaders of BJP. Police have arrested Anish’s father, Vashishtha Narayan Jha (50), for his alleged involvement in the fraud. Police said Ritesh (28) is active in district-level politics and lives in Phulkahan village under the Shyampur Bhata police station area in Sheohar district. SHO of Shyampur Bhata police station Vijay Kumar Yadav said Vashishtha is a teacher in a government school. “The accused are residents of Chiraiyya village under the Punahiya police station area in Sheohar. Anish is settled in Delhi,” the SHO said, adding money was deposited in Vashishtha’s bank account and it was used to construct a lavish house in the village. The SHO said Vashishtha was arrested on June 10. “Ritesh had lodged an FIR against the father-son duo on March 22 this year,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sheohar-man-eyeing-mlc-berth-duped-of-rs-35-lakh/articleshow/83467058.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The panic-stricken students are taking to social media with campaigns seeking cancellation of offline exams. They have formed groups to discuss the issue in chat rooms and seek reversal of the decision. They are posting #cancelMGUexams,#cancelKannuruniversity exams, etc to all MLAs and specifically to @CMOKerala,@RBinduCPM, @ShashiTharoor. “How can the government expose us to Covid? We have not been vaccinated. Most of us have family members, relatives and friends with Covid patients at home. There are elderly and young siblings. Even our parents have not been vaccinated. Amidst such fear in our minds, do they expect us to write exams? If the university decides to conduct exams, students from containment zones and those with Covid or in quarantine will come, exposing others also. The usual mode of transport is not available. How do they expect all of us to travel amidst such tension of the second wave of corona,” said a final year BCom student of an autonomous college. A common grievance is the lack of support from main student organizations, especially SFI, which has supported the government decision. “They told the government that students will write exams wearing double masks!! For three hours. There are so many students coming from containment zones,” said Santhra Paul, a final year student. For the PG students, change in syllabus has also been a challenge. If several states are cancelling or conducting online exams, why is Kerala not looking at such an option, they complain. Most undergraduate students have been seeking cancellation or online conduct of exams. “They can take our internal marks and average of our previous semesters, give us project work and evaluate,” is a common suggestion. Aliya Nasrin, a final year MA Economics student said that MG university had changed the PG syllabus in 2019 and there are no guides or reference material for the new syllabus. They had given several representations even before Covid and a few students had even approached the Kerala high court seeking intervention for revision of syllabus. “With Covid, we could not get access to any study material. Nothing is available in PDF form. The court had directed the academic council, which was due to meet in March, to take a decision based on the request by petitioners. We wrote our exams in March and now they have scheduled our final year exams which we have to write without any study references.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/college-students-seek-online-exams/articleshow/83469124.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Kolkata||Yaas, diesel price, curbs make veggies dearer in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The prices of vegetables have doubled since Yaas had inundated vast tracts of farmland in south Bengal. The diesel price, which has shot through the roof to hover around Rs 90 a litre, is making the matter worse. With another major spring tide lurking around the corner (on June 28), the prices are unlikely to plunge any time soon. “Majority of the farmers in south and some in North 24 Parganas are yet to grow vegetables on their land. They have only managed to pump out the water from their land. The vegetables you are finding in the markets are mostly coming from Hooghly, Nadia, Burdwan. Greater the distance, steeper is the transportation cost, leaving vegetables costlier,” said West Bengal Vegetable Vendors’ Association president Kamal Dey. Prices of some common vegetables have literally set the kitchen budget on fire. “Summer has limitations as far as the variety of vegetables is concerned. So, you have to pick either a ridged gourd or snake gourd, brinjal or green papaya, cucumber or parwal. But each of them will give you a shock. I am spending the same amount to buy half of what I used to get before Yaas,” said Sumit Mazumdar, a school teacher. “If you don't buy vegetables, you end up consuming only potatoes, which can trigger blood sugar level if you are diabetic,” said Shankar Dasgupta, a retired banker. “The lockdown and diesel prices have left the transportation cost spiralling. The prices are unlikely to drop if the suburban trains don’t resume services,” said Gopal Sonkar, a wholesaler at Koley Market. “Transportation cost has risen by fivesix times,” added Amol Das, a retailer at Barisha Market. Dilip Mondal, a Gariahat market retailer, added: “Prices are high because vendors are bringing less vegetables as the window for selling them is only three hours. Nobody wants to hold back unsold vegetables. The withdrawal of the curbs will ease the supply line.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yaas-diesel-price-curbs-make-veggies-dearer/articleshow/83469038.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19 bed occupancy drops from 98% to 2% in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: On April 23, Ahmedabad city had 5,602 beds in 81 hospitals designated by the AMC as Covid-19 hospitals. Out of the total, 98% of the beds were occupied with 12 beds vacant for critical and oxygen categories having 3,517 beds in total. After 40 days, the ratio has reversed, as just 2% of the 4,630 Covid-19 beds in 114 hospitals were occupied on Saturday, with only 105 critical and oxygen category beds occupied out of 2,963 beds available. With the peak of the second wave over, the city – that had recorded 5,790 daily cases on April 25 – has also heaved a sigh of relief with several of the designated hospitals recording zero patients in isolation and oxygen dependency categories. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that from the start of June, the number of Covid patients has reduced drastically for the majority of the hospitals. “Several have now gone back to their original specialities by reducing the number of Covid beds gradually,” he said. “But it’s with the condition that they can increase the beds again when the need arises. It’s surely a positive sign that the bed occupancy is one of the lowest in 2021.” AHNA records showed that on Saturday morning, the city hospitals had 114 patients, which was second only to 85 patients recorded on February 15. In terms of percentage, it’s one of the lowest, added AHNA officials. Shifting of non-Covid patients to other sections has also reduced the number drastically, said Dr Rohit Joshi, medical director of Aarna Hospital based in Paldi and Maninagar. “At its peak, we used to have 100% occupancy at 37 ICU and ventilator beds in our hospitals for 35 days. We used to refuse about 100-odd calls daily. Today, we don’t have any Covid positive patients at our facility,” he said. “The reason is, several of these patients, having post-Covid complications, are shifted to non-Covid facilities.” Even at government hospitals, the numbers are all-time low. Dr JP Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that out of 1200 beds, only 120 or 10% beds are occupied. “Several wards have been closed down or are given for purposes such as treatment of mucormycosis patients in the building,” he said. Dr Pina Soni, medical superintendent of Sola Civil Hospital, said that they have five active Covid-19 patients in 130 designated beds. Both the hospitals now witness more patients who have post-Covid symptoms, said senior health department officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-bed-occupancy-drops-to-2-in-abad-private-hospitals/articleshow/83470248.cms||Parth Shastri

All schools located in Kolkata Municipal Corporation area will be covered under the scheme, which will be undertaken at specified venues from June 16. In a communiqué to private schools affiliated to CISCE and CBSE, the school commissioner wrote that the schools will have to submit details of the teaching and non-teaching staff who are yet to be vaccinated with either both the doses or the second dose. “We have been told to submit the details within Monday at 2pm,” informed a school principal. He added that the registration will have to be done by the schools. “It is important that we start to bring back students to schools at the earliest. The existing situation is detrimental to the future of the students,” said a principal. Another school head explained that the decision will build confidence among parents. “Group D staffs of several schools are hesitating to spend the considerable amount of money to get vaccinated. This initiative will allow mass vaccination in the school,” said South Point School spokesperson Krishna Damani. Several private schools and colleges have already started holding camps to vaccinate teachers and staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-to-vaccinate-private-school-teachers-staffers/articleshow/83469074.cms||Somdatta Basu

It was only because two of his house-help had tested positive that his family got him tested. But given the list of comorbidities he weighed over 120kg, a smoker and had sleep apnea his family and doctor decided to opt for the newest Covid medicine in town: Monoclonal cocktail. “He was a high-risk patient with no hypoxia but mild symptoms of bodyache. Since the patient had tested positive on May 30, we decided to administer a monoclonal cocktail in anticipation of severe Covid-19 illness,” said pulmonologist Dr Salil Bendre at Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, Juhu. Pratap stayed in hospital for 48 hours but did not develop symptoms. “Even my sleep apnea seems under control since I was diagnosed with Covid. The only other symptom I have is lack of appetite,” said Pratap, who is under home quarantine. Monoclonal antibody therapy, which became popular after then US President Donald Trump took it soon after testing positive for Covid, became available in India in the last week of May, after getting clearance for emergency use. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s to fight pathogens and thus help patients make a quick recovery with mild symptoms. Pratap received an antibody cocktail of Casirivimab and Imdevimab. It costs Rs60,000 for one shot, putting it out of reach of many patients. Doctors, however, say that for elderly patients or those with comorbidities, the medicine holds promise. It has been in use in UK for months now. Around a dozen patients have used it so far in Mumbai. Patients at Lilavati Hospital and Surana Hospital, Chembur, who took the antibody treatment over 10 days back are doing well, doctors said. At Nanavati Hospital, four patients have been given the antibody cocktail since June 1. A 50-year-old woman with polio and hypertension and weighing 125kg was given the cocktail therapy on June 9. Her mild symptoms of cough and fever have improved. Other patients were a 50-year-old woman with uncontrolled diabetes and cardiac issues, and a 57-year-old man with hypertension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/patients-who-took-antibody-cocktail-doing-well-in-mumbai-docs/articleshow/83471129.cms||---

The heads of the two churches in the city — Bishop Paritosh Canning, who heads the Kolkata diocese of the Church of North India and Archbishop Thomas D Souza, head of the Kolkata archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church — have sent messages to all priests and parishioners that vaccination is the only way in which the pandemic can be fought and hence, there should be no complacence. All priests and church workers of 35 CNI churches and most priests and workers of the Catholic church have received their first jab. Bishop Canning got all priests and workers vaccinated at the La Martiniere vaccination centre being managed by Belle Vue Clinic. The expenses were borne by the diocese. The residents of the two old-age homes run by the CNI and teachers and support staff of all 21 CNI-run schools were also vaccinated. “We are very strict about this,” he said. Archbishop D Souza said, “Most of those in the city have taken their first jab, some seniors have taken both. We are keeping in touch with churches and are asking priests to ensure even parishioners take the vaccine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/church-heads-instruct-all-priests-workers-to-get-jabbed-by-june-15/articleshow/83469053.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Patna||Monsoon makes earliest entry into Bihar in 13 years||PATNA: The southwest monsoon entered Bihar from northeastern part of the state on Saturday a day earlier than its scheduled onset, bringing widespread showers in several districts. The earliest onset of monsoon in Bihar was recorded in 2008 when it had entered the state on June 8. Vivek Sinha, director of Patna Meteorological Centre, said June 13 was marked as the monsoon arrival date in the state. “The monsoon normally enters Patna on June 16,” he added. As per the seasonal forecast of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Bihar is likely to record above normal rainfall in June. Northeastern districts of the state like Purnia, Katihar, Kishanganj, Araria, Saharsa, Supaul and Madhepura received the first bout of southwest monsoon showers on Saturday. With favourable conditions for monsoon building under the persistent presence of the cyclonic circulation of low pressure over the northwest Bay of Bengal, the entire state would be covered in the next 24 hours. Sanjay Kumar, a weather scientist at Patna Meteorological Centre, said the early arrival of monsoon would not affect expected amount of rainfall from June to September. “In the first phase of monsoon, the state will receive above normal rainfall, but the average monsoon forecast for long period indicates that eastern region, including Bihar, will receive below normal rainfall. However, other parts of the country may receive above normal rainfall,” he said. Kumar added, “This forecast will be revised again in August during which the past performance of June and July will be analysed.” Uday Shanker Sinha, another official at Patna Meteorological Centre, said the northern limit of monsoon (NLM) passes through Diu, Surat, Bhubaneswar, Dhanbad, and Dharbhanga. “For the next 48 hours, Bihar will be under the spell of southwest monsoon, during which the day temperature may fall by 1-2°C. Most places will witness rainfall with thunderstorm,” he said. The Patna Meteorological Centre, in its daily bulletin issued on Saturday, issued yellow alert for the entire state, including Patna, for the next four days. “On Sunday and Monday, rainfall with thunderstorm would occur at most places. On June 15 and 16, many places in Bihar would receive rainfall with thunderstorm. During this period, heavy rainfall and thunderstorm with lightning is likely at one or two places,” it said. According to Skymet Weather forecast, heavy to very heavy rain, possibly lasting for one week, are expected over Bihar till June 19 due to low pressure area in eastern parts. “The wet spell may extend further for few more days. Rain will be accompanied with high-velocity winds in excess of 50kmph, thunderstorms and lightning,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-makes-earliest-entry-into-state-in-13-years/articleshow/83467152.cms||Faryal Rumi

After the three-hour open surgery, the patient, Anil Kumar from Jamui, is doing well. Talking to this reporter on Saturday, the medical superintendent of the IGIMS, Dr Manish Mandal, said no mucormycosis case of such an intensity in the brain region had been reported from anywhere in the state before. “A team led by Dr Brajesh Kumar operated on the patient with such precision that his eyes were not affected,” he added. Two weeks ago, Anil, a post-Covid patient, got epileptic attacks that would lead to temporary unconsciousness. He consulted the local doctors, but his condition deteriorated and he was admitted to the IGIMS. “The patient’s CT scan and MRI test showed that his brain had been severely invaded by mucormycosis. Apart from a cricket ball-sized fungus, about 100ml of abscess was also removed from his brain,” Dr Mandal said. Dr Brajesh claimed that the fungus had entered the frontal lobe of the brain through the patient’s nasal passage. Due to its fast spread, he got epileptic attacks. The IGIMS, a Covid-dedicated facility, has performed numerous surgeries on the patients of mucormycosis that affects various parts of the body, including the nasal passage, mouth, eyes and brain. IGIMS director, Dr N R Biswas, congratulated the team for the rare surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-remove-cricket-ball-sized-black-fungus-from-60-year-olds-brain/articleshow/83467004.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Patna||Patna HC seeks details on rise in Bihar's Covid toll||PATNA: The Patna high court on Saturday asked the state government to file a reply, revealing the sources from which it confirmed additional Covid deaths before increasing the number by around 4,000 to take it to 9,375. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, however, did not specify any time for the state government to file the reply. On Friday, the bench had expressed serious concern over massive jump in Covid toll in the state following a scrutiny carried out on high court’s direction. The bench was hearing the batch of PILs filed by Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh, which were filed earlier this year on the grim pandemic situation in the state. The court directed the state government to inform it whether death certificates and other documents were assessed to confirm additional Covid casualties. Advocate general Lalit Kishore, who appeared for the state government, submitted that private hospitals had not updated Covid deaths properly. Kishore had earlier also submitted that civil surgeons and panchayat secretaries had not provided death figures properly. He had also assured the court that action would be taken against the erring officials. The high court has once again asked the state government to try and maintain a separate portal for displaying and uploading birth and death data. Centre’s additional solicitor general K N Singh submitted that separate data is being maintained by several states as per their laws. However, Kishore submitted that there had been no complaint against the existing system prevalent in the state, which is controlled by the Registrar General of India. Kishore also submitted that maintaining two separate portals and giving access to the people to people to upload data can result in discrepancies. However, the high court was of the view that people should have access to such a portal in this digital era when everyone talks about transparency. The court sought to know from development commissioner Amir Subhani, who was also virtually present before the bench, the provisions in law on maintaining birth and death records by central and state governments. Subhani informed the court that these aspects are governed by Centre’s The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969, along with rules and regulations formed by the state government in 1999 which has provision for maintaining a separate portal for such purpose. Subhani also sought permission from the court to consult the AG before giving a proper reply on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-seeks-details-on-rise-in-bihar-covid-toll/articleshow/83466955.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The Sinhagad Road police have registered a case of rash and negligent driving against the vehicle. Police said Sardeshpande was a civil engineer but was unemployed at present owing to the Covid-induced lockdown. TimesViewThe city traffic police should strictly enforce the road rules to tame rowdy drivers and avoid loss of lives in accidents. The law enforcers should ensure speed limits are followed by every driver, at least in the densely populated areas and city limits. Strict vigil should be maintained to penalise the drives of speeding heavy vehicles because goods carriers were involved in several fatal accidents during the Covid-induced restrictions, when just a few hit the streets for some emergency work.Sub-inspector Vilas Dhotre of the Sinhagad Road police said, “Sardeshpande’s nephew, a resident of Narhe, met with an accident a few days ago. He needed crutches and the victim was heading towards Narhe to deliver them.” He said, “Prima facie it is suspected that one of the crutches got stuck on the road surface and Sardeshpande lost control over the vehicle. He fell on the road and a heavy vehicle trailing Sardeshpande ran over him. The vehicle did not stop after the accident.” Dhotre said, “Some of the eyewitnesses told the police that the victim was riding alone, and the crutches were tied in the rear side of the motorcycle. He fell suddenly, following which the vehicle ran over him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-vehicle-runs-over-motorcyclist/articleshow/83470001.cms||---

While reviewing the procurement status, the CM asked the officials concerned to further increase the targets of paddy and wheat procurement in the next season. “We have to further increase procurement of paddy and wheat in the state from the next procurement season,” he added. Nitish also asked the officials concerned to prepare a district-wise target for the next year’s procurement after carrying out a region-wise study of production and productivity of different crops. “Fix the procurement target on the basis of production of a particular crop in a region and try to achieve the target in the next procurement season,” the CM told the officials. He asked the officials of three departments – cooperative, food & consumer protection and agriculture – to work in proper coordination with each other after preparing a better work plan so that the increased target of procurement could be achieved in the next season. The CM also said the state procured a record 35 lakh tonnes of paddy from the farmers this year and the wheat procurement would also reach up to 3.5 lakh tonnes by June 15. The state government has fixed June 15 as the last date for wheat procurement during the current rabi marketing season. Earlier, cooperative department’s secretary Bandana Preyashi made a presentation before the CM on the current status of wheat procurement in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/procure-3-5l-mt-wheat-from-farmers-by-june-15-nitish/articleshow/83468978.cms||Madan Kumar

The consignment was intercepted on NH-57 near Narpatganj block on October 18, 2020,” Narpatganj police station SHO Masud Haidri told TOI on Saturday. Gautam, who was posted at the Dagarua police station in Purnia back then, allegedly took Rs 3 lakh from the smugglers for helping the truck pass smoothly. “However, the driver and the co-driver of the truck, which bore the registration number of Nagaland, were arrested and the vehicle was seized.

---||Patna||Fuel prices continue upward trend in Bihar||PATNA: Petrol and diesel prices were revised for the second consecutive day on Saturday. As a result, petrol prices went up to Rs 98.41 per litre and diesel prices touched Rs 92.47 per litre in the city on Saturday. The oil companies have attributed the hike to increase in crude oil prices. Prices of petrol increased by 26 paise per litre and diesel by 23 paise per litre in the city. The prices of speed or premium petrol, on the other hand, have crossed the benchmark of Rs 100 a litre. Ashok Kumar, proprietor of a fuel station at Dak Bunglow roundabout, said though the prices have been increasing, sales improved in June when compared to May. “After the relaxations in Covid-induced lockdown, people have started moving out in the city. Sales have picked up from 30-35% in May to more than 70% in June,” he said. Three big oil companies – Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum – align the rates of domestic fuel with the international crude oil prices by taking into account changes in the foreign exchange rates as well as the taxes. A sales executive at a fuel station near Gandhi Maidan, Vijay Kumar, said prices of petrol and diesel have reached highest in the last one-and-a-half-year. “The speed petrol price has was already crossed Rs 100-mark. It is being sold at Rs 102 per litre,” he said. Prabhat Kumar Singh, president of Bihar Petroleum Dealers’ Association, said petrol prices in several districts have gone up to Rs 99 per litre, while diesel was being sold at more than Rs 93 per litre. “The rates of international crude oil are irrelevant in frequent changes in the prices of petrol and diesel. The Centre has been increasing the rates of domestic oil to boost the economy and its revenue and the state government is also getting benefit by imposing taxes,” he said. Singh said the oil companies have also made profits by continuously increasing prices of petrol and diesel. “It is only adding to the burden of the low and middle-income group people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fuel-prices-continue-upward-trend-in-bihar/articleshow/83467053.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Varanasi||Vindhyachal STP discharge causing algal bloom in Ganga||VARANASI: Varanasi district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has recommended action against officials of a sewage treatment plant (STP) at Vindhyachal in Mirzapur district as discharge from the facility has been found responsible for algal bloom in the Ganga in Varanasi after an investigation. A five-member team, constituted by the DM to examine the reasons behind the surge of algae in the Ganga, submitted its report to him on Friday after an extensive survey conducted for three days from Varanasi to Mirzapur. “During the survey, the team found that the algae flowed into the Ganga with the STP’s treated effluent through Basvariya drain. The algae later grew further in the Ganga,” the DM said on Saturday. According to the investigation report, the 4-MLD capacity STP is based on conventional system. It seems that the algal bloom originated from the STP at Vindhyachal. The flow of water is minimum and the temperature is also conducive for the growth of algae in the river. Besides, nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, urea and DAP coming from farm fields through drains significantly help growth of the algae. The untreated wastewater from Mirzapur and Chunar also contribute to the algal bloom. The team in its report recommended modernization of Vindhyachal STP and that necessary instruction be given to the STP authorities for its proper maintenance. It was also recommended that all the STPs along the Ganga should be maintained properly and all the drains including Nagwa/Assi, Khidkiya Ghat and Samne Ghat in Varanasi should be tapped completely. The generated sewage should be treated at Ramna STP (50MLD) and Ramnagar STP (10 MLD). The construction of a new STP in Mirzapur, maintaining flow in the river and conducting a study on the impact of algae on aquatic life by the experts of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) was also recommended. The algae first appeared around 20 days ago, which was first examined by the officials of the Pollution Control Board. Later, the DM had constituted the team comprising additional city magistrate (II), regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board, assistant commissioner of police (Dashashwamedh), executive engineer of Bandhi Prakhand and general manager of Ganga Pollution Control Unit to look into the matter and submit a detailed report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/vindhyachal-stp-discharge-causing-algal-bloom-in-ganga/articleshow/83468686.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government eyes Rs 3,000 crore from land auctions||HYDERABAD: A month from now, the government will conduct the first phase of eauctions of land on July 15 and is expecting to generate Rs 3,000 crore. Short on revenues during the pandemic, the state had decided to sell unutilised prime government land to mobilise resources. In the first phase, 64 acres in Kokapet and Khanamet would be up for sale. Of the thirteen plots identified for auction, eight plots (49 acres) belonging to Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) in neopolis layout and golden mile layout and five plots (15 acres) owned by the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) will be up for grabs. While a notification for auction will be issued on June 15, a pre-bid meeting will be conducted on June 25. The last date for submitting bids is July 13 and the auction will be conducted on July 15. Officials sources said the land plots were chosen from the western parts of the city with a view to rake in more moolah. They are not only located in a prime area, are close to the outer ring road and financial district, but the land is also useful for setting up IT offices, residential and commercial purposes. “Instead of smaller plots, big plots between one acre and nine acres will be auctioned as they will be useful for big firms and bigger projects,” sources said. Also, these plots were chosen in the first phase of auction as both HMDA and TSIIC have developed the layouts, while other layouts need more time to be developed. Sources said these land plots were selected so that the government will get an idea about real estate boom in the city during the auction. The government is hopeful of getting a good response to its auction as it is aware of the fact that developers will look for a clear title of the land. “The government land has 100 per cent clear title. They (developers) will get single-window clearances for development and get unlimited FSI for their projects, ” a senior HMDA official said. The erstwhile Hyderabad Urban Development Authority (Huda) conducted land auction in Kokapet under golden mile project in July 2006. The bidders had paid Rs 678 crore for 166 acres as advance of the total Rs 1,700 crore. The auction landed in legal wrangles, which were cleared by the Supreme Court three years ago. Some of the bidders have taken back their advance. Meanwhile, the government has asked the district collectors to send the lists of unutilised government lands available at the earliest. Some collectors like Rangareddy collector have already provided the list to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-eyes-rs-3k-cr-from-land-auctions/articleshow/83469123.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Pune: Take an appointment, then visit eateries & malls, say experts||PUNE: As businesses like restaurants, salons, gyms, and malls gear up to throw their doors open, experts have stressed on the importance of taking prior appointments to keep Covid-19 in check. Experts said an appointment system — in place at several restaurants – could also apply to malls, retail stores, boutiques, gyms, and salons, especially since several establishments can operate with some restrictions. In its recent orders, Pune Municipal Corporation directed beauty parlours, spas, salons, gyms, and wellness centres to serve patrons at 50% capacity, and that too those with prior appointments. “An appointment system could be adopted in cities where there is easy access to internet or smartphones. For instance, if a restaurant table is pre-booked, a patron knows s/he will get a table on arriving at the restaurant. Otherwise s/he may have to wait, either physically with others on the waitlist, or hop from one restaurant to another, coming in contact with more people in the process and increasing the risk of transmission,” senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee told TOI. Banerjee said this risk was now higher, as there could be long queues of people awaiting their turn at places with a 50% occupancy limit. “Chances of the infection spreading would be reduced outdoors, but with the rains, people will invariably wait indoors,” he said. Experts said businesses could opt for easy methods, such as creating appointment or reservation apps, to minimize impromptu walk-ins. “As per transmission evidence, superspreader events are congregated settings. If congregations are prevented, Covid superspreading will also reduce. Prior appointments are thus processes which prevent congregations. But how this is to be implemented will ultimately depend on the establishments or the administration concerned,” Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19, also director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, told TOI. Some experts also said bigger retail stores could push for appointments to control the number of customers on their premises at any given point. “Even before the pandemic, we would tell our clients to take appointments for hair and skin services, but sometimes they would show up half-an-hour or an hour late. We are now strict about appointment timings and tell clients to come five minutes early. Appointments not only help reduce crowding, but can also make operations better and more efficient,” Manasee Dogra, who operates salons in Kharadi and Kalyaninagar, said. Kritika Dixit, fashion designer and boutique owner, said the appointment system has greatly streamlined her business. “Due to the pandemic, we have been seeing clients only by appointment. This has worked well for me, as I am able to give them my full attention without having to worry about and divide my focus on walk-in customers. In fact, I have started telling clients to take appointments for online consultations as well, where I get on a video call with them and give them my entire focus for an hour. Post-Covid too, we will continue to rely on appointments as it provides better service to clients, which in turn translates into revenues,” Dixit said. Many fine-dining restaurants too are encouraging their patrons to seek prior appointments, although some said an appointment system may not always be feasible. “We are encouraging senior citizens and families with children to make prior bookings for tables before visits. In such cases, we suggest that patrons come at the time of the reservation and not be late. However, there is another section of patrons, who prefer impromptu walk-ins while they are out shopping and feel like grabbing a quick bite. In such cases, pushing for prior appointments is not possible,” Swanand Bhave, founder and brand owner of a restaurant, told TOI. PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said restaurants would be allowed to offer only parcel services on weekends, even though operational hours have been extended till 10 pm. This will help avoid crowding on weekends, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/take-an-appointment-then-visit-eateries-malls-experts/articleshow/83469121.cms||Neha Madaan

He said the school authorities should consider the impact of Covid in the lives of parents while finalizing the fee structure. “I am making this appeal because I am in receipt of several complaints against a section of unaided schools demanding exorbitant fees from students. I am told that many schools still demand library, lab and smart-classroom fees, just like they used to during the pre-Covid times,” he said in a statement. “ I understand that many unaided schools function without leaving room for any such complaints. But, some schools do take positions that cause extreme difficulty to students and parents, especially in these Covid times,” the statement added. Some schools even demand money in the name of sports and games, cultural activities, medical examination, badge, diary, progress report charges, PTA fund and insurance. Since the livelihood of a large number of people are affected by the pandemic and related restrictions, the school authorities should act in a more humane manner and stop demanding exorbitant and unnecessary fees, he said. The minister also reminded unaided school managements that transfer certificate is the right of a student and if a student requests for the same, the school authorities can’t deny it. “TC is not mandatory for admission to Class 1 to 8. Government has issued necessary orders to ensure admission to students who wish to join public schools in Class 9 and 10, even without TC. Director of general education has issued orders for transferring to public schools the UID details of students who have been denied TC by unaided school managements,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dont-fleece-students-edu-min-tells-pvt-schools/articleshow/83469144.cms||---
---||Pune||Declining cases motivate plans for work vacations||Pune: The scene from the Bollywood movie “Zindagi Naa Milegi Dobara”, in which Hrithik Roshan’s character abruptly stops the car at a scenic valley to log on to his laptop and interact with a client, is steadily inspiring a number of tourists. Travelling for leisure while logging onto work or online classes is slowly catching on and people are approaching travel agents for a working vacation as Covid-19 cases continue to drop. Even with restrictions in place, like having an RT-PCR negative report not older than 48 to 72 hours, travel inquiries are on the rise. Many engaged with the travel industry said that though most queries were yet to convert into bookings, the fact that people have started enquiring can be seen as a healthy sign. “People have called us requesting quotations for travel to places like Goa, Coorg, Manali and Ooty during the monsoon. The second wave hit during the peak summer, when people usually take vacations. Now, they want to travel during the monsoon,” said Santosh Gupta, owner of Shree Vinayak Holidays. He added that the work from home regime and online classes for students weren’t a deterrent anymore. “It is a sort of work vacation trend that is slowly catching up. People can easily travel with their laptops and other electronic devices so they can attend important meetings while on a vacation,” Gupta added. Nilesh Bhansali, director of Travel Agents Association of Pune, also said that the number of enquiries has increased lately. “There are certain hotels near Mumbai where I cannot get bookings for my customers as they are running at full capacity. We have received queries for travel to Rajasthan from a group for July and many people are planning trips later in the year. Wedding tourism queries are happening too. The number of flights from Pune are increasing. While it is a good sign, things will be clear only after June 20. Many states are under lockdown and many big hotels have shut down due to losses. One has to wait for another 10 days to get a better picture,” said Bhansali. Manohar Sharma, who got back from a trip to Goa in March, is planning to travel there in July. “I have been working from home and I didn’t feel the need to take leave for a vacation. So, I went to Goa, relaxed on the beach and worked too. With the number of cases reducing, I am planning to go again next month but this time I will take leave,” said Sharma, who works with a private firm. IT professional Akanksha Neeraj, who travelled to Shimla in January, said, “Every good hotel room now has a proper Wi-Fi connection so joining an important meeting or quickly sending some data to a client while on vacation is normal now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/declining-cases-motivate-plans-for-work-vacations/articleshow/83469133.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||Will fee hike panel decide cases of pupils kept out of online class: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: While allowing two students of a south Mumbai school to attend online classes, Bombay high court asked the state government to inform if a panel constituted to look into school fee disputes will also decide such cases. Justices Nitin Jamdar and Chandrakant Bhadang asked if the committee can direct a school to let such students attend online class if the school stops them from doing so. The judges said “several such petitions are coming to court and it is not possible to decide cases of individual students”. They said the committee can take an undertaking from parents that if the hike is upheld, they will pay the fees. “It will relieve substantial burden on the court,” said Justice Jamdar. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia sought time to file a reply and place on record the GR on the committee led by a district judge. The court heard a petition by the father of two students of Diamond Jubilee High School, Mazgaon, about the “irrational hike of fees” and to reconsider it due to the pandemic. His advocate, R Sathyanarayanan, said that children are debarred from online classes due to non-payment of fees. The school’s advocate, Nandini Menon, had in May last year said that fees were revised to 2019 level. “There is no fee increase. We have maintained it at 2019 level for 2020-21,” she said, adding that it does not include miscellaneous charges. Menon also said the school had offered a rebate scheme and the father had paid “not a penny”. The judges said that the father would undertake to deposit the fees payable in case he does not succeed in the petition. “Meanwhile, you permit them to join online classes,” said Justice Jamdar. In the order, the judges “considering the fact that the education of the students is at stake, by way of interim order,” directed the father to file an undertaking and submit it to the high court registry. Thereafter, the school will permit his children to attend online classes until further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-fee-hike-panel-decide-cases-of-pupils-kept-out-of-online-class-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/83471912.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 8 held for illegal e-sales of pregnancy termination kits||AHMEDABAD: It is illegal to buy pregnancy termination kits or oxytocin (a hormone that induces labour) from e-commerce websites. Yet, these items and even psychotropic drugs were being sold online. On Saturday, Gujarat Food and Drugs Control Administration (FDCA) booked eight persons who had allegedly been selling pregnancy termination kits and psychotropic drugs online for the past two years. A pregnancy termination kitA police case has been registered against three in Deesa town for selling psychotropic drugs. The state FDCA seized 24,366 kits worth Rs 1.5 crore and 800 oxytocin injections worth Rs 3 lakh. FDCA officials carried out raids at locations in Palanpur, Mehsana, Ahmedabad, and Surat. The officials found that none of the people involved in the sales operations maintained books or bills. In some cases, injections were stored without labels. “We have sent samples of the pregnancy termination kits and hormonal injections for tests. Buying these highly restricted items online without a prescription from a gynaecologist is illegal,” FDCA commissioner H G Koshia said. “The e-commerce site too is being contacted to determine how these products were sold on its website.” The kits sold were called A-Kare and Clean Kit. “The kingpin behind the sale of pregnancy termination kits online is Rajesh Yadav of DKT India, Mumbai. He is being questioned,” said Koshia. “Yadav had pressurized a pharmacist in Surat and another individual in Deesa to prepare fake bills for these kits in the name of doctors and then pushed these kits online.” Koshia added: “We are trying to find out how many individuals had bought these kits online.” The state FDCA rounded up Pintu Shah from Ahmedabad, Lokesh Maheshwari of Karni Distributors from Deesa, marketing representative Nilay Bora, distributor Zaver Sanghala from Surat, marketing representative Vipul Shah from Ahmedabad, and Tushar Thakkar and Manish Panchal from Deesa town. “We found that these agents had no licences or permissions to sell these items online,” Koshia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/8-held-for-illegal-e-sales-of-pregnancy-termination-kits/articleshow/83470052.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Lack of socialisation prompts singles to mingle on dating apps||PUNE: The pandemic and consequent lockdown since last year has led to a surge in users from the city on online dating apps. However, it has also led to serious crimes and the Pune police have suggested extreme caution while using such apps. According to TrulyMadly, a dating app, the number of users from Pune has quadrupled since March 2020. “Even before the lockdown, Pune was contributing much in terms of revenue and the number of users. The city has kept up its pace and beat Hyderabad and Ahmedabad to become our sixth largest city in terms of users. Out of our total 85 lakh users from across the world, almost 5% are from Pune,” said Snehil Khanor, chief executive officer and co-founder. A 29-year-old IT employee, who has been using various dating apps for a few years, said, “Old school I may be, I did not expect to form serous connections through platforms such as these earlier. But since last year, I started using them again, and I find people now want to invest their time in more meaningful conversations. Since socialisation has been curtailed due to the Covid situation, users have been taking these platforms more seriously.” But the world of online dating has several pitfalls. Police inspector Machindra Pandit of cyber crime police station said, “Many crimes, especially blackmailing and cheating, have taken place through different dating apps. We have received many complaints about such crimes. People generally share their phone numbers after chatting briefly on the dating app. The victims don’t know if the person they are chatting with is a man or a woman. Fraudsters generally upload fake photographs, and then pose as women on these apps. After obtaining their phone numbers, crooks cheat men by either telling lies about their poor health or loss of job owing to the pandemic. Some fraudsters have told men to pose nude on video calls and blackmailed them. We have received complaints regarding 150 such cases in the city,” he said. Over the last year, as single Indians continued to navigate virtual and socially-distanced dating etiquettes, different approaches to relationships evolved in this new environment. “We’ve observed a 38% rise in the use of video calls and voice chats, with 50% of them turning into something more meaningful. Our recent nationwide survey also revealed that about 40% of single Indians have opted for virtual dating in 2021, with one in three hoping to see themselves in a committed relationship by the end of 2021,” said Samarpita Samaddar, communications director, Bumble India, adding, “Around 50% of our users are likely to be new dawn daters (people who are newly single after experiencing a break-up during the Covid-19 pandemic). While 46% said that the biggest driver of breakups was the inability to see a partner, 29% said that the pandemic played a role in aggravating the issues with their partners.” Singles are now going on more “pre-dates” (online) to get to know one another before meeting in person. “Online dating does not mean fast-dating. Instead, many people prefer to take it slow because of all the ‘virtuality’ involved. I took my time and conversed with another user I met on the platform to know him before meeting him in person in February this year,” said a 32-year-old business consultant. Urban Indians are moving beyond the conventional expectations of marriage and exploring unconventional relationships such as live-in, long-distance or even non-labelled companionship, but with focus on compatibility for the long haul. “We want our users to set their relationship expectations upfront. Users see a detailed description about their match’s personality, inclination towards romance and intimacy, values towards family, financial priorities, interest in health and fitness etc to find a match best suited to their lifestyle,” said Shalini Singh, founder, Andwemet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lack-of-socialisation-prompts-singles-to-mingle-on-dating-apps/articleshow/83469151.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The work on this project had been formally started in February end. However, the progress in the project was badly hampered with the arrival of the second wave of Covid that led to another lockdown. Though the work could not be done with desired pace, 92 boats have been covered and their diesel engines replaced by CNG,” he elaborated. The project has been undertaken for making the environment clean, especially for the people coming to Varanasi for pilgrimage and tourism and enjoy boat rides in the Ganga. As most of the boats are being operated with diesel engines, apart from air pollution, noise pollution also makes a boat ride for visitors bitter. “The project had been initiated in June 2020, but the major hurdle of funding was cleared in January when the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) sanctioned Rs 21 crore from its corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund for the replacement of diesel engines in boats with CNG-fuelled engines,” the commissioner aid. He added, “Later, Metallurgical & Engineering Consultants (MECON) Limited, a public sector undertaking under the Union ministry of steel, was roped in to execute this project.” “Apart from the replacement of diesel engines, many other components had also been proposed. Under the project, boatmen are being made stakeholders. CNG engines are being installed in small, medium and large capacities and average cost of engine is around Rs 1 lakh,” the commissioner said, adding, “10% of the money is charged from boatmen as a token amount.” “With the installation of CNG engines in the boats, old diesel engines are being disposed of completely to ensure that they are not misused in future by installing in other boats and introducing them in Ganga again,” further informed TOI. Agrawal said GAIL has already operationalised its CNG station near Khidkiyaghat where CNG boats are getting refuelled through the dispensers installed on a jetty floating in the Ganga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/1300-boats-to-get-new-cng-engines-by-dev-deepawali/articleshow/83468691.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Fewer citizens at vax sites slow down drive||Aurangabad: The number of people turning up at the vaccination site has suddenly dipped in Aurangabad city, causing a concern amongst the health officials. The increased gap between the two vaccine doses (84 days) and insstructions of inoculationg only the above-45 years category of beneficiearies are the main reasons for the reduced footfall at the vaccination centres. As on date, the civic body has 40,300 Covishield, 320 Covaxin doses. Moreover, another 7,560 doses of Covishield and 300 doses of Covaxin are expected. Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar told TOI, “It appears that suddenly people have lost interest in getting inoculated. Vaccination is the only way to put a check on the number of Covid cases and deaths. We feel that the postponement of the second doses has made many people feel a relaxed and this is driving them away.” She said that there are 72 vaccination centres, including three private, that are currently operational in civic body limits. “We are ready to expand this to 150, provided there is adequate response,” said Padalkar. She said the response from citizens wanting their first dose is poor and if need be, the civic body will opt for full-fledged awareness drive in the areas around the existing vaccination centres. Health officials said that in many cases, people reaching the centre are being made to wait till a batch of at least 10 beneficiaries is assembled. “Each vial contains 10 doses. We cannot waste even a single dose. People reaching the vaccination centre are asked to wait until 10 beneficiaries get lined up. Many people return after waiting for a long time,” said Anil Pacharne, a health worker posted at the Aurangabad Cantonment Board-based vaccination centre. Since the vaccination programme began in January, as many as 27,849 healthcare workers have received the vaccine in addition to 36,455 frontline workers. After the drive opened for the general citizens, as many as 64,682 people aged over 60 years got their first dose. Moreover, 90,354 people in the 45-59 years age group have got their first jabs and 20,840 from the 18 to 44 years age group have got the first shot in Aurangabad city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-fewer-citizens-at-vax-sites-slow-down-drive/articleshow/83465289.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kochi||Parents citing govt directive to evade fees: CBSE schools||Kochi: The Kerala CBSE school management association wrote to the chief minister stating that the CBSE schools in the state are struggling to survive amid the pandemic and the intervention of education department officials asking schools to permit students, who have fee dues, to attend classes gives a wrong message to parents who cite it as an excuse to not pay the fee arrears. The association said that schools are put in a great financial crisis which might lead to closure of many schools if the fee arrears are not cleared. Earlier on June 7, education minister V Sivankutty had instructed the director of general education to resolve the complaints raised by the parents of Mary Matha Public School, Thrikkakara, that the school authorities had reportedly asked their children to not attend the online classes as they had not cleared fee dues. Later, the deputy director of education, Ernakulam, asked the school principal to resolve the issue through discussion citing that denying education to students in the name of fees is in violation of Right to Education (RTE) Act. TPM Ibrahim Khan, president of Kerala CBSE School management association, said the statement of some government authorities that students of unaided schools can continue their studies even without paying the fee arrears was against the existing orders by the Supreme Court and the high court. “Taking advantage of such statements, other parents are also refusing to pay the fees and arrears. The officials should give a written order in such interventions and oral directions to schools cannot be accepted. If the government gives oral instructions citing RTE, more parents would stop paying fees, leading most schools to bankruptcy and closure,” he said. Meanwhile, sources with the education department in Ernakulam said that no directions have been issued to any school to teach without fees. “Students have right to education and it cannot be denied in the name of fees. In the case of Mary Matha Public School, direction was given to discuss with parents about the fee dues. That does not mean they don’t have to pay fees. Without collecting fees, schools cannot function and parents need to understand it,” said an education department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/parents-citing-govt-directive-to-evade-fees-cbse-schools/articleshow/83469152.cms||---

It was only hours later that the stick with cotton swab, which got stuck in the nose, was removed after he was rushed to a hospital in Karimnagar town. The distraught sarpanch, Juvvaji Shekhar of Venkatraopalli village in Ramadugu mandal, gave vent to his anger after the swab stick was removed. “I literally suffered hell. Even now I cannot speak properly and I have pain. Is this the kind of people whose services are utilised in conducting tests? Are they not given proper training?” Shekhar said after an endoscopy was performed at a private hospital and the broken swab stick removed. From the nose, the swab stick had gone into his throat and got settled there. Sarpanch Shekhar had taken the lead in his village to get the rapid antigen test (RAT) done in the village. The tests were conducted at the staff of Gopalraopet primary health centre at Venkatraopalli village. The villagers came to the local panchayat office to get the test done and the sarpanch also got it done. As the sarpanch started writhing in pain after the swab stick got stuck in his nose, the PHC staff, including a doctor, made a vain bid to remove it, but without success. With the staff unable to do anything to remove the broken stick, the staff then decided to rush him to a private hospital in Karimnagar. Sarpanch Shekhar had to endure the pain for nearly four hours before the stick was removed by doctors at the private facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/swab-stick-breaks-gets-stuck-in-nose-of-sarpanch/articleshow/83471178.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

A medical doctor with a post-graduation in hospital management and business management, Dr Desai has worked as an adviser to the World Bank, USAID, ministry of health and other organizations. According to him, Nagpur has seen a seachange in the last 10 years and there are big and innovative projects in the pipeline. After Covid-19, hospitality giants are shifting their focus on hospitals, he said. Q. How has been your experience with Nagpur as adviser to hospitals? A. We started 10 years ago in Nagpur with Alexis Hospital as our first project. At that time, travelling to Mumbai, Hyderabad or Chennai for advanced treatment was a common thing for Nagpurians. Now, things have completely changed. You get almost every advanced treatment in Nagpur. The city has emerged as the medical hub of central India. In last decade, I worked for big projects like the National Cancer Institute, Kingsway Hospital and Viveka Hospital. We have several big associations in future. Q. You mean more big hospitals are coming to Nagpur? A. Of course. One of them is going to be a big charity hospital. Another is being owned by a big medical family in Nagpur. The city is developing rapidly and our survey says it needs such projects. Many more projects are coming up in Nagpur to cater to entire central India. Q. Is it real that hotels will be converted into hospitals? A. Very much possible in near future. Post Covid, the hospitality industry has suffered a lot. I have several enquiries from hospitality giants in Nagpur who have shown interest in converting their hotels to hospitals. It is a pan India trend. Even a concept like medical mall, where one floor will cater one speciality will be a reality soon in many big cities. Nagpur may also get one such medical mall. Q. What are the sectors on which Nagpur needs to focus in future? A. Neurology, neurosurgery, and nephrology are the sectors where the city still needs a bigger set-up. Concept of a full-fledged children’s hospital is yet to gain corporate support in Nagpur. The city needs to work on organ transplant sector too. It will depend on how hospitals and doctors shift their bases to city in the next few years. Q. Your observations and suggestions to people/patients? A. During pandemic, everyone has realized importance of having good healthcare. More people are now considering to spend a good amount on health insurance. This will enable them to avail services in private hospitals with modern facilities. I must say, you need a sustainable health insurance policy. Start preparing for it as Nagpur is changing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-may-see-hospitality-to-hospital-shift-medical-mall-soon/articleshow/83470070.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The fraudster made Dobal scan a QR Code on the pretext of transferring money through UPI, but hacked into his bank account and transferred Rs1.35 lakh from his wife’s bank account, said the police. During probe, the Sakinaka police cyber team led by Sunita Bhosale found out that out of the total Rs1.35 lakh the fraudster swiped a cloned card three times to buy petrol worth Rs 65,000 from the accused Hirendra Choudhari’s Siddhivinayal Petrol Pump in Ajmer. Choudhari was produced before the Bandra Court on Saturday and he is remanded in custody till June 15. Choudhari was arrested after he failed to give a valid reason for selling petrol worth Rs 65,000 at one go to one person in January. “Choudhari is part of a racket that is involved in online fraud. The modus operandi the racket operates is, they target people who place ads online to sell old furniture or any valuables. They siphon money after making the victims scan the QR Code. The fraudster shares the card details to the gang member who then makes a clone card and it is used in withdrawing money. In Dobal’s case, similar modus operandi has been executed,” said Sakinaka police senior inspector Balwant Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-nab-petrol-pump-owner-from-raj-in-card-cloning-racket/articleshow/83471194.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Delhi||Ggn teen’s suicide after abuse post: NHRC steps in||Gurgaon: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed the state home department to transfer the abetment to suicide case of a 17-year-old boy, who had jumped to death last year after being accused of sexual harassment by a former classmate in an Instagram post, to the Haryana CID from Gurgaon police. Pulling up the cops handling the case so far for a slow investigation, the NHRC also directed a probe into the role of the investigating officer, followed by departmental action if any negligence or laxity was found. Asking the principal secretary (home) of the Haryana government to bring in the CID, the NHRC on June 9 observed that there hasn’t been a fair investigation in the case registered at Sector 53 police station in Gurgaon on May 5, 2020 under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC. The 17-year-old had jumped to death from the balcony of his flat in DLF-5 the previous night. The post, written in the wake of the “BoisLockerRoom” scandal that was breaking on social media at that time, was shared by the girl the same evening. The 17-year-old was viciously trolled after that. The trolls turned on the girl after the boy died by suicide. “The investigating officer will also inquire (into) the role of police/IOs for committing lapses during the investigation and take suitable action against them, if found guilty. As the complaint involves a serious issue, in which the life of a young boy has gone because of cybercrime,” said the NHRC missive. The state has to submit a report within eight weeks. The NHRC response came after a complaint was filed by the boy’s father. His counsel Amish Aggarwala told TOI, “The accused and their accomplices are still scot-free, making a mockery of the legal process. They have used all possible unfair means to derail justice. The tragedy is that justice has been delayed and denied to the boy and his parents.” The boy’s father said, “With all the information available, statements of the witnesses show it was a planned and strategised conspiracy between several persons.” His son, he added, lost his life due to a “mischievous, prejudiced, imaginary and slanderous post” made on social media by the girl. The boy, the father claimed, was bullied and threatened after the post that pushed him to commit suicide. In July 2020, a Gurgaon court while hearing the case had observed that “the investigating officers are working at a low pace in the present matter for reasons best known to them”. The court exercised its power under Section 156(3) of the CrPC to monitor the investigation. According to the girl, the alleged incident took place they were both in Class X and had become friends. The boy, she claimed, had come to her housing society and proposed a walk in the basement. There, she claimed, he had touched her inappropriately and demanded sexual favours. After her post, another one by a person identifying himself as the brother of the teenager claimed the boy had received threat calls and texts, after which he had tried to defend himself and also told his friends he was innocent. According to this post, the boy couldn’t handle the constant threats and believed his side of the story would not be heard. The writer of the post also lashed out at the girl, saying she should have gone to the authorities to file a complaint if she thought she was right.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ggn-teens-suicide-after-abuse-post-nhrc-steps-in/articleshow/83471177.cms||---

Gandhinagar Sector VII police have registered a case of abetment of suicide against the woman, who is absconding. The complaint was filed by Navnit Patel, 25, after his brother Vipul killed himself, leaving behind a note blaming his fiancee. In his complaint registered on June 9, the details which were declared on Saturday, Navnit said, “I deal in exotic vegetables. I was on my way to get the produce when my aunty Sangeeta called to inform that she had found a note written by Vipul and it looked like a suicide note. She said that she tried to call Vipul’s cellphone but he had left it at home.” In the suicide note, Vipul asked his brother Navnit and Dhaval to take care of the family members and stay united. Vipul had also mentioned the password to his phone in it. He also wrote, “I am committing suicide because of my fiancée. She has made life difficult for me.” The note also mentioned that Vipul had got Rs 3 lakh by mortgaging his mother’s gold ornaments with one Kanubhai. Navnit went searching for his brother and found his two-wheeler on Jundal bridge. Later, the fire brigade members fished him body out of the canal. He told police, “My brother was introduced to the girl by his friend Deepak Patel, who was got to know her through her father. She would often ask Vipul for money, and he borrowed from his business partners and friends to fulfill her demands.” Navnit said that while they were preparing for Vipul’s last rites, he got a call from a family friend, Nitin, that the fiancée had given him the gold that Vipul had mortgaged with Kanubhai. “Vipul’s chat history reveals that he had messaged his fiancée that he wanted to meet her for the last time. Two of his friends had gone looking for Vipul to the girl’s house in Sector IV, but in vain,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fiances-demand-for-money-drives-man-to-suicide/articleshow/83470055.cms||---

It was alleged the accused, Dilip Kumar (40) and Ashish Kumar (32), demanded Rs 10 lakh and Rs 5 lakh respectively, to help the accused in the probe against him. The stipulated period of 60 days to submit the chargesheet ended on June 6. The prosecution cited limitations due to Covid-19 for the incomplete investigations. The investigating officer said probe against the accused was in the final stages, and evidence collected would be forwarded to the concerned department to seek prosecution for sanction under the Prevention of Corruption Act. He submitted that the speed of investigation had been hampered. He said movement of witnesses was restricted due to the 15% attendance rule in government offices and it was difficult to collect documents from government offices. The court said the investigating officer failed to show any document citing reasonable grounds seeking an extension to file the chargesheet. The court said circumstances made it clear failure in filing chargesheet resulted in the indefeasible right of the accused to move court for default bail. Previous attempts of the accused to seek bail on the merits of the case had failed. The two were arrested on April 8 after they were allegedly caught red-handed accepting the bribe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-i-t-men-get-bail-sans-chargesheet/articleshow/83472012.cms||Rebecca Samervel

There were just two days remaining to complete the process and the family had no money to pay the fee. I called the school and they said they would make arrangements but the boy had to be present there. I paid for their travel as well as his exam fee. He will now have a Std X pass certificate.” Lokhande also remembered another Std X dropout Nandini Rathod, who she had met last September. She remembered Nandini as a smart girl but her father’s death meant she had no choice but to work. “I just couldn’t sleep. The next day I called her. She was back in Akkalkot, Solapur. After many calls, I convinced the family to let her fill up the exam form but we were past the last date. When the portal opened once again, we filled the form and I sent her the money to pay the exam fee. The school charged her Rs4,000, which is illegal because needy children will never be able to pay such a huge amount,” she shared. However, setbacks don’t seem to dampen Lokhande’s spirit as she says that she has met good samaritans all along. “There were just three months to the exam and we wanted to get books for Nandini. I called a retired teacher living in the area and he agreed to buy the books. When he went to the bookseller and told him about the situation, the bookseller didn’t take a single rupee and even sent the books to her address. Nandini had promised to get good marks and had even studied well but she was disappointed when the board exams were cancelled,” Lokhande shared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/std-x-students-get-a-helping-hand-in-times-of-despair/articleshow/83469154.cms||Ardhra Nair

Samples collected till April show that Nuh and health minister Anil Vij’s home district, Ambala, topped the tally. A total of 158 persons have been found to be infected with this double mutant virus and 117 cases have been detected in Punjab so far. Officials said Nuh has the maximum of 62 such cases followed by 48 cases in Ambala, 40 in Jind, six in Gurgaon and one each in Yamunanagar and Palwal. Officials associated with Covid management said this info had been shared by the Union government on the basis of genome testing of samples picked up from Haryana by labs in New Delhi and Pune. Sources said Delhi’s centralised labs have collected around 3,000 samples from five medical colleges and five district hospitals having maximum load of Covid cases in terms of numbers. Of total samples, genone labs have processed 1,100 so far. “Protocols of management for this variant are the same. We isolated the patients and carried out extensive contact tracing and sampling,’’ said Dr Usha Gupta, director, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), Haryana. Dr Manjit Singh, civil surgeon of Jind also said appropriate protocol was being followed for patients found to be infected by this variant. “Besides contact tracing, we followed all the instructions we got from Covid nodal officers as well as PGIMS Rohtak. Those who required home isolation were give all facilities at home and those who required oxygen support were hospitalised,’’ he said. SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2 is a variant of the B.1.617 lineage of SARSCoV-2, also called “double mutant”, due to the presence of mutations E484Q and L452R. It was termed Delta variant by WHO under a new naming system introduced on May 31. Initially, it was the UK variant that hit the state in February and after initial spread, the Delta variant replaced it, leading to Covid surge in the state. Reports of the presence of the Delta variant in six districts has put health authorities on alert. During the peak of the pandemic, these six districts reported the highest number of cases as well as deaths in the state. This double mutant variant is spreading fast in Punjab, where measures are being taken to control the spread of this infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/158-infected-with-delta-variant-in-hry/articleshow/83470062.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Kochi||Kerala: Development dream of pandemic-hit Kumarakom set to take off soon||KOTTAYAM: Popular tourist destination Kumarakom got a new lease of life amid the pandemic as the development of Kumarakom-Nedumbassery road is included in the 100-day action plan of the chief minister. The project is worth Rs 97.88 crore and the existing road via Cherthala is proposed to be modernized. The road will be widened in places where it is narrow and will be renovated according to the national highway standards. According to cooperation minister V N Vasavan, who represents Ettumanur constituency in which Kumarakom falls, the proposed development in the existing road will boost tourism development in Kumarakom. “I had promised this project to the people of Kumarakom during my election campaign. The connectivity with Nedumbassery airport will help the Kumarakom attract more tourists,” he said. The road goes via Cherthala and Thanneermukkom before joining the NH. Many regions along the Kumarakom-Thanneermukkom road are narrow. These regions will be widened. “I have also given a proposal to the water transport department and tourism department for a water metro connecting Kochi and Kumarakom,” he added. Salim Das, a resort owner in Kumarakom, said that the sector is hoping that Vasavan will bring lot of positive changes which will boost the tourism industry which is in severe crisis ever since the pandemic outbreak. “The proposed development will help in increasing the tourist movement in the destination,” he said. Sanjay Varma, president of Vembanad chamber of hotels and resorts, said that the road will provide for a smooth drive from the airport to the destination in a lesser time. “If the road to a destination is bad, the tourists will have a bad perception about the destination. The first impression itself will be bad,” he said. The proposed new road will change this. Quality roads and less time to travel between the destination and airport will certainly help the sector, he added. He also said that along with the excellent road connectivity with the airport, the destination also needs a good hospital or clinic that functions round-the-clock. “The health centre in Kumarakom is excellent. But it will be beneficial for the local residents also if it is working round-the-clock. Once can avoid travelling to the nearest town Kottayam 16km away,” Varma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/development-dream-of-pandemic-hit-kumarakom-set-to-take-off-soon/articleshow/83469173.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Teacher sets up night school for migrant workers’ children||PUNE: Zilla Parishad (ZP) school teacher Rohini Lokhande, who travels 25km every day to reach the school, is always watchful for the out-of-school children near the institution so that she can help find a way to teach them. Since 2018, Lokhande has been teaching the children of sugarcane cutters from the state, who have migrated to villages near her school. When lockdown struck in 2020, the 46-year-old realised that bleak poverty was forcing parents to choose work over education for their children and she set up a temporary night school. She paid a local volunteer from her own pockets, so that the children could have basic competency in reading, writing and arithmetic. Moreover, she also sponsors the education of a girl from Solapur, who had to drop out and work at a road construction site along with her family after her father passed away. Lokhande had newly joined the team of teachers at the ZP school in Nandor, Daund, three years ago and some children came to fetch water from her school. “When I enquired, they told me about how they had come from Aurangabad and other districts as sugarcane cutters. I saw that a huge ground held makeshift tents and the workers would stay there from Diwali until the monsoon set in,” said the teacher. She took the Std VII students of the ZP school to the area and conducted a survey of the families. After getting a stock of the situation, with the help of teachers, the students made Diwali lanterns for each family and contributed to buy Diwali faral (sweets and savouries) for them. “One by one, all students from the worker’s camp started enrolling at the school. The lack of documents was never a hindrance as we would get them admitted to the school on an education guarantee card. This card includes details such as the previous school, class, among others. In 2019, as many as 11 parents decided to stay back in the village to ensure their children’s education continued instead of going back to their village,” said Lokhande. However, last year, when the pandemic hit the situation became quite tough. “The lockdown meant that many of the students, who had enrolled at the school, could not be reached. Teachers were also put on Covid-19 duty and we had to teach regular classes online. Although, I did get help from volunteers to go and teach them whenever they can, it was not enough. Then I realised that most of the children were also made to work due to the severe money crunch faced by their families. All of this meant, education was the least of their priorities. That is when I thought of conducting the classes for the students at night,” said Lokhande. While Lokhande searched for premises, she sought help from a local resident, who had a bungalow and was herself a postgraduate. “I appealed to her to teach these children for two hours every night in the premises of her bungalow. I paid her from my own pocket and she agreed to do the job. The next hurdle was books. Since none of these children could even read or write, teaching them basic skills was our priority. We got workbooks in Marathi and Maths, which have a basic 60-day course. Apart from the lessons, she even taught the students about personal hygiene, discipline, and so on. By the end of the first week or so, after working on the fields, the children would take a bath, get ready for the evening and then come for the classes from 7 pm till 9 pm,” said Lokhande. Despite having a pretty full plate, Lokhande feels she is not doing enough and says all her contributions were possible only because she found people who helped her at every stage of her project. “From teachers in my school to people outside, I have found help everywhere. Even now, when I wanted mobile phones for the children of sugarcane cutters, a Kothrud-based housing society donated five phones. The 20 children can be divided into groups of four, to use one phone and study. People can do wonders.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teacher-sets-up-night-school-for-migrant-workers-children/articleshow/83469165.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Nanded police book eight, arrest two for practising black magic||AURANGABAD: The Nanded police have booked eight suspects and arrested two on the charges of performing superstitious acts to unearth hidden treasure that they believed had been buried for centuries. They have been slapped with the sections of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and Other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013. The arrested accused have been identified as one Shivanand Maharaj and his disciple Tirupati Narwade. The action by the police followed a raid carried out in the Vaka Shivar area, where the eight suspects, including a woman, had gathered on Saturday morning. Usmannagar police station’s inspector Birappa Bhusnur told TOI, “Following the raid at the spot, where the alleged black magic acts were underway, we arrested a self-proclaimed maharaj and his disciple.” He said the accused will be produced before the court on Sunday for seeking their custody. Police said that many people believed that the maharaj had supernatural powers. Many villagers, in fact, said the maharaj had helped people get rich by using his powers. Police said that though there was information that the suspects may perform a sacrifice, things are likely to get clear only after the arrest of other suspects. Preliminary probe has revealed that some of the suspects were facing financial problems and wanted to make some quick money by performing black magic to unearth the treasure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/8-booked-2-arrested-for-practising-black-magic/articleshow/83465336.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Mukhtiara, of the same village, was booked on Friday under section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) of IPC at Siwan police station. On Thursday, Mukhtiara had allegedly entered the Paharpur gurdwara village in his shoes and torn a page (ang) from the bir and left after committing the sacrilege. The crime was captured in the CCTV camera installed over there. Siwan police station house officer (SHO) sub-inspector Raj Phool said, “The accused was produced in the district court and sent to 14-day judicial custody. The investigation going on.” Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur and Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) president Baljit Singh Daduwal had both demanded strict action in the case. Daduwal had also claimed that Mukhtiara and his family were followers of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda. SHO Phool said, “Mukhtiara continued to insist that he had gone to the gurdwara only to pay obeisance. Some villagers have said that his family follows the Sikh faith as they had kept an ‘akhand path’ to offer prayers for their new home. It is still a matter of investigation, whether the family has any link to the Dera.” SGPC’s Haryana Sikh Mission incharge Mangpreet Singh claimed, “We have found his family has an association with the Dera. Police should add the criminal conspiracy angle. There is a need for harsher laws in Haryana also for such cases of sacrilege.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/desecration-in-kaithal-village-accused-arrested/articleshow/83470077.cms||JK Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lung issues biggest reason for post-Covid return to hospital||MUMBAI: The number of patients needing hospitalisation after a Covid-19 infection is worrying doctors in the city. While the state does not maintain a registry on the number of readmissions among Covid-19 patients, experts said that patients who spent over 15 days in hospital or had severe symptoms are at a higher risk of being hospitalised again. “The number of fresh Covid-19 patients is decreasing, but readmission numbers are enough to be noticed, especially among the elderly,” said Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of KEM Hospital and a member of the state government task force on Covid-19 mortality. The main cause for rehospitalisation is more often than not post-Covid lung complications. “The lungs are badly scarred and rigid, raising the risk of a secondary infection,” said Dr Supe. A doctor recalled how a 76-year-old patient who was in hospital for over 15 days during the first stint with Covid developed severe breathing issues after returning home in Talegaon. “She was admitted to the ICU locally, but died a couple of days later with severe inflammation in her lungs,” he added.  Post-Covid patients who needs oxygen support at home — perhaps for months — are most vulnerable. Pulmonologist Dr Lancelot Pinto from Hinduja Hospital said Covid patients with severe infection stay longer in hospital. “This makes them vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections caused by bacteria or fungus. At times, patients go back home and develop clotting issues,” he said. A negative test after a Covid infection is not the end, said doctors. While the acute infection is mostly restricted to 15 days, in senior citizens and patients with co-morbidities there is a need to stay alert for at least three months. Consider the post-Covid clinic in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, which saw 170 new patients in May. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Anita Mathew from Fortis said: “The Sars-CoV-2 virus has been capable of infecting a wide range of tissues in the body. The impact is such that months after their initial infection, some Covid patients suffer a baffling number of symptoms.” She said that out of every 100 patients who visit the post-Covid clinics, at least 70 have some symptoms of long Covid. “Around 20% of these experience severe symptoms that need urgent attention,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lung-issues-biggest-reason-for-post-covid-return-to-hospital/articleshow/83470110.cms||---

NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Vaccination In Your Locality is underway for last three weeks. We have identified few sites as permanent vaccination centres. When it resumes, vaccination of 18-44 age group will be free of cost in centres of NMC and government hospitals. We plan to increase the number of centres to cover maximum people in a day and prevent crowding.” The number of beneficiaries has further dropped at Kingsway Hospital which is the only private centre in Nagpur division where paid inoculation is going on for all people above 18 years. The numbers had started declining since centre’s announcement to resume free of cost vaccination of people in 18-44 age group from June 21. As per data provided by Kingsway Hospital, daily vaccination was around 1,700 in the first six days. It came down to 340 on June 9, 159 on June 10 and 160 on June 11. After centre permitted vaccination of 18-44 age group, the state started inoculation with limited centres in the district. The state stopped it on May 12 citing shortage of doses. The centre had allowed private hospitals to procure doses directly from manufacturers and inoculate anyone from 18-plus. The number of beneficiaries at government centres in the district has dropped below 5,000 for last few days as not many among healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and 45-plus are reportedly eligible for inoculation. The number has further declined to 3,361 on Saturday. These beneficiaries include HCW, FLW, 45-plus who took first and second dose and those from 18-44 age group who took second dose. As on June 11, 13,49,034 doses have been administered in the district. Of the 66,870 HCWs who had taken first dose, 43,914 have also turned up for second dose so far. When it comes to FLWs, 1,30,844 took first dose while 40,364 also had the booster shot. Highest 8,24,201 doses have been given in 45-plus age group. In this age group, 2,00,287 beneficiaries have also taken the second dose. In the age group of 18-44 years, 35,947 had their first dose while 6,607 are fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-plans-to-increase-vax-centres-to-150-200-for-18-44-age-group/articleshow/83470092.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Man defrauds ‘wife’ of Rs 4.5 lakh, disappears||AHMEDABAD: When Priya (name changed) got married a second time, she thought she had attained her happily ever-after. But her illusion shattered within months, when her husband cheated her out of Rs 4.5 lakh and disappeared. When the Satellite resident found out that he was already married, she filed a complaint. Satellite police registered a case against her husband for cheating and concealing his marriage. In the complaint registered on Saturday, the 42-year-old said that in 1994, she married a resident of Dehgam, with whom she had a daughter. In 2008, her daughter died in an accident following which differences crept into the marriage and she got a divorce the same year. She started living as a paying guest in Satellite where she met the accused in 2014. The two became friends. While he claimed he was not married, Priya told him about her marriage and divorce. She told police that they got married on June 11, 2015 and he took her to Ambawadi where they rented a house. She said, “About 45 days after the wedding, he asked me for money as he wanted to go to Punjab. In order to help him, I got a loan of Rs 2 lakh from a bank. In all, he took Rs 4.5 lakh from me. When my husband did not come back, I tracked him to his residence where he and his grandmother abused me.” She lodged a complaint against him in 2017. Priya also began staying as PG in the same flat that her husband lived in. Later, she found out that he was already married. “He had married another girl in Punjab in 2015 before marrying me. He was in a relationship with a Gota resident, whom he married in 2018,” she told police. Satellite police registered a case under IPC 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 494 (marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife) and 495 (concealment of former marriage from person with whom subsequent marriage is contracted).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-defrauds-wife-of-rs-4-5l-disappears/articleshow/83470096.cms||---
---||Surat||Railway staffer wanted for killing wife’s paramour held in Daman||SURAT: A railway gateman was arrested from Daman on Saturday for murdering his wife’s paramour at Derol village in Bharuch district on June 10. The accused Shashikant Vasava had learnt about his wife Yogita’s extra-marital affair with the 27-year-old deceased Satish Valand. Yogita and Valand had developed feelings for each other as Valand lived near her parents’ house in Vagra village and they used to meet often. The married couple used to have a fight regularly over the extra-marital affair, so Vasava decided to bump off Valand. The deceased worked in a pharma company at Panoli. Vasava convinced Valand to come near the crematorium on the outskirts of the Derol village as he wanted to talk. Police said that Valand deliberately chose the place, as it was a deserted area and nobody turns up there. In the middle of the conversation, Vasava pulled out a knife and stabbed Valand multiple times before fleeing from there. The body was noticed by a passer-by after several hours and he alerted police. Cops said that they had a suspicion that Valand was murdered over a love affair and their prime suspect was Vasava since he called Valand, and his mobile phone’s location was found somewhere towards Valsad and Daman. “The location showed that the accused was moving before he stopped so we shared his location and photo with Valsad police so that he can be nabbed before our team could reach there,” said inspector P S Gadhvi of Bharuch Taluka police station. Since he fled on bike, based on his location and bike’s number, cops apprehended him. Later, during interrogation Vasava admitted that he killed Valand because of his affair with Yogita. Cops are yet to recover the knife that he used for the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/railway-staffer-wanted-for-killing-wifes-paramour-held-in-daman/articleshow/83467379.cms||---
---||Mumbai||With a new builder, hope for Juhu housing society residents||MUMBAI: Residents of Juhu Anamika housing society, stranded since 2010 after the builder demolished their building and then abandoned the redevelopment project, have finally found hope. A new developer, Parinee Group, has taken over the project and recently started construction work on a new 16-storey tower at Gulmohar Cross Road No. 10, JVPD Scheme. In 2014, TOI had reported on how Kumar Urban Development Pvt Ltd (KUL) had left 20 families of the society in a bind as it halted work after demolishing the building. The developer stopped paying rent Rs75,000/month for each family for temporary accommodation. Times ViewThe Anamika society project case is a sad reflection of what happens when builders change the goalpost after the redevelopment agreement is signed and residents displaced. The 20 families have been rendered homeless for over a decade. It is time the government looked into regulations for redevelopment and made changes so that people are not cheated and ousted from what was their residence for generations.Then society chairman, Dipak Painter, had told TOI, “We reached a stage of frustration and don’t know if we will go back to our homes in our lifetime.’’ Painter passed away soon after. The tragic case of Anamika society is one of many across the city, where redevelopment projects are stuck as the builder backtracked on the agreement after demolishing the building. In the Anamika case, the society signed an agreement with KUL in 2008 and handed over premises in 2010 with the guarantee that members would receive new homes within 37 months. In 2013, the builder signed a supplementary agreement, seeking 18 months more with an assurance that he would build their 20 flats and hand over possession. The period expired in 2014. In the meantime, BMC demolished two floors of the under-construction building as the developer built them without permission. KUL wanted to scrap a clause stipulating that any benefit accruing from additional floor space index (FSI) would be shared 40-60 between residents and builder respectively. The builder told them he had to pay a steep Rs 22 crore premium to Mhada, the state’s apex housing authority, for additional FSI. In 2017, KUL wanted to terminate the agreement and Parinee Realty made an offer to take over KUL Elegance Project. Consent terms were signed in January 2020 and filed in high court. In December 2020, Parinee signed a fresh development agreement with the society. “We started paying rent to existing members from January 2020, demolished the structure and started piling work of the new tower,’’ said Vipul Shah, MD of Parinee Group. He said the new agreement offers each family a 1,000 sq ft flat, against 876 sq ft offered by the erstwhile developer. Shah said the current valuation of the project was Rs 200 crore. “We will invest Rs 120 crore in the project and raised initial funds from high net worth investors,’’ he added. The developer can build 50 extra apartments to sell in the free sale component. Society secretary G R Kshetramade said residents suffered for a decade and had given up hope. “No one wanted to take over our project, till the new developer stepped in,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-a-new-builder-hope-for-juhu-hsg-soc-residents-in-mumbai/articleshow/83472063.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Delhi||Days from now, glimpse of revamped Rajpath lawns||NEW DELHI: In the next fortnight, people will get the first glimpse of a sample patch of redeveloped Rajpath lawns, which will have all the features including lush green grass, trees, lights, canal, small bridge and walkways. The housing ministry is getting 100-120 metres ready, which is being seen as a move to dispel misinformation about the project of how this will mean loss of pristine trees and open public space. Sources said after the complete redevelopment, the lawns will get approximately 15 km of walkways. High quality 60 mm granite stone is being used for these walkways. Different types of grass are being planted that can grow in the open and under the trees. The aeration system in canals will control algae. On the issue of Rajpath lawns and trees, environmentalist Pradip Krishen told TOI, “The lawns will remain and there will be more space for the public. There is a careful drainage plan to ensure there is no stagnant water in the lawns. The idea is to have less water demanding grass and trees. Now we have a decent tree plan for Central Vista Avenue. Around 26 jamun trees will be transplanted in this area. We can’t say how many will survive, but some of them may survive because these are being transplanted in the project site where the nature of soil is similar.” TOI on March 15 had first reported the “Tree Master Plan” for Rajpath lawns, which is also known as Central Vista Avenue, to ensure no more haphazard plantations on this stretch. The forest department of Delhi government has so far given permission for transplantation of six jamun trees. Krishen, who authored ‘Trees of Delhi’, said that approximately 52 trees will be planted on these lawns of two species — Pilkhan and Kosam — that have red foliage. Sources said the draft Master Plan specifies the species of trees to be planted on these lawns as and when the existing trees die natural deaths and this would be realized after 20-30 years. These would include trees with coloured canopy. “Once the plan is finalised, there will be strict compliance of the norms,” said a source. The environmentalist said the main lawn set far back, which is close to the proposed new office buildings, will get flowering trees such as Semul, Amaltas and Barna. The CPWD has also proposed options such as Dhak and Gulmohar. On the issue of transplantation of trees from other sites to NTPC Badarpur and their chances of survival, Krishen said this seems bleak since there is no similarity in the soil type and till recently the new site was used for dumping fly ash. “This is sad,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/days-from-now-glimpse-of-revamped-rajpath-lawns/articleshow/83471212.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Goa||Centre raps state, CCP over implementing urban reforms||Panaji: The Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Afairs (MoHUA) has written to the state government, particularly to the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) questioning the delay in undertaking five crucial urban reforms as part of the AMRUT Mission - Atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation, to help develop urban infrastructure. Joint secretary with the MoHUA Sanjay Kumar has red-flagged the delay in submission of reports about the reforms which were undertaken as part of the World Bank (WB) funded capacity building for urban development (CBUD). This is the second reminder to Goa, specifically to CCP to submit the final reports on improvement of property tax collections, enhancement of advertisement tax, credit ratings for CCP and transaction advisory for municipal bonds. As part of the AMRUT Mission, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Limited (IPSCDL) had inked a contract with a private ratings, research, and risk analysis agency CRISIL to conduct a 40-day long exercise in the state capital to find out gaps in property tax collections. Initiated in early 2018, the inception report for the project has yet to be approved by the state government and CCP despite being submitted by CRISIL, said sources. Officials told TOI that despite funds being spent and recommendations being made, CCP has yet to act on the findings and take steps to increase its revenue streams. A similar contract for technical assistance in revenue for advertisement tax was prepared to help CCP identify avenues to increase the mop-up through advertisements that are displayed across the state. Improving revenue from advertisement tax is a key AMRUT reform. The inception, interim, draft final, final and hand-holding report - 1, 2 to enhance CCP’s advertisement tax mop up remains pending even though the CBUD project came to an end in December 2018. The reports requested by the Centre help certify that the funds were properly utilised and that the reforms were successfully completed, said under secretary for the CBUD division Joydev Pramanik. He had sent a reminder to Goa along with several other states on April 21 seeking information about the reforms. “It is therefore requested to intimate this ministry about the implementation status of the recommendations furnished by the respective consulting firms by the urban local bodies along with its impact on the revenue collection,” said Pramanik in his letter in April. After states, including Goa ignored the letter, Kumar sent a fresh reminder in the letter dated June 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-raps-state-ccp-over-implementing-urban-reforms/articleshow/83472113.cms||---

Speaking to journalists on his arrival at Nagpur airport on Saturday, Fadnavis said, “Regardless of what strategy is put in motion, only Modi will come to power in 2024.” Regarding the meet between Kishor and Pawar, the former state chief minister said, “There is no ban on people meeting each other, so that’s not an issue. People from both ruling and opposition parties keep strategizing. All I am saying is that today Modi is in power and even in 2024 he will continue.” When asked about Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shevale’s comment that delay by central government in granting permission to projects has resulted in waterlogging in certain parts of Mumbai, Fadnavis said that’s now become a standard excuse. “I think blaming the central government is a routine for them. After getting up in the morning the first thing they say is that central government is responsible regardless of the issue,” said Fadnavis. With the Maratha reservation issue again gaining centre stage, Fadnavis did not rule out BJP leaders joining the agitation. “Even when we were in power, so many of our leaders had taken part in the Maratha morcha. When it comes to public emotions then the issue of party does not arise, so it’s but natural some leaders will take part in the morcha,” said Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-read-much-into-pawars-meet-with-prashant-kishor-says-fadnavis/articleshow/83470104.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Bootleggers have started packing illicit arrack in mineral water bottles and deliver them at the doorsteps of the tipplers under the disguise of selling mineral water bottles. Police busted the racket after nabbing a man with mineral water bottles containing arrack following a tip-off. A team from the Kandachipuram police station spotted a middle-aged man moving under suspicious circumstances with a bag and detained him. On inspection, he was found in possession of 10 mineral water bottles with illicit arrack and several pockets of arrack. The man was identified as P Sankar, 39 hailing from the same locality. On inquiries, he confessed to packing arrack in mineral water bottles and deliver them to his clientele. Police booked him under different sections of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937 and arrested him. They have launched a hunt for all those involved in the crime. Police recovered 10 mineral water bottles containing arrack and several polythene packets containing arrack that can easily dupe anyone as water packets. “The accused claimed that he bought liquor from Puducherry and bottled them in pet bottles to sell to his clientele. We are not ruling out his association with bootlegging gangs. A thorough inquiry is on. There is a sudden spurt in the brewing of illicit liquor as Tasmac shops are closed following lockdown to contain the Covid-19 spread. Moreover, after Puducherry reopened its liquor and arrack shops we strengthened our vigil at all our check posts on the border and nabbed people smuggling liquor from Puducherry into Tamil Nadu,” said DSP (prohibition enforcement wing) G Harikumar. The DSP has undertaken a series of raids and destroyed over 10,000litres of fermented wash, 3,000litres of arrack and 500litres of smuggled IMFL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/racket-selling-arrack-under-guise-of-mineral-water-busted/articleshow/83461341.cms||Bosco Dominique

---||Kolkata||Step up security, form SOP for rent, say Kolkata residents||KOLKATA: A large group of flat owners of Shukhobrishti complex in New Town, which witnessed a shootout between police and two wanted gangsters, staged a demonstration at the main entrance on Saturday, demanding immediate tightening of security. They also lodged a complaint of criminal negligence and breach of trust at the Techno City police station against developers. Their demands included installation of adequate CCTV cameras, deployment of more guards and clarity on expenditure of maintenance fees collected by developers. Built on 150 acres, the 12,000-odd flats were covered by only three cameras and 160 security men kept guard, they said. The residents demanded a proper SOP for flat rent and sale. “As no formal body has been formed, the corpus deposit of over Rs10 crore, to be refunded to the owners’ body, is being enjoyed by the developers. It is an offence of fraud and cheat. They collect Rs 20 crore an annum as maintenance charge but never show the balance sheet,” said Mainak Kanrar, a cultural association member. TOItried to contact at least two officials handling the maintenance but did not receive any response. New Town Forum & News, an umbrella body of residents’ associations in New Town, held a signature campaign on Saturday on a 14-point agenda on ways to improve Shukhobristi’s security, which they will submit to police and NKDA. They highlighted the need for a residents’ welfare association at Shukhobristi, a police kiosk on the premises , an app for access to the housing, ID cards for help and vendors, and installation of CCTV cameras at each tower. Many RWAs are involved in the renting of flats. “We have a foolproof system and submit tenants’ documents but we can’t check their background. We will find out from cops if the checks were done,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of South City Residency association. Manav Mehera, president of Siddha Pines, where 20% flats are on rent, said, “Owners have to take the onus of their flats.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/step-up-security-form-sop-for-rent-residents/articleshow/83469181.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: One held for assaulting medico on vax duty in Osmanabad||AURANGABAD: A medico deployed on vaccination duty in the Kalamb tehsil of Osmanabad district was assaulted by a relative of a former MP on Saturday afternoon. Police have arrested the accused, identified as Balaji Narhire. Taking cognizance of the incident, Kalamb police have registered a case of assault and using criminal force to deter a government official from performing his duty, voluntarily causing hurt, an intentional insult to provoke breach of peace. In addition to this, the accused has also been booked under Disaster Management Act. Superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan told TOI, “We have registered a case for assaulting a medico on vaccination duty and the suspect has been arrested.” The officer said there were initial reports of medicos planning to go on a strike to protest against the alleged incident, but the decision was finally withdrawn after swift action undertaken by the police. Abhijit Londhe (41) and his father, both are paediatricians, run a hospital in Punarvasan Savargaon area of Kalamb. After there were objections to the vaccination centre in Osmanabad’s sub-district hospital, the vaccine centre was shut. Then it was started in Londhe’s hospital. Abhijit Londhe told TOI, “We have been running this vaccination centre for over three months and all the people from the locality have been supporting the vaccination drive, except for this one family. Earlier too, they raised objections to visitors parking their vehicles in the colony.” The medico, in his complaint, said on Saturday, some people, who had come to get the vaccine, had parked their vehicles in the colony. Following this, the suspect stepped out of his house and started abusing. On learning about it, the medico came out of the hospital, only to be assaulted by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/1-held-for-assaulting-medico-on-vax-duty-in-osmanabad/articleshow/83465401.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Scared of harassment, tenants plan to move out||KOLKATA: The shootout at Shukhobrishti in New Town on Wednesday and the killings of the two gangsters have shaken the residents so much that many of the tenants have decided to move out. As the gangsters from Punjab, Jaipal Singh Bhullar and Jaspreet Singh Jassi, were found to be staying at the complex as tenants on fake ID papers, questions are being raised about security lapse and lax checking during renting of flats. As a result, many tenants fear harassment at the hands of security agencies, who might want to verify their rent agreements. “Usually, the security agencies turn hyperactive after such an incident. In some cases, even innocent people are not spared. This is why we have decided to shift to some other complex either in New Town or somewhere in the surroundings,” said a tenant at the housing complex, which has around 12,000 flats. Some said they had already received signals from their landlords that their leave and lease licence might not be extended further. There were others, who did not feel it safe at Shukhobrishti any more, and posted their requirements for flats on social media platforms of the township. “I would like to move out. I have posted my requirements on an online platform and the rent I can afford to pay. I think it will be safer to stay elsewhere,” said a tenant at Shukhobrishti. Members of the housing society, however, assured that tenants did not need to feel scared. “We have no problems with tenants or vendors. The agency responsible for the maintenance of the complex and for looking into the rent process is not performing its duty judiciously. Any tenant with a legally drawn agreement has every right to stay here till his/her lease expires,” said a senior office-bearer of the Shukhobrishti housing society. New Town has turned into a favoured destination for students, techies and other professionals to rent accommodations as most offices are located in the township and the nearby Sector V. The high demand has given rise to a brokers’ nexus that sometimes bend safety rules to arrange for homes for their clients. A citizens’ forum has approached the local police and the administration to implement more safety measures in the township so that residents do not feel vulnerable. They have requested the authorities to verify the background of the tenants and check the rent agreements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zee-tenants-12/06/21/articleshow/83469188.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Trichy||Child labourers more than doubled during lockdown: Survey||Trichy: An organization working against child labour has found in a statewide survey that the number of child labourers has surged during the second wave of Covid-19. The outfit called “Campaign against child labour- Tamil Nadu and Puducherry” (CACL- TN & PY) said they found 650 child labourers in a survey carried out in 24 districts of Tamil Nadu during the lockdown necessitated by the second wave. The number was 231 during the first wave.CACL central region organiser R Maruthanayagam said on Saturday that the survey was done among 950 students. Financial constraints of the family forced children to step out for work while some went to work to buy smartphones to attend classes. The survey also threw more light on the pathetic working conditions of children at the workplace where they underwent mental and physical harassment. They were also forced to work for more than eight hours. The figures were released in connection with the observance of World Day Against Child Labour. CACL said UNICEF had stated that the number of child labourers touched a new high during the pandemic. Welcoming the financial assistance schemes announced by the state and central governments for children who lost their parents due to Covid-19, CACL put forth a slew of demands for the welfare of the children. It wanted the state government to conduct a rapid survey to find out the exact number of the child labourers. Village-level child protection committee (VLCPC) and block level child protection committee (BLCPC) should be strengthened.While expressing disappointment with the functioning of various stake holders of child welfare, Maruthanayagam said the child welfare committee (CWC), juvenile justice board (JJB) and district child protection unit (DCPU) etc should be pressed into action to work for the safety and care of children during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/child-labourers-more-than-doubled-during-lockdown-survey/articleshow/83469191.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur gets ‘auto fire balls’ to save records & docs||Kolhapur: The Kolhapur district disaster management committee has procured ‘auto fire balls’ that act as automatic fire extinguishers to help keep old records and record rooms safe from fire. They will be installed at government offices and record rooms across the district. Prasad Sankpal, the head of the district disaster management committee in Kolhapur, said, “Old records, government documents and other important papers are maintained for years in the record rooms. Many fire accidents have taken place across the state where such record rooms and documents were destroyed. To avoid such incidents, we have procured the auto fire balls. In case of a fire, these balls will burst in 30 seconds and spread a powder that will form a layer over the fire cutting oxygen supply. Without oxygen, the fire will be extinguished. These balls will be very helpful at night when there are fewer personnel in the offices. The cost of the one auto fire ball — which is about the size of a basketball — is Rs 2,000. Currently, 150 such fire balls have been procured. These balls will be installed at the Collector’s office, the divisional and sub-divisional magistrate offices and other government record rooms. “Moreover, breathing apparatus attached with oxygen cylinders and masks for the firemen are in possession of the disaster management team. The equipment costs Rs 1,50,000 each. This will help the firemen in carrying out rescue operations,” said Sankpal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-gets-auto-fire-balls-to-save-records-docs/articleshow/83465417.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: ‘United’ Patidars resolve to abolish separate identities||RAJKOT: The Patidars had been waiting, with many even becoming restive, for a surge in the community’s political agenda and to be part of the state governance. With an eye on the 2022 assembly election, a meeting of five Patidar religious and community organizations, held in Kagvad at Khodaldham on Saturday, also took a bold step towards erasing the underlying schism within the community. It decided to abolish separate identities for Leuva and Kadva factions uniting both under the broad umbrella of ‘Patidar only’. This was one of the agendas that a similar meeting held earlier at Umiyadham in Unjha, headquarter of Kadva Patidar community, a few months before had set for Saturday’s meeting. Khodaldham, the biggest temple of goddess Khodal located around 65km from Rajkot city, is also considered a headquarter of Leuva Patidar community of Gujarat. However, the tone and intent was set much before the actual meeting took place by Naresh Patel, head of Khodaldham himself, who indirectly expressed the desire to find a next chief ministerial candidate from among the Patidar community, while talking to media persons. “The Patidar community is very big and the meeting is organized to see that the community gets more importance politically and also in administration,” Patel, who had hosted the meeting, said. The elections are scheduled at the end of 2022. Patel also listed out why Patidar community should get more importance and named a few factors like its population, influence in every field, besides being the biggest taxpayers. He said for the unification of the community, a federation will be created, the name of which along with its constitution will be announced soon. Parrying a query on political ambitions, Patel said: “All communities desire to have a chief minister from their own. So, definitely we too desire that a Patidar becomes the next CM,” adding, “After Keshubhai (Patel) the community did not get the leader of same level.” He also lambasted the present administration for failing to manage the Covid-19 pandemic situation. When asked about Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) entry into Gujarat, Patel said that the prospects of a third party in the state’s political history has not been very sunny. “But looking at the experiment done by AAP in Delhi and other states they will be benefited in the next election,” he quickly added. During the meeting the leaders also resolved to ask the government to revive the non reserved commission that was formed to counter ‘Patidar Anamat Andolan’ during the Patidar agitation in the state. The meeting started at around 11am and ended around 2.30pm. Briefing the media again after the meeting, Patel said that the the community organizations will support the members who are already in politics to get ‘appropriate’ place in the political strata, while they will seek ‘work as per capability’ for those members in the administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/united-patidars-resolve-to-abolish-separate-identities/articleshow/83467468.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Schools are better geared up for e-class 2.0 this academic year||MUMBAI: As schools get ready for the new academic year, albeit online, they are doing away with the practice of reshuffling students going to the next class. The state has directed educational institutes to begin the new academic year from June 15. Online schools and colleges in Vidarbha will reopen on June 28. Like last year, blackboard teaching will be replaced by virtual classrooms for the second consecutive year. While teachers and students are better geared up this time, schools have made it easy for them by moving an entire division from one academic year to another. Normally, students of a class are not moved to the same class in the next grade, but are shuffled into different divisions, in which they end up losing their classmate friends. Reshuffling is usually done to ensure that students mix and gel with different children through their school journey. “Reshuffling would have disturbed the online teaching process that is in place. Groups were formed among students of each class last year. If the entire class moves to the same division of the higher standard, it will be easier for both students and teachers,” said Neelima Pathak, principal, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Vidyalaya, Vikhroli. A teacher has to now simply connect with the class teacher of the division he/she will get and obtain all details about the student. “In physical school, it takes less than a month to know each student. In the virtual classroom last year, it was only post November that I knew names and details of my students,” said Virginia Dsilva, class 4 teacher of St Joseph’s school, Kandivli (west). With a year into virtual teaching, teachers are well-versed with their online tools of teaching. This year schools are also focusing on orientation sessions with parents, who are being advised to not chase marks and instead focus on inculcating values in their children. The results of many students in schools across the city indicated cheating during online exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-schools-are-better-geared-up-for-e-class-2-0-this-academic-year/articleshow/83472212.cms||Sandhya Nair

The decision was mutually taken. Historian and mountaineering expert Dr Amar Adake said, “The Panhala-Pawankhind expedition is not merely a trek, it has history behind it. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had bravely escaped from the Panhala fort from Siddi Masud of Adil Shah Sultanate on July 13, 1660, and had reached Vishalgad fort taking the Pawankhind route. Maratha warriors Shiva Kashid and Bajiprabhu Deshpande lost their lives in this battle. For the trekkers from across Maharashtra, the Panhala-Pawankhind trek is a sacred expedition and thousands of trekkers come every year .” Sagar Patil from Kolhapur Hikers said, “This 50 km trek, which passes through plateaus, deep jungle, farmlands, steeps, slopes, valleys and streams, takes two to three days. The trek usually takes place in June and July every year.” “This year, due to Covid outbreak, only the trekkers or locals, who reside along this treks start and endpoints, can go and pay their respect to the statues of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Bajiprabhu Deshpande and Veer Shiva Kashid on July 12 and 13. Trekkers and historians will share their experiences and information on the Battle of Pawankhind and we will stream it on Facebook Live,” he said  He added, “All the groups will organise blood donation campaigns at their respective places as a tribute to Bajiprabhu Deshpande.” Trekking group organisers and members of the Kolhapur district mountaineering association like Dr Amar Adake, Pandit Powar, Hemant Salokhe, Sagar Patil, Vinod Salokhe, Rajesh Patil, Ramdas Patil, Sagar Kadav, Dipak Savekar, Sadashiv Patil, Umesh Kodolikar, Vijay Sase, Vishwanath Bhosale attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/historical-trek-hits-pandemic-roadblock/articleshow/83465424.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Sumit had been on the run since Wednesday. After the shootout on Wednesday, police came across photo IDs — Sumit’s passport and an Aadhaar card — along with the rent agreement for the Shukhobrishti flat that was booked in Sumit’s name. Cops later found out that Bharat Kumar, who had brought Bhullar and Jassi from Punjab to Kolkata in a car, had posed as Sumit while renting the flat. The original documents of the IDs were found with Bharat as well. However, when cops raided Sumit’s Rohtak residence, the address of which was mentioned on his ID cards, he was found absconding. On Saturday, he was picked up from a hideout in Mohali. Cops said Sumit initially claimed he had given the IDs to Bharat for a car registration deal in his name but didn’t know he would use that to house criminals. Later, cops said, he confessed to his crime. “Sumit is a close associate and business partner of Bharat, who had helped Bhullar and Jassi escape from Morena, Gwalior and arranged a hideout for them in Kolkata,” said Amit Prasad, additional director general of police (ADGP) Counter Intelligence and Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU). The ADGP said that preliminary investigations had found that both Sumit and Bharat were involved in illegal sale of fancy mobile numbers, including mobile numbers of foreign-based telecoms, purchased from different countries and other states, and sold them across Punjab, Haryana at exorbitant rates. Bharat also had in his possession an official ID of constable Amarjit Singh, which was being used to evade toll plazas, while escaping from Gwalior. “Although, Bharat claimed that constable Amarjit is his and Sumit’s mutual friend, the police are investigating why he was in possession of the cop’s official ID and if the latter had any knowledge about his ID being misused,” said ADGP Amit Prasad. Bharat’s mother-in-law lives in Charu Market in the city. She told reporters that Bharat and his wife Piyali had come to her house on May 21. While Piyali had stayed back for lunch, Bharat had left in his car and picked up Piyali later in the evening. They stayed at a hotel for a week, she told cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-whose-id-was-used-to-rent-new-town-flat-caught/articleshow/83469192.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Transport minister Bikram Singh said after the implementation of the amended rules, as per Section 146 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, if there is no valid insurance of the vehicle at the time of the accident, the affected would be compensated according to the directions of the tribunal. After this amendment, the claim process would be expedited and the claim settlement would be ensured in a time bound manner, he added. Bikram Singh said there would be a proper provision to protect the interests of the applicant after amendment in the rules. He said motor vehicle would not be released in case of accidental death, bodily injury or damage to property. He said if there is no third party risk cover in the insurance policy, a provision has been made to sell the vehicle by the police and compensate the affected. He said provision has been made in the rules to simplify the process from application to time-bound payment under accident insurance. He said the amount would be directly transferred to the beneficiary’s account through RTGS or NEFT. In case more than one vehicle is involved in the accident, the claim amount would be paid to all the vehicles on the basis of police report. If the claimant is unable to bear the cost of summoning the witnesses, the cost would be borne by the government. A provision has also been made to constitute a medical board by the tribunal on disability claims and submit report within 15 days, he added. He said the proposed amendments would be published in the gazette and the website to receive the objections or suggestions of the general public. These rules would be finalised after a month, after the disposal of the objections and suggestions received, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-principle-nod-to-amend-vehicle-accident-claim-rules/articleshow/83470146.cms||---

---||Pune||‘Born to Battle’ coursemates to pay tribute to fallen heroes today||Pune: A group of retired Army officers from the city will commemorate the golden jubilee of their commissioning into the Indian Army by laying a wreath at the National War memorial, Southern Command, on Sunday. Lieutenant General Deepak Raj (retired) will lay the wreath on behalf of the course at the memorial on Sunday. On June 13, 1971, as many as 349 cadets passed out of the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun, and were commissioned as second lieutenants in various branches of the Indian Army. Within six months of commissioning, they were deployed in the 1971 war against Pakistan. For this reason, the 47th regular and 31st technical course has been dubbed the “Born to Battle” course. Ahead of the function, veterans said officers from the course made the country proud. Further, this was the only course to have been awarded the highest awards for gallantry in war and peace: the Param Vir Chakra and the Ashok Chakra — conferred upon Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal and Colonel NJC Nair, respectively. In addition, officers from the course have also been awarded three Shaurya Chakras and four Sena Medals for gallantry, apart from a host of other decorations. “History tells us we were up to the task and (justified) the trust reposed in us, considering the number of our batchmates who made the supreme sacrifice in the 1971 Indo-Pak war,” said Brigadier Deepak Bajaj (retired). Colonel Vinay Dalvi (retired), said, “Within six months, all of us were in the thick of the 1971 war ... 50 years on and now in our 70s, we can vividly recall the long, eventful and enjoyable journey. One feels truly blessed and honoured to be a part of this famed course.” Recalling their training days, Colonel Rajinder Khushwaha (retired) said, “Arun Khetarpal and I are from the same squadron, Foxtrot, at the National Defence Academy (NDA). We spent three years together in NDA. He was a soft-spoken but determined fellow. Aggression was never his forte. But what he did in the Battle of Basantar, in 1971, explains that there were many other factors, other than aggressive nature, which make you do the unthinkable. Mental steadfastness is the other name for bravery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/born-to-battle-coursemates-to-pay-tribute-to-fallen-heroes-today/articleshow/83470171.cms||Sandip Dighe

There are at least 10 districts where less than 10 or maximum of 10 cases have been reported in the entire week between June 6 and June 12. And on June 12, there was not even a single district where more than 100 new covid-19 cases were reported in the state. Least, only one new positive case was reported from Alirajpur district in the entire week, apart from it other districts where less than 10 or maximum of 10 cases were reported in the week include, Tikamgarh (only 2 cases reported), Bhind (only 2 cases reported), Katni (only 4 cases reported), Mandla (only 6 cases reported), Khandwa (only 7 cases reported), Singrauli (only 9 cases reported), Morena (only 9 cases reported), Guna and Burhanpur districts where 10 cases each were reported in the entire week. Besides, these 10 districts there are another 14 districts where less than 20 cases were reported in the past one week. And in another 8 districts between 20 and 25 cases were reported in the week. Thus on an average in 32 districts of the state less than 25 new covid-19 cases were reported in the entire week. And besides Bhopal (793 cases reported) and Indore (289 cases), there are no other districts in the state where more than 100 cases were reported in the entire week. Sources said that these figures show a steady decline in the new cases reported across the state, and it is good sign, however things will be clear in next few days, as the lockdown was relaxed in the first week of June in majority of the districts and the signs of infection are visible after 3 to 5 days of getting infected, but of course things are improving. And if things remain same and a little precaution is taken in terms of maintaining social distance, wearing masks and also maintaining hand hygiene, there is a greater possibility that any third wave or third peak in cases could be avoided, added sources. But it is only possible if proper precautions are taken and adequate vaccination is done, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/less-than-10-new-covid-19-cases-in-10-dists-in-a-week/articleshow/83469195.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Already aggrieved by his separation with a relative of Pandey with whom Sahu had a love relation for seven years, a source stated that the alleged perpetrator had decided to teach the victim’s family a lesson after he was twice humiliated by showing his mother’s image on the cellphone. As per a source at Indiramata Nagar where Pandeys stayed, some tension was going on between Sahu and victim’s family.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Couple booked for manipulating voter list||RAJKOT: A couple from Khambhaliya town in Devbhumi Dwarka district was booked for allegedly changing the residential address of a poll contestant on the election commission of India (ECI) portal. The couple committed the fraud to debar a strong candidate from contesting the municipality election held in February this year, sources said.  Jam Khambhalia police on Friday night booked Karan Joshi and his wife Sejal following a complaint filed by Vasu Doru. The complainant had given an application to the police in February. After conducting investigation, police booked the Joshi couple under IPC sections 465, 466, 468, 471, 120 (b) and relevant sections of I-T Act which mainly deal with forgery. According to the complainant, his wife Geeta was to contest the municipality election from ward number 4 which was a reserved seat for scheduled caste candidates. However, the final voter list published by the election officer wrongly showed Doru family’s residential address coming under Shaktinagar gram panchayat. The mistake meant Geeta was not eligible to contest from ward 4 as she was not a voter of that ward. Also, the name of the complainant’s mother Jaya, who was the incumbent ward member that time, was deleted in the final list. However, the names of the Doru family and their address were correctly mentioned in the primary voter list. Doru approached cops with a complaint regarding change in residential address on the record of election commission. The cyber cell of Devbhumi Dwarka police found the login record of Joshi couple on the national voter service application. They changed the address of the complainant by uploading a fake electricity bill of PGVCL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/couple-booked-for-manipulating-voter-list/articleshow/83467580.cms||---

Each of the grocery kits has 10kg of rice, salt, masala powders, 1kg of pulses, cooking oil and other essential commodities required for a family. The school teacher and his wife D Sowmya, an IT professional, load the grocery kits in their car and cover the low-income group (LIG) areas in Trichy city including Thennur, Srirangam and Thiruvanaikoil. “Friends residing in Japan and Singapore have contributed the majority of the fund. We focus on cobblers and daily wagers who lost income in the lockdown,” Satheesh Kumar said.Having undergone the struggle after contracting the infection, Satheesh said that he decided to help people who were economically impacted by the pandemic. “Although I was least interested in clicking pictures while distributing the kits, photographs are needed to share with the donors for their satisfaction. But, not many of the beneficiaries were interested in posing for the photographs,” Satheesh said. He said that his family did not stop him from stepping out even after recovering. “We are wearing masks and frequently sanitising our hands, while distributing the grocery items,” Satheesh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/school-teacher-distributes-grocery-kits-to-the-poor/articleshow/83469216.cms||Deepak Karthik

The IMD downgraded Sunday’s red alert to orange, indicating a heavy rain spell for the city, and not extremely heavy, as was forecast earlier. Weathermen said that rain was likely to continue till Wednesday. Shubangi Bhute, scientist, IMD Mumbai, said that with the formation of a low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal and its neighbourhood and the strengthening of westerly winds, an active rainfall spell is expected over the Konkan and the adjoining ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra for four to five days. “All citizens need to take precautions as widespread rainfall activity is expected over the region during the period with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places with extremely heavy falls at isolated places,” she said. In the 12 hours of Saturday from 8.30am-8.30pm, the IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 64.8mm of rain. A warning for fishermen continued to stay in place. “Strong winds with speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60kmph likely to prevail along and off North Maharashtra coast on June 12-16. Fishermen are advised not to venture along and off North Maharashtra coast during the above mentioned period,” the IMD said. Mumbaikars were woken up early on Saturday, around 5.30am, with thunder and lightning strikes, which lasted non-stop for almost an hour. IMD officials said that lightning was due to the development of cumulonimbus clouds. Dhaval Shah, a member of the Andheri Lokhandwala Residents Association, said many who were in the last phase of their morning sleep were suddenly woken up by the loud sound of thunder and lightning. “It was very unusual and many joked on how one could fall off their bed while listening to the loud sound. It was very clear from Yari Road, Lokhandwala area,” he said. The Santacruz observatory has so far recorded 641.3mm of rain, which is 526.5mm above normal beginning from June 1. Powai lake started overflowing at 3pm, almost a month earlier as compared to last year, when the lake started overflowing on July 5. IMD officials said the extremely heavy rainfall belt has shifted southwards and so warnings had to be updated. “Still IMD expects heavy to very heavy rainfall in city and suburbs tomorrow,” said Bhute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/waking-up-to-thundershowers-mumbai-city-gets-back-calm-after-noon/articleshow/83471312.cms||Richa Pinto

Besides covering the household workers, car cleaners, vegetable vendors, chowkidars, etc., these associations are even trying to ensure that people in nearby blind schools, orphanages and jhuggi clusters get vaccinated. In Sainik Vihar, the RWA has gathered Rs 2 lakh. In its first camp organised on May 19, 25 guards and office staff were vaccinated. In another round, 25 people, including 12 from a blind school in Mehrauli and the rest from a jhuggi cluster near Tilpath Valley, got the jab. “Two NGOs, Rasoi on Wheels and Rehmat, have offered to help us with funds. The third round of vaccination camp for which 50 people had registered will end on Sunday. Ours is a drive-through facility, which will help differently abled and other people who can’t access regular vaccination centres due to their missing infrastructure. Those unable to get slots or use CoWin app can receive the jab for free here,” said Hardeep Singh Bhalla, president, Western Avenue Residents’ Welfare Association, Sainik Farm. To help vendors, persons ironing clothes, domestic workers and guards get vaccinated, Lajpat Nagar-3 RWA will be holding a camp on Monday. “Our aim is to keep the area safe. Since these people interact with residents, it is important to get them all vaccinated. Isha Trust, an NGO, has agreed to bear the cost and Max Saket will organise the camp. We have registered 100 such people and may also help their family members. We have got an approval from the district administration,” said SB Singh, president of Lajpat Nagar-3 RWA. In Sundar Nagar also, the RWA held a vaccination camp. “While we bore the cost of organising the camp last Wednesday and paid for vaccination of colony guards, the residents came forward to finance the vaccination of their household staff in large numbers after our appeal. We managed to help at least 267 such people, including office staff, cooks, families of domestic workers, etc.,” said Atul Bhargava, treasurer of Sundar Nagar RWA. Even in Vasant Kunj C-8 block, many residents decided to pay for their staff.

---||Goa||Firms boosting skilled jobs may get IPB weightage||Panaji: Goa Investment Promotion Board (IPB) is working on a new process to evaluate investment proposals and allot industrial land in Goa. IPB’s sub-committee met on Friday to understand the new process and to finalise the evaluation system, which will be submitted to chief minister Pramod Sawant who heads the board. Goa IPB plans to rework the way investment projects are screened with more weightage likely to be given to projects that create skilled employment opportunities. Industries minister Vishwajit Rane chaired the meeting of the sub-committee in the presence of Secretary - Industries Ashok Kumar, chief executive officer of IPB Swetika Sanchan, Rajkumar Kamat, Manoj Caculo, Damodar Kochkar and Harish Rajani. Sachan gave a presentation on the new evaluation system with industry members giving inputs and suggestions. Government officials said that the inputs will be vetted and incorporated and then put up for the board’s approval. “We discussed the proposed land allotment process and project evaluation framework for Goa IPB,” said Rane. “All the suggestions will be put forward to the chief minister for further evaluation.” IPB will also hold deliberations with the technology provider as the screening process is likely to be automated to avoid subjective bias creeping in. “The discussion was to see which points in the project proposal should get more weightage, which sectors should be encouraged and how to attract more investment,” said one of the industry representatives who was present for the meeting. The sub-committee did not take any final decision and no date has been fixed for the board to meet and approve the proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/firms-boosting-skilled-jobs-may-get-ipb-weightage/articleshow/83472237.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||JRP leader releases another ‘audio clip’ of state BJP chief||Kozhikode: Janathipathya Rashtreeya Party (JRP) state treasurer Praseeda Azhikode has released yet another audio clip of a purported telephone conversation she had with BJP state president K Surendran to buttress her allegation that the latter had given Rs 10 lakh to JRP chairperson and tribal leader C K Janu for her re-entry to the NDA before the assembly elections. In the audio clip of the alleged conversation made before Surendran came to meet Janu at a hotel in Thiruvananthapuram in March, Surendran is heard asking Praseeda whether Janu will tell about the matter to Krishnadas (referring to BJP national executive committee member P K Krishnadas). Praseeda is heard assuring Surendran that Janu will not reveal it to anyone. “I have kept everything ready in my bag and have been travelling with it since yesterday morning,” Surendran is heard telling in the audio clip to which Praseeda is heard asking if it became a great risk to him. Praseeda told media in Kannur on Saturday that Surendran was referring to the money which he was bringing to the hotel to give to Janu. Surendran is also heard telling in the clip that he will reach the hotel by 9.15am and asked her to place order for breakfast. Janu made her re-entry to the NDA at a rally attended by home minister Amit Shah in Thiruvananthapuram on March 7 to mark the culmination of the ‘Vijaya Yatra’ led by Surendran. Asked why Surendran had specifically asked whether Janu will disclose the matter to Krishnadas, Praseeda told media that it could be because of the factionalism in the party. She said that Krishnadas had earlier approached Janu and had requested her to return to the NDA but Janu had declined it then. This is the third audio clip released by Praseeda of the purported conversations between her and Surendran and in the first conversation, she is heard telling Surendran that Janu had sought Rs 10 lakh for her return to the front and Surendran was heard agreeing to hand over the money in Thiruvananthapuram on March 6. However, both Janu and Surendran had refuted the allegation raised by Praseeda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/jrp-leader-releases-another-audio-clip-of-state-bjp-chief/articleshow/83467612.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Unlocked Saturday: Business buzz returns in Bhopal markets as cases drop amid curbs||BHOPAL: Shops in the city remained open on Saturday for the first time since the lockdown was imposed around two months ago. Even after the process of unlocking was started from June 1, weekend corona curfew was imposed wherein the curfew was in force from Friday evening to Monday morning. However, owing to the declining Covid-19 cases, district crisis management committee headed by district collector, decided on June 8, that now, there will be corona curfew only on Sundays. Thus June 12, was the first Saturday after lockdown when shops in the city remained open. However, as Sunday is a holiday and there will be lockdown then, there was more rush than normal in the markets, said sources. During the first half of the day and till late afternoon there was rush in the markets, and nearly 50% people in the markets were seen either without mask or were wearing masks but in appropriately, said sources. The condition in the new city areas like Kolar, Baghmughalia, BHEL townships also remained the same, though a slightly better number of people were seeing wearing masks, added sources. The rush in the markets, could also be attributed to the fact that the there is information regarding opening of schools from next week and as there is Sunday a day after, people thronged to the markets, however in the late afternoon, as rain and strong winds started, majority of the shops especially in old city areas were shut, and people also returned home, added sources. The decision to relax curfew on Saturday was taken after the positivity rate for covid-19 in the city reduced, for the past three days less than 100 new covid-19 positive cases are being reported from the city and the positivity rate—number of people testing positive out of every 100 samples tested—is also below 1%, this means that less than 1 person is found positive out of every 100 samples tested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/unlocked-saturday-biz-buzz-returns-in-city-markets-as-cases-drop-amid-curbs/articleshow/83469229.cms||---

The suicide note left behind by the girl doesn’t mention that she was raped but she did write ‘mere saath kuch bura hua hain’ (something bad has happened to me). “Her suicide note is full of personal incidents in her life and how she felt guilty after her mother’s death. She used to get severe migraine attacks too. May be, she didn’t get the emotional support after the rape and that led to her taking the extreme step,” an official said. The suicide note didn’t mention the name of the accused but an audio clip that she had sent to her boyfriend helped the cops learn that she was raped. “The accused and the girl’s father are hiding something. She may have faced brutal sexual assault or even unnatural sex as she was having severe abdominal pain. The post mortem report and FSL tests will reveal it,” official said. “One of the focusses is on the girl’s suicide. She was in shock after the rape and her father wasn’t willing to file complaint initially. Also, she wasn’t in good mental state. There may be several reasons which we are probing,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/girl-blamed-self-for-moms-death/articleshow/83468884.cms||---

Keeping this in mind, an NGO has been working to provide motivational sessions and mental counselling amongst other relief drives, which includes distribution of food, masks and reusable menstrual pads across the capital. For Covid-19 relief in particular, the NGO Saday, which works all across the country, has been providing relief in six sectors in the capital — mask distribution, door-to-door delivery of dry ration, providing home-cooked meals, distribution of medical kits, distribution of reusable pads and mental health counselling sessions. Called ‘It’s Okay Not to Be Okay’, the counselling programme has already provided over 100 sessions to people who are largely unable to feed their families. “We started the programme in June, 2020 and we have a team of around 10 psychologists and counsellors working with us on a pro-bono basis. After a form is filled with us, we put people in touch with a counsellor. Each week, one session is held that looks to motivate them and guides them on the way forward,” said a member of Saday. Another member says in the last six months, the NGO began working on menstrual hygiene awareness too, with a project ‘My Pad My Pride’. Over 2,000 reusable cloth pads have been provided across Delhi-NCR. The NGO is also working on another project ‘Shiksha’ to bring out the best in underprivileged children. For assistance or providing donations, people can reach the NGO at www.sadaysadev.org or on the helpline numbers 7532019866 or 9643424286.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mental-health-counselling-among-relief-for-the-poor/articleshow/83471314.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The trio diverted the saleswoman attention by engaging her in talks and stole the gold chains weighing a total 20 grams, while sitting right across her on the other side of the display desk. Sarthana police booked the three unidentified women on Friday and registered an offence of stealing two gold chains worth Rs 1 lakh based on a complaint filed by the owner of Manki Jewellers, Sanjay Trada. On May 28, the women arrived at around 11.25 pm posing as customers and asked the saleswoman to show them gold chains. Dressed in simple clothes, the women pretended to check the chains while stealthily lifting two of them and leaving within a few minutes thereafter. The store staff noticed the theft only in the evening when they discovered two chains missing from the stock. “I am checking with other jewellers in the area if a theft was carried out in a similar pattern from their shop,” Trada told TOI. Photos and video of the women are being circulated by police in the Sarthana area and nearby police stations to identify the women. “Police are working to identify them from CCTV footage. We got few leads and the accused women will be nabbed soon,” said an officer in Sarthana police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/three-women-stealing-gold-caught-on-camera/articleshow/83467619.cms||---

A large number of people, mainly from Nashik city and other areas, visit the dams for picnics. Incidents of people drowning also occur from time to time. On Saturday afternoon, Kamlesh Sonawane (25), a resident of Pawan Nagar, drowned at the Waldevi dam. Sonawane and his five friends had gone to the dam for a swim. But apart from Sonawane, everyone came out. The Wadivarhe police rushed to the spot. With the help of the locals, Sonawane’s body was fished out after two hours. On March 30, three people of a private company went to the Mukne dam to swim. Of them, two drowned. On April 17, a birthday celebration of a 14-year-old girl at Waldevi dam took a tragic turn when she along with five others drowned.Jadhav said, “We have written to the irrigation department from time to time to put up signboards of warnings at the dam sites and deploy security guards so that people do not go to the dams for fun. There are four dams under our jurisdiction and it is very difficult to keep watch on these sites all the time during routine police work. However, we continue patrolling.”Superintendent of police Sachin Patil said, “There have been quite a few cases of drowning in the dams in Wadivarhe and those under other police stations there. Given the possible rush of people at the dams during monsoon, the officers' in-charge of the police stations have been instructed to put up nakabandi points on the roads leading to the dams.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ensure-people-dont-have-easy-access-to-dams-police/articleshow/83465549.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kochi||Kochi corporation faces threat of dengue outbreak||KOCHI: With the onset of monsoon, the pandemic-stricken Kochi corporation is reeling under dengue fever outbreak. Vyttila Janata, division 52 under Ponnurunni urban health centre, has reported dengue outbreak. As many as 24 new cases have been reported due to the outbreak in the division in the past one week. Also, outdoor breeding sites of Aedes mosquito, which spreads dengue, has been identified in the city limits. During the summer, the breeding grounds of Aedes larvae were mostly indoors. June is the breeding season of Aedes larvae and authorities expect more dengue cases in Kochi if source reduction activities by residents are inadequate. Kochi corporation limit reported as many as 230 cases from January to June 10 this year. Hundreds of mosquito breeding sources were found in the division. Bowls used for providing drinking water for pets, buckets used as fire extinguisher in petrol bunks, ill-maintained fountains in front of petrol bunks, pipes for laying electric cables, barrels for storing tar as part of road works, unused shoes, terrace and waste dumped by people are the major sources of Aedes mosquito at Vyttila Janata division. “It has been revealed that the dry day being observed by residents in the area is not in full scale. We have noticed mosquito breeding sites even in houses where the residents had observed dry day. A suspected dengue death of an elderly man was reported from division 52 three weeks ago,” said Dr Vinod Paulose, district surveillance officer for non-Covid diseases in Ernakulam. It has also been noticed that uninhabited houses and vacant plots have become mosquito breeding grounds due to the presence of unused tanks and people dumping waste in these plots. Perumarady panchayat and some other local bodies, including Thrikkakara, also face outbreak threat. Five or more cases, with similar symptoms, from a single area is regarded as an outbreak. The offices which remain closed due to lockdown are also turning into breeding ground of Aedes larvae. Chances of employees contracting dengue are high when such offices reopen. “The normal functioning of the offices should resume after clearing all the possible sources of Aedes larvae,” said Dr Paulose. “Despite fogging and other control activities by health workers, residents are not aware of many breeding grounds. Dengue cases, which have increased in the corporation limit over the past week, started declining now. We will get a clear picture only in the next week, said Abdul Jabbar, senior biologist of vector control unit. Cases are also being reported from Mattancherry areas where the dengue cases were less compared to other places in the city in the last season. Health department and Kochi corporation authorities on Saturday night held an online meeting with residents associations in divisions 51, 52 and 53 of the local body to sensitize them about the need to take mosquito control activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-faces-threat-of-dengue-outbreak/articleshow/83469232.cms||T C Sreemol

Such is the situation that almost 50% coaching classes in the state capital are permanently closed. In Bhopal, coaching classes are concentrated in MP nagar, Kolar and Indrapuri area of BHEL. Coaching class owners felt that there is an urgent need to help them in opening the classes. “We are in deep trouble. Entire education sector has crumbled. There is a need to support the coaching classes or else the majority of them will be closed permanently,” said a coaching class owner without quoting his name. They have demanded that the classes could be opened with the 50% capacity. “We are ready to follow all Covid protocols. Due to the closed classes the situation has become very tough for the teachers also who were teaching in such classes. Several of them are jobless. They have nothing to earn as both schools and colleges are closed,” said another coaching class owner. Asked the challenges coaching classes are facing, an owner said, “We pay a rent of almost Rs 1 lakh. The landlord has been charging it. We have teachers, electricity and other bills. How to run the classes when there is no student.” Even students are willing to see the opening of coaching classes. “Permission has been given to open the market when the capital is unlocked, but coaching-classes are still closed. Online studies is enough as there is a need to open coaching classes atleast,” said Ankush Malviya, a class 11 student, who wants to prepare for engineering exams. Same is the problem with the students who want to appear for exams like NEET and such others. “Coaching classes help us a lot. I do not know how to prepare in the absence of the classes,” said Swati Verma, a class 12 student who wants to appear for NEET exam next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/lockdown-effect-over-50-coaching-classes-shut-forever/articleshow/83469230.cms||Ramendra Singh

It is suspected that the money is part of the total Rs 2.5 lakh allegedly given to Sundara as bribe by BJP leaders. It also needs to be probed whether the amount was deposited in any bank accounts. The investigators are learnt to have started the procedures to check the veracity of the claims made by Sundara by cross-checking with banks. District crime branch (DCB), Kasaragod is probing the case after Sundara raised the allegation. The sleuths had on the other day taken Sundara’s smartphone into custody. The phone was allegedly given to him by BJP leaders along with the Rs 2.5 lakh to withdraw his nomination. The probe team has also collected CCTV footages from a mobile shop at Neerchal from where the phone was purchased. However, the phone, sources said, was cheaper than what Sundara claimed. Earlier, Sundara had told police that local BJP leaders came to his house at Vaninagar, took him to their office at Jodkkal where he was threatened to withdraw his nomination. He had reiterated before the police that he was promised money and assistance to set up a wine shop at Manjeswaram if Surendran wins the election. He added that Surendran called him and gave an assurance as well. Police had registered the case against Surendran under Sections 171 B (bribery involving giving gratification to any person with the object of inducing him or any other person to exercise any electoral right or of rewarding any person for having exercised any such right) and 171 E of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gave-rs-1l-of-bribe-money-to-friend-for-safekeeping/articleshow/83467622.cms||---

Lack of coordination among various agencies and poor planning by the road relaying firms like CSML, are causing monetary loss to the government and damages to these roads. On Saturday, CSML dug up the tarred kerbs of Park Avenue Road, the relaying of which was completed by it just a few days ago, for laying utility cables. “The work on utility duct should have been done before completing the relaying of the road. Normally, it is after completing all works like construction of drains and utility ducts that a road and its main carriageway is bituminised. The recently relayed Convent Road near Shenoy's junction had been dug up for plugging a leak in a sewer line. Though the dug up portion of the road was restored, holes have already started to manifest. (Right) The work on cable duct on the side of Park Avenue Road being done on Saturday. The CSML dug up the road, relayed by the same agency a few days ago, for laying the cables. The work has already damaged the footpath in the areaBut, the CSML’s contractor is doing it the other way around,” said K S Dileep Kumar, president, Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi, an NGO. The digging up of Park Avenue Road is not an isolated case in Kochi. A portion of the TD Road near Kunhalu’s Hospital was dug up by Kerala Water Authority (KWA) for carrying out some repair works in the pipeline. Following the public raising protests, the agency soon restored the dug-up portion. Within a few days after completing the relaying, the Convent Road near Shenoy’s Junction was dug up for plugging a leak in a sewer line. Though the dug-up portion had been restored, potholes have already surfaced on the road. The Santo Gopalan Road in Fort Kochi, which had been dug up by the KWA a few months ago, is yet to be restored. According to CSML authorities, the Park Avenue Road had to be dug up for laying power cables. “The cables had to be imported. In the wake of the pandemic, it took a bit more time to get it imported. That’s why we have to do the laying of cables after completing the relaying of road,” an official with CSML said. “We have given permission to KSEB and KWA to dig up the roads, the bituminized concreting (tarring) of which are yet to be started. Regarding the other roads, we haven’t given any permission to any agency,” the official said. Similarly, the work on footpaths and drains of many of the roads relayed by CSML has not been started so far. If such works are started after completing the relaying, the reconstructed road will be damaged. “We had to postpone the work on footpaths as the electrical inspectorate of KSEB failed to give its consent for removing power cables from the drains. Now, the KSEB has informed that they will give the approval after the lockdown,” a CSML official said. “We have to shift the electricity cables to the newly constructed ducts on the kerbs of the relayed roads. Then only can we start the work on the footpaths,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/blame-game-on-over-digging-up-of-roads/articleshow/83469235.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Jain is part of a drive called India Against Corona. Initiated by co-founder Mohit Raj of Turn Your Concern Into Action (TYCIA), the drive is providing medical help, vaccine accessibility and food to the most vulnerable tribal and rural areas in 16 states across the country. Jain, who has been practising as a doctor for a year, decided to join when he was told about how rural areas, without much medical infrastructure, need assistance to fight Covid-19. “It was then that I offered to help out.” “Many doctors in India were tied up over the past few weeks due to the current wave. But we started tele-consulting recently as part of the Doctors for Diaspora group. We are trying to reach out to doctors of Indian origin who are practising abroad and can speak local languages.” Another volunteer, Divya Gupta, said, “We connected multiple groups together through a network.” She said they were trying to ensure that nobody in these vulnerable areas stayed deprived of basic resources. Jain said tele-consulting rural folks had made him realise the extent of the problem of lack of resources in these areas. “Even to get a test done, many people have to travel around 70km. Many do not have any idea about their medical history. I have worked with tribal populations in the past and know how a large population relies on just one doctor. So we are reaching out to those with mild and moderate fever.” He added that many people were also unwilling to get vaccinated as they feared side-effects or believed in rumours. “Vaccine hesitancy is a big problem in those areas.” This is what TYCIA is working on. “Our team has been working for over 15 years with vulnerable groups at multiple places. We have a network of individuals, NGOs and others who are working on vaccine awareness and accessibility,” said Raj. As part of Covid relief, he said, a collective called Kasbai was created, which includes over 1,000 frontline workers in small towns and villages. TYCIA has collaborated with multiple bodies to provide healthcare. “We connect people with doctors through tele-consultation and also provide them information on availability of hospital beds and facilities like ambulances. We also work to make sure that people get ration kits,” Raj said. The organisation is working with 80 vulnerable groups, including those living in tribal belts, those who face societal taboos such as sex workers, and migrant labourers who do not have necessary documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/access-where-there-is-none-these-docs-are-a-call-away/articleshow/83471315.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Majority of the health centres — including the Ayurvedic ones — catering to senior citizens, health freak families and even young bodybuilders are unable to resume work whenever they would be allowed to open. Reason: Their health therapists and Panchakarma experts have left the state capital and are not willing to come back. In the past couple of years several health centres have come up in the state capital. Even the national chains had extnded their business in the city with new centres. However, the business is hit severely ever since pandemic surfaced. “I do not think authorities will allow the opening of our centres soon. We understanding it. However, the issue is the survival of the business in the state capital. There are over 50 noted centres in Bhopal. Such is the situation now that the majority of them have either decided to close it permanently or they will be closed if the present situation continues for a long time,” said a spa owner without quoting his name. Even the workers and therapists who were working in different spa have left the city last year and they are not willing to come back. “What to do in Bhopal? After the first wave ended, I went back to Bhopal with a hope that the work would resume. It was a wrong decision. I wasted two months in Bhopal. It is better to be in your city instead of going out,” said a spa therapist who belongs to Manipur. There is a fear of third wave among the workers. “I have two children and parents to feed. How to take risks when everyone is talking about a possible third wave. I will not go back to Bhopal until the third wave is over. I have been vaccinated and waiting for a vaccination for children. Even after vaccination I will go back only when the issue of the third wave is over,” said another therapist expert in Panchakarma. Spa owners said that the future will make the situation about their survival. “We are waiting to see the light of the day. However, it would not be possible to open a spa even if the government allows as therapists and workers are not available. It will take time to resume work,” said an owner .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/lockdown-pressure-health-spas-on-verge-of-closure/articleshow/83476497.cms||Ramendra Singh

As a result, the farmers have appealed to the administration that any land parcel below a specific measure (if it remains with the farmers after the acquisition process) should also be acquired and compensated for,” Godse said.The farmers also wanted to know the manner in which the land acquisition process was to be carried out and raised concerns given the past experience of the farmers in case of the ‘Samruddhi’ Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication Expressway.The farmers, during the meeting that was also attended by Sinnar tehsildar Rahul Kotade and the officials of MahaRail, appealed to the administration for better remuneration for the plants and trees. “We want the administration to set up village-wise committees to calculate the compensation to the farmers in terms of land, trees, other properties (including buildings),” said Sanjay Dhatrak, a farmers from the area. The farmers have also put up other demands including reserving stalls at the railway station for the farmers who have given land to the project.The MP said that the demands were addressed by the concerned officials and the farmers were ready to cooperate. Some of their concerns would be raised with the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/farmers-meet-sinnar-mp-with-pune-nashik-rail-project-concerns/articleshow/83465599.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Kochi||Nemmara love story: Kerala women’s commission takes suo motu case||PALAKKAD: Kerala women’s commission (KWC) has registered a suo motu case in the incident in which a women was allegedly kept secretly in a room for 10 years in Nemmara by her lover Rahman. The commission in a statement said, “This story has no logic at all. Nobody can hide a woman in a room where no facilities to meet the primary needs of a person like toilets are available. The commission felt it as a case of blatant violation of human rights. The woman was kept as a slave and in an inhuman condition. The commission member will visit the woman and record her statement soon. It will also look into the lapses on the part of the police in investigating the missing case filed 10 years ago.” “It is so cruel that the woman was kept in confinement. She could not go out as the door was connected to electricity as claimed. So she could not go out even to answer the call of nature. This shows that she was kept like a slave. This cannot be justified by describing it as love, lover, romance, etc. This is a grave crime which no civilized society can accept,” the commission said. Meanwhile, the parents of Rahman rubbished it “as a concocted story which nobody could believe.” As the story had gone viral Mohammad Kani, the father of Rahman and mother Athikka said, “We cannot believe my son had kept the woman inside his room for 10 years and nobody in the family was aware of it. We believe that he kept the girl in the house of one of our relatives.” “My son is fabricating stories. It is impossible to hide a girl inside a small room for 10 years in our house. Even if she had sneezed once we would have come to know about her presence. If we had any clue about the girls’ presence we would have informed the matter to our relatives, neighbours or the police. When the girl went missing 10 years ago, police had questioned Rahman also but he told them that he had no idea about her. He told the same thing to Sajitha’s mother also, the father said. “Rahman did not go to work and remained in the house most of the time. He had complained about ill health and we had taken him to the doctors. He showed mental problems also,” Kani said. “Rahman said that he was giving a share of his food to his lover. But we do not cook extra food at home. Rahman does not have food in his room. He used to wash his plate after having food. Once he went to Tamil Nadu for two days and if Sajitha was in his room how did she got food? Rahman says he kept bread for her. He is coming up with strange stories. So, I suspect that he had kept the girl in some other place all these years,” the father said. “Our tiled house was repaired after removing the roof some time ago. At that time we entered Rahman’s room. We didn’t see the girl inside. There was no furniture except a coffee table. So his stories cannot be believed,” Kani added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nemmara-love-story-kwc-takes-suo-motu-case/articleshow/83467632.cms||---

An audio recording of an alleged phone conversation between Vala and complainant Hiten Adatiya, a resident of Amreli, has been circulating in the social media of late. In the audio clip, Vala calling himself ‘don of Amreli, is heard threatening Adatiya and demanding extortion money. Vala is also heard boasting about not being afraid of police by referring to Amreli district superintendent of police Nirlipt Rai and using abusive language for MP Naran Kachadiya and his family. “I dare to demand money even though an officer like Nirlipt Rai is posted here,” Vala is heard saying. When Adatiya expressed his inability to pay the amount, Vala threatened to fire at him at the petrol pump premises. The goon advised Adatiya ‘to be watchful while leaving the pump’ and also asked him to get police protection.

Two people died when an old tree fell on a kebab hotel at Bhopal Talkies intersection following strong winds. Three others were injured in the incident, according to Shahjehanabad police station. Rescue operation continued past sunset to remove the body of a 21-year-old man. The incident took place around five in the evening. A huge tamarind tree, which was planted in the Bada Bagh graveyard at Bhopal Talkies intersection, suddenly fell on the shop. The tree fell on the adjacent kebab shop, injuring five people who were sitting there. While two later died and two others were rescued, search was on for the last person at the time of this report going to press. According to Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC), similar incidents were reported from 60 places in the city. There was power failure in more than half the city lasting up to hours in some locations. Water-logged intersections and roads led to traffic jams and vehicles moving at a snail’s pace. Commuters on two-wheelers took shelter wherever they could. The torrential rain on Saturday was one of strongest in recent past. Besides the fall of the tamarind tree, a mobile tower on the roof of the Palace Hotel in Shahjehanabad collapsed. Wall of nearby Old Civil court also was reported to have collapsed. Injuries were not reported in the two incidents.  The balcony of Goyal house next to former mayor Alok Sharma’s house in Dayanand Chowk located in Chowk Bazar suddenly collapsed due to heavy rain. There was no one under or around it when the it caved in. As soon as information was received, the BMC staff reached the spot and also demolished the rest of the dilapidated balcony. A wall behind the old court at Shahjehanabad collapsed in heavy rain. A tree fell on the wall in Saad Colony near Teen Mohre gate located in Shahjehanabad, causing the wall to collapse. There were no casualties in both these incidents. There were no casualties reported from any other place except for Bhopal Talkies incident, a BMC official said. In some areas, heavy rain, caused waterlogging, reaching up to the ankles and even knees. Traffic jam lasted for more than an hour even after rain stopped. Hamidia road faced one of worst traffic chaos in over a year. One end of the traffic was diverted for rescue operation at Bharat Talkies. Police had closed the Bhopal Talkies intersection from all sides. Traffic coming from Hamidia Road side was diverted towards Chhola Road, whereas traffic coming from Safia College Road, Bal Vihar and Model Ground was diverted to Sindhi Colony via Lal Masjid, Noor Mahal via Shahjahanabad through Islamic Gate. Traffic in entire commercial area was moving at snail’s pace. Simultaneously, the traffic police coming from Sindhi Colony towards Bhopal Talkies on Berasia Road diverted from Sindhi Colony intersection. The situation turned worse between 7.30pm to 8.30pm as people tried to reach home before 8pm. Lockdown is implemented from 8 pm each day. The heavy rains hit drains across the city.

Several students, studying at the CBSE school, and their parents have raised complaints with the education minister’s office after the school authorities asked the students to not attend the online classes as they had not cleared fee dues. The school authorities reportedly did not share the links to the online session to those students, who had not paid the fees. After the issue caught Sivankutty’s attention, the minister asked director of general education K Jeevan Babu to intervene in the issue. The official later directed DDE Ernakulam to look into the issue and resolve it. Following this, Honey G Alexander, DDE Ernakulam, contacted the school principal and inquired about the complaint. The DDE said that if the students are denied permission to attend the classes, it is violation of Right to Education (RTE) Act. DDE directed the school to ensure that students attend the online classes. “The school management said their financial constraints are severe and many students are not paying the fees even though they have reduced the fees due to the pandemic. But we told them to resolve the issue through discussions with the parents in accordance with the existing court order on online class fees. Students should not be denied education in the name of fees. The school authorities assured that it will not happen again,” Alexander said. Many of the CBSE schools are facing severe financial crunch due to huge arrears in fee payment by the students. In many schools, tension prevails between the management and the parents with the latter demanding reduction in the school fees. In some schools, parents have protested openly against the managements alleging that they charge huge fees. But school authorities are of the opinion that they would have to stop operations if fees are not paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/school-told-not-to-deny-classes-to-kids/articleshow/83469239.cms||---

Monsoon has advanced faster over the central parts of the country, entering parts of north Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh (MP) earlier than normal by about five to seven days. Normal date for monsoon advance over parts of MP is around June 20, but it reached the state around June 11. Monsoon covered northern parts of Maharashtra by June 9-10, while it normally covers only south Maharashtra by that time. “It is likely to maintain this streak during the next few days, as it may reach eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh (UP) way ahead of time, by about seven days. It is also likely to enter some parts of northwest India earlier than usual. It normally enters Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) by June 25 but is likely to reach parts of northwest India in the next four-five days, almost a week in advance,” India Meteorological Department (IMD) director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI. Mohapatra said monsoon was quite active this time. “There is the favourable cross equatorial flow. In addition to that, the low-pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining coastal areas of West Bengal and north Odisha is helping to push monsoon forward at a faster pace. The low-pressure area is likely to become more marked and move west-northwest across Odisha, Jharkhand and north Chhattisgarh during the next two-three days,” said Mohapatra. D S Pai, scientist and head, of climate research and services, IMD, told TOI the low-pressure system is expected to take the monsoon current further. “We expect an interaction between the trough in mid-tropospheric westerlies and the low-pressure system, causing monsoon to reach parts of northwest India, including parts of Delhi (barring parts of Rajasthan) in the next few days. The low pressure is moving along the monsoon trough at a fast pace. It is likely to pump in a lot of moisture, while its interaction with the trough in mid-tropospheric westerlies will cause monsoon to move further by causing good rainfall in parts of northwest India,” said Pai. Pai said once the low-pressure system weakened and the trough moved away, monsoon might stall for a while till it got another push to cover the remaining parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-makes-rapid-progress-covers-north-maha-by-june-11/articleshow/83470279.cms||Neha Madaan

But with the pandemic still on, officials say that they are running behind schedule in planning monsoon-related activities, usually done every year to tackle ailments. In fact, sources privy to an internal review meeting said that officials present indicated that distribution of long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN), used for prevention of these diseases in rural areas, might be difficult to finish on time due to the Covid-19 protocol. Also, instead of camps this year, the department has taken up door-to-door distribution of equipment, which has only begun now. “Distribution may be started (house-to-house distribution rather than holding a camp in the villages — with use of mask and social distancing). It’s especially important as once rains start; it will be very difficult to distribute LLINs in hard-to-reach areas. Therefore, we must try to complete the LLIN distribution before the rains starts,” read an internal order circulated a day ago. However, with rains already hitting in the state, executing the order has become hassle, said an official. “We have been instructed that the house to house distribution should be finished before the rain starts...But we are already seeing rainfall for the last few days. Moreover, going house to house in rural areas with all the Covid-19 protocols in place is a time-consuming affair and we are likely to miss out on the target,” said a district medical and health official from an endemic district. The health department, meanwhile, has set upon itself the task of identifying high risk areas for malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases based on previous year’s case load and initiate preventive measures. The surveillance and preventive measures have been included in the monsoon action plan prepared by the department. In 2020, a total of 872 cases of malaria, 2,173 cases of dengue and 182 cases of chikungunya were reported in state, as per official records. Apart from distribution of LLINs, other measures planned include Indoor Residual Spray (IRS), surveillance of fever, testing for malaria and dengue and releasing of gambusia fish. “Gambusia fish should be released in the month of July and August in stagnated water bodies in the districts. Prepare the plan of action and put indent to Fisheries Department,” the action plan states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-dept-behind-schedule-on-activities-to-prevent-vector-borne-diseases/articleshow/83470287.cms||Amrita Didyala

The only two leopard rescue centres in the state — one in Nainital and the other in Haridwar — are already “crowded”, housing a dozen animals that forest teams were able to trap alive. So the forest department came up with a novel idea — shift the “inmates” to other states, especially those where rescue facilities are lying vacant. A proposal was drafted and sent to the Central Zoo Authority, which gave its nod this month. Now, in the first phase, six maneaters will be sent to Gujarat. “In Gujarat, the Jamnagar rescue centre has capacity to house 50 leopards but they only have four. We will be sending six leopards there,” said JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand forest department. As per forest officials, maintenance of each animal costs Rs 2 lakh every year. “Our rescue centres are overburdened,” said a forest officer. Between 2000-2020, 75 leopards have been declared maneaters in Uttarakhand. In the past five years alone, 27 maneaters have been put down, as per forest department. In 2020, 31 people died and 85 were left injured in leopard attacks||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rescue-centres-full-ukhand-to-shift-maneater-leopards-to-gujarat/articleshow/83473614.cms||Shivani Azad

Around 50 technicians (skilled electricians) were trained in different models of OCs before being inducted into the helpline. “They went through an orientation on how to respond to calls in different languages,” said Shishir Joshi, CEO Project Mumbai. The second covid wave has seen over 2,00,000 oxygen concentrators being imported to India. “In particular, they came into use for people needing oxygen at home,” said Joshi. Several of these OCs were imported at extremely short notice with limited after sales service facilities. , he added. The NGOs have also prepared videos which help and guide people on the basic know-how of these machines. These can be accessed on www.projectmumbai.com and https://prathamopenschool.org/Covid19Resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/helpline-started-to-guide-how-to-repair-oxygen-concentrators-in-mumbai/articleshow/83472315.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi : Police to seek custody of Martin Joseph||KOCHI: City police probing the apartment torture case in which a woman was restrained, tortured and sexually assaulted in an apartment at Marine Drive in Kochi would submit a custody application for the accused, Martin Joseph, on Monday. Police are collecting information about the antecedents of the accused. Sources said that till Saturday evening, the investigators have not received any new complaints against him. City police had on Friday released a notice urging the public to contact them in case they have any complaints against this person. A senior police officer said that the accused seemed to be a delinquent person in general. “In both the cases registered against him, the women were familiar to him. In the original case, he started torturing her after staying together for several months. In the complaint by the second woman, she was known to him and he attacked her, probably while trying to find a refuge in her house. Both the attacks had the characteristics of a domestic violence case. Only a thorough probe would reveal the extent of his criminal activities,” said the officer. City police are also investigating the accused’s luxurious lifestyle involving premium flats and multiple vehicles. Police had seized two cars and a motorcycle from the accused. Joseph, a Thrissur native, was residing in Kochi and had been on the run ever since police registered a case against him on a woman’s petition. He was finally arrested from Thrissur on Friday. Police said the accused had been in a live-in relationship with the survivor for several months before he allegedly became violent and started torturing her during the last months of 2020. The victim had filed a complaint on April 8, a month after she had escaped from the apartment where she was allegedly locked up. He was booked under sections 376 (rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 days or more), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means or weapons) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-to-seek-custody-of-martin/articleshow/83467653.cms||---
---||Pune||As air quality alarms ring, electric vehicles see a window of opportunity||PUNE: Skyrocketing fuel prices and rising air pollution have ensured that electric vehicles are in prime position to make inroads into a market that’s got its eye on a cleaner, greener future. Track the pollution level in your cityPreliminary studies, by Indian scientists and those abroad, have found a link between polluted air, and severe infection and increased mortality from Covid-19. Fuel prices are well over the Rs100/litre-mark across India. Last September, a study across six cities by Indian Institute of Tropical Metrology (IITM) found that people in cities exposed to higher baseline levels of PM2.5 run a higher risk of dying of Covid-19. “ PM2.5 is considered the most dangerous [pollutant] as it penetrates deeply, reaching the base of the lungs and entering the blood system. Long-term exposure leads to dysregulation and compromises the immune system. A person with a compromised immune system cannot effectively fight Covid, making them vulnerable,” Sachin Gunthe, a professor and researcher at Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, said in an interview with ‘The Weather Channel’ in December 2020. Rising fuel costs are another problem — a litre of petrol costs over Rs 100 in many cities across India. A drop in demand and availability of public transportation during the pandemic, and a potential rise in demand for personal vehicles, especially two-wheelers, has prompted policymakers, such as central government thinktank NITI Aayog, to urge manufacturers and other stakeholders to consider a mass shift to electric vehicles. “About 80% of all vehicles in India are two- and three-wheelers. We need to go all out in that space — as well as in public transport and long-distance commercial transport — with electric vehicles,” Amitabh Kant, NITI Aayog CEO, said while addressing a gathering of cell manufacturers late last month. Kant touted the Union government’s new product-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for advanced chemistry cells (ACCs), which are used in the powertrain of electric vehicles. Such a push would have the double benefit of providing a fillip to the EV sector and boosting sales in the larger auto sector, which were at their lowest in decades. Annual EV sales in India dropped by 20% in 2020-21 over the previous fiscal, while in the same period, auto sales declined by around 13%. EV manufacturers said incentives like the PLI can help the industry grow and indigenize the import-dependent supply chain but conceded the technology for battery manufacturing was on the expensive side. “The PLI, and FAME subsidies that apply to vehicles which have a mostly local supply chain, will force companies to indigenize their supply chain. However, setting up a cell manufacturing facility is something that start-ups don’t have the financial wherewithal for. That will have to be done by the few players who have access to serious and ready funding,” said Ravneet Phokela, chief business officer of Ather, which manufactures electric two-wheelers with backing from Hero. Some public transportation utilities in India — Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) — are slowly shifting their fleets to electric vehicles. PMPML’s electric bus inventory is currently a fraction of its fleet. Activists insisted that, a push towards EVs notwithstanding, the answer to increasing the demand for public transport lies in improving reliability and frequency. “Most people have little choice but to use buses post-pandemic, as other options are becoming expensive. The solution lies in having over 3,500 buses and disincentives for using personal vehicles. Concentrate on public transport buses — numbers and quality — improve their efficiency and reliability, and you will see improvement in air quality. There are no short cuts to doing this,” Sujit Patwardhan, founder of the citizens’ group Parisar, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-air-quality-alarms-ring-electric-vehicles-see-a-window-of-opportunity/articleshow/83470306.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The number of new cases on Saturday 8 am was 90. In the first wave, corporation areas accounted for over 85% of cases while the rural areas saw minimal numbers. During the second wave, the spread of the disease was more rapid though the city reported lesser number of cases than the rural areas.With the disease peaking when the new government took charge, commercial taxes minister P Moorthy and finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan decided to approach the control measures strategically. Corporation commissioner S Visakan and monitoring officer Dr B Chandramohan decided to decentralise markets and increase fever camps.Visakan said they had reported zero Covid 19 cases on March 10 before cases started rising in all the 100 wards in the second week of March and went up gradually. The peak was on May 20 when 1,038 cases were reported. Subsequently, fever camps were increased to 170 daily. As many as 5,500 to 6,000 cases were screened through the camps while the sample size was maintained the same till June 12.As many as 15,601 fever camps have been conducted in the 100 wards from March 1 to June 11 and 3,52,083 people screened. The fever camps helped in early detection and isolation of the new cases. But the civic body continues to keep the same sample size. Many people have also reached out to the corporation’s control room on 8428425000 regularly for Covid-related help and information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/8-weeks-on-madurai-city-cases-dip-below-100/articleshow/83470283.cms||---

Deaths, medical emergency, volunteering and caregivers during the Covid-19 pandemic and passing through Tamil Nadu are the options available at present in the portal.While e-registration is available for permitted industries during the lockdown, the portal makes it clear that only one designated officer from the industry can apply and individual employees are not allowed to apply directly. A Shankar, executive director of Empower India said that this makes it difficult for those who had gone to their hometowns to get back to work now.In the absence of public transportation, return to work option should be included on the e-registration form, he said. He also appealed to the government to include wedding as an option in the portal. “Many weddings will be held on auspicious days – June 13, 14, 16, 21, 23, 27 and 28. Those families are facing hardships in organising the weddings,” Shankar said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-add-return-to-work-wedding-on-e-regn-portal/articleshow/83470293.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Two KV students to speak at int’l math conference||KOCHI: Even as they continue their online schooling, Nanditha (15) and Niveditha (11), students of Kendriya Vidyalaya Rubber Board Kottayam, will participate as subject experts at the seventh international Vedic mathematics online conference on Sunday.  The sisters, who are trainers in Vedic mathematics, have spent the last one year teaching more than 300 students online. They were invited following this achievement of training children and adults under a ‘Maths Made Easy’ programme.  The two-day conference that began on Saturday is being organized by the Institute of Advancement in Vedic Mathematics (IAVM) London. During the conference, the duo will speak about their experience in the successful peer teaching model that they evolved in 2020 and is continuing this year too, as a lockdown success story. “They have also given a slot to take a teaching session for student attendees in the international workshop, organized in connection with the conference,” said P Devaraj, father of the children and a vedic mathematics trainer. “Since it was a lockdown which extended to the vacation period, my daughters said that they would also teach online for their own age-groups initially. We started it as a free programme and suddenly numbers surged. We could not handle the numbers. So, we decided that only those who were serious be taught,” he said. The family decided to put a fee of Rs 100 and suggested that this be given as donation to the PM Relief fund or CMDRF.  “They had to submit the scanned copy of the receipt to join.” For the sisters, they looked at this to utilize the available time creatively and to meet their friends through this learning platform. Much to their surprise, around 300 students participated in the two levels of the programme.  The two levels included a junior group of the students from Class III to V and its senior group from Class VI to Class X. Hearing of their achievement, Anita Karwal, the then chairperson of CBSE, tweeted her appreciation of this initiative as the unique model of survival by the students in the Covid pandemic. The CBSE shared this inspiring story on their social media pages also. They continued this Maths Made Easy Season-2 during this vacation with an overwhelming response with 1,000 students from all over India.  After the Vedic mathematics session, they also conducted a five-day foundation programme on maths fundamentals in the same way. The students are excited with the loving presentations and interactive modes throughout sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/two-kv-students-to-speak-at-intl-math-conference/articleshow/83469252.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

On Saturday, the Thanjavur district administration honoured the man’s philanthropy with a financial assistance of Rs 50,000, which he reluctantly accepted.A former teacher, Ravichandran had reared the calves so that he could sell them and pay fees for his younger son’s college education. Then came the call from chief minister M K Stalin asking people to donate to his public relief fund for fighting Covid-19. Ravichandran decided to pitch in and handed over the money to the collector on June 9.A BSc, BEd graduate, Ravichandran is married to Maheswari, 42, and has two sons, R Prasanth, 20, a college student, and R Sanjay, 17, a Class XII passout. He was employed as a teacher at a private school when all of a sudden, he lost his vision partially and had to leave his profession. Since then, he and his wife have been managing the household with the paltry wages from Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme (MGNREGS) and the government’s financial assistance for disabled people. In between, he got his elder son enrolled in college with his hard-earned money.Thanjavur collector M Govinda Rao paid a surprise visit to the man’s house at Aazhivaaikkal and handed over the cheque for Rs50,000. “We appreciated his generous behaviour and helped him with financial assistance,” Govinda Rao told TOI. He asked the man to use the fund for his son’s education and uplift his livelihood. “Ever since Covid-19 hit the people and caused so much sufferings, I have been worried. At one point of time, I decided to spend my savings for the purpose. I told my son we will manage the money for his education somehow,” Ravichandran told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/partially-blind-man-donates-savings-to-cms-relief-fund/articleshow/83469270.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Residents of ward 31 in Madurai Corporation have decided to take their plight to the notice of the chief secretary soon.S S A Basha, a resident of Thasildar Nagar, said they have been battling the issue for the last ten years but was never given a hearing. “We were better when our area was under Melamadai panchayat as till date we do not enjoy any of the benefits of being under the corporation,” he said.In places like Vivekanandar fourth street in Yagappa Nagar, the houses are two feet lower than the road level. “One of our greatest fears is rain as if it rains hard the water will enter the houses,” said S Kumar, a resident. A house that was one foot above road level when constructed two decades ago is today two feet below it and steps have been constructed to climb down from the road.The situation is same in Sundaravinayagar street and in many parts of Tahsildar Nagar like Nellai Street. “We made representations to the corporation when the road was laid, but the contractors told us we will have to construct a small half-foot bund like structure near our gates to prevent water from entering our houses,” said K Jannarthanan a resident of Tahsildar Nagar.In Malligai street, people say that they are unable to even sell their houses and move to other places as people do not want to buy houses that are below the road level.Corporation sources said that the entire area was under the proposal for an underground drainage and that they would try to rectify the problem when the UGD work is complete and the road is relaid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/residents-to-take-up-laying-of-roads-sans-milling-with-cs/articleshow/83470312.cms||---

A video of their verbal duel was also widely shared on social media. The altercation started with sitting councillor Rupa Pandya asking former councillor of the same ward Manjula Dudhat to not approach her for any work. In response to Pandya’s comment, Dudhat asked her to leave from there and she is aware what kind of businesses Pandya does. On hearing this statement, Pandya became furious and even threatened to hit Dudhat. While Pandya was being pulled away by BJP workers to contain the situation, she accused Dudhat of taking money from people. The former councillor too responded by saying that people know who takes money before Pandya was taken away from the scene. The two women argued in public view at the tree plantation event organized near Varsha Society near Lambe Hanuman Road by BJP workers. However, BJP functionaries remained tight-lipped over what sparked the arguments, but as the video made rounds on WhatsApp it was highly talked about. The two women too remained unavailable for their comments. While Dudhat’s phone was switched off, Pandya did not respond to TOI’s phone calls and messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/public-spat-between-sitting-ex-bjp-councillors-creates-flutter/articleshow/83467674.cms||---

The seventh phase of excavation is under way in Keeladi since February 13 and the work that was temporarily suspended since May 10, was resumed three days ago. Archaeology minister Thangam Thennarasu visited the site on Saturday when deputy director of the state archaeology department, R Sivanantham, showed him a potsherd discovered two days ago.Many potsherds with graffiti similar to Indus Valley script, which is seen as a means of expression and communication since the iron age, have also been found in plenty at this excavation site.According to the fourth phase excavation report of the state archaeology department, 56 potsherds with Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions mostly with people’s names have been found in Keeladi. There is also evidence that both the potters and the owners of the pots engraved their names on them. It has also been revealed that the Keeladi civilization dates back to 6th century BCE.When asked about Tamil being sidelined in government websites such as CoWin, Thangam Thennarasu said Keeladi has produced all evidence to show that the Tamil population was one that was literate even before 2,600 years. “This government will ensure that Tamil gets its due recognition, as it was the late chief minister Kalaignar who declared it a classical language,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/more-evidence-points-to-keeladi-civilizations-literacy/articleshow/83470311.cms||---

In 24 hours, Kotecha had received close to Rs 10 lakh. “It was very overwhelming for me as I felt that my people believed in doing good for the society at large,” Kotecha told TOI. He added, “I had not even made a single call to anyone, just sent out a message through a video I circulate daily in my constituency where I inform people about the Covid situation in the area. My plan is to enter the slums of Mulund like Indira Nagar, Hanuman Nagar, Vijay Nagar and get people vaccinated. While I know authorities are undertaking vaccinations, I felt an initiative such as this would help in speedily vaccinating those in slums.” Kotecha said he is in talks with a private hospital to ensure vaccines are made available for the slumdwellers. He said he wishes to ensure that T Ward of Mulund has the maximum number of people vaccinated with the first diose by next month. He said he had also received contributions from those as young as 19 years of age. Kotecha addded that the reason they plan to go into the slums and vaccinate is that the slumdwellers do not feel hesitant when they see other people living in their area who have taken the vaccine in front of them and are yet doing well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vaccines-for-slums-mlas-voters-give-rs-10l-in-a-day-in-mumbai/articleshow/83470368.cms||Richa Pinto

He has been accused of molesting an office staffer and when sacked, threatened to leak important school data on social media by demanding Rs 20 lakh. Police officials said that they have booked Nilesh Chavate in two separate cases of extortion and outraging the modesty of a woman. “Chavate has been remanded to police custody and we will also be arresting him on charges of outraging the modesty of a woman,” said an official. The officials of the international school lodged a complaint stating that the management sacked Chavate in May after a woman from the school lodged a complaint that he inappropriately touched her. The school committee against sexual harassment at workplace indicted him following which he was asked to leave. In the first week of June, he called a senior official of the school and threatened to leak the school’s important information on social media. He sent threatening messages to the CFO of the school and demanded money. “He said that due to his suspension from the school, his career had been ruined as he had 10 more years for retirement and hence demanded a compensation of Rs 20 lakh.

Add to this the lack of proper crowd control mechanism, hordes of people thronged the primary health centres, both in urban and rural parts of TrichyAs vaccination camps for those aged 18-44 resumed at the four zonal offices of the corporation after a brief gap, crowding was reported in the vaccination centres. Though vaccination was to commence by 10 am, people were at the camps since early morning. There were neither proper arrangements to control the crowd from entering the campus nor clarity on the age groups which will be vaccinated. With people coming to the same UPHCs for giving samples for the RT-PCR test, the vaccination centres also posed the risk of spreading the disease. “I took my mother to both Srirangam and Thiruvanaikoil UPHC. The staff there told me that only 50 tokens were allotted and all had been issued. We reached the centres by 8 am but there were people already standing since 7 am,” G Viswanathan, a resident of Srirangam said. Earlier, while those in 45+ age group were hesitant to vaccinate, UPHCs were not crowded much. But now, those in the senior age group are keen on getting the jab.The UPHC at Gandhipuram and Kuzhumani saw big crowd as even 18-44 age group people arrived there instead of 45+ only to be sent back. “People are starting to come early instead of the scheduled time mentioned, we could not control them but we issued tokens. Further, a set of people approach the vaccination centres during the scheduled time, causing a crowd. We will streamline our camps,” an official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/confusion-causes-crowding-in-trichy/articleshow/83469271.cms||Deepak Karthik

As on Friday, TPR of Manickal panchayat was 6.85% — a figure which was considered improbable in the last week of May. Manickal was declared as one among the critical containment zones in the district by the end of May. TPR of the panchayat stood at an alarming 35% on May 27, however owing to the combined efforts of local residents, panchayat authorities and the health team, it dropped to below 10% and since June 5, TPR remained at 8% and now it is nearing the 5% mark which is considered the ideal TPR. In the days following high prevalence of infection in the panchayat, the health team and the local body set out to ramp up testing. “We were initially facing difficulties in procuring test kits. We took it up with the district health team and once kits were arranged, we conducted massive public testing campaigns. It wasn’t merely restricted to symptomatic or primary contacts. Schools and junctions based testing camps recorded 200 tests on a daily basis and we could pick up and isolate many cases which would otherwise have gone unnoticed,” says Manickal panchayat secretary Jyothis V. The medical team had promptly reported about a general unwillingness to get tested. “At clinic, we would get around 10-15 positives a day, but to curb the spread this wasn’t enough. We took the testing to the public and people felt encouraged to volunteer for testing. This resulted in early detection and isolation,” says medical officer at Manickal FHC Dr Heera T S. The panchayat also constituted rapid response teams which kept full vigil over the families where infection was reported. “We had understood that if we could limit infection to families and in the meantime pick up our testing rate, we could significantly reduce the spread of disease. The teams also worked well in identifying people who faced practical issues in isolation and they were shifted to care centres promptly,” adds Jyothis. “Voluntary ward-level activities were monitored at the panchayat war room. Each primary contact and family members were followed up on a regular basis and now the decreased TPR is there to see,” said a panchayat representative. Manikkal panchayat has been able to bring down the TRP to 6.85% at a time when nearly 90% of local bodies report above 15% TPR. Kuttichal is another local body in the district with TPR below 10%. Between June 2 and 8, 759 samples were tested in the panchayat out of which 35 tested positive. Two mobile ambulance units have also been deployed for transportation and quick hospitalization of patients to care centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/from-35-manickal-tames-tpr-to-6/articleshow/83469276.cms||Aswin J Kumar

It was around half of the total biomedical waste generated in Bhopal from hospitals in normal times. Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) conducted a day to day monitoring of the biomedical waste generated from corona patients in hospitals and ensured its disposal, as per the directives of the central pollution control board issued in July 2020. As per the guidelines, corona waste needs to be packed in a double layer yellow bag by the hospitals and sent for disposal. Those disposing or treating the waste must be in PPE kits. Pollution control board officials informed there are five facilities in satellite towns and cities adjoining Bhopal that collect, incinerate and treat the bio medical waste. Hospitals in Bhopal have tied up with one or the other facility for collection and disposal of its bio-medical waste. Anything that was in contact with the Covid patients including saline bottles, PPE kit, hand gloves, face masks, napkins, face shields or head cover comes under bio-medical waste. Officials said they did not find any hospital throwing the Covid bio- medical waste in the open. MPPCB teams regularly keep track of hospitals and teams were sent on receipt of complaints in Karond and other city areas, but nothing objectionable was found, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-generated-500mt-covid-biomed-waste-since-march-2020/articleshow/83469277.cms||Ankur Sirothia
---||Pune||Ray’s actors reminisce his work and meticulousness for creating best with worst||Pune: The latest in the memorial discussion panels of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) and the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) brought together three veteran actors, filmmakers, and critics to reminisce the life and work of auteur Satyajit Ray, with notes from their time working with him and his crew. Two of the actors, Sharmila Tagore and Aparna Sen, on the online panel on Saturday evening made their screen debuts in Ray’s films Apur Sansar and Teen Kanya, respectively. Both spoke in glowing terms about what Ray meant for their careers and being cast in his films when they were both teenagers. “He told me once that he preferred to work with newcomers, and that he has worked with both good and bad newcomers, as well as good and bad professional actors. Casting was very important for him, and the look of someone mattered more to Ray than acting. In a scene in Apur Sansar, where I entered a small apartment, he told me what to do while the camera rolled, such as looking left and right, and heaving a sigh. His instructions and direction completely made the scene, and it was okayed in the first take,” Tagore reminisced. Sen was cast in her first role based on a character from a short story by Rabindranath Tagore after a discussion between Ray and her father film critic and historian Chidananda Dasgupta,who was a long-time friend of Ray. “I was reading the short story Shamapti, which had the character I would eventually play, and I identified with it instantly. Shortly after that, a phone call came from Ray, and he spoke to my father about that very role and the possibility of me playing the character on screen. Earlier on, he gave instructions about what to do in front of the camera, like frowning more or less. If you could imitate just half of what Ray said, you would do well,” Sen remarked. Another veteran actor and former FTII director Mohan Agashe worked with Ray in the Hindi telefilm Sadgati, based on a Munshi Premchand story on cast discrimination, featuring a star cast of him, as well as Om Puri and Smita Patil. He told the panel about Ray’s “meticulousness”, yet his flexibility, all while working on a limited budget. “Manik (Ray’s nickname) da was meticulous in his work, as if he were making his first film. He gave scripts to every actor also wrote instructions for each of them to follow. Despite good planning, he had flexibility. The climax was supposed to be shot in the hot sun, but seeing cloudy weather, he decided to shoot the climax in the pouring rain, which created a different kind of impact. We dubbed the film at Indrapuri Studio (in Kolkata), and looking at the equipment there, people would suspect if he actually got any film done with those. But he managed to do the best with the worst. What I learnt in those 14 days of shooting with Manikda, I haven’t learnt in years,” Agashe remarked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rays-actors-reminisce-his-work-and-meticulousness-for-creating-best-with-worst/articleshow/83470315.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Lucknow||Fighting for survival, former national, int’l players look up to govt for help||Lucknow: There was a time when Halim Khan, a national level hockey player, used to dodge opponents with his agility to help his team win matches. But an injury on his right leg changed his life forever. In due course of time, his condition worsened and he developed sepsis due to which his toe had to be amputated in February this year. Adding to his woes, all sources of his income got blocked due to the coronavirus pandemic leaving the family of six under tremendous financial pressure. Khan has written to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and director, sports, RP Singh to appeal for financial assistance for his treatment. “In fact, RP Singh (sports director) and I were together in Lucknow Sports College from 1981 to 1984. Under his captaincy, our team won many medals. I played with him in the All India Sardar Mohan Singh tournament (1981) and Junior Nehru Hockey (1983) in Delhi,” claimed Khan. “My team won the rural sports championship in Meerut in 1985. I also played in the senior national hockey tournament in Hyderabad in 2005,” he said. “I trained budding players for 12 years at Pant Sports Stadium and worked as a coach at Kendriya Vidyalaya for three years. I have groomed several national players,” said Khan, who is also the treasurer of Sultanpur district hockey association. Speaking about his ill health, Khan said he had a leg injury many years ago and underwent treatment but developed complications in 2019. “My toe (four fingers) had to be amputated due to infection. Doctors say I need another operation but I don’t have enough money,” he said. “I used to run a sports goods shop but had to close it down due to losses during lockdown. My wife used to work as a teacher in a private school but she also lost her job during the pandemic,” Khan added. Director, sports, RP Singh told TOI: “I will look into the matter and ensure that all possible help is extended to Halim Khan.” Like Khan, a number of players who brought laurels to the state in the past are left with no option but to take up menial jobs. Vivek Kumar Mishra of Mirzapur won medals in various national championships from 2014 to 2018. After losing his job as an ad hoc coach in early 2020, he is working as a daily wager to support his family. “I have done BPEd and I am a qualified coach but my father and I have to work as labourers. We earn too little to support the family. I have domesticated a buffalo and sell one litre of milk daily to earn some more,” Vivek said. “I have taken a loan for my sister’s education and am unable to pay it. I wrote to the Chief Minister twice, in September 2020 and April 2021, seeking financial help but to no avail,” he said. Shatrughan Lal of Lucknow, an international level powerlifter, is currently jobless and struggling for survival with his family of four. Lal resides in a 12x10ft rented room in Aishbagh and is currently dependent on help from friends and relatives. “I won the title of Strong Man of India in 1993, 1995 and 1996 and won silver and bronze medals in international events like Junior World Powerlifting championships (New Delhi and Indonesia) and Senior Asian championships (Taiwan in 1993 and Kazakhstan in 1996),” he said. “I worked as an ad hoc coach but lost my job. I started a ‘vada paav’ stall in June 2020 but had to shut shop within two months due to lockdown. Since then, I have been struggling for a living,” the powerlifter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fighting-for-survival-former-national-intl-players-look-up-to-govt-for-help/articleshow/83471364.cms||Fazal Khan

---||Kochi||Muttil case: ADGP Sreejith to head investigation team||Thiruvananthapuram: Crime Branch ADGP S Sreejith would lead the investigation into the Muttil tree felling case. A government order in this regard was issued here on Saturday. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had on Friday said that a high level probe would be ordered into the controversy plaguing the LDF government. The government order calls for a detailed investigation into the tree felling case and points at a possible conspiracy behind the incident. Crime bank, vigilance and forest department officials would form part of the investigation team and S Sreejith would be coordinating the same. Sreejith is expected to visit Muttil any time soon. Former revenue minister E Chandrasekharan had on Friday said that an order issued by the revenue department, with the noble intention of helping out farmers, was misinterpreted by some people. The order was used for massive felling of trees and the government did rescind the order when the misuse was detected, he had claimed. Meanwhile, Congress leader P T Thomas has termed the high level probe announced by the government an eye wash. Thomas alleged that the smuggling took place with the concurrence of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The first order insisted joint inspection by the forest and revenue officials and warned of strict action against those who posed hindrances to the felling of trees. It was aimed at the 150 to 200 years old trees of Adivasis,” he said. Meanwhile, forest minister A K Saseendran told reporters here on Saturday that he was not ready to form an opinion that things are in bad shape in forest department. He said not a single tree was smuggled from forest land and promised strict action against erring officials. Saseendran said the forest and revenue departments had held discussions over the ramifications of the controversial order that was used as a cover for the massive tree felling. The issue was, however, not discussed in the LDF, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/muttil-case-adgp-sreejith-to-head-investigation-team/articleshow/83467724.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Palaharavandi brings a smile on the faces of pandemic-hit children||Thiruvananthapuram: With an aim to bring a smile to children’s faces, the DYFI Mangalapuram block committee has come up with ‘Palaharavandi’, an initiative of distributing snack boxes to kids. The initiative was launched by Youth Commission chairperson Chintha Jerome at Perunguzhi on Tuesday. The initial plan is to distribute snack boxes to children of those in quarantine. In three days, snack boxes were distributed to nearly 450 houses.With a lockdown in force, children are mostly confined to their homes. They have already completed an academic year without going to school or seeing their friends. The idea of ‘Palaharavandi’ was put forward to make the children happy. “Most of the children are fond of snacks and chocolates. It is not possible for Covid-positive patients to get out of their homes and get the food items their children love. At the same time, children are not aware of the intensity of the pandemic, and by staying inside their homes all the time, the chance of developing mental stress is high. So, we thought it would be great if we could provide something which they love,” said S Vidheesh, secretary, DYFI Mangalapuram block committee.The snack box contains items like banana and jack fruit chips, laddu, jalebi, chocolates, biscuits and cakes and most of them are homemade. The initiative is also expected to bring some relief to some small-scale food units. “There are some units in our area that used to distribute food items to bakeries. With the lockdown, they are finding it difficult to make the ends meet. Such production units are also a part of this initiative. They provide tasty homemade snacks including chips and cakes and we pay them too,” said Vidheesh.Meanwhile, the ‘Palaharavandi’ initiative has received immense support from the public. Twelve vehicles have already been voluntarily by local residents to transport the boxes. They have also come forward to sponsor the snacks.“During the pandemic time, I feel extremely happy that each day the youth are coming up with different ideas. This initiative was launched to make the children happy. The kids too will be having the frustration of not seeing their friends. In the present scenario, they will be definitely glad and excited to receive gifts that they love. This initiative is exemplary in all ways,” said Chintha Jerome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/palaharavandi-brings-a-smile-on-the-faces-of-pandemic-hit-children/articleshow/83469279.cms||---

---||Kochi||Stricter vigil on rule violations||Idukki: With reports of rampant tree felling in different parts of the state coming to light, the forest department has warned officials to be vigilant to avoid such incidents in future. A circular issued by chief forests conservator (wildlife) and field director Anoop K R, points out that as per the title deed guidelines (based on Kerala Land Assignment rules, 1964) sandalwood, rosewood, ebony and teak trees in the assigned lands are owned by the state government but several trees were felled after the revenue department issued its controversial order. Besides admitting that large-scale tree-felling may have occurred, the circular urges officials to be vigilant while verifying the tree-cutting passes issued by range officers as per the recommendation from the revenue department. The circular further instructs the officials to immediately conduct spot inspections, recover the cut logs and shift them to depots to prepare a stock list. The officials have also been asked to prepare a mahasar (a report prepared at the time of seizure) and initiate legal actions. In addition, it also directs them to submit a letter to the district collectors to take action against title deed owners for violating the Kerala land conservancy Act and Kerala land assignment Act. Reacting to the circular, environmentalist M N Jayachandran said: “It was preplanned. The revenue department’s order was aimed at large-scale tree-felling. After achieving the objective, they have cancelled the order. Based on the order, the timber mafia threatened forest officials to issue passes for cutting the trees.” “We had rejected several applications for tree fellin. But after the revenue department issued its controversial order, the officials were helpless and issued the passes,” said a senior forest official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/stricter-vigil-on-rule-violations/articleshow/83467747.cms||Sandeep Thomas

In such cases, the virus colonizes in the intestines instead of the lungs and patients continue to have problems in the form of ulcers, pancreatitis and even gangrene post recovery. “Around 30% of the patients are presenting with GI intestinal symptoms including discomfort, gas formation, bloating, some present with diarrhoea and abdominal pain and do not have any respiratory symptoms. In many of them, even stool examining is showing positive for Covid-19. It shows that the virus is colonizing in the intestines,” said Dr C Madhusudan, head of department of gastroenterology and transplant surgeon, Osmania General Hospital. Experts advise that being extra vigilant about GI issues now. Gastrointestinal symptoms in Covid patients is however something seen persistently since the first wave. “The reason we are seeing many more patients present with GI symptoms is due to the overall number of patients having increased during the second wave. Since the second wave has been much more infectious, with increase in overall cases of Covid-19, patients with GI have also been many more now. In at least 1% of these patients, we see pancreatitis,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital. While pancreatitis is self limiting and usually improves after a few weeks, ulcers can be treated in a few weeks as well. However, gangrene which occurs due to clot formation in the blood vessels of the intestines, is a life threatening condition and any symptom during or after Covid-19 should not be ignored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-increasingly-affecting-gastrointestinal-systems/articleshow/83470348.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Must probe Sachin Waze posting to inquire into police transfers: CBI||MUMBAI: The CBI said probe into transfers and postings of police officers is “directly related to” allegations levelled by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh and an advocate whose complaint based on Singh’s letter formed the basis for its preliminary enquiry (PE) and the investigation “cannot be completed in a fair manner without probing posting of Waze and other police officers and the report of Rashmi Shukla then commissioner (State Intelligence Department).” The CBI said this in its affidavit filed on the weekend in reply before Bombay high court in response to Anil Deshmukh’s quashing petition against its April 21 FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act. The agency sought dismissal of Deshmukh’s petition, calling it an “abuse of process of law”. Deshmukh said CBI failed to seek prior sanction as was necessary under the law since he was a public servant at the time of the alleged offence. “No sanction is necessary in this case,” said the CBI, “particularly in cases of illegal gratification or amassing wealth by illegal means as the same can never be considered to be in discharge of official duties.” Besides, said the CBI, the case against Deshmukh “is one of entrustment of investigation by the HC and therefore no prior sanction is necessary”. The CBI said that the “allegation here is that Anil Deshmukh tried to obtain illegal gratification and that the investigation is at a very preliminary though crucial stage.”  The CBI said, “It is also alleged along with other allegations that …Deshnukh had set a target of extortion for Sachin Waze, the then API, CIU, Mumbai Police to collect extortion money from bars/restaurants/other establishments in Mumbai and this act …constitutes an offence of attempt to obtain undue advantage under section 7 of PC Act, 1988...” There is "disclosure of a cognizable offence from the letters (of former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh to the chief minister, alleging ‘corrupt malpractice’) themselves even prior to the PE said the CBI. The HC is to hear the matter on Monday along with a petition filed by the state for quashing two paras from the CBI FIR against Deshmukh. The CBI said the ingredients for an offence of “illegal gratification “ under the Prevention of Corruption Act is prima facie made out also “further submitted that offence of section 120B IPC is made out as accused ...Anil Deshmukh had attempted to obtain undue advantage and extorted money in conspiracy with other persons whose suspected roles will be ascertained during the investigation and so FIR has been registered against” him and unknown others. The agency added that Deshmukh’s ground of "malafide” is "vague’’ and sans any details. Deshmukh’s quashing petition said it is a “biased, dubious’’, inquiry, "with ulterior motive at the behest of those having political or other vendetta’’ against him and to have him arrested. He said no case of allegations of ‘illegal gratification’’ under section 7 of PCA is made out. The CBI affidavit says that allegations against Deshmukh is “related to illegal gains, corruption, extortion, criminal conspiracy etc and it cannot be denied that the exercise of undue influence over transfer/posting of police officers by political executives may result in exercising undue influence over the performance of official duty by police officers. ‘’ Following the PE once a “cognizable offence emerges which are intrinsically connected with each other, the investigation must be made qua such offences without being inhibited by the initial PE.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cbi-must-probe-waze-posting-to-inquire-into-police-transfers-in-mumbai/articleshow/83472445.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Lucknow||Remembered rights suddenly, questions Allahabad HC, grants bail to conversion accused||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Friday granted bail to a person accused of abduction, rape and forceful conversion, while doubting the ‘conduct’ of the victim, a married woman, who has alleged that the bail applicant used to physically exploit her and was compelling her to change her religion. “The bail applicant and the victim were in a relationship for the last four years when there was no UP’s anti-conversion law. All of a sudden, after the coming of this Ordinance into existence, she got aware about her rights. Her mental thinking exposed her conduct,” the court observed while pronouncing its judgment on June 11. However, while passing the above order, the court made it clear that observations made while granting bail to the applicant should not in any way affect the trial judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses. Granting bail to one Munna Khan of Mahoba district of UP, who is accused of abduction, rape and under Section 3, 5(1) of UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance-2020, Justice Rahul Chaturvedi observed, “She (victim) was a wilful and active participant in all actions faced by her during last four years. Cumulative effect of all above factors clearly indicate that the victim was interested to remain in the company of the applicant, and even after her marriage she wanted to maintain the relationship with him.” The applicant’s counsel said that the present FIR was lodged by the woman against the applicant and his sister on March 4, 2021, under sections of IPC and UP’s anti-conversion Ordinance at Kotwali police station of Mahoba district, alleging that she and accused Munna Khan reside in the same mohalla, Bajariya, of district Mahoba. “It is further alleged in the FIR that the applicant had taken certain obscene photographs and videos of the victim and used them as a tool of blackmailing her to maintain physical relationship. This relationship continued for the past four years without any objection, resistance or complaint to anyone,” the counsel said. “Thereafter, on December 8, 2020, the victim got married and went to Delhi. It is stated by the victim in her statements recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of CrPC that she came back from Delhi to Mahoba on February 18, 2021. Thereafter, from February 18, 2021 to March 2, 2021 she remained in the company of the applicant at Orai along with her sister, where the applicant used to ravish her and started compelling her to change her religion,” the applicant’s counsel further said. While directing the applicant to be released on bail, the court further observed, “From the ossification test it is clear that the victim is aged about 19 years. She has not received any formal education. She resides in the same locality where the applicant resides. In such circumstances, it is unswallowable proposition that in a small city like Mahoba, she was not aware about the background of the applicant or about his religion for four good years. Besides this, there is no recovery of any obscene still photograph or video, which is said to have been used for blackmailing, by the police during the course of investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/remembered-rights-suddenly-questions-hc-grants-bail-to-conversion-accused/articleshow/83471414.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Kolkata||Filmmaker Buddhadeb Dasgupta’s daughters pay tribute to dad by feeding strays in Kolkata||KOLKATA: In a unique way of paying tribute to their father, filmmaker Buddhadeb Dasgupta’s daughters decided to feed stray dogs and cats in the city. A day after he passed away, daughter Alokananda Dasgupta got in touch with a shelter home for animals and organized to sponsor the feeding of 1,000 strays. Alokananda said, “My father believed it is important to take care of animals and the needy. I believe that feeding strays, which are more helpless during the pandemic, will really make him happy wherever he is.” The filmmaker himself was very attached to animals. “He loved our dog, Jinu. She was a German Shepherd. Baba used to take care of her like his baby. I was also obsessed with her. She was very protective of me. Baba would never scold me. Once in a while, just to tease Jinu, Baba would team up with my mother and my sister and pretend to scold me. That would just be to see how protective Jinu was towards me,” she said. Memories of such moments crowd her mind now that he is no more. On Thursday, Alokananda spoke to her sister, Rajeshwari, and decided to take this opportunity to feed strays across the city. She got in touch with Titas Mukherjee, who along with Somak Chatterjee, runs a shelter home-cum-hospital called Animal Rescue & Care Kolkata. “This is the first time we came across a bereaved family that paid homage to the departed by feeding strays. For this purpose, we fed strays in Joka, Burma colony, Thakurpukur, Diamond Park besides those at our shelter home in Thakurpukur and Burdwan on Friday,” Mukherjee said. The next such drive will be held on Monday. “Both our parents had a huge heart. It is very difficult to accept their absence. Baba would always support me when I wanted to feed strays. We had so many discussions on how important it is to speak against cruelty towards animals, the meat industry and the need to adopt strays. That’s why I am finding some peace by doing this,” Alokananda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/buddhadebs-daughters-pay-tribute-to-dad-by-feeding-strays/articleshow/83469289.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

BJP representatives in the forum raised an objection to the decision. SLF is also planning to observe a ‘Black Day’ on Monday to protest administrator Praful Khoda Patel’s visit to the islands by wearing black masks and putting up black flags, SLF said in a statement. SLF has, however, refrained from ousting BJP from the group though several forum members have sought for the party’s removal from the forum after it filed a complaint against Sultana. The forum’s core-committee decided that it wouldn’t be ideal to remove the party from the forum as the central objectives of the forum and the party were compatible.  SLF said the forum’s agenda is clear and that includes rolling back the draft regulations, withdrawal of all anti-people orders of the administration and the calling back of the administrator. BJP representatives raised an objection to the demand that the administrator be called back. The forum urged the islanders to be watchful of certain groups which are trying to give a religious angle to the issue. The core-committee also directed every Dweep-level committee to collect evidence for the formal objections submitted by the islanders against the draft regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/forum-offers-legal-help-to-activist/articleshow/83467800.cms||---

A city-based activist, Rohitt Malhotra, who witnessed this illegal act while passing by the area, has lodged a complaint with the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC). “The peepal tree was cut down by some workers using a motorized electric saw machine. I noticed that the wires of the saw machine were leading inside the Vashi Infotech Park building, from where the power supply was drawn to hack the tree. One of the workers told me that they cut the tree on the directions of the ‘society people’ of the Vashi Infotech Park,” he said. NMMC deputy municipal commissioner (trees/gardens) Manoj Mahale said, “I have asked the tree official of Vashi civic ward to inspect the site and lodge an FIR. We are also checking for CCTV footage of the tree cutting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/40-year-old-tree-hacked-illegally-outside-vashi-infotech-park-bldg-in-mumbai/articleshow/83472496.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Chennai||The infinite marketplace||Chennai: On March 11, Vignesh Sundaresan aka Metakovan drew a tense last hour deluged by more than 180 bids to a close at a Christie’s auction, and bagged himself a deal that would go down in digital art history. The Chennai-origin blockchain entrepreneur from Singapore gave the celebrated auction house its most record-setting sale in recent times, after buying a non-fungible token (NFT) of ‘Everydays’, a 13-years-in-the-making collage by digital artist Beeple, for $69.3 million (the value of 42,329.5 Ether cryptocurrency as of then). On May 11, Sundaresan made another notable deal. He bought Chennai musician Kaber Vasuki’s NFT — an early demo recording of his song ‘Vasanam’ — for 50 Ether (ETH, the cryptocurrency generated by the Etherium blockchain), equivalent to Rs 1.5 crore as of then. NFT is an immutable certificate of ownership on a decentralised ledger, which is typically linked to a digital asset like art, music or even a Tweet — as American billionaire and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey demonstrated earlier this year. In March, Dorsey offered a glimpse into the eccentric novelty of goods striking gold in the NFT market when he sold his first ever Tweet — ‘Just setting up my twttr’, from 15 years ago, for more than $2.9 million in Ether, following a competitive bidding battle. He then donated it to a coronavirus charity in Africa. Likewise, in February, celebrating the 10th year of Nyan Cat, the sensational Japanese pop video from 2011, its creator Chris Torres sold a digital rendition of it for about 300ETH ($590,000) in an online auction. But what’s making creators flock to this $100 million market (as of July 2020), aren’t just these myriad possibilities of money making, but a path to bigger opportunities and possibly a fairer ecosystem. For example, despite the legal grey areas surrounding aspects like licensing Intellectual Property rights, NFTs can be clubbed with smart contracts — a computer programme that self-executes legally relevant actions according to the terms of an agreement. And this could become the future of royalties, believes Kaber. "You can programme royalties into NFT. I set a 10% royalty agreement to the song I sold, which is coded and cannot be changed by anyone. I will earn that royalty every time my song is resold," he says. In the pandemic, it has also opened the floodgates for lockdown art. In February, Chennai-based digital artist Siraj Hassan made close to Rs1,80,000 — the value of two Ethers that time — selling 28 of the 46 surrealistic artwork from his series ‘Caged’ that he created inside cookie jars to represent life during the pandemic. It also became a gateway to more commissioned work than he had ever received in his seven years in the field. "I promoted my NFT extensively on social media, which put it in the spotlight for collectors around the world, who then sent more work opportunities my way," says the 31-year-old. Cashing in on the crypto boom, June this year saw WazirX, India’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, launching an NFT marketplace exclusively for Indian artists and creators. And Delhi artist Ravi Koranga was among the early birds to get on. Koranga’s pandemic artwork sold for 200 WazirX coins (valued at $400 at that time), half of which he plans to donate to Gurugram’s Hemkunt Foundation for Covid relief. To sell their work or accept a bid, artists also have to pay a gas fee — a pricing value for the computing energy required to conduct a transaction on blockchain. As of June 11, WazirX’s overall NFT sales stood at $44,555 (Rs32.5 lakh). While as a decentralised platform this marketplace has made it easier to put out what you create, it’s still the work that makes the cut, warns Kaber. "You have to promote yourself, have a story to tell, and an identity people will buy into. It’s not very different from the real-world art market — just more transparent."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/the-infinite-marketplace/articleshow/83473656.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

The girl, a resident of Bulandshahr district who is temporarily staying at a hostel in Meerut, was taken to Noida by the accused on the pretext of a job offer, sedated and raped, police said. An FIR under sections of rape and criminal intimidation was registered at Lalkurti police station in Meerut against three people, including the sister and brother-in-law of the main accused. Though the crime occurred on June 1, the rape survivor could recently muster courage to narrate her ordeal after which a case was registered in Meerut. Police have begun investigation in the case. "The girl had accused her friend's brother of raping on the pretext of job. Her medical examination was conducted and we are yet to record her statement in front of a magistrate,” Vineet Bhatnagar, superintendent of police (city), said. No arrest has been made so far. “The investigation has begun. Corroborative evidence like the mobile location of the accused and survivor are being gathered. Action will be taken soon,” Suraj Rai, additional superintendent of police (cantonment), said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/friends-brother-sedates-rapes-ba-student-from-meerut-in-noida/articleshow/83465883.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a meeting held at the collectorate here on Friday, it was presented that work on Kudavoor, Madavoor, Vilappil, Vakkom and Vithura village offices has been 95% completed. The village offices at Ayiroor, Pettah, Ulloor and Nedumangad will be temporarily shifted to another place to facilitate the work on conversion to smart offices. Thirty village offices will be made smart village offices as part of Rebuild Kerala project. State Nirmithi Kendra is in charge of the project. Five village offices are in the first stage of construction. Remaining offices will be demolished and new ones will be built. Administrative sanction has been received for the upgradation of civil station, Kudapanakkunnu. PWD will be in charge of the work. Government-level works have begun on construction of Nedumangad revenue divisional office and Thiruvananthapuram taluk office. Nine village offices in the district had earlier received administrative sanction to be upgraded as smart village office. These offices include Maranallur, Thycaud, Navaikulam, Pallipuram, Kallikadu, Kadinamkulam, Cheruvakkal, Kadakkavur and Pattom. Kadinamkulam and Maranallur were earlier declared smart villages. Three village offices — Cheruvakkal, Kadakkavur and Pattom — were included in smart village plan in the district for 2017-18. SMART (speedy, modern, assured, responsible, transparent) village office aims at converting village offices into people-friendly centres where speedy delivery of service is implemented in modern ambience in an assured, transparent and responsible manner. The project envisages construction of buildings with modern facilities, including facilities for public and incorporating possibilities of e-governance. Any kind of service related to smart village office can be availed from any place at any time. Parasuvakkal, Karupur, Nemom and Nagarur are the four villages in the district which had received administrative sanction during 2018-19 to be converted into smart villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/smart-village-office-works-to-be-expedited/articleshow/83469308.cms||---

The CBI officials who have probed the case have found them guilty and have submitted the chargesheet. As per the order issued by the excise commissioner on Friday, those who are being reinstated include V A Ummer, M G Anoopkumar, V B Abdul Jabbar, Nithin M Madhavan, V M Smibin, M O Benny, K U Mahesh and V B Sreejith. They were earlier suspended following the death of Ranjitkumar of Tirur in Malappuram, after being taken into custody at Pavaratty on October 1, 2019. The case was initially being probed by the state police and later it was taken over by the CBI. The CBI had submitted a chargesheet arraigning seven excise officials as accused in February this year. The CBI chargesheet had not listed Sreejith, who is a driver, as an accused. According to excise department sources, the reason to reinstate the suspended officials were taken as the chargesheet has been submitted and only trial is left. Prolonging the suspension may lead to charges of double punishment after the submission of a chargesheet. The CBI had not objected to their reinstatement and the government had also concurred when the suspended officials submitted a request for revoking suspension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/officials-suspended-in-custodial-case-reinstated/articleshow/83467873.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Minor alteration in treatment of Covid+ alcoholics with liver disease||Panaji: There is a slight alteration in treatment protocol changes when alcoholics having liver disease are hospitalised for Covid-19, while medical intervention remains the same for alcoholics who do not have such a condition. Nodal officer at the South Goa district hospital (SGDH), Dr Rajesh Patil, explained that it boils down to discretion in the use of the anti-viral medication, Remdesivir. “This drug cannot be used on patients with abnormal liver function. Treating patients with already compromised livers and lungs can make it challenging,” he said. Besides this, the hospital has had to treat alcoholics going into withdrawal after admission, with symptoms similar to those experienced by Covid-19 patients suffering from pneumonia. “Fever, heightened pulse rate, sweating, breathlessness and delirium are common to patients experiencing hypoxia (inadequate oxygen supply) and alcoholics experiencing withdrawal. If the patient is diabetic, it further complicates the case,” he said. Medical treatment for alcoholism must be supplemented with Alcoholics Anonymous support groups, Patil, who is also a friend of AA, said. He pointed out that recovery from alcoholism is a lifelong process and suggested that recovering alcoholics should continue connecting with AA members by participating in meetings online during the pandemic when physical meetings are difficult. A recent case at SGDH was of an alcoholic patient going back to the bottle after discharge, only to return with seizures and other serious symptoms, he recalled. “Virtual meetings and personal sharing with one’s sponsor and mentor, who are senior AA members, are very important. These help a recovering alcoholic to share experiences, listen to others and identify with them. Whenever the urge to consume alcohol arises, one phone call to the mentor or AA member can prevent the alcoholic from taking his first drink,” he said. Patil also advised against staying isolated in the present situation. “I believe addiction thrives when one is isolated. A recovering alcoholic should always connect with family and co-workers either through phone or video calls to distance oneself from relapsing,” he said. “The pandemic has also given the opportunity to develop new hobbies. Use the time to innovate, find ways to be occupied,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/minor-alteration-in-treatment-of-covid-alcoholics-with-liver-disease/articleshow/83470361.cms||---

Most of them had laughed. The sanitation worker was “thinking too big”, they had said. On Saturday, it was Kumar who was grinning as he watched his 21-year-old son, Sujeet, graduate from the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun and become the first person from his village of Basila to join the Indian Army as an officer. “I held a broom, but my son will protect the country with his gun,” Kumar told TOI over phone from Varanasi — where he is currently posted — as the family huddled around a television to watch the Passing Out Parade. Family members of the Gentleman Cadets (GCs) were not allowed to be present during the ceremony due to Covid-related restrictions. “I would have loved to see the pride on my parents’ face,” said Sujeet, whose mother is an Asha worker back home. He will be joining the Army Ordnance Corps and hopes his achievement will motivate more youngsters in his village to don the olive green. Sujeet is already an inspiration to his siblings. All of them are preparing for competitive exams, said Kumar, who has now got his three other children to be with him in Varanasi to ensure they have access to better education facilities. “My wife lives alone in the village as she has to look after the health of people in that area. We do visit her once in a while but we have decided that we will do everything in our power to help our kids get the career they want.” Kumar is confident the family’s dreams will come true. "I know all my children will achieve what they aspire to one day. Challenges can only make people stronger. My elder daughter finished school two years ago but I couldn’t arrange money for medical coaching so she is studying on her own for MBBS. My younger daughter wants to become an IAS officer while younger son wants to get into IIT.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sanitation-workers-son-gets-commissioned-as-army-officer/articleshow/83467915.cms||Ishita Mishra

LSG minister M V Govindan Master told the assembly on June 7 that the draft master plan has to be discussed and finalized by the council. He said that Centre allocated Rs 60 lakhs so far in two installments for preparing the city’s master plan. The Centre had approved the proposal to prepare the master plan under formulation of GIS-based master plans for AMRUT cities at a cost of Rs 75 lakh. The draft master plan-2040 of Thiruvananthapuram city was expected to be readied in July 2020 and the city corporation initiated discussions at ward sabhas for it. The town planning department was able to complete data collection, stakeholder consultation, compilation of data from land use survey, socio-economic survey and meeting of 18 working groups and expert-level committee meetings to finalize proposals to be included in draft master plan 2040. With the council shirking discussion on master plan owing to past bitter experiences, the town planning committee mooted recommendations for change in the interim development order. Despite best efforts, the town planning standing committee failed to garner the support of both ruling and opposition members on two fronts: finalizing a new city master plan or in getting modified provisions of interim development order approved. Meanwhile, Neyyattinkara municipality got the department’s approval to notify its new master plan. Town planning committee repeatedly pointed out that people were finding it difficult to construct houses in certain areas and modifications were needed. The councillors digressed from the topic and the ruling council clearly hinted that it was not interested in modifying the interim development order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/onus-on-council-to-finalize-city-master-plan-lsg-min/articleshow/83469317.cms||---

Jadhav said that the move will benefit thousands of Goans who serve on merchant vessels and cruise liners. “The decision to include seafarers in the priority list for vaccination is a welcome move. A big thank you on behalf of all seafarers and GBOA,” said Jadhav. While the government has started vaccinating seafarers, crew that serve on iron ore barges and inland river vessels do not fall under the priority sector, said a Captain of Ports official. Jadhav said that CII is organising an intensive communication outreach programme for those who are hesitant to take the vaccine and to improve inoculation coverage in the industrial sector. “ Around 90% of those who died in Goa have not taken a single dose. Everyday, there are six to seven people who are above 60 years and who could have taken the vaccine, but did not,” said Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vax-drive-for-seamen-right-move-cii/articleshow/83470376.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Months after losing loved ones, kin get helpline calls||LUCKNOW: City-based private physician, Dr DP Mishra, was left fuming when he received a phone call from the Chinhat community health centre (CHC) on Saturday morning asking about his wife’s health, almost two months after she died of Covid-19. “It is horrible that these people have not updated their records. When my wife and I were suffering from Covid, nobody called to ask for our well-being. We tested positive on April 14 and were admitted to a private hospital on April 20. I was lucky to have survived but my wife passed away on April 27. I even got her death certificate made and they are irresponsible enough to call up families asking how the ‘patient’ is doing now,” said Dr Mishra, a resident of Gomtinagar. Dr Mishra is the former medical superintendent of Balrampur Hospital and also served as the president and general secretary of the UP Provincial Medical Health Services Association (PHMSA). “I told the man who called me that I can give heaven’s number for him to know how my wife is faring now,” he added sarcastically. Like Dr Mishra, many city residents are being contacted by the call centres of the health department and district administration to seek update on the health of patients in their families, but only days and sometimes months after they have already died of the disease. Posted at the National Health Mission (NHM), UP, Dr Anand Pratap Singh lost his 59-year-old father to Covid-19 on June 6. “He tested positive and was admitted to a private hospital on May 18. He died of Covid pneumonia and sepsis,” he said. “All the call centres attached to various departments used to make regular calls during the time of his illness, but the calls continued even after his death. I told them to update in their records that my father has passed away but the calls continued. Finally, I blocked all these numbers two days back so that no more phone calls come through. This constant badgering after the death of a loved one is highly insensitive and can be rectified by a minor update of data,” said Dr Singh. When TOI contacted Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Lucknow, Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar, he accepted that such a mistake could have happened and would be rectified. “Calls are now being made to all families on the list to collect data related to post-Covid complications. We want to get an overview of the complications and arrange beds and other facilities,” he said. “There is a possibility that some families which have already lost their patients received calls through those numbers which should not have happened. We will inform our staff to update the lists accordingly,” the CMO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/months-after-losing-loved-ones-kin-get-helpline-calls/articleshow/83471442.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Summer trips hit, chilling Rs 700 crore loss for agents||AHMEDABAD: Come summer and people are on a road trip to Udaipur or take a beach vacation to Maldives or rush to the Himalayas. When the people of Gujarat head to their favourite destinations, the travel and tourism industry in the state thrives with a whopping Rs 700 crore business. Last year’s lockdown eroded this completely. But the hope of revival of even domestic tourism this year has been dashed. Estimates of Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI), Gujarat chapter, suggest that cancellations of this year’s summer alone dealt losses to the tune of Rs 700 crore to the industry. “The pandemic year adversely hit the business of the travel industry and tour operators,” said Ankit Bajaj, secretary, TAFI-Gujarat chapter. “Many travel agents were forced to turn to alternative businesses or forced to lay off their staff or shift to smaller premises or even temporarily shut offices to cut costs of operations.” There was some hope of at least domestic travel and tourism reviving, Bajaj said. “But even that took a hit due to the second wave,” Bajaj added. “Inquiries have also not yet revived because people are extremely wary of travelling,” Bajaj said. “The looming threat of the third wave is a big deterrent in pre-planning holidays because people not just fear Covid but also getting stranded due to restrictions.” After the second wave, tour operators are reeling from a severe revenue crunch and are heavily cutting cost of operations. “We have completely shifted our office setup to home and continue to work from home so that we can save electricity and other operating costs,” said Hitank Shah, a city-based tour operator. Summer holiday bookings account for 60% of the total annual revenue of tour operators. This year, yet again, travel demand has nosedived both for leisure and MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) segments causing a clear loss to travel companies. A 35-year-old travel company in Ahmedabad was operated by a team of eight persons till March. “We had no choice but to let go off all the employees over the past two months,” said the owner of the company, on the condition of anonymity. “Business is adversely impacted and we don’t have the funds to bear the overhead costs. We have asked the employees to start looking for other jobs and have assured them that if the business revives in the near future, we may take them back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/summer-trips-hit-chilling-700-cr-loss-for-agents/articleshow/83469332.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Thane||Thane: Armed with college degrees, youths clean drains for a living||THANE: Lack of jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic has forced some 20-odd young men with college degrees to work as nullah (drain) cleaners in the Mumbra, Thane. But they are not ashamed. No work is inferior and they have to support their families, said one of them. A group of around 20 persons from Diva in the district has been hired by a private contractor for nullah cleaning, which is undertaken every year to prevent flooding during the monsoon. To save on transport costs, they walk from Diva to Mumbra, a distance of over 10km, everyday for work. Among them are some well-educated young men. Sameer (full name not disclosed), who said he is a “double graduate”, is working with the contractor for the last three months. “There are no jobs outside. Companies have closed due to the pandemic. One needs a job for earning livelihood and to take care of the family,” he told a local news channel. Anil, another worker, said he is an “IT engineer”. Some of them had white collar jobs, which they lost during the pandemic. As they needed income, one of them approached an agent of the civic contractor who undertakes pre-monsoon works a few weeks ago, and expressed willingness to join his team of labourers. The corporator of the ward in Mumbra where the work is underway said she felt sympathy for them as they had lost their regular jobs. “I salute them for their work,” she added. “One should not look down upon any work. After all we have to survive and support the family. What if we are post graduates or double graduates? Our degrees are not going to help us at present,” said another man. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-armed-with-college-degrees-youths-clean-drains-for-a-living/articleshow/83472562.cms||---
---||Chennai||How to support a loved one in distress||Chennai: Over the past few months, Dr S P Kurinjinathan has been seeing more cases of anxiety than he did last year. Unlike 2020, where the anxiety was related to the pandemic, this time around it is centered on it. "Last year, the anxiety was caused more by job and financial insecurity as well as the way the pandemic had caused an upheaval in their lives. The second wave has caused anxiety about getting infected and dying or in some way causing the death of a loved one," says the head of psychiatry at MIOT Hospitals. "They get frequent panic attacks, which almost mimic a heart attack. And that gets them more anxious."According to the World Health Organisation, the leading cause of disability worldwide is depression. At the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF), psychiatrist Dr R Thara says depression is becoming a "sequel to lifestyle changes caused by Covid-19". "We are seeing more people with mild to moderate levels of depression. It’s also triggering panic reactions as well as phobias of going out and meeting people."The anxiety quickly leads to fatigue and burnout, she explains, largely because no one knows how long the pandemic will last. "When your future is uncertain, you feel a sense of hopelessness and it’s killing people in terms of their mental health," says Dr Thara, adding that even she has felt that sense of helplessness. "Last month, I was flooded with calls for oxygen requirements and I could not help everyone. That was tremendous mental pressure on me because I felt I was letting people down in their time of need."Coping, she says, requires one to speak to loved ones or in the case of psychiatrists, even their peers, to regain a sense of calm. "People need to support a loved one who is undergoing anxiety," she says.Dr Kurinjinathan says some of the signs that tell you a loved one needs mental health support are if they seem dull and listless, isolate themselves from family and friends, or are irritable. "These are signs that they are struggling," he says.Children having anxiety will exhibit behavioural issues like anger and aggression or may just not engage with the family. Other signs for both adults and children include unexplained crying, inability to focus on work, a lack of interest in any form of social engagement, and tossing and turning in bed. "Obsessively reading up or talking about Covid-19 and its related deaths could also be another sign of anxiety," says Dr Thara.While it can be challenging to get them to open up, to help the loved one cope, Dr Kurunjinathan suggests first learning to listen to them. "If it is the news that is worrying them, present them with balanced news. Show them the news about survivors, the positive facts. Also, keep them socially engaged with phone calls to friends and family so the mind does not wander back to Covid-19."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/how-to-support-a-loved-one-in-distress/articleshow/83473672.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh set to surpass its wheat purchase record||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government is on the verge of breaking its own record in wheat procurement this year, having already purchased around 51.05 lakh tons of wheat from more than 11.54 lakh farmers since April 1. The state set the record for the highest wheat purchase in a year in 2018-19 when it procured 52.92 lakh tons. With current procurement scheduled to carry on till June 15, it is likely to surpass the previous record. Procurement of wheat in the corresponding period in 2020-21 was just 29.92 lakh tons. The government has not set any target for wheat procurement this year, said government spokesperson, as Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath did not want to limit procurement only to fulfilment of the prescribed target. “Despite the second wave of Covid, we have been purchasing almost 1 lakh tons of wheat every day. On June 11, around 1.19 lakh tons was procured,” said Food and Supply Commissioner Maneesh Chauhan, adding that wheat worth Rs 10,082.99 crore has been purchased so far. For the first time, farmers have received direct benefits against the sale of wheat under “One Nation, One MSP, One DBT”. The payment is being transferred into their bank accounts within 72 hours of purchase, Chauhan said. The government has nominated seven purchasing agencies, including the department of food and civil supplies, PCF, UPSS, UPPCU, SFC, Mandi Parishad and Food Corporation of India. The number of procurement centres has been increased from 5,000 last year to 6,000 this time while the MSP for wheat has been increased from Rs 1,925 per quintal in 2020-21 to Rs 1,975 per quintal in 2021-22. Arrangements are also being made for the safe storage of wheat in light of the monsoon rain. “An online token system has been arranged this year for farmers to get tokens for sale of wheat at the purchasing centre as per their convenience. Centres have been geo-tagged to help farmers locate the centres easily. To eliminate middlemen, electronic point of purchase (e-PoP) machines are being used," an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-set-to-surpass-its-wheat-purchase-record/articleshow/83471451.cms||---

With a number of world heritage properties being lost or pulled down for construction of commercial properties, the heritage cell of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has engaged an agency to begin a mass awareness campaign to save these properties and educate families and market associations on the importance of the Unesco world heritage tag. The civic body had engaged the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) to prepare a heritage conservation plan for the city, which is being delayed for almost three years. On Thursday, the Chowksi Mahajan at Manek Chowk and several other trading guilds in the Walled City had issued notices to their respective members to co-operate with the NIUA-designated agency for the heritage conservation survey. “The NIUA has engaged an Ahmedabad-based private agency to conduct a survey to suggest ways of educating people to save their heritage structures and building a brand around the Unesco world heritage tag,” says a senior AMC official. One of the biggest fears plaguing the municipal corporation is a Unesco inspection that may suggest Ahmedabad to be put in the endangered list and finally remove the world heritage tag. ‘In all our promotional material we have been mentioning that Ahmedabad is India’s first world heritage city. It will be a big blow for us if we lose the tag prior to the 2036 Olympics bid as a majority of Europeans love heritage tours,” added the senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/olympics-bid-amc-hires-agency-for-heritage-push/articleshow/83469373.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||A papaya barrier to fend off simian attack||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Having found themselves at wits’ end by the persistent, irritable visits by a troop of monkeys, Pallickal panchayat is setting up a bio-barrier hoping that the simians wouldn’t venture beyond the line. While other local bodies were busy planting tree saplings, the members of this panchayat had gone around households collecting papaya saplings. About 50 saplings were planted in each ward, mostly on the borders, with the aim of preventing the monkeys from coming near households and farm lands. “Monkey menace is a major issue in this panchayat. Despite our talks with the forest department and our efforts, we have not been able to control these monkeys. Around five wards are located close to Elambarakoodu forest and the monkeys make it a habit to frequently raid households and adjacent farms. We thought of planting papaya saplings hoping that it would serve the food they are looking for,” says S S Biju, ward member, Molychantha. The panchayat residents had to also deal with wild boar which would damage the farm lands. “Many residents here are farmers and every household has a small cultivable land. With the arrival of monkeys and wild boar, everything is ruined. We are not able to get proper compensation due to the losses. We sincerely hope that papaya will ward off the trouble,” says Noorjahan S, ward member, K K Konam, one of the most severely-affected wards. Biju said that the panchayat arrived at the decision of planting papaya saplings on environment day for the common good. The planting of saplings was organized in all wards on World Environment Day. “Besides addressing the monkey menace, we also wanted environment day programmes to have a human connect. In many cases, the survival rate of tree saplings is very low. Here, papayas grow fast and give good yield. It will also act as a barrier to the monkey attack. We are also taking a status check on the actual state of tree saplings planted in the panchayat in previous years,” said Biju.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-papaya-barrier-to-fend-off-simian-attack/articleshow/83469354.cms||---

---||India||Steroid use for Covid treatment likely cause for rise in diabetes cases: Doctors||AHMEDABAD: Anil Mehta, 48, a real estate broker had never shown high blood sugar in his biannual medical check-ups. He did not have risk factors like hypertension or obesity and had a healthy lifestyle. A severe Covid-19 illness which required hospitalisation due to 80% lung involvement, however, saw him testing positive for uncontrolled sugar levels over 500 mg/dl. Six months after surviving Covid, Mehta is now a diabetic who pops two pills a day to keep his sugar levels in check. “Covid has given me diabetes as a parting gift,” says Mehta. Gujarat, the diabetes capital of India, seems poised for a jump in the number of diabetics post Covid-19 as experts report a perceptible rise either triggered by or detected during the Covid episode. “A global analysis published in Journal of Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism last year demonstrated that 14.4% of patients hospitalised with severe Covid developed diabetes. Nationally, experts are estimating 1 crore diabetics will be added due to the pandemic,” says endocrinologist Dr Sanjeev Phatak who has treated 80 patients diagnosed with diabetes after a Covid infection in the pandemic year. “Covid may attack insulin-producing beta cells of pancreas either resulting in cells to fail or impairing their function, triggering high blood sugar levels or diabetes. Steroid use may also trigger it though it is generally temporary,” says Dr Phatak. Experts say pre-existing factors like obesity, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle and pandemic-induced stress may also be triggers. “In many patients with risk factors, Covid fast-tracked manifestation of diabetes. In many cases, it is possible diabetes was present but undetected,” said diabetologist Dr Bansi Saboo. Dr Saboo said a national study is underway to understand the role played by Covid in precipitating diabetes and if it was a permanent disease or a temporary metabolic alteration which resolved as inflammation resolved or effects of steroids wore off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-steroid-use-for-treatment-likely-cause-for-rise-in-diabetes-cases-doctors/articleshow/83473654.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Chennai||TN lawyers oppose making apex court lawyers HC judges||Chennai: The proposal of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), and the approval it received from the apex court, to elevate lawyers practising in the Supreme Court as judges of high courts has been condemned by top Bar associations in Tamil Nadu.A fortnight ago, the SCBA floated the proposal, which also found favour with Chief Justice of India Justice N V Ramana. The SCBA added fuel to the controversy by forming a ‘committee’ of its office-bearers to ‘identify’ potential candidates, saying lawyers in the Supreme Court were more ‘meritorious’ than their counterparts in high courts.Taking exception to this, Madras Bar Association (MBA) president A R L Sundaresan said it was not constitutional. “Practice for more than 10 years in the high court concerned is the mandatory requirement to be elevated as judge of the court, and the proposal being made now is a reverse of the process,” he said. SCBA’s search committee which is supposed to identify candidates and recommend them to the SC, which would then pass on the list to the high court concerned is something unheard of, he said.Vice-chairman of the Bar Council of India S Prabakaran said the proposal was an attempt to interfere with the administrative affairs of high courts. Citing the example of Justice Subramoniam Prasad, who was practising before the SC before being appointed as judge of Madras high court, Prabakaran said, “No doubt he is an able judge. But within a year of his elevation at Madras high court, he was transferred to Delhi high court, which is loss to the Madras Bar. Moreover, SBCA is not a statutory body to make such recommendations.” Madras high court advocates association president G Mohanakrishnan said, “If the appointment of judges to high courts is taken over by the SC, brilliant lawyers practising in high courts will be deprived of an opportunity to become judges.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-lawyers-oppose-making-apex-court-lawyers-hc-judges/articleshow/83473699.cms||---

This is the first time that this painting will come under the hammer. The Calcutta Series is a famous collection of paintings that Husain had done in tribute to the city in its tercentenary year. He tried to capture not only glimpses from the daily life of the city but also the history and culture associated with it. The painting in question shows a slice of ‘babudom’ in yesteryear Kolkata, where a rich man is seen smoking an elaborate ‘gorgora’ (hookah) sitting on his perch with his human carriers carrying him on their heads. This painting is 44×60 inches in size and is an acrylic on canvas. It was part of the entire series that was exhibited in Calcutta 300 – From Job Charnock’s Kolkata to Satyajit Ray’s Mahanagar in 1990 when the tercentenary celebrations of the city was organised. “I remember having interacted with him when he was bringing these brightly coloured large canvases to life one after the other. He loved to roam about on the streets and read deeply about the city’s past. People like Rammohun Roy and Tagore inspired him,” said Jogen Chowdhury, who has been to many exhibitions of Husain’s paintings. The auction has been organised on June 25 by AstaGuru and the base price has been kept at Rs 20-30 lakhs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mf-husains-calcutta-series-painting-to-go-under-hammer/articleshow/83469368.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

G-RIDE is planning to reach out to various multilateral financing agencies like World Bank and Asian Development Bank to fund the project, said sources in the chief minister’s office. At present, G-RIDE is undertaking alignment studies of the project. It is estimated that a majority of the alignment will be along national highway (NH-47) connecting Ahmedabad and Rajkot. The take-off point in Ahmedabad is being planned at Sabarmati. The EIA study will entail a comprehensive environment and social impact study along the route corridor. The consultants will identify mitigation measures, conduct public consultations, prepare a resettlement action plan as well as an environmental and social management plan. The project will act as a high-speed rail feeder for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train and reduce travel time from Rajkot to Mumbai, which, currently takes more than 12 hours, to less than 5 hours. The semi high-speed rail project will have six stations and a total corridor length of 227.6 km. The estimated cost of the project will be Rs 28,291 crore. Trains on the line will operate at top speed of 160 kmph and cover the distance between Ahmedabad and Rajkot in two hours, thus reducing the usual travel time of 4.5 hours if one opts for a journey by national highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-undertakes-eia-study-for-semi-high-speed-rail-project/articleshow/83469412.cms||---

Dr Ram Vishwakarma, advisor to DG-CSIR, pointed out that Colchicine in combination with standard of care can be an important therapeutic, life-saving intervention for Covid-19 patients with cardiac co-morbidities and for reducing proinflammatory cytokines, leading to faster recovery. Laxai CEO Dr Ram Upadhayay said the enrolment of patients has already begun at multiple sites across India and the trial is likely to be completed in the next 8-10 weeks. He further added that this drug can be made available to large population of India based on the results of this trial and regulatory approval. India is one of the largest producers of this key drug and if successful, it will be made available to the patients at an affordable cost, said CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology Hyderabad director Dr S Chandrasekhar and CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM), Jammu director Dr DS Reddy. Both these CSIR partner institutes will be participating in the study. A number of global studies have now confirmed that cardiac complications during the course of Covid-19 infections and post-Covid syndrome are leading to loss of many lives and it is essential to look for new or repurposed drugs, CSIR said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/csir-laxai-get-dcgi-nod-for-phase-2-trials-of-colchicine-for-covid/articleshow/83470389.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Ten people have died so far, including one death reported by the Goa Medical College (GMC) on Friday. Most of the patients are treated at the GMC, with 14 active cases. A patient who was admitted as a suspect was found to be negative for black fungus and was de-notified accordingly on Friday, a GMC doctor said. A special ward for patients undergoing treatment for black fungus under an ENT surgeon has been set up at GMC. Goa, though has fewer cases compared to other states, the doctor said they are still worried as patients come with severe complications, and their diabetes level is also high, slowing down their recovery. Most of the patients, he said, were referred to them after their recovery from Covid. The higher doses of steroids are suspected to have caused their present condition. “Covid-19 has led to several complications in patients post their recovery or while recovering. Black fungus is one of the serious complications caused due to excessive use of steroids,” he said. Experts have already warned that Covid patients shouldn’t be administered steroids during the initial period of the illness – the first five days - to avoid the adverse effects, more so for those who are diabetic. “When patients with uncontrolled diabetes are given steroids for an extended period, and without monitoring them, they face a grave risk of developing the black fungus infection. They can also get any other opportunistic infection. Also, the mortality rate is high,” he said. A Covid patient having a high or uncontrolled diabetes, should not ignore nasal symptoms. Other symptoms that they may experience could be tooth pain, blurred vision, facial pain or headache. During the first wave of the pandemic, Goa had hardly reported any cases of black fungus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/black-fungus-tally-rises-to-24-in-goa-10-deaths-till-date/articleshow/83470387.cms||---

Three who died were under the age of 60 – a 51-year-old man from Nanus who died two days after he was hospitalised, and two women - a 54-year-old from Agali and a 56-year-old from Benaulim – both having co-morbidities – died few days after their hospital treatment started. The average hospital stay of other deceased was a week and more. There were 70 hospitalisations, while 15 patients were discharged. Barring Margao and Ponda centres, the caseload of all centres in South Goa has reduced to less than 200 cases. In North Goa, except Panaji and Chimbel, the caseload of other centres has fallen below the 200-mark. The active case tally of primary health centres at Casarvarnem and Mayem was less than 50 on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/positivity-rate-rises-to-14-4-toll-nears-3000-mark-with-15-deaths/articleshow/83470391.cms||---

Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has managed to keep those three reserved seats where it has three sitting MLAs in Doaba region, but they also happen to be strongholds of BSP and latter was demanding these seats also. The seats allotted to BSP include Kartarpur, Jalandhar West, Jalandhar North, Phagwara, Nawansheher, Hoshiarpur City, Tanda, Dasuya, Chamkaur Sahib, Bassi Pathana, Mehal Kalan, Ludhiana North, Sujanpur, Bhoa, Pathankot, Anandpur Sahib, Mohali, Amritsar North, Amritsar Central and Payal. Of these, eight are in Doaba region, where party has its strongest presence. But, on several seats of Malwa, where it got three (as four being called in Malwa are actually in Puadh region), it can be a good vote aggregator for SAD and has the potential to tilt the balance. However, BSP sources said a feeling is prevailing that party does not have really strong presence on quite a few seats left for them. Though senior BJP leader Manoranjan Kalia on Saturday called it a ‘most unnatural alliance’, but elections of 1989 and 1996 have already proved that SAD and BSP voters transferred their voters to each other seamlessly. In1989, BSP had an alliance with Simranjit Singh Mannled Akali Dal and party got its first MP from Punjab in Harbhajan Lakha from Phillaur constituency. Parkash Singh Badal-led SAD at that time contested separately and it was reduced to margins as Sikh voters preferred Mann led Akali Dal. In 1996, BSP got its three MPs, including Kanshi Ram, but the alliance was short-lived as Badal preferred to go with BJP after winning the election “Late Gurcharan Singh Tohra wanted to continue alliance with BSP, but Badal prevailed and ideologically closer alliance between SAD and BSP was broken,” said author Gurbachan Singh, who worked closely with Kanshi Ram and has been frequently writing on Dalits and their relationship with Sikhs. A difference from 1989 and 1996 is that on both occasions Sikh voters had almost completely rallied behind SAD, but now a large section of Sikhs are annoyed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-gives-12-seats-fought-by-bjp-to-bsp/articleshow/83470420.cms||IP Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Third wave: Private hospitals in Ahmedabad add infrastructure, more staff||AHMEDABAD: During the post-Diwali surge, the highest daily cases recorded in Ahmedabad were 354 in November 2020 which rose to 5,790 in April, recording a 16-fold rise. While the number of beds available in private hospitals increased from 2,256 to 6,213, the occupancy in both the waves remained over 90%, making citizens scurry for beds, as the rise in the number of beds was just three times the previous figure. The second wave thus brought in several changes in approach of private hospitals especially in procuring oxygen, upgrading infrastructure, and getting matching human resources. Currently, about 110 hospitals treat Covid-19 patients in the city. They are gradually reducing the number of beds to make space for post-Covid patients and for planned medical procedures. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, the president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that almost all member hospitals are increasing bed capacity by converting the existing wards and adding new infrastructure. “A few hospitals are installing liquid oxygen tanks to address the acute shortage of oxygen at the peak of the second wave,” he said. “Several others are installing PSA plants for getting oxygen from the air.” Industry sources said that a city like Ahmedabad may witness the addition of about 1,000 beds in the next few months which can be used for both Covid and non-Covid purposes. Focus is also on makeshift arrangements which can be employed at a time of major surge. AHNA members said that the public-private hospital model worked in favour of the city and Gujarat, with a large section of patients getting treated by the private sector. The AMC in both waves requisitioned beds in private hospitals to reduce the financial burden on patients, which increased the share of hospitalization. “All hospitals have been told to remain on standby for quick response if the need arises for more beds during the third wave,” said Dr Gadhvi. “The focus is on following standard operating procedures and ensuring oxygen supply.” Dr Gadhvi added: “Our oxygen bank — one of the first such initiatives in India — is also being expanded to tackle any contingency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/third-wave-pvt-hospitals-add-infra-more-staff/articleshow/83470395.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Delhi||It’s document of hope rather than redemption, say sceptical citizens||New Delhi: While appreciating the new concepts in the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041, many citizen groups and traders’ associations are concerned about the actual implementation of these ideas. Some sceptical people point out that urban regeneration and redevelopment of the city’s areas were also part of MPD21 but were never implemented. They, therefore, want to see clearer guidelines about the progress envisioned in the draft plans. One of those who isn’t too optimistic about the plans is Sanjay Bhargava, member of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal. He said the draft MPD41 restates the redevelopment plans for Shahjahanabad without realising that only an empowered local body for the Walled City could ensure holistic redevelopment. “It cannot be done piecemeal or plot by plot,” said Bhargava. Delhi Development Authority must focus on overcoming practical difficulties and forge ahead with actually implementing the ideas of MPD41, said Atul Goel. The head of URJA, or United RWAs Joint Action, an RWA collective, was clear: “Just floating good ideas is not enough. Urban regeneration was also part of MPD21 but nothing happened. DDA must determine why such projects did not materialise and remove the roadblocks.” Chamber of Trade and Industry similarly said MPD41 was old wine in a new bottle. “Many new proposals were already in MPD21. There is no clarity or a concrete vision,” grumbled Briesh Goyal, head of the body. “No roadmap has been provided for redevelopment of historical markets.” In a pragmatic move, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) will send DDA its feedback, to be prepared by an 11-member panel. It welcomed the provisions allowing commercial activities in industrial areas but demanded an amnesty scheme under MPD41 to prevent sealing and demolition drives. “Traders have paid thousands of crores as parking and conversion charges without getting any facilities,” said CAIT’s Praveen Khandelwal. Because of issues like these, MPD41 is a document of “hope rather than redemption”, opined Rajeev Kakria, convener, Save Our City Campaign. He said, “Instead of encouraging redevelopment of existing mixed-land use markets in terms of better infrastructure, access and circulation, the draft plan promotes mixed-use in vertical buildings/ residential areas. This despite the fact that mixed land use has destroyed the fabric of residential areas and turned the entire city into one extended marketplace, with all its attendant problems.” He added that the concept of ‘green buffer zone’ was interesting but automatically aimed to promote commercialisation. Parking management has been met with mixed reactions. B S Vohra, who heads the East Delhi RWA Joint Front, said: “Everything depends on the hope that people will shift to public transport or cycling. But barely anything has been done to improve last mile connectivity, forcing people to use their own vehicles.” Bharat Ahuja, president, Bhagirath Palace Electrical Traders’ Association, broached an issue faced by all business owners. “We have asked the authorities to fix loading and unloading sites in markets and this should have been ideally addressed by the master plan. Our market, for example, is so congested, but nothing has been done in this regard,” said Ahuja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-document-of-hope-rather-than-redemption-say-sceptical-citizens/articleshow/83470390.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: 22 more oxygen plants in Covid fight||NEW DELHI: In a major boost to medical oxygen infrastructure, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated 22 new oxygen generation plants virtually in nine hospitals on Saturday. Together, these plants will generate 17.3 metric tonnes of oxygen. Kejriwal said that the chances of a resurgence in Covid-19 infection were “quite real” and said the government was preparing for it on a war footing. A total of 33 pressure swing absorption oxygen plants are now functional in Delhi. Under extensive preparations for a possible surge in Covid, 17 more oxygen plants will be installed in the coming month. Delhi government has set up 27 PSA plants, while the central government has installed six in state government hospitals. The Delhi government plants have a capacity to generate 22.2MT of oxygen daily, while the Centre’s six plants can generate 8.1MT. Calling the augmentation of oxygen a huge development, the CM thanked PWD, HCL, Maruti Udyog, engineers and hospitals, all partners supporting Delhi government in erecting 22 PSA plants at short notice. Delhi government is also procuring oxygen tankers. “We now face the risk of a possible third Covid wave. There are indications that the United Kingdom has already started seeing the third wave, even after 45% of the people were vaccinated. So, we also must be fully prepared,” Kejriwal said. “In the recent wave of infections, Delhi suffered a huge shortage of oxygen. Delhi is not an industrial state and so doesn't have production sources for oxygen. Delhi requires a relatively smaller share of oxygen for its hospitals, but Covid increased the city’s requirements manifold,” Kejriwal said during the e-inauguration. The CM and health minister Satyendar Jain thanked HCL for providing 17 oxygen PSA plants to Delhi government. Four plants have been made available by Maruti Udyog. “HCL will be giving us four more plants, which will arrive soon. Similarly, five such plans have already been installed in hospitals like Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra, Ambedkar Nagar Hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, and Burari Hospital,” said Jain. Many Delhi government hospitals now have multiple oxygen generation plants. The CM explained that Delhi needed around 200MT of medical oxygen for non-Covid purposes, apart from some amount of industrial oxygen. “This requirement rose to 700MT during the corona crisis because every patient needed oxygen. We didn't have the means to produce the gas or even tankers to get it from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the central government. Now, we must be fully prepared. We cannot abdicate our responsibilities,” he said. Delhi is working assiduously to create infrastructure that will meet the needs if the city faces a resurgence in Covid infections. One of the measures being taken by Delhi government is to strengthen oxygen generation capacity because during the recent wave, the city faced a huge scarcity of oxygen and tragically many patients died when the oxygen supply ran out in certain hospitals. Kejriwal also inaugurated an oxygen storage facility in northwest Delhi on Thursday. “I had to ensure oxygen storage tanks in Delhi because even if we procure medical oxygen from outside the capital, we need to have the capacity to store the gas,” he said. “We inaugurated three storage tanks of 57MT each, along with oxygen tanks of 13.5MT each." Kejriwal thanked the Centre for its support in Delhi’s battle against the coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/22-more-o2-plants-in-covid-fight/articleshow/83470412.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh’s three aspirational districts make it to UNDP top-10 list||LUCKNOW: Out of the eight aspirational districts in Uttar Pradesh under the United Nations Development Programme, three have made it to the top 10 among 117 across the country, on the basis of improvement in positive indicators of development. Chandauli has ranked second this year, followed by Sonbhadra at the fourth position and Fatehpur which has ranked seventh. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the development brought about by the Aspirational District Programme. “Under the guidance of the PM and with the efforts by UP Government, the state is fast progressing towards holistic and inclusive development. The UNDP India report on the development in Sonbhadra, Chandauli and Fatehpur recognises this fact,” the CM said. The Aspirational Districts Programme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2018 as a part of the government’s effort to raise the living standards of its citizens and ensure inclusive growth for all, he added. He added that the UNDP report has appreciated the PM’s aspirational district programme which has helped to cover many districts in the state with inclusive development. “UP Government is committed to achieving ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ under the PM’s guidance,” the CM added. Appreciating the work that has taken place in Chandauli, known as the ‘rice bowl’ of eastern UP, for production of the more economically viable black rice, the report has commended the district administration for encouraging farmers to take up black rice farming. “Black rice as such is not native to the area and is actually produced in high quantities in Manipur. However, given the increasing demand for the product in the global markets, the district administration promoted the product among a small group of 300 farmers. With the success of the initiative, high quality black rice produced in the district is now ready to be exported to Australia and New Zealand and will soon be exported to other countries as well,” the report has said, adding that black rice is double the price of normal rice in the local market at Rs 200 per kg. A government spokesperson said that the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) has been motivating more farmers to grow black rice as Chandauli’s soil is highly favourable for paddy farming. “The UNDP report is based on quantitative analysis of publicly available data and interviews with various stakeholders, including DMs, central prabhari officers, district fellows and other development partners,” said the spokesperson. Furthermore, the UNDP report has put Chandauli and Sonbhadra among the top 5 districts with maximum change in net resilience since 2018. According to the report, Chandauli and Sonbhadra among others were found to have progressed the most since the beginning of the programme. The Aspirational Districts Programme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2018 as a part of the government’s effort to raise the living standards of its citizens and ensure inclusive growth for all, he added. “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has always encouraged innovation in the agricultural sector. He has given the much required impetus to the sector in line with the UP Export Policy 2020-25, which aims at doubling the income of farmers and increasing farm exports while promoting the ‘Make In India’ programme,” he said. Jharkhand capital Ranchi has topped the rankings. Bahraich is UP's worst performing district at 81st position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-three-aspirational-dists-make-it-to-undp-top-10-list/articleshow/83471462.cms||Neha Lalchandani

During the hearing before the Gujarat high court on Friday, petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal highlighted the discrepancy in the figures that the authorities supplied to the court. The information was placed before the court by eight municipal corporations and six fire regional officers pertaining to all cities and municipalities. By citing various affidavits filed by the AMC on different dates, the petitioner submitted that the city had 646 highrise residential buildings out of 1,800 such buildings which did not have valid fire NOC as on February 22. During a hearing, the HC insisted on specific figures on highrise buildings. On June 1, AMC submitted that 1,876 out of 3,165 highrise residential buildings lacked fire NOC. Similarly, AMC stated on February 22 that all 600 schools and colleges were fire safe. On March 31, it said that 1,292 buildings out of total 2,395 school/college buildings did not have fire NOC. The number of defaulting buildings in this category increased to 1,353 on June 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mismatch-in-fire-noc-figures-pointed-out/articleshow/83470463.cms||---

---||Delhi||Draft MPD2041: Roadmap for affordable, rental housing is in place||New Delhi: To address the housing needs of students, single working men and women and migrants, the draft Master Plan of Delhi 2041 talks of a diverse strategy, including affordable housing, rental housing, hostels, studio apartments, serviced apartments and dormitories. A roadmap for “affordable public rental housing” (APRH) has been drawn up with possible incentives to give the idea a push. Around 28.4% of households live in rental accommodation as per Census 2011 and it is estimated that the number would have increased over the last decade. 32.3% of the population are migrants (socio-economic survey of Delhi, GNCTD, 2018-19) and prefer rental housing due to low entry and exit costs. Most of this rental housing demand is being catered to by unplanned settlements with issues of tenure insecurity and compromised living conditions. The draft MPD2041 dwells on the rationale behind promoting rental housing. It cites how metropolitan cities across the world maintain a diversified rental housing stock providing residents and migrants tenure flexibility, geographical mobility and affordability. Given the high cost of land in developed parts of the city, this also ensures availability of housing for a variety of income groups closer to their workplaces. “Public agencies shall develop a proportion of their housing inventories in the form of rental housing. This may be of various forms such as service apartments, dormitories, etc. A mix of rental options such as affordable rentals with controlled rents, market rental units, rent-to-own models may be explored,” the plan states. Also, public agencies may consider bringing their unsold/vacant public housing stock into the rental market. According to the draft, DDA and other public agencies concerned may take up dedicated APRH projects on public lands close to activity centres such as industrial areas, educational hubs and others to improve the availability of affordable rental stock. “The large number of EWS housing units created as part of group housing projects will provide opportunities to improve the availability of affordable rental housing stock. Suitable models may be explored for facilitating the same,” it stated. To improve management of such rental assets, public agencies may seek the services of rental management agencies and housing aggregators. An online portal giving information regarding availability, location and rentals will be created, stated the draft MPD 2041. Incentives shall also be offered for encouraging the private sector to implement rental housing or other non-ownership formats like serviced apartments and worker housing. For instance, industrial areas and warehousing/freight complexes shall develop affordable rental housing units by utilising 15% additional FAR. Rented housing shall be promoted as part of group housing projects. Rental housing shall also be encouraged in all greenfield, reconstruction and regeneration projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/draft-mpd2041-roadmap-for-affordable-rental-housing-is-in-place/articleshow/83470415.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Daily infections may drop, but can’t be lax on SOPs’||PANAJI: Though the state is witnessing a dip in new cases of Covid-19 and since last Sunday the daily count of cases has gone below the 500-mark, people will have to continue to follow the Covid safety norms considering the unpredictability of the virus. “Even if the virus spread is under control, and the daily average of new infections drops below 200 or even 100, the measures against the virus cannot be done away with. In fact, that would be the crucial time — the period when infections will be negligible — and the public will have to strictly follow what they are doing now so that the anticipated third wave doesn’t happen,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI. The measures are required to be followed scrupulously now, people will have to comply with an equal earnest when the cases decrease drastically, he said. “It will be more important that patients in home isolation adhere to home quarantine standard operating procedures (SOPs) fully when the cases drop. By stepping out of a house when they are required to be in the quarantine, if they think they are fooling either the government or society, then they are mistaken. They will be fooling themselves. Their misadventure can lead to rise in infections,” Betodkar said. People, he said, will have to avoid gatherings and crowds at all costs. “The cases shot up exponentially due to all kinds of gatherings in the state. We don’t know when the government plans to open up, but when the restrictions are lifted, people will have to avoid gatherings,” he said. The people are frustrated by being indoors for so long and they are longing to go out, but they will have to be patient and take measures to remain safe, the epidemiologist said. They can have their functions and celebrations when the overall scenario normalises, he said. Betodkar said that since Covid-19 has thrown up numerous surprises, he will not like to comment if the infectivity of the strain – the double mutant – will lessen in the next few months. The state has not seen new strains, apart from four, including the double mutant Maharashtra strain, that were detected two months ago. The epidemiologist, however, said that the state will be better prepared for the possible third wave which may hit the state in September, as the task force and the expert committee constituted last month, have swung into action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/daily-infections-may-drop-but-cant-be-lax-on-sops/articleshow/83470399.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||In under 24 hours, Goa cops find kidnapped infant||PANAJI: A day after a child was kidnapped from the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital premises in Bambolim, Goa police cracked the case and arrested a woman from Saleli, Sattari. The mother of the toddler has identified the baby as her one-month-old son. North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena told TOI that the district police as well as crime branch were roped in in massive numbers to find the child, and it was this search coupled with technical surveillance that helped them crack the case. “They have arrested Vishranti Gawas in the case,” said deputy SP Santosh Dessai. On Saturday morning, Goa police released CCTV footage and photos of the woman suspected of having kidnapped the baby,. The SP said that Gawas already has four daughters. Police said that a month ago, she told her husband that she delivered a baby boy at GMC, and didn’t allow him to visit her at the hospital due to Covid. When she reached home from hospital “with an object wrapped like a baby”, she didn’t let her family visit the “baby”, which she kept inside a room. Police said that her husband told them that the family never heard the baby crying at home. Saturday, when Gawas was arrested, was supposed to be the baby’s naming ceremony. “I congratulate Goa police for successfully leading one of the biggest manhunts in the state and safely rescuing a one-month-old child within 24 hours. The safety and security of citizens is the top priority of our government,” CM Pramod Sawant tweeted. According to police officials, the child’s mother was standing with the infant near the coffee shop within the hospital premises. The accused woman approached the mother and pleaded for food. The accused convinced the mother to purchase food for her and to allow her to hold the child while the mother bought the food. The child’s mother went to the coffee shop, but on her return, was shocked to see the accused and her child missing from the spot. The mother raised an alarm, and police personnel posted at the GMC outpost rushed to the spot. However, on carrying out a search, the accused woman could not be traced on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-under-24-hrs-cops-find-kidnapped-infant/articleshow/83470401.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Will soon make final analysis of Covaxin efficacy trials public, says Bharat Biotech||HYDERABAD: As the clamour grows for Bharat Biotech to publish the phase-III data for indigenously developed Covaxin, the company said it is committed to data transparency and will soon be making the final analysis data of the efficacy trials public. “Demonstrating its scientific commitment to data generation and data transparency, Bharat Biotech shares full data of all research studies of its Covaxin and has published as many as nine research papers on its safety and efficacy in five globally reputed peerreviewed journals in a span of 12 months,” the vaccine maker said in a statement on Saturday. These journals include The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Cellpress, Clinical Infectious Diseases, Journal of Travel Medicine and Nature Communications. “The published studies are widely cited for the rigor and breadth that Bharat Biotech brings to its clinical trials,” it added. “Our humble request to ‘Where is your data?’...our publications do the talking!” the company also tweeted from its Twitter handle to drive home this point and said Covaxin has many firsts to its credit in data transparency. “It is the first and only product to have published any data from human clinical trials in India. It is the only product to have any data on emerging variants. It is also the first and only Covid-19 vaccine to have efficacy data in Indian populations,” it said. The company’s statements came in the wake of a heated Twitter exchange between Bharat Biotech’s SARSCoV-2 vaccine project lead Raches Ella and Kolkata-based endocrinologist Dr Awadhesh Kumar Singh over the latter’s study comparing immune responses of Covaxin and Covishield. The spat also saw several Twitterati accuse Bharat Biotech of lack of transparency as it has not yet declared the final Phase-III data. “Currently, data from both efficacy and safety follow-up of Covaxin’s Phase III trial is being analysed and compiled.

---||Patna||‘Mango man’ of Bhagalpur comes up with new varieties||BHAGALPUR: Apart from the juicy Jardalu mangoes, other exceptional, colourful and rich varieties of mangoes developed by Ashok Choudhary, popularly known as ‘Mango Man’, at his farm-cum-research centre at Maheshi-Tilakpur village under Sultanganj block in Bhagalpur district have also caught the attention of people. Sixty-two-year-old Choudhary, a science and law graduate, had left his job as teacher in a government school long ago and started working for the conservation of about-to-be extinct varieties of mangoes and also developing new varieties since 1992 at his ‘Madhuban Mango Farm’. While toiling hard for ‘Jardalu’ variety of mangoes, Choudhary developed new varieties of mangoes with the help of ‘grafting technology’, also known as multi-variety propagation. It helped him develop more than 20 varieties of mangoes. Choudhary said new varieties of mangoes have been developed with the help of ‘Irwin’ and ‘Sensation’ varieties of mango from Florida, USA, and other varieties from across India. “In 28 years, I have developed more than 80 varieties of mangoes of different regions and countries, including 20-25 varieties of colourful mangoes,” he added. Popular names of the colourful mangoes developed by Choudhary are Lalima, Pratima, Arunima, Navratra, Surya and Bhagalpuri Bambaiya. A fan of PM Narendra Modi, Choudhary has also developed two special varieties of juicy colourful mangoes which have been been christened as Modi I and Modi II. “Only those new varieties which are exceptional in terms of quality, juiciness, aroma, sweetness and external appearances are used for propagation and commercial farming,” Choudhary said, adding people from Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Purnia and other districts visit his farm to have a look at the mango varieties and also carry their saplings to grow them. “I don’t charge anything from anyone in the propagation of colourful varieties of mangoes,” he added. The Bihar government has been selecting unique variety of Jardalu mangoes, which had got prestigious geographical indication (GI) tag in 2018, from Choudhary’s farm since 2007 to send them to the country’s dignitaries, including the President and the PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mango-man-of-bhagalpur-comes-up-with-new-varieties/articleshow/83467757.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The vaccination sites for Tika Utsav 3.0 include the permanent vaccination centres, panchayats and other centres. Health officials expect that there won’t be a mad rush as the government rolled out vaccination for 18-44-year olds in a staggered manner beginning with lactating mothers, parents, those with comorbidities and other priority groups of seafarers, auto rickshaw, motorcycle and taxi drivers. Borkar said vaccination centres don’t have a limit for the day and can vaccinate according to their capacity. “They will inform people in the beginning itself how many persons they will be able to vaccinate,” he said. A vaccination site with a single vaccinator can immunise up to 200 beneficiaries a day, although 100 are recommended to avoid fatigue. Several sites have more than one vaccinator and are gearing up for Sunday. However, centres have to also take into consideration the space available in the observation area where beneficiaries are made to wait for half an hour after vaccination. Should there be a low turnout of less than 100 persons at certain vaccination centres, the government will consider merging the centres after some days to avoid wastage of resources, including vaccines. Centres have also been told to reduce wastage of vaccines and are referring persons to other neighbouring centres where the last vial for the day has already been opened up. A vial once opened must be discarded within four hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-above-18-years-can-walk-into-any-of-200-vax-centres-for-jabs-today/articleshow/83470408.cms||---
---||Patna||SDRF gears up to fight floods in Bhagalpur||BHAGALPUR: The Bhagalpur district unit of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) conducted a mock drill on Saturday to check its preparedness for the likely floods. The theme of the mock drill was ‘Hain Taiyaar Hum (we are prepared)’. The SDRF has also readied its inflatable rubber rescue boats, outboard motors and life jackets to meet any eventuality. Company commander of district unit of SDRF, Ganesh Jee Ojha, said 35 members of the force, including three officers in the rank of sub-inspector from Army and Navy, and 31 trained jawans and divers have been geared up to conduct relief and rescue operations in case of floods. “We have readied 18 inflatable rubber rescue boats. Our jurisdiction is vast and includes areas under Banka, Munger, Lakhisarai and Sheikhpura districts besides Naugachia police district,” Ojha said. The SDRF personnel, after making surveys of the river embankments, suggested the locals to keep emergency usable articles like torch, spare batteries, strong ropes, matchboxes, candles, dried food items, medicines, waterproof bags, polythene, strong ropes and radio ready. “People should not worry at all as we are there to help them,” Ojha said. Meanwhile, Bhagalpur DM Subrat Kumar Sen visited several flood-prone zones in the district and directed the sub-divisional and block officials to get ready for the likely floods as the monsoon has already entered the state. Sen also reviewed the past incidences of floods in the district and gave necessary instructions to district officials. Dr Birendra Kumar, a weather scientist at Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), said monsoon has entered Bihar and Bhagalpur in particular from northern Kosi and southern regions. “Smart and heavy rainfall is expected in the next few days, which may lead to rise in water levels in the Ganga and Kosi,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sdrf-gears-up-to-fight-floods-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/83467655.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Mumbai||To recover from Covid, RWITC may name its structures after sponsors||MUMBAI: As Covid-19 has added to its financial miseries, the Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) is mulling over selling name rights for the various structures at its racecourses in Mumbai and Pune. These structures may be stands, enclosures and even gates, if the club so decides. Committee members of the premier racing club in the country had approached its biggest patron, vaccine baron Dr Cyrus Poonawalla, for financial help and proposed to rename a few RWITC structures, but he declined to avoid political controversy. In a letter dated June 10, Dr Poonawalla suggested to the committee members that they pursue the naming option relentlessly and call an EOGM (extra-ordinary general meeting) to take the club members’ mandate for it. He wants the club to invite corporate bids too. “We were waiting to hear from Dr Poonawalla,” RWITC chairman Zavaray Poonawalla, who is also one of the leading breeders in the country, said on Saturday. “Now we will immediately start formulating and working on other plans. We are planning an EOGM within the next two months.” About financial help sought by the RWITC, Dr Poonawalla in his letter suggested that the club should approach some of its multi-millionaire members and persuade them to contribute generously to help the club tide over the financial crisis. “After assessing financial contributions made by all, I will decide how much I should contribute because I am more inclined to help the underprivileged in India and globally,” Dr Poonawalla said in his letter. RWITC chairman Zavaray Poonawalla said the club will soon approach its members to request them for contributions. “Committee members have no plans in place and I am afraid that any money contributed will be squandered away,” Shiven Surendranath, president of the Western India Race Horse Owners’ Association, said. With curtailed racing activities in the past year, RWITC has suffered losses. The Covid-19 facility that had been built at its premises had added to its financial woes — proximity to the facility had forced well-known restaurants Gallops and Tote On Turf to close down, and there are no takers even today for the turf club lawns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-recover-from-covid-rwitc-may-name-its-structures-after-sponsors/articleshow/83472610.cms||Shailendra Awasthi
---||Hyderabad||Telangana loses out on crime rate, gender equality||HYDERABAD: The state outperformed most in terms of sanitation goals but fell behind in curbing violence against children & women. Telangana might have succeeded in supplying clean water and energy to more households in 20220-21, but it failed to rein in crime against children and women, or address gender disparity. According to the latest Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index report released by Niti Aayog, the state displayed worrying trends in areas – particularly those revolving around peace, justice and strong institutions (targets under SDG 16). It witnessed a rise in the number of murders per one lakh population – from 2.17 in 2019-2020 to 2.3 in 2020-2021 – and also registered a higher number of cognizable crimes against children. This touched 37.3 in 2020-2021, as against 32.1 the previous year. Other findings: Rise in crime against women (SDG 5: gender equality) and a three per cent drop in women’s representation in the assembly. P Sandhya, national convener of the Progressive Organization for Women (POW) said violence against women has been on the rise across the country, over the last few years, and Telangana is no exception. “The same trend is reflected here also,” she said adding, “The SDG index clearly tells us that our journey towards equality will be much longer, both in country and the state.” But despite these negatives and loopholes in certain areas, many feel that the state has managed to fare well, overall. In fact, Janga Manohar Rao, retired professor from the University of Hyderabad pointed out how Telangana has registered impressive scores in economy and infrastructure related SDGs – crucial indicators of growth for any state. “Immediately after the bifurcation of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, visible signs of faster growth were seen in the state like in the case of GDP and agriculture growth. The state government has also been spending on welfare measures. That has considerably helped in improving the overall performance of the state in reaching the targets identified under SDGs,” he told TOI. He added: “The functioning of sub-parameters will also improve with time. There is no chance of any further decline.” For now though, Telangana’s health and well-being (SDG 3) quotient remains a concern with its health staff availability dropping to 10 in 2020-2021 from 11 in 2019-2020. Experts say that this needs to be fixed soon, especially with indications of a third Covid-19 wave lurking in the background. Experts are also called for immediate attention to the drop in percentage of schools with separate toilet facilities for girls in Telangana’s rural areas -- from 99.89 to 98.39 this year. Meanwhile, even as India recorded an overall score of 66 points in achieving targets under the 17 parameters of SDG this year, Telangana was counted among the front runner states with an overall score of 69. And despite a slip in rank – from third to sixth -- its latest score is two points higher than 2019-2020's 67.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-loses-out-on-crime-rate-gender-equality/articleshow/83469713.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The 19-year-old girl who ended life after being raped was a budding kabaddi player who had played in two national inter-school tournaments. But last year she wasn’t picked up in the selection trials for the national juniors tournament. “She appeared in the selection kabaddi matches but her fitness wasn’t up to the mark. Also, she had felt dizzy a couple of times during the trials. When she was asked about the reason, she said that she wasn’t in a good state after her mother had died,” said Jagdish Chavan, a former Kabaddi player who is now associated with Gujarat Kabaddi Association. “This year too she was picked up for the national juniors kabaddi camp but again couldn’t make it due to her fitness,” Chavan told TOI. “I had seen her play and I will say that she was very talented,” he added. The girl, who had been playing kabaddi since a very young age, used to be a raider on the field. “She used to say that she wasn’t in a good mental state as her mother had died. It also affected her fitness levels. She was a very good player and could have made it to the senior national team too. Her suicide is really an unfortunate incident,” said Vijay Vichare, former secretary, Baroda District Kabaddi Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/turmoil-in-personal-life-ended-her-kabaddi-dreams/articleshow/83468914.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Goa||Goa govt extends curfew till June 21, with some relaxations||PANAJI: The state government on Saturday extended the curfew till June 21, but allowed shops in panchayat and municipal markets to open from 7am to 3pm. The government has also allowed marriages with up to 50 persons, but only with prior permission. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who made the announcement on Twitter, said that the detailed order of the state-level curfew would be issued by both district collectors. Following the first imposition of the curfew last month, daily Covid cases, as well as the positivity rate, have steadily dropped. The government’s decision on Saturday is the third extension of the curfew. The first curfew was imposed on May 9 after a lot of reluctance even as the state grappled with an unprecedented surge in new Covid cases. A senior official said that the relaxations have been allowed keeping in mind economic activities. He said that if the curfew is lifted in one go, people would come out in large numbers and contribute to another Covid spread. Recently, state government departments began functioning at full capacity. Sawant had earlier said that the state would start the process of “unlock” after June 15. He had also pointed out that the state can only think of restarting tourism “after vaccinating the (eligible) population in the state”. ‘Marriage functions with 50 persons only’All persons above 18 years of age are advised to get themselves vaccinated at the nearby vaccination centre,” he said. “The government has decided to extend the State Level Curfew till 7 am, June 21, 2021. Shops, including in Panchayat and Municipal markets, may open between 7 am to 3 pm. Marriage function upto 50 persons has been permitted with the permission,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-extends-curfew-till-jun-21-with-some-relaxations/articleshow/83470434.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Capt, Sisodia in war of words on govt schools||New Delhi/Chandigarh: Raising objections against a report released by the central government that credited the Punjab government for hosting the best government schools in the country, deputy CM Manish Sisodia in a press conference claimed that it was an outcome of good relations between PM Narendra Modi and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh before the upcoming Punjab elections in 2022. Sisodia stated that crediting the Punjab government with having the best government schools in the country at a time when Punjab had seen the closure of more than 800 schools was a farce. Schools there are not up to the mark and some of them are functioning as alcohol factories, he claimed. “It is crystal clear that Captain Amarinder Singh has the blessings of Modi and the central government for the upcoming elections and we can consider this report as a gift to Singh,” Sisodia said. Dubbing Sisodia’s allegation as “atrocious”, Amarinder termed it a clear case of AAP crying foul in the face of its imminent wipe-out from Punjab in the 2022 assembly polls. He said the AAP leadership was so obsessed with electoral politics it saw poll conspiracies even in something as basic as school education. “Come to Punjab and I will show you around our schools,” said Singh. “Your political dialogues cannot undermine this success,” he said, terming Sisodia’s comments as an obvious case of “sour grapes” since Delhi-NCR had scored a poor 6th ranking in the list. Sisodia said quality education and learning had become a joke in Punjab government schools. “The Centre has released this report to hide the inadequacies in quality education of Punjab. In the last three-four years, almost 800 government schools have shut down in Punjab, and have been given to NGOs or other institutions to function. Many children had to bear the brunt and parents had to transfer their children to private schools. In fact, a few government schools in Punjab were found to be hosting alcohol factories on their premises,” the deputy CM said. He said in a few days, the Centre would release another report claiming that Punjab government hospitals were the best in the country. Expressing shock at the AAP leader’s attempt to give a political colour to the excellent outcomes of the hard work and commitment of thousands of school teachers, administrator and education officials, Amarinder said it was evident that Kejriwal’s party was used to seeing everything from the telescope of politics. Little wonder then that Delhi continued to be deprived of even basic amenities like education, health and safe drinking water even after six years of Kejriwal rule, he quipped. Pointing to the sad and sorry spectacle of people gasping for breath at the peak of the second surge of Covid in Delhi, Amarinder said the much-touted Kejriwal model of governance was nothing but a hype created by the media, which was benefitting from the massive advertising budgets of the AAP government. From the highly publicised Mohalla clinics to the school education system, the entire model of the Delhi government had been thoroughly exposed for nothing more than a hollow claim being perpetuated by AAP’s media and social media machinery, he said. Kejriwal was so busy promoting his image that he seemed to have forgotten to make any investments on the ground, said Amarinder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-sisodia-in-war-of-words-on-govt-schools/articleshow/83470438.cms||---

An internal scrutiny found that the decisions of the Goa investment promotion board between October 2016 and May 2017 did not have legal standing as the term of the board had lapsed. After industry officials were recently informed of the glaring lapse, which put all clearances granted by the IPB during that period under a cloud, the government has quickly moved to rectify the error. On May 28, the department of industries issued an order extending the term of the then IPB board for a period of five months with retrospective effect. Industries under secretary Amalia Pinto, through a notification, said that the government has reappointed industrialists Atul Pai Kane, Shekhar Sardesai and Nitin Kuncolikar as members of the board for the period from October 2016 to May 2017. The period in question is the transition time from the Laxmikant Parsekar government to the term of Manohar Parrikar, who was sworn in as chief minister on March 14. On May 6, Parrikar reconstituted the IPB board and replaced Kunkolienkar and Kane with other industry representatives. “The decisions taken by the board would not be valid so a notification has been taken out now,” a source said. The board had met on December 21, 2016, under the chairmanship of then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, where 15 investment proposals were given the nod, including GTDC’s Panaji to Reis Magos ropeway project. The notification does not impact the term of the current board members of the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-notifies-extension-of-ipb-after-forgetting-to-do-so-four-years-ago/articleshow/83470427.cms||Newton Sequeira

In the diamond industry, all traders and manufacturers are following the 50% staff guideline, said Nanu Vekariya, president of Surat Diamond Association. “Some 1,100 traders have opened the shops but we ensure that only 2-3 customers are allowed inside a shop at any given time,” said Mahesh Pandya, president, Lakhajiraj Traders Association, Rajkot.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Past deaths not factored in, will affect overall rate||MUMBAI: As Maharashtra’s various districts witnessed different peaks during the second wave of Covid-19, the case fatality rate (CFR) is higher in June, suggesting that the state is still not completely out of danger. “Districts like Satara, Kolhapur and Ratnagiri are now adding higher deaths than Mumbai. Cases in these districts started surging later, so deaths are yet to stabilise,” said a senior official. Officials said they expect deaths to fall significantly too in the next two weeks as critical cases in the state are on the decline. Experts said while CFR is usually considered over a period of time, CFR over a 10-day period too shows an increasing or decreasing trend. This calculation does not include the large number of deaths that have been added to the cumulative toll as part of the data reconciliation exercise as there is no clarity regarding the period in which those deaths have occurred. The reconciliation process will affect the overall CFR. Since May 17, the state has added over 13,000 deaths to the toll as part of the reconciliation process. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu from the Public Health Foundation of India said that adding five-digit numbers to the toll would definitely change the cumulative death rate. Many corporations and states have the tendency to add “old” deaths after the peak (of an epidemic or pandemic) is over. “But deaths cannot be hidden. Bihar was by court intervention required to carry out a data reconciliation exercise. Every state needs to do it,” he said. National Health Mission commissioner N Ramaswami said the death data reconciliation exercise would not impact the state’s cumulative death rate, which hovers between 1.7% and 1.8% at present. The state has declared over 1.06 lakh deaths so far, and adding another 10% wouldn’t change anything. “We are being transparent in data gathering and presentation so that we have the entire picture,” he said. Planning for the third wave, which many experts said is inevitable, would be more effective if there is appropriate transparency about the second wave. Maharashtra’s cumulative CFR is around 1.84%, which is higher than the national average of 1.25%. Although there are three more states like Punjab, Uttarakhand and Nagaland who have a higher CFR than Maharashtra, in absolute numbers the deaths reported by these states are much lower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/past-deaths-not-factored-in-will-affect-overall-rate/articleshow/83470436.cms||Bhavika Jain

The court had declared as void transfer of lease of government land. This “fraudulent act” caused a loss of Rs 4.25 crore to the government exchequer, said lekhpal Satyendra Prakash Sharma after conducting a probe. A notice would be served on the director. Lekhpal Sharma brought the matter to the notice of the Rampur DM, who ordered registration of an FIR. The FIR was registered at Civil Lines police station under IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of IPC and provisions of the Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, based on the lekhpal’s complaint. Satyendra said, “The company director had leased the land to another company for Rs 2 lakh per month though not authorized to do so following a high court order declaring as void transfer of the lease of government land to another company in 2003. But the company continued to misuse government property.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/company-director-booked-for-govt-land-fraud-in-rampur/articleshow/83468177.cms||---

The Union minister said the Centre would examine the request of the Telangana government. Harish Rao made the request during the 44th GST Council meeting held on Saturday in which chief secretary Somesh Kumar also took part. “Due to Covid-19 second wave and lockdown, the state had lost Rs 4,100 crore in May. If the FRMB limit is increased, it would help improve the economic activity,” Harish Rao said. He also urged the Centre to supply more doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/harish-urges-centre-to-raise-frbm-limit/articleshow/83470444.cms||---

The statement was sent to the HC registrar on June 10 via a written covering letter through lawyers Parinam Law. It sought permission to make his statement in a criminal writ petition by lawyer Datta Mane for directions to the state government to grant him Z plus security, citing news reports on alleged threats to him for additional Covishield vaccines. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar was hearing the matter, where advocate Pradeep Havnur for Mane, had sought security, saying SII’s vaccines are life-saving. The petition did not come up for hearing on June 10 due to paucity of time. On Friday, it was disposed of. The order is yet to be uploaded. In its June 1 order, the HC bench of Justices Shinde and Abay Ahuja said it was furnished with a police report dated June 1, which stated that pursuant to the petition, a request for Z category security for Poonawalla was made, and he was provided with Y category security, consisting of CRPF jawans, in addition to two police constables provided by the police commissioner, Pune. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare had submitted then that any request for Z category security could be considered after Poonawalla returns from England. He had sought time to take further instructions after the HC, during the hearing, requested him to “talk to the highest state functionary in the home department… may be the home minister too”, and to make a statement on June 10 on how many personnel were detailed for Poonawalla’s security cover. The matter had been thus adjourned to June 10. “Poonawalla is doing such a great job and playing a substantial role by providing crores of vaccines to the nation,’’ the bench had remarked during the June 1 hearing. On Friday, Thakare submitted, on instructions from the home department, that on Poonawalla’s return to India, if he made any request for security, it would be adequately provided. The HC said it declined to entertain the petition, then observed that he had not asked for security yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-never-asked-for-z-plus-security-adar-poonawalla-tells-high-court/articleshow/83472623.cms||Swati Deshpande

The owner of the rented house called the police after foul odour began emanating from the accommodation, which was locked. On reaching the site, police broke opened the house and found the decomposed body of the woman on the bed. Anjuna PI Suraj Gawas said that the deceased, who was staying at the rented house with Shekhappa, was hit on the head with a cricket bat on Wednesday night. After inquiring with the neighbours and the house owner, police found that Shekhappa had not been seen since Wednesday. A complaint was filed against the accused by Hemappa, 29, the deceased’s elder brother who stays in Baga. Based on the complaint, police registered a murder case and began an investigation. A team of Anjuna police was consequently dispatched to Gadag in Karnataka, where Shekhappa was arrested with the help of Gadag rural police. The Karnataka native’s family had moved to Goa nearly 15 years ago in search of employment. While Shekhappa was unemployed, Anasuya was working as a domestic help. Police said that the two often quarrelled over money. The body was handed over to the family after a post mortem was conducted at Goa Medical College and Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktaka-man-held-after-sister-found-dead-at-rented-room-in-nagoa/articleshow/83471528.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa CM intervened, cleared power works: Nilesh Cabral||PANAJI: Days after expressing his frustration with the finance department for not clearing power works in the state, power minister Nilesh Cabral told TOI that chief minister Pramod Sawant — who holds the finance portfolio — had now got around 14 work proposals cleared. Around eight of the works cleared by finance department are underground cabling projects, the delay in sanctioning of which had triggered Cabral. “Around five to six proposals have been cleared by the works board and seven-eight proposals have been cleared by the expenditure finance committee,” he said. With finance approvals, we will be able to tender the works soon. At least eight of these approved works are of underground cabling in different parts of the state,” Cabral told TOI. Cabral had said on June 8 that he would request the chief minister for a joint meeting with finance department officials. But Cabral told TOI that the CM has now assured him of his intervention, and promised that a joint meeting would not be necessary to get the stuck power department files cleared. “I conveyed it to the CM and he said he has intervened, and other files will also be cleared soon. He said he will take it up with the finance department and a meeting need not be required,” said Cabral. Earlier this week, Cabral’s outburst against the finance department, headed by Sawant, had come close on the heels of the CM rejecting the power and law minister’s proposal to provide marriage counselling to couples in Goa to bring down the divorce rate. Cabral lashed out against the finance department, after being asked by mediapersons about the status of the long-pending underground cabling works in the state. Cabral had said that the finance department had been returning most of the power department files with a remark that a full-fledged state budget had not yet been passed. This is hindering work of underground cabling in the state, he had said. “I am going to ask CM whether I should work or sit at home. Files are being sent back by the finance department with a note that the proposal should be sent after the budget, but no one knows when the complete budget will be passed. After the budget is passed, the finance department will send another circular curtailing expenditure. I will ask the CM how works like underground cabling are to be taken up,” Cabral had said, adding that he felt ashamed to give false assurances on underground cabling works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-intervened-cleared-power-works-cabral/articleshow/83470443.cms||---

Samir Kakkad, one of the organizers of the event, said that they got an overwhelming response. “We had made representation to the city authorities to allow us to organize the event. The primary reason was lack of access to several other vaccination centres and difficulty they faced in getting themselves registered.

---||Hyderabad||Records of 2,100 properties missing, says Waqf board to Telangana high court||HYDERABAD: Has the Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB) lost the records of 2,186 waqf properties which have been encroached? The waqf board itself made this startling admission before the high court, which sought a detailed affidavit on the goingson in the board by August 12. The judges, who were seeking details of efforts made by the board to reclaim its properties, were shocked to learn about the state of affairs in the TSWB. The admission belies the waqf board’s earlier claims in the court that it has been putting all efforts to protect the 2,186 encroached waqf properties. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a batch of PILs filed by former chairman of the state minorities commission Abid Rasool Khan and social activist Mohammed Ilyas, who were seeking retrieval of the waqf properties, particularly graveyards, from the clutches of the encroachers. The board, however, has identified and reconstructed records pertaining to 85 properties and sent fresh eviction notices. Counsel Abu Akram, representing the waqf board, said: “We have issued fresh eviction notices in 85 cases involving 85 acres and cancelled 135 sale deeds registered on these 85 acres.” Appearing for the board, senior counsel DV Sitarama Murthy along with Akram furnished a report prepared by the CEO of the TSWB. According to the waqf board CEO, after the bifurcation of the state in 2014 and formation of the TSWB, they found that the records pertaining to a lot of waqf properties had gone missing. “The records pertaining to the identified encroachments (2,186) and subsequent eviction notices could not be traced till now. Moreover, all the previous eviction notices have now become useless as there is no corresponding record with the board,” he said. Also, certain provisions of Wakf Act were amended in 2013. “This amendment has rendered eviction notices issued under old Act redundant,” he said. Shocked by the revelations made by the wakf board CEO, the judges verified with the board advocates on the status of formation of a special task force to reclaim the waqf properties. They replied they had requested the state police boss to constitute a task force. “A DSP rank officer was allotted for the purpose and he was attached to office of the waqf board CEO. We are issuing fresh eviction notices under the new Act in cases where record is available or could be reconstructed,” the lawyers said. They further said, “In the melee that followed the bifurcation of the state, we lost all the records. We are in the process of reconstructing the records with the available material.” Akram also narrated the details of litigation on the properties in district courts, waqf tribunal, high court and the Supreme Court. The effort in identifying the encroached properties and issuing eviction notices to 2,186 encroachers, too was not a recent effort. It dates back to a period prior to November 2013, the board said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/records-of-2-1k-properties-missing-waqf-board-to-hc/articleshow/83470455.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

After the meeting, general secretary, SAD (S) Karnail Singh Peermohammad said, “For now, the party leadership has decided that SAD (S) well-wishers who are keen that the party enter into an alliance with AAP before the 2022 assembly elections will explore possibilities of a political partnership with the party at their own level but not at the party level.” However, sources said that SAD (S) did not get a desirable response from AAP. When asked why SAD (S) couldn’t forge an alliance with BSP, Peermohammd said there were “certain issues” on which they refused to compromise. He did not elaborate on the said issues. Sources said that in the past, SAD (S) president Dhindsa and other senior leaders of the party held several rounds of meetings with BSP’s Rajya Sabha member Satish Sharma and state president Jasbir Singh Garhi. SAD (S) patron Ranjit Singh Brahampura said they would want to have an alliance with AAP to form a strong front in Punjab ahead of the assembly elections. However, he said that the BSP leadership had put forth several conditions which were not acceptable to them. “Our aim is to give clean governance to people of Punjab and a strong alternative for political parties including Congress, SAD(B) and BJP,” he said. Meanwhile, Peermohammad said the party would announce its remaining organisational structure on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/breakaway-sad-factions-look-to-aap/articleshow/83470475.cms||Yudhvir Rana

In April, when the number of Covid-19 cases was consistently rising, gated communities in many parts of the city were identified as hotspots by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Covid-19 protection teams constituted in many societies in addition to the statewide lockdown brought the number of Covid-19 down in three months. “We had 83 cases in 40 odd apartments when the second wave was at its peak. Now, we have only one active case. This happened due to concentrated efforts taken up by us to ensure that all common facilities were closed, regular sanitation and initiatives by Golden Star Facility Services such as door step delivery of essential supplies to the affected families, and the like,” said Gade Srinivas, president of Aparna CyberZon Apartment Owners Welfare Society. Not just that, many ramped up vaccination drives within their premises keeping the virus at bay. At Rajapushpa Atria, which now has zero active cases, the residents welfare association has held multiple vaccination camps. “So far, we have vaccinated more than 1,000 residents, including those falling in 18+ category, in the last three months. Even on Saturday, we are conducting a vaccination camp for all our residents within our society in association with a private hospital in Gachibowli,” Mithilesh Kumar Singh, VP, Rajapushpa Atria Owners Welfare Association, Kokapet. At Srila Park Pride, a community of 330 houses in Miyapur, periodic bleaching and sodium chloride spray and closure of all parks and open areas for three months contained the spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gated-communities-show-the-way-in-defeating-pandemic/articleshow/83470467.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Chronic spots go down under for second time in just 4 days||MUMBAI: Heavy rain on Saturday morning saw several low-lying areas in Mumbai go down under again – the second time in just four days after the city saw the arrival of monsoon with robust showers on June 9. Chronic spots like Gandhi Market at King’s Circle, Bandra National College Road, Sion Road No. 24 and Gazdhar Bandh in Santacruz were waterlogged, owing to which traffic was slow-moving or had to be diverted. Central Railway had to suspend train services between Dadar-Kurla due to waterlogging near Sion from 12:15 pm. Fast services resumed at 12.50 pm and slow corridor services at 1.15 pm. 70 BEST bus routes were diverted due to waterlogging at 17 locations, and buses broke down at a few places. At Gandhi Market, local resident Nikhil Desai said that despite there being no high tide, water accumulated on the arterial road on Saturday morning. “Earlier, the BMC would at least place dewatering pumps at the location, but now these aren’t kept. Also, BMC says every time that water is accumulated owing to high tide, but this time the high tide warning was for 1.32 pm, whereas waterlogging took place much earlier,” Desai said. BMC officials however said they close the floodgates a little prior to the high tide to stop seawater from entering the city. At Gazdhar Bandh scheme, there was knee-deep water, making it difficult for vehicles to navigate. Gautam Rao of Gazdhar Scheme Residents Trust (GSRT) said, “The Gazdhar Bandh pumping station in Santacruz failed to give any relief to citizens. It is only getting worse. Rainwater started accumulating from the morning and had not receded even post noon. The main avenue and north avenue were all under water. This was the same scene as on June 9.” BJP corporator Swapna Mhatre said the monsoon arrived earlier than it does every year. “Many pre-monsoon works which already started late this year owing to Covid were not completed. The BMC should not wait till just a few months prior to the monsoon to start desilting and tree-trimming works. Instead, these works should be done through the year,” Mhatre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chronic-spots-go-down-under-for-second-time-in-just-4-days/articleshow/83471571.cms||Richa Pinto

Speaking to journalists on his arrival at Nagpur airport on Saturday, Fadnavis said, “Regardless of what strategy is put into motion, only Modi will come to power in 2024.” Regarding the meet between Kishor and Pawar, the former chief minister said, “There is no ban on people meeting each other, so that’s not an issue. People from ruling and opposition parties keep strategising. All I am saying is that today Modi is in power and even in 2024, he will continue.” Asked about Sena MP Rahul Shevale’s comment that the Centre’s delay in granting permission for projects led to waterlogging in parts of Mumbai, Fadnavis said, “Blaming the central government is a routine for them...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fadnavis-plays-down-pawar-kishor-meet/articleshow/83472675.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Now, dabbawalas to cook your lunch and deliver||Sexagenarian Yamnaji Ghule is a worried man. The second generation dabbawala is not sure what to make of his future emerging from a pandemic that dished out a blow to his decades-old vocation of delivering cooked lunches to Mumbai’s officegoers. The world of lunchbox carriers has been a resilient lot — constantly reinventing itself —English lessons, computer literacy, women entering the all-male bastion. Now, the modern dabbawala is in for yet another change: they will no longer just be dropping off lunch, but cooking too if asked. They will rustle up a 7-day rotating menu of home-style lunches in a 1,000sqft “cloud kitchen” at Saki Naka, aimed at time-starved millennials. “Some of our dabbawalas and their wives are currently being trained by an F&B expert and we should be launching our service by mid-June,” said Ritesh Andre, 25, a 4th-generation dabbawala with an MBA degree. Mumbai’s 130-year-old dabba distribution fleet has been a legendary workforce of 5,000 tiffin carriers like Ghule — picking up food from home cooks and delivering to two lakh office-goers on their cycles and by local trains. “We’ve worked through the worst situations...rains, floods, terror attacks, but never seen anything like this before. My team of seven dabbawalas used to make around 20 deliveries in a day between Mahim-Worli-Sion but now, not more than four,” said the veteran tiffinwala who had returned to his village Rajgurunagar in the Khed taluka of Pune to farm for his survival for the first eight months of Covid. “I came back to Mumbai in January when deliveries restarted but it has stopped again. I’ll have to wait and watch. I’ve been doing this for more than 40 years, it’s the only work I know,” he frets. As Covid changed culinary culture, delivering hot lunches that would fetch dabbawalas Rs 14,000 to 20,000 monthly was suddenly down to nil. Following lockdown, around 3,000 dabbawalas—mostly from Pune, Junnar, Ambegaon, Mulshi, and other parts of Maharashtra—retreated to hometowns. “When offices started opening up last June, we were able to restart our services but with 300-400 dabbawalas. Now in the second lockdown, there’s work for only 100-150,” explained Ulhas Shantaram Muke, president of the Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust. Struggling to resume services, they found a new breed of tiffin takers—Covid care facilities, people in home quarantine, isolation centres and healthcare workers in hospitals. Even as some took to moonlighting as watchmen or tied up with farmers to deliver fresh produce, and found a helping hand from restaurateurs like Riyaaz Amlani who teamed up with them to tide over losses, it was not enough to sustain. Mumbai’s dabbawalas saw their business plunge by nearly 90% with most offices in Mumbai still closed. But there is no turning back the wheel and the tiffin carriers will no longer just be dropping off lunch boxes as they kick off the next era with a “cloud kitchen”. “We’re creating a website where people can directly place their orders. One can choose between monthly or annual subscriptions and we’re also introducing online money transfer to make payments easier. Dabba services have always depended on cash transactions and they faced financial difficulties during the pandemic,” says Andre. “The idea is to use their unique sorting skills to diversify, generate employment, bring stability and pride in what is India’s oldest food delivery chain,” explains Andre pointing at their intrepid new avatar which will allow people to choose between mini-meals (two rotis and two sabjis) and regular meals (two rotis, two sabjis, a portion of rice and dal, pickle, papad and salad) — which dabbawalas will prepare, pack and deliver from Dahisar to Churchgate and Ghatkopar to CSMT in specially designed two-tier and four-tier dabbas — in a fresh twist to their colour-alphabetic-numeric code to identify where to deliver the stainless steel dabbas every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-mumbai-dabbawalas-to-cook-your-lunch-and-deliver/articleshow/83471654.cms||Mohua Das
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 32 leopards died or went missing in nine years from Jhalana, says study||JAIPUR: Not just tigers, leopards in the state are under threat too as many have died or have gone missing mysteriously from Jhalana Reserve Forest, where ‘Project Leopard’, a first-of-its-kind, was launched. A recent study ‘Jhalana Leopard Family Tree, 2012-2021’ by the member of Leopard Monitoring Committee, Dhiraj Kapoor, has revealed 32 leopards have died or went missing from Jhalana in this duration. A worrisome figure that the research highlighted was that altogether 25 sub-adults and cubs died or disappeared from the region, which once roamed in the 20 sq km area. Kapoor said, “Only three leopard deaths can be attributed to old age. Deaths of cubs and sub-adults are either related to territorial fights, infanticide, mating rights or other unknown causes. However, no traces were recorded.” Even as there is considerable joy due to the increase in leopard population, the experts are sounding a word of caution as the area is bursting at the seams. At present, 36 leopards are living in a 20 sq km area. The report reads, “The density of leopards is too high for an urban jungle. With new cubs being regularly born the sub-adults get pushed out. In search of territory, these wild cats venture out and go missing or get killed in territorial fights.” With the leopard population on an upward trajectory, there is an expected spillover to the different adjoining areas of the reserve. The researchers are apprehensive that these young leopards may go missing again. “There are 15 leopards that are between 12 months and 24 months of age, which will soon venture out for new territories and disappear in the process. It is imperative that the forest department addresses this problem of plenty as soon as possible to save these leopards from going missing,” reads the report. To provide them a safe habitat, the department should now consider developing safe habitat for leopards under project leopard. “Rajasthan has luckily got a long stretch of Aravali hill ranges, which is ideal habitat for leopards. Other areas should be developed to trans-locate the leopards and tigers,” said an expert. Agreeing to the point, a senior official said, “The big cat population is higher than its carrying capacity. Ideally, one male leopard requires at least 5 sq km area. The department is considering on developing surrounding forest areas including Galta, which is above 700 hectare in size.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/32-leopards-died-or-went-missing-in-nine-years-from-jhalana-study/articleshow/83470466.cms||---

He had given up his TRS membership a few days back. Now political parties will focus on the candidates to be fielded in the . Rajender, who is set to join the BJP on June 14, will be in the race. Rajender, who was sacked from state cabinet on April 30 on allegations of encroaching on government land by a firm owned by his family members, paid tributes to Telangana martyrs at Gun Park, opposite Assembly and later submitted resignation to assembly secretary as speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy was not available in his office. Within two hours of his resignation, the speaker accepted his resignation and informed the Election Commission about the vacancy. Soon after stripping Rajender of his ministership, the TRS leadership had deployed senior leaders to see that none of the party leaders and local body elected members sail with the ex-minister. KCR also decided to replicate the ‘Nagarjuna Sagar’ bypoll strategy in Huzurabad. In the Sagar elections, TRS had adopted multi-pronged strategy where KCR took charge and prepared the poll plan. The CM visited the constituency much before the bypoll was notified and announced sops for the constituency. He addressed a second public meeting three days before the bypoll. The CM is expected to visit Huzurabad this monthend not only to announce developmental works but also to boost the morale of the local leaders. The party has not decided on the candidate yet. Though there were rumours that the former minister’s wife would contest from Huzurabad, BJP is most likely to field Rajender himself. Congress has not decided on a candidate and is not clear whether Kaushik Reddy will be fielded in this election too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-quits-assembly-state-set-for-another-bypoll-bout/articleshow/83470469.cms||Koride Mahesh

An audit, which had identified 74 blind spots in 2017, submitted its report to the JDA in 2020. Some of the vulnerable spots which need urgent attention are Apex Circle Chouraha, Jagatpura Balaji Road, Luniawas Bus Stand, Kanota Agra Road, Khole Ke Hanumanji Delhi Bypass Road and Sadva Road.However, no action has been taken, except a few places, told a traffic board member. The lack of action is costing the lives of the citizens who are meeting with accidents in these black spots. Similarly, a separate audit report on Sodala elevated report has been submitted in November 2020 along with solutions, but it was not even discussed at the JDA. The elevated road is also among the blind spots in Jaipur. The Traffic Control Board meeting was held in January 2021 to discuss the action plan for the road safety audits.“The decision was taken that work will be initiated soon as per the suggestions submitted by the experts. Thereafter, it never took off till date,” said a member of a board. Partially agreeing to the claims, Aminudin Azad, traffic engineering (JDA), claimed that they have assigned the work at all 74 blind spots in the city. “Due to pandemic, it has been delayed. The work at all spots will soon be completed,” said Khan.Neha Khullar, consultant, road safety cell, transport department, who was part of the road safety audits, said, “The spots remain vulnerable for accidents. I have not seen any spot identified by us corrected or repaired other than markings at some places.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/audit-identifies-74-blind-spots-in-city-but-jda-yet-to-act/articleshow/83470484.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Hotel owners request CM Rawat to remove restriction on RT-PCR -ve report for tourists||DEHRADUN: A delegation of Doon Valley Hotel and Restaurant Association met chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Saturday and sought his urgent intervention in reviving the sector from the difficult phase. They pointed out the hotels have operated for only three months in the last 15 months. To boost the sector, the hoteliers requested the CM to remove the restriction of RT-PCR on tourists and allow hotels to operate at 50% to 75% occupancy. They also appealed for a guarantee of "no lockdown policy" in the future and last minute orders to close banquet halls and restaurants in case of an increase in the number of Covid cases as it was an “expensive affair” to shut down such a large organisation with little or no prior warning . The delegation led by the organisation's president SP Kochar and secretary Mohamed Ilyas met CM Rawat and asked him for tourist-friendly Covid travel protocols in the state. The letter handed over to the CM by the hoteliers mentions that in 2019 a total of 3.92 crore visitors had come to the state and in 2020 the number dipped to 78.74 lakh leading to heavy losses to those involved with the hotel industry and tourism sector. They pointed out the hotel industry was on verge of collapse and was unable to sustain its employees. Besides removing RT-PCR restrictions, the association members have suggested that the first dose of Covid vaccine be made mandatory for visitors travelling to the state or to attend weddings and other events. They urged the government to give priority to hotel and restaurant staff in the vaccination drive. The hotel owners have asked for a single window system for broadcasting any news or regulation regarding the changes in the Covid travel protocols. The letter mentions, “It has been found that the industry and tourists have to rely on various news agencies who publish incorrect and incomplete information.” They also requested the government for a three-year retrospective tax exemption in House Tax from April 2020 to March 2024. Another suggestion includes that the fixed electricity charge be waived off for a period of two years starting from April 2020 barring the actual consumption be charged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hotel-owners-request-cm-rawat-to-remove-restriction-on-rt-pcr-ve-report-for-tourists/articleshow/83468322.cms||Kautilya Singh

The meeting discussed “the way forward for 2022 polls”, amid concerns of poor handling of Covid-19 crises and the results of the recent panchayat elections in the state. Party’s state mantri Anjula Singh Mahor said a total of 66 functionaries, including 19 districts in charge and presidents participated in the meeting. Source said senior functionaries urged office-bearers to take on the battle against Covid to the doorsteps of people by persuading them to get vaccinated as well as reach out to the families of those who have suffered from Covid. They suggested that arrangements be made for doctors to attend to those who need urgent medical care and for online consultations. MLAs, and MPs were to be prepared for the third wave of the pandemic by adopting and upgrading community and primary health centres in their respective areas. “Check drinking water facilities, furniture, and presence of doctors there,” the district presidents were told. The party functionaries also directed to focus on publicizing the state government’s achievements and policies. Sources said the party’s focus will also be on cornering maximum posts of chairman of zila panchayat across the state and the district presidents have been asked to do “all it takes” to achieve it. Party’s state unit secretary Vijay Shivhare, who was present at the meeting, said members have been helping people during the pandemic -- from providing free rations to the needy and helping the migrants in all possible ways. “We will follow the party’s instructions and continue our services for the welfare of people,” he said, adding that all organizational work must be completed by July 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/eye-on-22-polls-bjp-pitches-for-covid-care-to-win-over-public/articleshow/83466557.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Phones of MLAs being tapped, says Sachin Pilot supporter lawmaker||JAIPUR: Phone tapping charges have come back to haunt the Ashok Gehlot government. Congress MLA from Jaipur district’s Chaksu seat Ved Prakash Solanki, a vocal supporter of Sachin Pilot, on Saturday alleged that some legislators told him about their phones being tapped. Solanki, however, declined to name the MLAs who told this to him. He also had no idea who was tapping the phones and on whose orders. “I do not know if my phone is being tapped or not? I am also not aware if the state government is involved in phone tapping or not. But some legislators told me about their phones being recorded,” Solanki told TOI. Solanki said these MLAs used an App to learn that their phones were being tapped. The Chaksu MLA further claimed that some of these MLAs even informed the chief minister about their phone tapping fears but the latter laughed off the matter. Solanki said the same MLAs informed him that police and intelligence personnel were keeping a watch over them. “The MLAs also shared about how some government officials cautioned them against being trapped by the anti-corruption bureau,” said Solanki. He added, “I cannot understand why these MLAs are scared of speaking up openly.” On being asked if these MLAs belonged to the Sachin Pilot camp, Solanki replied, “They are Congress MLAs.” Congress chief whip in the assembly Mahesh Joshi reacted by saying, “These are baseless charges. A responsible person like an MLA should make a public statement after verifying things on proof.” Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, “This is a BJP and RSS ploy to divert public attention from the corruption charges against their members in the bribery deal connected with the city’s sanitation issues. RSS man was seen in the viral video in which Rs 20-cr bribery is being demanded from the sanitation company.” BJP state president Satish Poonia tweeted, “Today again a Congress MLA is saying that many MLAs say their phones are being tapped, spying is happening. Congress should tell who these MLAs are? The Congress is intimidating its own MLAs on the lines of ‘so jaa beta Gabbar aa jayega’ (dialogue from a Bollywood classic). Congress should tell when will Gabbar come?” Last July when Pilot and 18 Congress legislators rebelled against chief minister Gehlot, one of the accusations they levelled was about illegal phone tapping. The charges gained ground when audio clips of telephonic conversations allegedly between union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and two Congress legislators were shared by Gehlot’s officer on special duty (OSD) Lokesh Sharma. The audio clips were later handed over to Rajasthan police’s special operations group (SOG) to investigate charges that Shekhawat and some legislators were trying to topple an elected government through horse trading. SOG ultimately closed the case after a truce between Gehlot and Pilot mediated by Congress central leadership. Union minister Shekhawat recently lodged an FIR against Sharma in New Delhi in the same matter but the Delhi high court barred the police from acting against the accused till further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phones-of-mlas-being-tapped-says-pilot-supporter-lawmaker/articleshow/83469629.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Over 12 legislators met CM in last three days ahead of cabinet reshuffle||Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has begun consultations with legislators and party leaders for a cabinet rejig expected by June end or early July, Congress sources said on Saturday. Expecting cabinet reshuffle and political appointments in the coming days, over a dozen MLAs have met chief minister Gehlot in the past three days. Congress state president and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra quoted AICC general secretary in-charge Ajay Maken about the cabinet changes likely soon. “Reshuffle will happen in Rajasthan. As told by Ajay Maken Ji, a reshuffle will take place,” Dotasra told reporters in New Delhi. The party state chief was on his way to Uttarakhand for a condolence meeting of a Congress MLA’s mother. Dotasra dismissed speculations over former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot quitting the Congress. “Pilot is our politician and a strong senior leader of the Congress. There is no problem in Congress. Why are these questions being raised?” the Congress state president said. Revenue minister Harish Chaudhary, considered close to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and chief minister Gehlot, too reached Delhi on Saturday. Dotasra and Chaudhary reaching Delhi within hours after Pilot reached there on Friday were seen as connected with the party’s internal exercise to finally make some cabinet changes—a key demand of the disgruntled Congress MLAs who revolted against Gehlot last year. In Delhi, Pilot is expected to meet AICC general secretary K C Venugopal and Maken, who are members of the committee formed to resolve issues between him and chief minister Gehlot last year. Pilot and his loyalist MLAs have been expressing displeasure against the committee for sitting on their demands for the past 10 months. Pilot is likely to meet Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi with his grievances before returning to Jaipur. Some among the 19 rebel legislators, though, have now moved closer to Gehlot in the past couple of months. Former tourism minister Vishvendra Singh and MLA Bhanwar Lal Sharma are prominent among them. MLA Hemaram Choudhary, one of the rebel MLAs who sent his resignation by post and through email to assembly Speaker C P Joshi last month, has been denied appointment by the latter. Choudhary was earlier told to appear in person before the Speaker within seven days once the lockdown was over. When the MLA sought time from the Speaker, the assembly secretariat informed him that the state was still under ‘modified’ lockdown, so the meeting was not possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-12-legislators-met-cm-in-last-three-days-ahead-of-cabinet-reshuffle/articleshow/83469668.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The minister raised the demand in a meeting of the GST Council chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Dhariwal also asked the Centre to release the GST compensation amount to Rajasthan at the earliest. The GST Council had already exempted the Covid-related materials like oxygen and its equipment, ventilators, remdesivir and other essential medicines, Covid testing kits, pulse oximeter etc from the GST till August 31, 2021. But Dhariwal said since the pandemic is not going to end any time soon, it is necessary to extend the exemptions at least till March 31, 2022. Drawing attention to opinions of experts, he said the third wave of pandemic may come in September-October. Therefore, exemption should be extended till March 31, 2022, and, if needed, it should be continued even further, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/give-gst-relief-on-covid-items-till-march-22-says-dhariwal/articleshow/83470490.cms||---

However, it continued to add a large number of old deaths to the cumulative toll due to the ongoing reconciliation exercise for the 25th day in a row. The state added 10,697 cases and 360 fatalities on Saturday but added 1,606 old deaths, taking the total caseload to 58.9 lakh, and the state’s total toll touched 1,08,333. The state had added 12,989 deaths in the last 12 days, of which 9,229 deaths were added as part of the reconciliation exercise. The state health department had on Friday defended itself after widespread criticism of addition of old deaths and said that it was being transparent with data In Mumbai, with the relaxing of restrictions leading to more crowds on the roads, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has been able to carry out more rapid antigen tests at crowded places such as markets. The BMC update on Saturday said that 29,174 tests were conducted in a 24-hour period, leading to 749 detections. The number of deaths in the city continued to dip, with 18 deaths registered on Saturday and the city’s pandemic toll climbing to 15,097 so far. A BMC official said the BMC’s decision to allow Mumbai to stay with Level 3 restrictions is a reflection of the lack of confidence in the people’s ability to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour. “People have a tendency to not wear a mask or observe social distancing,” the official said. The test positivity continued below 3% for the sixth straight day. At the moment, the doubling rate of cases in the city is 633 days, and the overall growth rate of cases is down to 0.11%. At the state level, there are six districts which have a positivity rate of over 10%, and the weekly average case growth rate is 0.22% and the doubling rate is now up to 322 days. Meanwhile, at the state level, the rate of recovery rose to 95.5% and active cases dropped further to 1.5 lakh, of which 18,065 were in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/daily-toll-is-down-but-state-adds-1606-old-deaths-again/articleshow/83476341.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two identical cases of delayed homes, 2 different verdicts!||MUMBAI: MahaRERA members have given two different orders concerning similar complaints of home buyers in Emerald Isle-T7 project of L&T located at Kurla. In an order passed this January, MahaRERA member B D Kapadnis directed the promoter to pay interest to six home buyers for delayed possession, while in another order passed this month, MahaRERA chairman Ajoy Mehta denied interest to the buyer. In the latest MahaRERA order of this month, home buyer Neera Gupta, represented by advocate Anil D Souza, stated that possession of the apartment, purchased in 2016, was to be given on March 31, 2017, but was given only in June 2018 and sought directions to the promoter to pay interest for the delay. The promoter, represented by advocate Manish Gala, pointed out that the project completion was delayed due to mitigating circumstances and stated that the occupation certificate was obtained on April 27, 2018, before the complaint was filed. The promoter said that the buyer had taken possession on June 15, 2018 without caveat. Ajoy Mehta in his order observed that the promoter cannot be held liable to pay interest on delay, citing that the starting line of Section 18 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 clearly indicated that the provision shall apply only till the project is incomplete or the promoter is unable to give possession. Once construction is complete or possession given, the said provision ceases to operate. However, in the January order of MahaRERA, concerning six home buyers in the same project, member B D Kapadnis had directed the promoter to pay simple interest at 9% p.a. to the buyers. Kapadnis observed that section 88 of RERA provides that provisions of RERA shall be in addition to, not in derogation of the provisions of any other law. Section 89 of RERA provides that provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law. Kapadnis pointed out that section 55 of The Contract Act, which the promoter relied on, cannot be made applicable and cannot override section 18 of RERA. Kapadnis also stated that the right to claim interest for delayed possession has been conferred upon the home buyers by section 18 of RERA and it survives even after taking possession of the flats. Meanwhile, L&T has moved the Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal against the MahaRERA’s January order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-2-identical-cases-of-delayed-homes-2-different-verdicts/articleshow/83472692.cms||Sanjeev Devasia
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ex-beauty pageant winner who extorted over Rs 1 crore from trader||JAIPUR: A former beauty pageant winner arrested in a blackmailing case had allegedly extorted over Rs 1 crore from a businessman for car, flat and interior decor. Priyanka Choudhary (31) was crowned as ‘Mrs. Rajasthan’ at an event held in a city hotel in 2019. A native of Tonk district, she lived with her husband, a police constable, and two kids in a flat near Nirman Nagar. She was arrested on Friday evening. Shyam Nagar SHO Santra Meena said the businessman alleged that Priyanka extorted over 1 crore from him. “We are verifying to see if the amount reported by the businessman was indeed transferred into her account,” she told TOI. The complainant, a 50-year-old businessman who lives at Parshwanath Colony and runs a sprawling iron business, alleged in his FIR registered on June 3 that Priyanka was a family friend and they knew each other as both were natives of Tonk district. Her wife reportedly treated Priyanka as her sister. After meeting Priyanka and her husband in 2016, she moved to his Gautam Nagar located flat as a tenant for which a rent agreement was agreed upon. As the two families bonded, Priyanka cajoled the businessman to help her buy a flat in Nirman Nagar worth Rs 64lakh. The complainant claimed he was also compelled to spend Rs 14.59 lakh in furnishing the newly purchased flat with AC, furniture, etc. As time wore on, the cordial friendship soured in 2018, when Priyanka allegedly threatened to book him in a rape case if her demands were not met. The businessman alleged he was forced to deposit Rs 5 lakh and Rs 2,5 lakh into her bank account in December 2018. Another payment of Rs 8.45 lakh was made in March 2019, reportedly for a car, Rs 30 lakh for jewelry, along with other hefty payments for her different expenditures which included investment schemes, EMI, and school fees for her two kids. In April this year, Priyanka allegedly made a call to the businessman and asked him to help her buy a plot in Jaipur, worth several lakhs. An argument soon ensued. The businessman declined to stump up the cash and filed a complaint against her while seeking from senior police officials. After days of the investigation, Priyanka was arrested on Friday evening under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, the probe is also underway to examine the role of her husband. “The case is under investigation. Priyanka had also filed a case against the businessman on May 20 and alleged that he had tried to beat her up. We are examining it,” an official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ex-beauty-pageant-winner-who-extorted-over-rs-1cr-from-trader/articleshow/83470495.cms||---

However, it continued to add a large number of old deaths to the cumulative toll due to the ongoing reconciliation exercise for the 25th day in a row. The state added 10,697 cases and 360 fatalities on Saturday but added 1,606 old deaths, taking the total caseload to 58.9 lakh, and the state’s total toll touched 1,08,333. The state had added 12,989 deaths in the last 12 days, of which 9,229 deaths were added as part of the reconciliation exercise. The state health department had on Friday defended itself after widespread criticism of addition of old deaths and said that it was being transparent with data In Mumbai, with the relaxing of restrictions leading to more crowds on the roads, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has been able to carry out more rapid antigen tests at crowded places such as markets. The BMC update on Saturday said that 29,174 tests were conducted in a 24-hour period, leading to 749 detections. The number of deaths in the city continued to dip, with 18 deaths registered on Saturday and the city’s pandemic toll climbing to 15,097 so far. A BMC official said the BMC’s decision to allow Mumbai to stay with Level 3 restrictions is a reflection of the lack of confidence in the people’s ability to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour. “People have a tendency to not wear a mask or observe social distancing,” the official said. The test positivity continued below 3% for the sixth straight day. At the moment, the doubling rate of cases in the city is 633 days, and the overall growth rate of cases is down to 0.11%. At the state level, there are six districts which have a positivity rate of over 10%, and the weekly average case growth rate is 0.22% and the doubling rate is now up to 322 days. Meanwhile, at the state level, the rate of recovery rose to 95.5% and active cases dropped further to 1.5 lakh, of which 18,065 were in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/daily-toll-is-down-but-state-adds-1606-old-deaths-again/articleshow/83470570.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||India||Covid origin: ‘If nothing went wrong at Wuhan lab, then why the obfuscations?’||Under the cover of a Chhau mask, an interview with the nameless-faceless ‘The Seeker’ who has been searching for the true origins of Covid-19 begins almost like a blind date. Like everyone else, the 29-year-old’s lockdown days were about ‘watching movies, reading books and browsing the Internet’ until web surfing took on a whole new meaning when he found himself at the centre of DRASTIC, short for Decentralized Radical Autonomous Search Team Investigating Covid-19. During an interaction with Mohua Das, he reveals how he plumbed the depths of the internet to find evidence that has compelled the world to re-examine whether the virus had indeed leaked from Wuhan Institute of Virology’s (WIV) labYou don’t want to reveal your name but tell us a little about yourself.I am a 29-year-old Bengali boy in Bhubaneswar with a mix of architectural, entrepreneurial, filmmaking and teaching experience. A day in my life is mostly friends and family. I was in Delhi working on a passion project — audiobooks —but then Covid changed our plans, our project got shelved and I came back to my family home in Bhubaneswar. What made you believe that the lab leak theory was plausible?Like most people, my initial impression was that it was a natural zoonosis — that the virus jumped from bats to humans via a pangolin — in the Huanan wet market. For me, it was stumbling on a 2013 Masters thesis, which I think, along with the RaTG13 (a SARS-like betacoronavirus that infects the horseshoe bat) link that really blew this thing wide open. It was Luigi Warren’s (scientist who pioneered the mRNA technology and a prominent member of Drastic) Twitter thread where it all started. Luigi did a brilliant distillation of what was known, and unknown about the miners. That fired up my curiosity, and I started digging into the Chinese academic journals. How did you stumble upon the Chinese-language 2013 Masters and 2016 PhD theses, that took you inside the bat-filled mine shaft in Mojiang county, southern Yunnan where some miners had contracted a mystery disease in 2012?The first time I heard about the sick miners, I had a flash of insight: ‘Wait, everyone’s typing queries on google... Let me explore the Chinese academic publications and see if there are any skeletons in their closet’. I started keyword searching extensively in Chinese databases, and then one day, bang! I was led by an insatiable curiosity, patience, willingness and determination. And my knowledge of advanced search tricks came handy. Honestly, I was just trying to figure out this whole mystery behind the Mojiang miners, and I felt my skills with search engines could help shed some light about this mystery event. There is so much helpful, valuable digital information on the web, if people know what, where and how to find it. You compare your pursuit to a “stellar suspense thriller that starts with mysterious deaths that need to be solved”. Tell us about your digital investigations into this puzzle...Yeah, so like all puzzles, you need a piece to start with. Mine starts with a keyword and a determination to follow it wherever it leads. Usually I’d translate the keywords into Chinese, and plug the query into the search box using advanced search operators. If nothing comes up at the first attempt, I'd start tweaking or switching terms. If there are far too many, I'd narrow it down by using date constraints, or start filtering it by institutes, or search within a specific domain. Then I’d translate the results back to English, and start navigating all the results, which means spending hours going through countless pages. There’s no method, just madness. Every time there’s something that triggers my curiosity, I make my way to the search bar, play around with the keywords, and venture to the deep depths of the Internet to see if I can come up with anything. Sometimes you hit deadends, and sometimes you hit gold. Google translate is also known for its casualties...Well, the trick with Chinese characters is to remove all the line breaks. The Wuhan lab leak theory has opened up arguments, the likes of which one hasn’t seen since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Bhopal Gas Tragedy, and even man’s landing on the moon... How do you ensure that these 140-character investigations are not dismissed as a conspiracy theory?Well, there are people on the extreme ends who misconstrue our findings, but then it’s the Internet. I can’t speak for others, but if you ask me, conspiracies are not needed to explain a lab leak. The problem is, there was, and continues to be, a complete lack of transparency. WIV hasn’t yet shared the raw data, laboratory records, samples and specimens of its extensive collection of bat coronaviruses. They had one of the world's largest databases of bat coronaviruses, but the databases were taken offline. If they have nothing to hide, and if nothing has gone wrong, why not show it? What we suspect is clumsy handling and an accident, and lab accidents are a well-known phenomenon. To quote Richard Ebright: “an accident, by definition, cannot be a conspiracy”, so those who use the term "conspiracy" misunderstand the meaning of the words. I think the facts speak for themselves. Active research on the same lineage of SARS-like coronaviruses was taking place in the vicinity of ground zero of the outbreak, and investigating how SARS-like coronaviruses infect humans was one of their primary research directions, they got grants for it. There is evidence of obfuscations, omissions, and inconsistencies in the data provided by the WIV. Significant safety concerns were documented in their facility, and Chinese authorities have made every effort to deny access to evidence. I'm not saying the lab leak theory is one true holy theory, but that it is very clearly a plausible theory worth investigating. I believe science is about doubt and open-mindedness, and scientific approach should be without prejudices or preconceived ideas. What does it look like to you — a case of bioerror or bioterror?My overall impression is that they found a variant of the coronavirus that infected the Mojiang miners, or at least it led them to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2. With six human cases, the mine was their best bet to find a coronavirus whose spike protein was effective at attaching to receptors in human lung cells, i.e., a coronavirus that could potentially jump to humans. No wonder, they sampled the mine for at least four years (they didn’t reveal it until November last year). They got projects for testing them in animal models, cell lines, and for creating chimeras - combining different bat coronavirus backbones and spike proteins - to gain insight into its cross-species transmission mechanism, with the ultimate aim to create a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 could have been generated by such an experiment, and then due to a lapse in safety protocols, escaped from that lab. Or it could be something more mundane like sampled from mine, sequenced, isolated, and somehow spilled over from the lab. Why does the Wuhan lab leak theory matter? And what does this entire exercise personally mean to you?In view of a global pandemic with four million deaths, hundreds of millions out of work, and trillions of dollars in economic damage, I think knowing the truth about its origins should be an end in itself. As for me, I am seeking the truth. Unlike the other Indian members of Drastic like Monali Rahalkar and Rahul Bahulikar, why is it important for you to remain anonymous?Privacy is dear to me and I fear potential intrusions in my personal life down the line. In any case I really like my pseudonym. I think it adds a veneer of mystery, and I like mysteries. Why a Chhau mask as your Twitter DP?For some reason, the artwork fascinated me. I thought if curiosity had a face, it must look like this. How do Drastic Twitter detectives organise themselves?There is no organized structure or division of labor as such. It’s just people coalescing around a common purpose, and having complementary skill sets helps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-origin-if-nothing-went-wrong-at-wuhan-lab-then-why-the-obfuscations/articleshow/83473826.cms||Mohua Das

The state would offer training to women who are interested in becoming priests in temples managed by the department, HR&CE minister P K Sekar Babu said on Saturday. “As all Hindus can become priests, women can also become priests. After getting approval from chief minister M K Stalin, we will offer training to them, ” the minister said after chairing a review meeting. The minister said trained non-brahmin priests would be appointed in temples managed by the department by following due processes before the completion of the DMK government’s first 100 days in power. “We are in the process of collecting details of vacant posts in temples. The department will soon call eligible candidates, including trained non-brahmin archakars, for interview,” said a senior official. On the announcement of priesthood training for women, the official said a dalit woman was appointed as priest in a temple in Mangalore city in Karnataka a few years ago. There are some temples across the country, where women alone are permitted to do poojas as per tradition. Knowing that the Dravidian party stands for gender equality and social justice, the minister’s announcement to encourage interested women to become priests has not come as a surprise. It is aimed at breaking a gender stereotype. “The announcement is nothing but taking forward the idea of former chief minister M Karunanidhi, who wanted to break caste barriers on all fronts,” said Ranganathan, president, Tamil Nadu Government Archakars’ Association. He was among the 206 people who passed the one-year junior archakars course in 2007-2008. The course was launched by then chief minister Karunanidhi at six temples  Tiruvannamalai, Tiruchendur, Palani, Madurai, Srirangam and Triplicane. Two of them were appointed in Madurai and Pudukottai districts, while the remaining have been waiting for more than 13 years for jobs, pursuing legal battles. Satyabama Ammayar of Satya Baba Trust said Tamil culture and tradition had given priority to women in temples. But Aryans destroyed native practices and showed discrimination against women. “We welcome the government’s efforts to restore our tradition and give importance to women,” said Satyabama Ammayar, who has been giving training to women in priesthood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-ready-to-appoint-women-temple-priests/articleshow/83469708.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

Sawai Madhopur remained the hottest in the state, with a maximum temperature of 44.1°C, the Met reports said on Saturday. Attributing the continued rise in mercury to the active upper air cyclonic circulation and northerly winds, Jaipur Met office stated that from Sunday onwards, mercury will continue the upward swing across the state. Also, from Monday onwards, mercury will take a dip, when many places will witness mild showers and dust storms. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively warmer morning as a minimum temperature of 31.5°C, almost four degrees above the normal notch was reported. It was followed by a sultry afternoon with a maximum temperature of 41.0°C, almost one degree above the normal notch. Also, humidity level was almost 80 per cent in the city, adding to the heat. Humidity levels have started increasing across the state which is a good sign for the onset of monsoon. “Presently, humidity across the state is varying from 60 per cent to 80 per cent. When it will go above 90 per cent, it will be conducive for the onset of monsoon,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. Among other districts, Pilani reported a maximum temperature of 43.9°C, Churu 43.6°C, Karauli 43.5°C, Sriganganagar 42.8°C, Pali 42.3°C, Phalodi 41.6°C, Bikaner 40.8°C, Chittorgarh 40.6°C and Jodhpur reported 39.7°C.

The only two leopard rescue centres in the state — one in Nainital and the other in Haridwar — are already “crowded”, housing a dozen animals that forest teams were able to trap alive. So the forest department came up with a novel idea— shift the “inmates” to other states, especially those where rescue facilities are lying vacant. A proposal was drafted and sent to the Central Zoo Authority, which gave its nod this month. Now, in the first phase, six maneaters will be sent to Gujarat. “In Gujarat, the Jamnagar rescue centre has capacity to house 50 leopards but they only have four. Therefore, we will be sending six leopards there,” said J S Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand forest department. According to forest officials, maintenance of each animal costs Rs 2 lakh every year. “Our rescue centres are overburdened. In Haridwar, the Chidiyapur rescue centre can house nine leopards but it has 11 at present,” said a forest officer. Generally, maneaters that are caught alive are sent to zoos or kept in makeshift open enclosures that are supervised. Between 2000-2020, 75 leopards have been declared maneaters in Uttarakhand. In the past five years alone, 27 maneaters have been put down, according to the forest department. This year, at least four maneaters were put down after 10 people were killed in attacks. In 2020, 31 people died and 85 were left injured in leopard attacks. Renowned hunter Joy Hukil, who put down a maneater on Thursday in Bageshwar district, said leopards are increasingly entering human habitats. Hukil, who often accompanies forest teams on rescue missions, has put down 41 man-eaters in his lifetime. “The official number of leopards in Uttarakhand is slightly over 800, but the actual count is much higher. That’s why the man-animal conflict has become such a problem in the hills. The authorities need to find a solution that allows for leopard conservation, but without the human casualties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-move-maneater-leopards-from-crowded-rescue-centres-first-6-to-guj/articleshow/83468490.cms||Shivani Azad

The Rs 15-crore urban rejuvenation project is being carried out under AMRUT urban renewal scheme. Local councillors report that grass and footpath tiles in the complex have been damaged and need repair. After Sanjay Lake near Mayur Vihar, this will become the second largest lake-based recreational spot in east Delhi, which largely remains deprived of open and green spaces. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain held a review meeting for the key infrastructure projects in east Delhi recently. The meeting discussed rejuvenation of Shahdara lake, cleaning of drains and the ongoing work in the ward block of the Swami Dayanand Hospital. Jain said that Shahdara Lake is an important project. “As monsoon is arriving, this is a golden time to complete the project. All departments must coordinate and finish the renovation by end of July,” he said. “Leader of the House Parvesh Sharma said that the funds have been received for the project. A senior official overseeing the work said that the lake can store 6.5 crore liters of water. Out of the Rs 15 crore allocated, Rs 14 crore have already been spent. Jain said that the ongoing projects in Swami Dayanand Hospital were also reviewed. The plan to set up an oxygen plant in the hospital has been approved by the Centre and a foundation stone will be laid after the site for it is selected. “I have directed the hospital administration to complete the civil and medical work in ward no. 4 and 5 in June,” the mayor added. Mukesh Kumar, director of hospital administration, said that the work order has also been given for laying a gas pipeline in the maternity ward. The redevelopment work has begun in both wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-july-deadline-for-shahdara-lake-revamp/articleshow/83469717.cms||---
---||Delhi||6 shops gutted at Lajpat Ngr market, luckily nobody hurt||New Delhi: It took four hours, 30 fire tenders and over 100 firefighters to put out a blaze in Lajpat Nagar’s Central Market in which six shops were gutted. The fire brigade found the stones placed as road dividers obstructing the approach to the market, and a JCB had to be summoned to remove them. According to the fire service director, by the time the fire tenders arrived, the fire had spread, but there was no loss of life.After receiving a call at 10.20am on Saturday, the fire personnel reached the market to find four showrooms engulfed in flames, among them garment shops, a watch showroom and a crockery store. The blaze spread to the adjoining fifth showroom soon after. “The area was immediately vacated and our teams acted swiftly to prevent the inferno from spreading,” said Delhi Fire Service director Atul Garg. “After more than two hours of struggling, our teams contained the blaze. It took a few more hours to complete the cooling process.”The operation to douse the flames began from a lane between the rear gates of the showrooms. The police officers from Lajpat Nagar police station also reached I Block in Lajpat Nagar II. “Electricity provider BSES and Indraprastha Gas Limited were also contacted to turn off the power and gas supplies. The crime and forensic teams have inspected the gutted showrooms,” said R P Meena, DCP (Southeast). He added that a case under Section 285 Indian Penal Code for a negligent act endangering human life has been registered.Firefighters and police said they suspected the fire started from one of the showrooms probably due to a short circuit. The exact cause of the conflagration, however, can be ascertained only after a proper inspection, they said.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that he was monitoring the Lajpat Nagar situation constantly. Naresh Kumar, a manager with a sari showroom, said the employees had just opened the shop around 10am and hadn’t even turned on the lights when they saw smoke emanating from the adjacent building. “We tried to use the fire extinguishers but we realised the fire was spreading rapidly. We all rushed to save the vehicles parked outside and call for help,” said Kumar. When asked about the estimated cost of the loss, Kumar said, “Whatever was there in the shop has been reduced to ashes. Nothing is left.” People residing in houses behind the showrooms came out of their homes as the fire spread. The fire department’s additional divisional officer Vedpal, who was the first to reach the mishap site, said, “By the time we arrived, the fire had engulfed four shops. The stability of the building will have to be looked into because there’s been a lot of damage. Most shops had combustible material stored inside. Within half an hour, the category of fire was raised to medium and more fire tenders pressed into service.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/6-shops-gutted-at-lajpat-ngr-market-luckily-nobody-hurt/articleshow/83469726.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Community leaders to counsel youths against stunts on roads||MUMBAI: After the arrest of Arman Shaikh, the 21-year-old social media influencer who made a video clip of a suicide sequence with a fake revolver on the railway tracks, a group of Muslim community leaders have swung into action. Though dangerous stunts on trains, railway tracks, bikes and cars are performed by youths of all communities, community leaders admitted that Muslim boys are involved in such stunts more often than others. “Remedial measures must be taken,” they said. Disturbed by the stereotypes about the community that such stunts tend to entrench, the leaders want to engage with the boys. “Every year, before Shab-e-Baraat and Shab-e-Meraaj, the sacred nights, imams and preachers counsel youths not to do stunts on roads or trains on these nights. But now that many do such stunts often habitually, imams will speak on the issue in their sermons regularly,” said senior cleric and spiritual leader Maulana Moin Ashraf Quadri (Moin Mian). Lack of open space for sports, gymnasiums and diminishing interest in other physical exercises have also made many teenagers and youths addicts of online games and stunts. “Provide them infrastructure for games and sports, engage them in gyms and keep them away from smart phones as much as possible,” suggested Aligarh Muslim University Executive Council Member M Asif Farooqui. He added that no amount of sermonizing or punishment will deter them unless they are motivated to “burn” their youthful energy in physical exercises. All India Ulema Council general secretary Maulana Mahmood Daryabadi blames it on the “bad influences” these boys get from different sources. “Mosques are shut and imams have not delivered Friday sermons for months. Religion prohibits such dangerous stunts and, once prayers resume, we will launch a campaign to counsel the youths,” he said. Many suggest mentorship programmes for the youths who seem to be anchorless and lacking motivation. “We have begun mentorship of youths in different localities so that youths can be guided to live purposeful life and not waste their time and energy on dangerous activities,” said Amir Idrisi, president of Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP), a group which works for empowerment of Muslim youths. Idrisi added that the “so-called community leaders are more interested in taking delegations to the authorities and getting their photographs published in Urdu newspapers than engaging the youths in healthy activities.” Since the leaders have failed youths who have no heroes, they do dangerous stunts and falsely think they are being brave, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-community-leaders-to-counsel-youths-against-stunts-on-roads/articleshow/83472699.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi on Saturday said the civic body will continue to test more people as more relaxation will take effect from Monday. The civic body will be conducting tests in crowded and enclosed spaces such as fruit and vegetable markets, meat shops and fish stalls and malls as well, a senior GCC official said. Another strategy is targeted vaccination of vendors in these places to counter the spread of infection. Another official said the civic body has also started keeping tabs on influenza-like-illness (ILI) cases reported in private hospitals, people taking scans at standalone scan centres and those who buy fever and flu drugs in pharmacies. “A list of these people is regularly collected from these centres for which officials have been earmarked and these people are being tested,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-tpr-5-new-cases-below-1000-after-73-days/articleshow/83469735.cms||---
---||Delhi||20 enclosures in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary for injured animals||NEW DELHI: Over 20 enclosures are being developed in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary to treat the injured rescued animals before they are released into the wild.  The creation of big enclosures with fencing is a long-term solution for the forest department to provide proper space to injured animals before they are considered fit to survive in the forest. According to the latest data compiled by the department, a total of 434 animals, reptiles and birds were released into Asola from January to May this year after they were rescued from across Delhi. A forest official said, “In most of the cases, the animals that are rescued from human settlements are found to be injured. It takes days for them to recover. At present, we have cages and small enclosures for such animals but it has been decided to provide a better and bigger space where herbivores can be treated. So, we have identified space for enclosures near the office of south division in Tughlaqabad. Proper fencing and other steps will be taken to keep the animals here.” At present, the forest and wildlife department does not have a rescue centre and hence, injured animals are kept in the Delhi zoo, private hospitals or Tughlaqabad facility. “However, with the creation of enclosures, we will provide a proper environment to the injured animals. After they recover properly, they will be released inside the Asola Bhatti sanctuary,” said an official. However, public will not be allowed to go near the enclosures to view the animals. “It is not a zoo and hence, the public will not be given access to go near the enclosures. It is being developed only for nursing the animals and not for public entertainment,” added the forest official. The forest department is also creating water bodies, salt lakes and grasslands inside the sanctuary for herbivores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/20-enclosures-in-asola-bhatti-for-injured-animals/articleshow/83469741.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Delhi||EDMC begins door-to-door waste pickup in all 64 wards||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has launched a door-to-door garbage collection project in all its 64 wards. The civic body, which has hired a concessionaire for the purpose for a period of 10 years, is planning to focus on covering all unauthorised and regularised colonies in the jurisdiction to keep them neat and clean. Mayor for the east Delhi civic body, Nirmal Jain, said the garbage collection project was being implemented in a phased manner for the past few months. “Under the scheme, segregated waste is being collected from each house of all the wards in our area. After that, the waste is sent for further processing in covered vehicles to processing sites or fixed compacting units. Here, compost is being made from wet waste, which will help to reduce the pressure on the landfill site. The rest of the segregated waste is either sent to landfill or recycling units,” stated the mayor. Jain said the scheme would help authorities improve the waste management system in east Delhi. To compress the segregated waste and simplify the process for its transportation to the landfill, there is a plan to provide one or two compactors in each of the wards, besides using different dustbins for garbage collection, the mayor claimed. “We are stressing on public awareness campaigns to bring behavioural changes among the residents. Segregation at source will help us greatly in managing waste in the city,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-begins-door-to-door-waste-pick-up-in-all-64-wards/articleshow/83469749.cms||---

His application was rejected, citing bad CIBIL score. When he verified his CIBIL report, his shock turned to worry. He immediately approached police, complaining that his Permanent Account Number (PAN) details in CIBIL report were incorrect and he suspected someone had modified it. The complainant, M Vijay, said his name and address in the CIBIL report were modified by unidentified miscreants. Using the modified details, the person had applied for an automobile loan and consumer loan of Rs 1.80 lakh and Rs 21,490 respectively. “As per CIBIL report received on May 19, 2021, I came to know that my personal and PAN details were changed. Except PAN number, my name and address were changed. A few days ago, when I checked with income-tax department, the officials clarified that as per their records my PAN details remained unchanged. However, some of my details are incorrect with CIBIL records,’’ Vijay told TOI. In December last, he had applied for a loan at a private bank and submitted his PAN card photocopy, job ID card, pay slip and bank statement. Again last month, he applied for another loan. He, however, got the shock when the bank staff rejected his application, citing bad CIBIL score. Apart from this unusual complaint, police said in the recent past at least five cases were registered wherein the miscreants applied for loan without the knowledge of victims by sharing Aadhaar, PAN and other ID proofs without making any modification in credentials to the banks. “The fraudsters, giving their own phone number and bank account details, applied for loans and even got it sanctioned by submitting ID proofs of victims. Later, they turned defaulters. Since the address proofs of the documents has victims’ address, banks have been asking victims to return the money. We are investigating these cases,’’ assistant commissioner of police (cyber crime) KVM Prasad told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/miscreants-modify-pan-details-cheat-banks-customers/articleshow/83469770.cms||Srinath Vudali

Therefore, we decided to extend aid to those who have lost their fathers to Covid-19,” said Anwar Ahmed, managing director, MS Education Academy, that runs nine junior colleges and four degree colleges apart from 10 schools. Those willing to take free admission in MS Education Academy institutions have to approach the nearest branch. “Students have to submit documents such as death certificate, an HRCT report, RT-PCR report among others to the nearest branch. We will then conduct an independent enquiry to verify that their claims are correct so that free admission is not extended to those who are ineligible,” said Anwar Ahmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/free-edu-to-students-who-lost-dads-to-virus/articleshow/83470576.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi may see earliest monsoon in 13 years||NEW DELHI: If the southwest monsoon, which is advancing at a rate faster than normal, hits Delhi on June 15, it will be the capital’s earliest monsoon in the last 13 years. The normal meteorological date of onset is June 27. In 2008, the rain-bearing winds blew into the city on June 15 to mark the earliest advent of the rainy season in Delhi. On Saturday, while no showers were recorded during the day, the weather changed towards the night as gusty winds were reported across the capital, accompanied with light rain in some places. The day’s maximum temperature was 35.8 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal. Moderate showers are forecast for Sunday. The normal date for the onset of the southwest monsoon in the capital is June 27, meaning this year it could be two weeks in advance of the regular. This date was revised from June 29 last year by India Meteorological Department after factoring in data from 1961 onwards. Last year too, the monsoon hit Delhi early, reaching the capital on June 25. In 2019, it was delayed by almost a week, with the first rain in the city on July 5. In 2018, the onset was declared on June 28. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said there was a greater likelihood of the monsoon reaching Delhi by June 15 and covering the entire country by June 16. “So far, the expected date is June 15. This will be 12 days in advance. We can expect light to moderate rains all through this week, which will keep the maximum temperature below normal,” said Srivastava. IMD data since 2003 shows the monsoon hitting Delhi in June only eight times, and arriving only in the first week of July in the rest of the years. The forecast for Sunday is gusty winds of 30-40 km/hr, with a yellow alert in place for moderate rainfall. The maximum temperature is expected to stay around 35 degrees Celsius. IMD’s seven-day forecast also shows a yellow alert till June 18, with light to moderate activity expected all week. The increase in wind speed, meanwhile, has improved Delhi’s air to the lower half of the ‘moderate’ pollution category. On Saturday, the air quality was 133 on CPCB’s index. It is expected to fall below 100 in the next 24 hours. “The wind shift from westerly to easterly has led to improvement in air quality due to the decrease in the long-range transport of dust from Rajasthan’s arid regions,” said SAFAR, a body under the Union ministry of earth science. “The wind speed is predicted to stay high for the next three days and isolated rainfall is likely in Delhi. The AQI is likely to improve and stay in the moderate-satisfactory categories for the next three days.” It added that the component of coarser particles in pollution compared with finer particles was fairly high.

According to sources, on June 9, the 69-year-old man residing in Dahod town was shocked to get a message claiming that he had been vaccinated with the second dose. A family member used the link given in the message to open the portal and was even able to download the certificate! The certificate stated that he elderly man had been vaccinated at the Desaiwada health centre on June 9 and even mentioned other details like the name of the vaccinator. This not only left the family preplexed. but flummoxed officials too who have faced a similar situation in the past. Chief district health officer Dr RD Pahadiya said that it has come to light that one of the four persons registered on the same mobile phone as the elderly man had taken the vaccine. However, a clerical error while making entry in the portal sent the message to the elderly man instead. The portal allows four persons to be registered on the same mobile phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/after-1st-shot-man-gets-fully-jabbed-certificate/articleshow/83468960.cms||---

---||Delhi||Corporations yet to finish survey of all dangerous buildings in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The advancement of monsoon arrival date has put the dangerous building survey exercise under spotlight as Delhi witnesses several old and dilapidated structures collapsing during the rainy season every year. Only 57% of the 11.4 lakh buildings have been surveyed in South Delhi Municipal Corporation jurisdiction areas so far and just four structures have been declared “dangerous”. Only one-fourth of the exercise has been completed in east Delhi. A senior East Corporation official said that out of over 2 lakh buildings, around 50,000 buildings had been surveyed. “The survey is still being carried out.” North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s survey has identified 424 dangerous structures while 78.5% of the annual exercise has been completed. A report from the north corporation states that out of 83,4001 properties, teams from its engineering and maintenance department have so far surveyed 6,55,219. “Out of the surveyed buildings, 265 are in need of repair while 424 buildings fall under ‘imminent danger’ category. Notices under sections 348,349 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act have been issued to the owners,” mayor Jai Prakash said. He added that the rest of the exercise would be expedited. The maximum number of dangerous structures is in Rohini zone (142) followed by Karol Bagh zone (96) and Civil Lines zone (83). Old Delhi areas under City-Sadar Paharganj zone have 21 dangerous structures while Keshavpuram zone has 75 dangerous structures and Narela seven. The annual building survey is conducted three months prior to the onset of monsoon. Delhi witnesses several building collapses every year but because of poor accountability fixing mechanism, no lessons are learnt. In the capital's biggest such case, a five-storey building collapsed in the Lalita Park area of Delhi in November 2010, which claimed the lives of 70 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-yet-to-finish-survey-of-all-dangerous-city-buildings/articleshow/83469783.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Early showers may mean early rise in air pollution in Delhi||NEW DELHI: An early monsoon may have a detrimental effect on the capital’s air pollution, which may start rising early this year, if the withdrawal also occurs sooner than normal. Track the pollution level in your cityWith the absence of showers in early October, pollution levels had touched “poor” and “very poor” by mid-October last year, a phenomenon that may repeat this year too, if the monsoon comes and goes away early, experts claim. Generally, pollution levels in the NCR start rising by mid-October, coinciding with the crop burning season and a change in wind direction soon after the monsoon withdraws. Experts believe this leads to a “stagnancy” phase, which can trap pollutants over the region. Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said a two-pronged effect may take place this year, if indeed monsoons track back early. “Over the long term, some years see a delayed onset of monsoon while some see an early onset. However, the crop harvesting season is generally linked to the monsoon period and if withdrawal occurs early, farm fires may start a little early too,” Saha said, adding that as the monsoon withdraws, there is a change in wind direction and air ventilation drops. “This is what leads to a rise in winter pollution and it may be seen the same way. Monsoon withdrawal leads to a number of meteorological changes and the boundary layer also starts to drop, which traps pollutants closer to the surface. While it is too early to say, we will have to track the monsoon’s progress,” Saha explained. In 2019, a later withdrawal of monsoon (in the second week of October) saw the air quality largely remain in the “moderate” category till mid-October, highlighting the impact late rains can have on winter pollution. Professor Mukesh Sharma from IIT-Kanpur, who was recently appointed as a member of WHO’s Global Air Pollution and Health Technical Advisory Group, said while the direct correlation between monsoon rains and winter pollution is yet to be analysed, the impact of rains on a drop in pollution is clear. “Rains impact both particulate matter and brings down the gaseous content too. So the longer the rains go, the lesser the pollution will be in the early part of winter,” Sharma said. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment also agreed, adding that while the relationship between seasonal monsoon and its bearing on winter pollution is not yet understood, it highlights the impact for long-term change. “We need to cut emissions at the source with speed and scale and not rely on short-term impact, such as rains. This will prevent pollution build-up even in the absence of rains and when conditions are adverse,” Chowdhury said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/early-showers-may-mean-early-rise-in-air-pollution/articleshow/83469780.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Netas go on pre-poll ribbon cutting spree at jab centres||Wielding a pair of scissors, an MP from the city is in the middle of a weeklong jaunt across vaccine centres. One morning at Kurla, the next day at Chatwani Bagh in Vile Parle and the day after, in Chandivali congratulating the “corporator & all party karyakartas working hard to help people.” All the while, trailed by an army of aides, a photographer to capture the moments and an audience of vaccine aspirants queued up. There will be relief. But first, let there be a ribbon to cut. Every five years, the rituals begin. A spree of pre-poll inaugurations. Be it public toilets and swimming pools or street lights and underground garbage bins, BMC corporators and poll aspirants rarely pass up the chance to cut a red ribbon. But after Covid-19 turned their stage and strategies upside down and with nine months to go for Mumbai’s civic elections, vaccine centres have emerged as the new place to make their pitch. A celebratory snip of the scissors, juice and biscuit packs for those in queue and photo-ops with the needle-poked have turned vaccine centre openings into events that are keeping councillors as well as wannabe corporators busy. At some centres, a festive atmosphere prevailed. With a bouquet in hand, Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai got filmmaker Anurag Basu to cut the ribbon and let his mask slip for a few seconds to smile for the launch of a vaccine centre at Sai Hospital in Goregaon. Three-time corporator and Mumbai North East MP, BJP’s Manoj Kotak, roped in Sonu Nigam to launch an oxygen bank and isolation centre in Mulund and also sing a song amid applause from health staff and officials. In a battle over bragging rights for a new drive-in-vaccination centre at Andheri Sports Complex, local BJP and Sena workers came to blows after BJP MLA Bharti Lavhekar who was supposed to inaugurate the centre was late and Sena workers led by Rajul Patel tried to beat them up for the delay. The mayhem lasted for an hour and normalcy was restored after a trip to Amboli police station. The race for fastest fingers first at inaugurations has also caused bruised egos. Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddiqui spewed fire at Sena minister Anil Parab for not inviting him to a vaccine unveiling in Bandra East — Siddiqui’s constituency and home to the CM. But do these symbolic displays of duty have an impact on ordinary citizens caught in the middle of a vaccine crunch? A disgruntled Sharad Varshney lashed out at BMC. “Lots of hard work being put in by people, got an appointment in a new vaccine centre in Sewri today, it was inauguration day of a temporary centre, nagar sewak sir came to inaugurate it an hour late with full force of his team wearing no or half masks…” Yashraj Naik, who travelled 15 kms after winning a CoWin slot, found venting to the mayor on Twitter. “We here have gathered at the Maa Saheb Meenatai Thackeray Maternity Home Chunabhatti! But we are told that we will get vaccines only after your inauguration of the center! Unjust! It is more important for you to inaugurate and get into people's eyes than to actually vaccinate people!” he wrote. Last week, BMC commissioner I S Chahal issued an order banning all kinds of political ads and hoardings outside vaccination centres. The move made Chembur resident Kala Suresh glad, who felt politicians had covered a spectrum of publicity stunts. “They’re not doing us a favour. Vaccine arrangements involve taxpayers’ money,” said Suresh. However, BJP corporator Atul Shah, managing the civic vaccination centres at Madhav Baug Temple compound and a banquet hall in Bhuleshwar, differed. “My volunteers sit 50 metres away from the vaccination site and guide people,” claimed Shah, stressing that as corporators they had “better reach” in ensuring everyone from his area turned up. Former BMC health committee chairman and Sena corporator Amey Ghole insisted that although BMC had made vaccines available, setting up camps was done by them. “I got this done through CSR funding. As corporators we’re trying to ensure smooth vaccination,” he said, defending the need for an opening ritual. “It was during the inauguration that we decided every corporator ward should have one vaccination centre.” BJP MLA Ameet Satam likened the exercise to “annual performance appraisals”. “Because they can’t have their usual meetings and rallies before an election, corporators want to claim credit and show what they’re doing for their people. You can’t stop them because it’s part of the process but one has to show maturity, like I did by not barging into others' inaugurations, uninvited,” said Satam. Many are not so easily assuaged. When mayor Kishori Pednekar posted pictures of herself — snipping a ribbon to unveil a “150-bed Covid dedicated hospital” at Nehru Science Center and a “new 193-bed facility at Poddar Hospital” — Jai Pawar could barely hold his rage. “I don't understand why cutting ribbon and celebrating the inauguration, taking pictures & posting in social media, I hope you understand it is a pandemic situation in Mumbai and not a festival,” he tweeted. However, this exercise of vaccine centre-to-centre canvassing could backfire, feels political analyst Surendra Jondhale. “Political enthusiasm at the cost of people’s anxiety in critical times can be insensitive. Attention of a crowd doesn’t necessarily guarantee votes and people realise it’s political tamasha. There are other ways to establish rapport,” he said.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: High street retail powers through, despite second wave||HYDERABAD: Popular as a high street retail destination, Hyderabad saw significant movement in this sector even this year – between February and April – despite a growing second Covid-19 wave. According to reports, the city witnessed close 60,000 square feet (sft) of leasing by standalone outlets during this period alone, with store sizes ranging from 400 sft to 15,000 sft. Those picking up space in Hyderabad include prominent food and beverage brands, apparel chains, electronic stores, jewellers among others. And while some of it continues to be limited to the city’s western corridor, many are found opening their doors to customers in other areas as well – A S Rao Nagar, Dilsukhnagar, L B Nagar to name a few. “Other prominent markets that are seeing increased demand include Kukatpally, Miyapur and Vanasthalipuram,” said Pankaj Renjhen, COO and joint managing director of Anarock Retail, adding, “While high street retail destinations like Banjara Hills and Jubilee hills have long been high on demand, they have limited supply.” According to him, while many top-end brands, with a presence is Hyderabad’s malls, are taking their expansion plans to the high streets, some are planning to make their debut in the city with a standalone retail outlet. Sumanth Reddy, immediate past president of the National Association of Realtors attributes this trend to two reasons: lower rentals and fear of Covid-19 among consumers. “The city’s high street retail has done well in the last quarter as landlords have been flexible with the rentals. Also, the high risk of Covid-19 infection in crowded spaces, which has led to lower footfall in malls, has further contributed to creating this demand,” he said. Reports suggest that Hyderabad is among the leaders in this segment along with cities such as Bengaluru, Pune, Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and Gurgaon. “Prominent tier 2 and 3 cities like Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Patiala, and smaller towns in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior) too have witnessing expansion by leading brands,” reads a report by Anarock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-street-retail-powers-through-despite-2nd-wave/articleshow/83469785.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

---||Mumbai||25 projects held up as BMC, realtors spar over development fee||MUMBAI: At least 25 housing projects in the city are in limbo as developers and BMC spar over development charges in mixed-use projects. These are residential-cum-commercial projects where the former is predominant. Development charge for residential use is 4% of ready reckoner rate and 8% for commercial. Development charges is a vital revenue source for BMC. While Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act allows this charge to be levied on the predominant use, BMC has been insisting on charging proportionately. If predominant formula is applied, a developer, especially in a large project, can save crores. Realtors said that when they apply for a mixed-use development to be charged at rate of predominant development which is residential, civic officials insist they obtain an order from court. “BMC must treat a court order as a precedent and not insist on each developer obtaining a fresh order each time,” a developer said on anonymity. Sathyen Prasad, a techno-legal expert to the real estate industry, said it is tantamount to mental harassment and a loss to the state exchequer as BMC, with a legal team at its disposal, prefers to fight it out despite being repeatedly rapped by courts. In two recent orders Bombay high court directed BMC to charge residential rate based on predominant use formula. For Incline Realty’s Borivli project, where 74% is residential, the court referred to the BMC law officer’s opinion who opposed development charges at commercial rate. In Oberoi Realty’s Goregaon project, it was said that the executive engineer and law officer clarified the project was predominantly residential. Yet BMC rejected the developer’s plea to recover charges at 4%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-25-projects-held-up-as-bmc-realtors-spar-over-devpt-fee/articleshow/83471676.cms||Clara Lewis

He said that the kabrastan commitee was not taken into confidence nor invited for the inauguration of the burial ground, and pointed out that the works undertaken by Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA) were not up to mark. “We had handed over the possession of the kabrastan to GSUDA for renovation, but since the inauguration, it has not been reverted to us. We had complained to Mormugao MLA and urban development minister Milind Naik, and also called for a joint meeting with GSUDA officials to show that there are leakages in the office area,” Khan said. He said they were assured that repairs would be completed in a month’s time. “We are not sure if the repairs pointed out by us have been taken up as we have not yet been given the possession of the kabrastan. While we understand that there can be ups and downs in the government functioning due to the Covid pandemic, GSUDA has claimed to have inaugurated the kabrastan at Sada through MMC on Statehood Day. I want to know on what basis they have inaugurated the kabrastan,” Khan said. “The works are incomplete. I want to request the minister to initiate steps to hand over the kabrastan to us and also question GSUDA why the works have not been completed. If GSUDA fails to carry out the repair works, our committee has the capacity to complete this task,” Khan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hand-over-sada-kabrastan-back-to-us-demands-committee/articleshow/83471686.cms||---

There were long queues from 8am to collect tokens and get the jab. When cops on duty said the counter was closed as vaccines were over, people got into verbal argument with them. “Why do you have a rule to vaccinate only 100 or 150 people a day when so many of us are waiting? You need to bring more vaccine to the centre as demand goes up,” a visitor said.After a lean day, at centres like Cheran Managar High School also, vaccines got over by 9.35am, and again only Covaxin was administered, said a visitor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fresh-covid-cases-fall-below-2000-recovery-rate-at-90/articleshow/83469782.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Plans afoot to set up five new police stations||Coimbatore: The city police are planning to set up new stations at Karumbukadai, Vellalore, Ondipudur, Sitra and Ganapathy for better policing, and add corporation areas under the Thudiyalur and Vadavalli stations to their jurisdiction.The city police have 15 law & order stations, 15 investigation wings, three all women stations and two traffic investigation wing (TIW) stations, traffic police stations and special units. For administrative purpose, four sub-divisions (central, west, east and south) were formed and all the 15 stations were brought under the subdivisions.In April, former city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham sent a proposal to create four new stations after bifurcating Singanallur, Peelamedu, Saravanampatti and Podanur stations and also sought permission to take over Kavundampalayam, Thudiyalur, Nallampalayam and Vadavalli stations falling under the city municipal corporation. But the areas were controlled by Thudiyalur and Vadavalli police stations that are under the rural police.Senior officers in Chennai sent back the proposal and sought some clarification. Subsequently, police commissioner Deepak M Damor held meetings and decided to create five new stations for better policing. “Karumbukadai and Ganapathy are densely populated and should be covered by city police. Vellalore, Ondipudur and Sitra are newly-developed areas and the city police were not able to manage them properly. To reduce crime rate, new police stations should be created in the three areas,” said a senior police officer.“While Vadavalli, Veerakeralam and some more areas are under the Vadavalli police station, Kavundamapalaym, Thudiyalur, Nallampalayam and Vellakinar areas are under Thudiyalur station. The two stations are controlled by the district police. We are planning to take over the stations. A revised and detailed proposal will be sent to senior officials in Chennai to create five more police stations and take over two police stations from Coimbatore rural police,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/plans-afoot-to-set-up-five-new-police-stations/articleshow/83469781.cms||A Subburaj
---||Jaipur||First in India: Diesel climbs to over Rs 100 in Sriganganagar||JAIPUR: Sriganganagar has become the first district in the country where diesel crossed the Rs 100-mark after oil marketing companies raised the price of the auto fuel on Saturday. Diesel price is now retailing at Rs 100.05 a litre in the district after a hike of 25 paise, while petrol is selling at Rs 107.48. In Jaipur, prices of petrol and diesel increased to Rs 102.73 and Rs 95.92, respectively. Oil marketing companies did not raise fuel prices for 18 days prior to May 4 because of elections in West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Assam. But since May 4, fuel prices have been hiked 23 times, pushing the rates to record highs despite the demand in the country slumping due to lockdowns. Because of different levels of VAT, other local taxes and transportation costs, fuel prices vary from one state to another. Since VAT rates in Rajasthan are the highest in the country, auto fuels are costlier than other states. Rajasthan levies 36% and 26% VAT on petrol and diesel, respectively. Since the fuel stations in Sriganganagar are supplied from depots in Jaipur and Jodhpur, higher freight costs result in higher prices compared to other places in the state. But as the district shares its borders with Punjab, where fuel prices are cheaper, people prefer buying from the neighbouring state while Rajasthan loses some of the revenues. Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers’ Association president Sunit Bagai said, “By having the highest VAT rates on petrol and diesel, Rajasthan loses a lot of business to neighboring states where the prices are lower.” Rajasthan had reduced VAT on petrol and diesel by 2% in February from 38% and 28% to 36% and 26%, which are still the highest in the country. The state earns nearly Rs 22 from every litre of diesel as VAT and road cess. Bagai said diesel is a poor man’s fuel. “The rise in diesel prices will hit the poor more than the rich as everything will become costlier. Also, since farmers use tractors for cultivation, the input costs for farming will go up further.” Oil companies revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15 days and foreign exchange rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1st-in-india-diesel-climbs-to-over-rs-100-in-sriganganagar/articleshow/83470616.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Colleges forcing us to pay full fees: Students||Coimbatore: Some college managements are said to be putting pressure on the students to pay the yearly tuition fees by threatening to take them out of online classes and not to allow them to attend semester examinations.A third-year architect student of a private college in the city told TOI that the college management had been asking him to pay the tuition fees, which is close to Rs 85,000 a year, immediately. The management has warned not to allow him to attend the online classes and take up the semester examination, if he didn’t pay the fees without any delay.The student, who didn’t want to be identified, said he had sought additional time to pay the fee, as his father, who is a mason, was out of job because of the complete lockdown. He said they were struggling to meet the daily expenses.“Our financial situation has been worse, since the pandemic began. Last year itself, we had struggled a lot to arrange the college fees. This year, we cannot afford such a lump amount. I have been requesting the college management to give me additional time to pay the fees. But they are putting pressure on me to pay the fees immediately. Had it been a normal time, my father would have paid the fees somehow. But in this pandemic situation, it is just out of question. Now, I don’t know what to do,” the student said.This is not a lone case. Many educational institutions, including the reputed ones, in the district have been coercing the students to pay the fees immediately, by threatening to stop them from taking the semester examinations or attending online classes, said M Dinesh Raja, secretary, Student Federation of India. He had taken up the issue with the district administration recently.“Bullying the students to pay the full fees immediately during the pandemic situation is completely unfair. Many of their parents have lost jobs and are struggling to manage their daily expenses. How will they be able to arrange such a huge sum? The government should intervene and get some additional time for the students to pay the fees. Also, a committee should be formed to ensure that the colleges are collecting only the fees fixed by the government,” he said. When contacted the office of the regional joint director of collegiate education, an official said they had not received any such complaints from the district so far. “It is a common practice among the colleges to collect the pending fees before the examination,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/colleges-forcing-us-to-pay-full-fees-students/articleshow/83469824.cms||Nivedha Selvam

After verifying the bills, the corporation commissioner would sign them and send them to the accounts department. The department would release the amount in instalments. The initial payment would be made about two months from the date of bill submission,” he said.“But in the last two years, bill processing has been slow. Contractors received payments mid-January. Rs 80 crore is pending with the corporation till February. We request the government to take steps to release at least Rs 20 crore immediately,” Kumar said. “Also, the corporation commissioner has not signed any bill in the last four months.”The association requested Pandian, who has been transferred, to sign and process the submitted bills before vacating office. “The commissioner knows what kind of works are being carried out. So, it would be easy for him to verify and sign the bills. Once the new commissioner takes charge, he will have to learn about the works before signing bills, which would delay our payments by another four to five months. Many contractors are facing enormous pressure from banks and are staring at huge losses,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/contractors-seek-payment-of-dues-from-city-corpn/articleshow/83469812.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Sridhar Merugu, an employee of Oracle, started as many as 10 WhatsApp groups—which have pediatrics, pulmonologists, general physicians, and orthopaedics, among others—to assist people. “It all started with a simple query from my five-year-old son Sharan, with whom I was quarantining at a hotel back then as my wife tested positive for Covid-19. He asked me who is going to take care of his mother, cook for her, and give tablets if we stay in a hotel away from her. That got me thinking and I decided to do my bit for families who are going through the same situation,” Sridhar told TOI. Sridhar, who is the founder of the IT and Entrepreneurs forum, said that his son further encouraged him by donating ₹10,000 from his pocket money—which he had received from his grandparents, uncles, and aunts—to the cause. “Soon, we started many WhatsApp groups dedicated to doctor consultations, vaccines, post-covid care, among others,” Sridhar said adding that these groups have about 40 volunteers, mostly techies and entrepreneurs. “We aim to help the Covid patients and educate them via online platforms like Zoom. We have also opened online clinics for critical issues. On the ground level, we are assisting in finding ventilator, ECMO beds, procuring medicines, and the like, ” he said, adding that they had managed to help about 600-700 people during the second wave. “I tried to get consultation when my one-year-old has high temperature through WhatsApp. Within minutes, a doctor sent a voice message with detailed instructions.

They said the rising prices had made it difficult for the builders and small-time contractors to complete the projects, leaving many construction workers out of jobs. They also urged the state government to bring the cement prices on par with the prices in other states.The association said the prices of all raw construction materials had increased post the state assembly election. The price of a sack of cement has increased by 54% to Rs 570 from Rs 370, while the price of a unit of M-sand has gone up to Rs 6,000 from Rs 5,000 and that of sand to Rs 8,000 from Rs 6,000.

Announcing this on the occasion of World Day Against Child Labour on Saturday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the government would also provide free education to orphaned children till Class 12 in residential schools/hostel facilities. A committee of various stakeholders would also be constituted to form a streamlined policy to rehabilitate children rescued from forced labour. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “During the discussion through webinar which was presided over by Gehlot and attended by senior officials including the chief secretary, it was found that more coordination was required between states and while children were being rescued successfully, their rehabilitation continued to be irregular. We will constitute a committee of all the stakeholders and form a policy which will be submitted to Gehlot for further deliberation.” While child labour continues to be a major concern, experts lamented that children orphaned due to Covid need particular attention so that they can have access to food, shelter, health and education as well as the fact that they are not forced into labour. Apart from financial aid, girls studying in colleges will get hostel facility on priority basis while boys will be given incentives.The child commission has made a list of 791 children who were orphaned during the second wave of Covid. The state government had announced that it would look after children orphaned during the pandemic irrespective of whether their parents died due to Covid or some other ailment through Mukhyamantri Corona Bal Kalyan Yojana. It will be separate from the aid provided by the central government. For children of mothers widowed during Covid, an amount of Rs 1,000/month will be given for their welfare and Rs 2,000 per annum for school books and uniforms. The widows would be given Rs 1 lakh ex gratia and Rs 1,500 per month as pension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-2500-per-month-for-kids-orphaned-by-covid-in-state/articleshow/83470649.cms||---

---||Kolkata||New vaccine regime: West Bengal to act as mediator, private hospitals wait & watch||KOLKATA: After the central government announced that it will procure vaccines and distribute 25% of the share to private hospitals through the state from June 21, Bengal health department held a meeting on Wednesday and informed private hospitals that they will now act as the mediator for procuring vaccines on their behalf. The private health facilities were also told to send in their vaccine requirement along with their existing stock position. Senior state health officials met central health ministry officials on Thursday where the former were briefed on how to go about streamlining the procurement from manufacturers and the subsequent supply modalities to private hospitals. “Some private hospitals have already started sending in their requirements. The state is mediating as a aggregator for vaccine procurement for private hospitals to ensure a smooth supply chain and equitable distribution between large corporate hospitals and smaller health units. Many smaller nursing homes and clinics had been unable to purchase their doses directly from the manufacturers. This new policy should be helping them as well,” said a senior health official. AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua agreed. “This should ensure more equitable and fair distribution of vaccines. Small nursing homes and private CVCs have often been struggling to procure doses. We, too, have been affected ever since we were asked to purchases vaccines from the manufacturers. With the central government now procuring vaccines from manufacturers and the state government acting as the aggregator, we believe we will get our share at the right time,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua. “We have already provided all the details that had been sought — number of vaccines we procure, the number of our centres, daily consumption and the rest. Even though there is no additional convenience for us in this new arrangement, we hope that there will be no further shortage of vaccine,” added Barua, also the president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI). Peerless Hospital, which will resume vaccination with its purchased stock on Monday, said the new arrangement will bring relief to all private CVCs. “The onus will now be on the government to ensure supply. We were asked to provide details of our requirement which we have already done. For July, we have sought 20,000 doses and hope to get it,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. A private hospital head, however, added that it’s still not clear who will receive the payment. “State officials are probably working it out for we haven’t been told yet,” he said. The new reforms may help states get hassle-free vaccine supply, according to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) zonal head R Venkatesh. “All private hospitals will have the opportunity of getting vaccines with support from the state government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-vax-regime-state-to-act-as-mediator-pvt-hosps-wait-watch/articleshow/83468774.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

From reporting a worrisome 1,200 infections daily in early April, Nandurbar is now registering Covid cases in single digit for the past few days. In the past week, the daily new cases in the district have been less than10 on all days, except once. On June 7, 8 and 9, the daily cases registered were five, six and one respectively. On June 11, it was five. Only on June 10, the district had registered 12 cases. What Nandurbar lacked in terms of medical infrastructure, it made up for in terms of planning. The local administration put its best foot forward to curb the spread of the infection. Learning from the first wave, they had already set up oxygen tanks and did not have to scramble for it. They called in doctors from Mumbai and made institutional quarantine mandatory. District collector Rajendra Bharud told TOI, “It’s the teamwork that has yielded results for us. Our district presently has the lowest per million cases (73) in the state and our weekly positivity rate of 2.06% is one of the lowest in the state.” The district had 174 active cases till June 11. Bharud said that the administration will continue to aggressively zero in the contacts of Covid positive patients and test them for the infection. The health teams are reaching out to villages in remote parts of the mountainous terrain of the district to inoculate the beneficiaries at present. Although the district did not register a significant surge in cases in the first wave last year, the district saw an exponential rise in cases in the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/from-1k-to-single-digit-cases-nandurbar-turns-around/articleshow/83466968.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Bikaner district collector Namit Mehta, who launched the scheme on Saturday, said a team of health department officials will reach the location where the beneficiaries have gathered and vaccinate them. He said at least 10 people should gather at a house or at a place and call the help desk for vaccination. The main objective of the campaign is to help elderly people who are unwell and cannot reach a vaccination centre. In another move to speed up vaccinations, mobile vans will be parked at crowded places in the city for two hours where people aged 45 and above can get inoculated. On Saturday, three such vans were parked in Bikaner city. On Friday night, a meeting was held to discuss both the initiatives wherein it was decided to implement it from Saturday. An official said the drive will gradually be launched in other areas of the district. In another development, Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi has started a campaign to vaccinate labourers, beggars and the homeless. He added people living on footpaths and those who do not have identity proofs will be covered under this scheme. On the first day, 15 such people were vaccinated at Hanuman Chowraha, Gadisar Chowraha and at the railway station. Municipal council urban manager Lalit Lodha and police administration extended their support in vaccinating such people. Chetan Paliwal of Savera Swayansevi Sansthan also supported the move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vaccine-on-wheels-drive-starts-in-bikaner/articleshow/83470683.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||M K Stalin releases Mettur dam water for ‘kuruvai’ crops||METTUR (Salem): Chief minister M K Stalin opened the sluice gates of the Stanley Reservoir at Mettur on Saturday, releasing 3,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs) water to irrigate the ‘kuruvai’ crops in the delta districts of Trichy, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Pudukottai, Mayiladuthurai and Cuddalore. The quantity of water being released was increased to 10,000cusecs in the evening and is likely to be maintained at the same level for the next couple of days. Stalin said close to 5.21 lakh acres of fertile land would benefit from the water release. He said it was for the 18th time that the water was being released from the dam on the traditional date of June 12. The dam had 60.784 thousand million cubic feet water on the day, while the water level stood at 96.8ft. “Farmers in the delta districts will get the Cauvery water for their irrigation needs on the right time when the water is released exactly on June 12. The state has sufficient stock of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds for ‘kuruvai’ cultivation,” he said. Stalin said desilting works were carried out across the delta districts to ensure uninterrupted water flow to the tail-end areas. “We had spent Rs65.10 crore to desilt the water pathways for nearly 4,061km in the delta districts. The works were carried out in consultation with various farmers’ associations. I had appointed nine special officers to monitor the works.” Recalling the seven important resolutions that the DMK had taken during the election campaign in Trichy, Stalin said the government was committed to reforming the agriculture sector and improving the water resources management in the state. He said the government would work to ensure a bumper harvest to make farmers happy and their motto was “Magasool Perukkam, Magilum Vivasayi”. “All the farmers in the state will get sufficient water for irrigation purposes. The government has started groundworks to fulfil the election promises. Presently, farming activities are carried out only on 60% of the fertile land. The area under cultivation will be increased to 75% in the next 10 years.” The chief minister said the DMK government was also committed to provide quality higher education, world-class medical facilities and treatment, smart cities, best-in-class infrastructure to the people of Tamil Nadu. Answering a question on water sharing between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the chief minister said he had written a letter to the water resources minister in Karnataka on Friday. Talking about the AIADMK government’s pilot project kudimaramathu, Stalin said they had started collecting information on the project and a detailed report would be given to the media at the earliest. Referring to the government’s fight against Covid-19, he said their efforts have helped contain the virus spread in a speedy manner. When asked about the decision to reopen Tasmac shops, Stalin said he had ordered the same only in the districts where the cases have plateaued. Stalin said he had approached the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to meet prime minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on June 17. “They have also given the date tentatively and the PMO hasn’t finalised my appointment yet.” Meanwhile, water resources development S Durai Murugan told the media that a decision on Cauvery-Kodavari river linking scheme would be taken in consultation with the chief minister after studying the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/stalin-releases-mettur-dam-water-for-kuruvai-crops/articleshow/83469889.cms||---
---||Goa||Degree only if 66% tests answered in physical mode: Goa University||PANAJI: As a relief to students during the pandemic, Goa University has said that a student will be eligible to get his or her degree if they have answered 66% of their assessments in the physical or offline mode. For instance, for a three-year programme with six semesters, the students should have answered a minimum of four semester-end examinations (SEE) or semester-end assessments (SEA) in the offline mode. The student will be eligible for a degree by answering the remaining two SEE or SEA in the online mode. A criterion on these lines has been drawn up by the university for students pursuing programmes of upto five years’ duration offered by the Goa University. The decision was also taken to ensure safety of students and staff, the varsity said. “Taking cognisance of the ongoing pandemic situation, and the unprecedented distress caused to the student community, the mode of conduct of SEE/SEA for final year students for the academic programmes of the university was reviewed with a view to maintaining the highest academic standards, while ensuring the safety of students and staff,” Goa University registrar Radhika Nayak said in the circular issued on Friday. The directives state that wherever online examinations are proposed to be held, due weightage must be given to the previous semesters so that the overall performance of the students in the programme is accurately reflected. “The university has decided that in order to be eligible for the award of the degree, a student should have answered and cleared at least 66% of the SEE/SEA in physical/offline mode,” the circular states. However, in the case of professional programmes, the examinations for the programmes are to be conducted as per guidelines issued by the national regulators like Pharmacy Council of India, etc, wherever applicable.  “All examinations shall be conducted as per the guidelines issued for the specific programmes. However, in the case of all professional programmes governed by national regulators, the examinations will be subject to the guidelines of the respective regulators. A separate circular shall be issued for academic programmes where examinations are conducted annually,” the registrar said in the circular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-degree-only-if-66-tests-answered-in-physical-mode/articleshow/83471713.cms||---
---||Pune||Night curbs from 10.30pm in PMC areas, 6pm in PCMC limits||PUNE: The Pune police will implement the night-time curbs on movements from 10.30pm from Monday, while their Pimpri Chinchwad counterparts clarified that the restrictions would be enforced from 6pm. Commissioner of police (CP), Pune, Amitabh Gupta told TOI on Saturday, “We shall implement the night-time curbs on movements from 10.30pm instead of 10pm. This is because we are giving grace time of 30 minutes to enable people to reach home after visiting restaurants, food courts and bars, which will close by 10pm from June 14, according to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s order.” Gupta said commuters could travel from the PMC areas to the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits or vice versa till 10.30pm. “If caught by the police at nakabandi points/checkposts, people travelling with valid reasons would be allowed to travel. People found travelling without logical reasons would be fined (after 10.30pm),” he said. Additional commissioner of the Pimpri Chinchwad police Ramnath Pokale told TOI, “The night-time curbs on movements would come into force from 5pm, according to the PCMC order, but we are giving grace time of an hour to enable people to reach home by 6pm. We shall fine people if they are found travelling or venturing out without valid reasons after 6pm.” Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve said, “We shall ensure that people maintain Covid appropriate behaviour from Sunday. Our beat marshals will intensify patrolling and make good use of the public-address system to create awareness to avoid crowding at commercial establishments and marketplaces to contain the spread of the virus in the second wave though the number of positive cases has declined in the city.” Shisve said the shops had remained open till 4pm for more than a week. “The PMC order issued on June 11 states that the closing time for all essential and non-essential shops, places holding entertainment, political and social functions and outdoor and indoor sports activities would be extended till 7pm from Monday. But we do not anticipate rush or overcrowding at these places as unlock has started and is settling down. We feel that the crowd will get distributed in shops and malls in different areas evenly. We hope that the law abiding Puneites will continue to maintain Covid appropriate behaviour.” He said though shops, malls and other commercial establishments would shut by 7pm from Monday, people can visit restaurants, food courts and bars till 10pm. “We have no objection if people are visiting/travelling to these places after 7pm. We are implementing the PMC order. The guidelines issued by the civic body should be implemented by the public because it is for their own benefit and that of others,” he said. Shisve said the night-time curbs on movements would start from Monday at 10.30pm. “There will be no relevance of nakabandi points during the daytime. But there will be nakabandi points at important places during the night to ensure that people are following timings of returning home,” he said. The decision to offer more relaxations in the PMC limits was taken on Friday after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar conducted a review meeting. He had said the Pune civic areas warranted relaxations mentioned for cities categorised as level 2 under the state’s “break the chain” mandate because the PMC’s weekly positivity rate was less than 5%. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) decided to continue with the level 3 restrictions till next Friday. The only relaxation offered by the PCMC on Friday was allowing reading rooms, libraries and coaching classes for competitive exams to reopen at 50% capacity. No relaxations would be offered in the Pune rural areas next week, as advised by experts. The weekly Covid positivity rate was 9.6% there on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/night-curbs-from-10-30pm-in-pmc-areas-6pm-in-pcmc-limits/articleshow/83469911.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The circular was withdrawn after the minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant tweeted that the move had been stayed and a new plan would be worked out soon. A number of citizens visit the 411-acre campus for walks. The campus is also a preferred spot for many social and fitness activities. As per the circular released on Friday, the SPPU Oxy Park Scheme was to launch on International Yoga Day on June 21 and visitors aged above 13 would have to pay Rs 1,000 for a monthly pass and Rs 10,000 for an annual pass. The members were to fill a form, pay the fee and collect their ID cards from the university to utilise the facilities. People from economically disadvantaged families were to be given a 50% concession in fee. “Some regular visitors had given us the idea as they felt that if there was a club/membership pattern, they could get associated with the university and use various facilities like the gym/library. Since it is an open campus, having a tab on visitors would have also meant more campus safety. However, after the uproar, we have decided to stay the order completely now,” said Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, SPPU. However, the university had to withdraw the circular, after much uproar and Samant’s tweet on Saturday morning which said, “Savitribai Phule Pune University had decided to charge morning and evening walks at the university under the ‘SPPU Oxy Park’ scheme. The administration has been instructed to restructure the scheme by postponing this decision and a circular to this effect will be issued soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-withdraws-plan-to-charge-morning-evening-walkers/articleshow/83469927.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Matter of Pride: Inside Maharashtra’s first shelter home for trans members||How will my lipstick be visible?" wonders Nashik's Shagun when asked to wear a surgical mask before breaking into a jig for our camera. Zeba, her new friend from Kurla, too, chooses to wrap the thin blue mask around her wrist instead as the duo dance with feeling to a sultry Hindi number. It seems all masks--literal and figurative--have already been shed at Garima Greh, the newfangled shelter home for transgender (TG) persons in Kalyan whose yellow walls still sport balloons from the inauguration ceremony of June 4. Bobbing a red balloon up and down on her cot, Zeba says she is feeling lighter after having confided in the wise, English-speaking Rekha--one of her six new roommates--about the ghosts of her recent past including a roommate's death in Kurla. Referring not only to the six other TG occupants but also to the TG cook Dilbar and the cheerful TG project coordinator Tamanna Keni, Zeba says: "We've finally found our family." Set up by the National Institute of Social Defence (NISD)--a central advisory body for the central government's Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment---on the third floor of a chawl-like building in Kalyan east's Dwarli Pada, this first-of-its-kind shelter home for needy TGs in Maharashtra is being run by the Kalyan-based NGO Kinnar Asmita. According to the NISD guidelines, "it's open for those TGs who do not have any means of income, do not beg or do sex work and are below 60 years of age," says Tamanna, adding that inmates can stay there for a maximum of one year. The idea is not just about providing a roof. "We want to make them self-sufficient by empowering them with entrepreneurial skills such as paper-bag-making," says the NGO's president Neeta Keni, who had sent a proposal to NISD for the shelter home last year. But the lockdown conspired with age-old stigma to cause delays in finding a rental space. "Some people thought we were building a Covid hospital. Others were worried about HIV infections and illegal activities," recalls Neeta, who had to seek the help of local MLA Ganpat Gaikwad and Ulhasnagar corporator Rekha Thakur to land the space which costs Rs 40,000 a month in rent. Inaugurated on Thakur's birthday, Kalyan's Garima Greh--the first of three such shelters in the city--is finding its feet. Right now, both the doctor--who conducts regular check-ups of inhabitants--and the mental health counsellor sit at a table near Tamanna's desk for want of a cabin. To give them privacy during their sessions, the occupants shift to the other end of the room. Already, in the course of painting each other's lips a deep red, braiding one another's hair and helping Dilbar peel potatoes in the first-floor kitchen, the seven strangers seem to have forged a quiet sisterhood. Solapur's guilt-ridden Pheroza--who hopped onto a truck after her sister's wedding got broken last week because the groom's family "found me wearing flowers and make-up"-- has been unofficially crowned 'Selfie queen', Diva's Alka, who left her sister's home after growing tired of the name-calling, has been declared the inhouse make-up expert and the consensus on Bhiwandi's 52-year-old Rekha--whose command over English stems from nights spent with tourists in Goa during her youth--is that she is the youngest soul in the room. "I'll rock the floor," says Rekha and immediately hides her face with her new grey sari when asked to demonstrate her English oratory. The sari covers her eyes again when the memory of her erstwhile cement bed under the Bhiwandi bypass, makes her eyes well up. "Old-age for TGs is especially tough as they can't work," says Tamanna, patting Rekha gently, pulling her "chubby" cheeks and reminding us that "she is only 22 at heart". "Many are abandoned and have nowhere to go," adds Tamanna and the silent tears of Urmila Kamble, a soft-spoken sweeper from Ambernath, confirm her statement. Kamble has suffered aching joints, months spent sleeping on the railway platform brimming with abusive drug addicts and family members who look away when they cross paths. "Circumstances force them to think they can't do better in life. This mindset has to be broken," says "bridge coordinator" Sachin Tambe, sharing plans to convert the room above into an activity centre that will offer training in yoga, dancing and computer skills. Even as the shelter now waits for the flatscreen TV to be set up, it reminds Shagun of her favourite reality show in which a bunch of strangers are locked into a house. She quickly tut-tuts away any resemblance: "We're not here to fight."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/matter-of-pride-inside-states-first-shelter-home-for-trans-members-in-mumbai/articleshow/83469950.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Kolkata||Hotel satellite units being shut after case dip in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Satellite centres in hotels opened by hospitals during the peak period of the second wave are now gradually closing down following a sharp fall in positivity rate over the last fortnight. Even stadiums that were converted into field hospitals, like Kishore Bharati and Salt Lake stadium, are being utilized as vaccination centres by the hospitals. These units accommodated Covid patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, where the attached hospital treated them under the care and guidance of their medical teams. President of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) Sudesh Poddar told TOI that hospitals are now releasing hotel rooms that were used as satellite centres because of a sharp decline in the number of patients in the last two weeks. According to Poddar, in the first week of May, the peak period of the second wave in the state, around 2,200-2,300 rooms were still being used as satellite centres across 35-40 hotels. “The occupancy during the peak period was 90%-100% in most of them. At that time, it was difficult to get a bed. Now the occupancy level in such facilities has gone down to 10%-15% or less as a whole,” he said. The general manager of Lalit Great Eastern, Dilip Mishra, said the hotel has started the process to discontinue its satellite facility from Monday, June 14, as there is no patient now. Lalit Great Eastern had a tie-up with AMRI and had one of the biggest satellite facilities in the city with 100 rooms and 200 beds. “We are now preparing ourselves for normal guests,” he said. President of Associations of Hospitals of Eastern India, and Group CEO of AMRI, Rupak Barua told TOI the hospitals have started to close down satellite facilities as there is not much demand at present. “Most of the rooms in satellite facilities have been closed,” he said. According to Barua, AMRI had converted Salt Lake stadium into a Covid hospital, which is now being used mostly for vaccination. “We will continue the Salt Lake facility for sometime, as long as there is a risk of a third wave,” he said. The chairman of Medica Group, Aloke Roy, said the hospital was facilitating 5,000 vaccinations per day at Kishore Bharati Stadium, which had been converted into a Covid hospital in association with ITC. The tie-up between hotels and hospitals for satellite beds was a lifeline during the second wave of Covid. During the peak period, most of the hospitals had a waiting list of 100 patients. HRAEI had joined hands with the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) to solve the acute problem. HRAEI has over 800 members in Bengal and has 60,000 beds under its members. During the first wave of Covid, too, the association had offered over 1,000 rooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hotel-satellite-units-being-shut-after-case-dip/articleshow/83468803.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji
---||Pune||Will need 3 crore doses every month from July to cover key groups: Tope||Pune: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said he has sought three crore vaccine doses per month from the Centre to cover everyone in 18-44 and 45-plus groups in the next five to six months. So far, the state has administered 2.5 crore Covid-19 jabs. Tope told TOI plans are on to cover the rest of the 14.5 crore people within five to six months, with a daily target of 10 lakh jabs. He added that with the Prime Minister announcing free vaccinations for the 18-44 group from June 21, the state has been assured of a detailed vaccine supply plan. Tope said, “I had a detailed conversation with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, who said that within days, the Centre will unveil policy explaining how vaccines will be supplied to the state. The plan will include volume and the cold-chain arrangements Maharashtra will have to make, considering some of the shots will need -18°C storage temperature.” The state’s 5.71 crore people in the 18-44 beneficiary group will need nearly 12 crore doses. There are another 2.5 crore people in the 45-plus group, which will need five crore doses. “To cover these groups, the state will need three crore doses every month (from July),” Tope said.The state will also have to prepare for vaccines that’ll need ultra-cool storage. Its facilities can store doses between 2 and 8°C. But shots such as Sputnik V will need -18°C storage, Tope said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/will-need-3-crore-doses-every-month-from-july-to-cover-key-groups-tope/articleshow/83469939.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Now, it has become a subject of research as why pregnant women have not contracted mucormycosis. Mahila Chikitsalaya will send its patients’ samples to SMS medical college, which will conduct a study. Since the doctors at Mahila Chikitsalaya followed the same protocol of Covid treatment, which has been followed by other government-run hospitals of the state, which include steroids and oxygen therapy, the hospital claimed that pregnant women did not contract mucormycosis. “Not a single case of mucormycosis has been reported in the hospital till date,” said Dr Shalini Rathore, Covid incharge, Mahila Chikitsalaya. The SMS medical college’s microbiology lab will conduct genome sequencing of samples collected from pregnant women. Till date, around 1,200 pregnant women, who tested positive for Covid, got admitted to Mahila Chikitsalaya. Some of the pregnant women got severe symptoms and were given steroids and oxygen therapy. Besides, ventilators remained completely occupied at the hospital during most of the days in second wave. Since a lot of pregnant women were brought to the hospital in critical condition, 34 of them had died. Around 800 pregnant women were brought to the hospital for treatment who were Covid infected in 2020 and in 2021, around 400 pregnant women were rushed to the hospital for Covid treatment. Since the Delta strain, which has been found circulating in the state and dominated the second wave, the doctors are now assessing if the Delta strain is responsible for causing mucormycosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-mucor-case-among-pregnant-women-at-mahila-chikitsalaya/articleshow/83469930.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Long-distance help sacked, locals take over homes||KOLKATA: A re-run of last year’s restrictions got Kolkatans to add household chores to their workload after domestic helps stopped coming due to suspension of train services. A lot of these city residents are now replacing the ‘long-distance’ helps with local maids who can walk or cycle to the houses. This arrangement is turning out to be cheaper, too, since the local helps do not have to spend time and money travelling and many employers are allowing them to come to work even at odd hours. For Neha Sharma, business head of an outdoor publicity agency, who lives in Dum Dum, it was a nightmare again when her cook, who lives in Birati, was unable to come. “Luckily, my other maid who was engaged in sweeping and cleaning lives nearby and I asked her to take up the cooking job too,” she said. Sumana Konar, a fashion designer who lives in a complex on Ritchie Road, has given up both her maids who used to come from Baruipur for two others from the locality. “It was a long association for over a decade. One used to cook and the other did the housework and cared for my school-going daughter,” she said. Seema Sapru, a school principal, had worked by herself last year when her maids couldn’t turn up. This time, she has employed local help from the Baghajatin area. People in the Gariahat-Kasba areas mostly had maids coming in on trains from South 24 Parganas. Most of these helps have now been replaced by women living in the slums around Swinhoe Lane, Haltu and Dhakuria. “My maid has gone back to Namkhana. Thankfully, I can cook and she could be replaced with maids from the locality,” said Saibal Mitra, a maths tutor from Kasba. Many who have implemented this change in their homes are, however, a little dissatisfied with their new employees’ behaviour. Anirban Haldar, a digital marketing professional from Lake Road, said, “These urbanised women often get into arguments with us, which we are not used to.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/long-distance-help-sacked-locals-take-over-homes/articleshow/83468830.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Nagpur||Missing Std 1 in physical mode may hit transition phase of kids||Nagpur: One of the biggest impacts that the pandemic-induced online schooling has had is on younger kids who are in the process of transitioning from pre-primary to the formal education ecosystem which starts from Std I. Both, the last academic session as well as the one coming up, will see batches of Std I students progressing into the world of formal education without even stepping foot on the school campus. Academics say this threshold of Std I acts as a bridge between the ‘over protective’ environment of pre-primary to the more ‘independent’ formal schooling years. “They enter our campus gates as kids and leave as young adults in Std XII,” said Jayshree Bhake, principal of GH Raisoni Vidya Niketan (CBSE). “This Std I phase is extremely crucial because for the first time the child becomes more self-reliant and expressive. Academically, there’s a big change because subject-specific teachers are introduced, the number of hours and subjects also increase. During assembly, these kids would see or interact with older students and that helps in development of their social skills,” she said. Sonal Fuke, director of pre-primary school Toddler Creed, said, “School is not just about reading books. It also includes collaborative activities, face to face interaction with teachers and classmates. Due to online school, students don’t have access to these activities, their communication is limited with their families. The positive impact is that these students are adapting to the usage of technology which in a few years will become a huge part of our day to day lives.” Aruna Rao, principal of Central India Public School (Kamptee), said that even though online classes are of ‘high quality’, they are not a substitute for the conventional methods. “While innovative teaching methods are being used, the drawback was that students were not able to get access to physical classrooms and face to face interaction was missing between the student and teachers,” she said. Ashnaryan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said foundation years are extremely important. “Going from the play-way method of pre-primary to our formal set up in Std 1 is a process in which the child has to be eased into. Slowly, in one or two years they are acquainted with the campus, a friend circle is established, network or acquaintainces be it teachers or senior students also increases and that’s how the assimilation process takes shape. But with that not happening anymore, it will be only in Std III or IV that many of these kids will have that comfort level,” said Tiwari while clarifying that the difficulty will only be for introvert kids. Parent Dhaval Shah said that while from a health point of view it’s good that kids are at home, but there’s no denying that they are missing ‘something’. Shah said, “Forging friendships is something which they are missing out on. Going to the school ground and playing with new friends has all become a thing of the past. This of course affects their health too because now they are sitting in front of tabs and laptops which can cause eye problems.” Another parent, Priya Bhalotiya, feels that some aspects of physical schooling are indeed being missed by kids. “Schools are doing their level best to incorporate a variety of activities so that kids can concentrate but till they don't get that environment of physical classes they won't understand what it means to attend classes at school along with their classmates, meeting them regularly, etc.” However, parent Vanshika Betala feels that kids are adapting well even under the new teaching ecosystem. “I think online classes are working absolutely fine and even schools are putting in efforts to mould children’s personalities through this mode. The online system can be appropriate for the long run if right steps are taken by the school,” said Betala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/missing-std-1-in-physical-mode-may-hit-transition-phase-of-kids/articleshow/83469945.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: How doctors & medical staff keep themselves fit during Covid||JAIPUR: Doctors and para medical staff, serving during the pandemic have made it a point to take some ‘me-time’ to keep themselves rejuvenated. From playing cricket to cycling, from listening to their favourite music to reading, they regularly involve themselves in activities which they find de-stressing. TOI on Saturday spoke to various doctors and para medical staff to know what keeps them going in these times and the things they have been doing to de-stress themselves. “I played lawn tennis occasionally especially during January and February, when there was a dip in the cases. But on a regular basis, brisk walking is a must for me. Even if I leave from the hospital at 1am or 2am, I make it a point to get up in the morning and go for a walk,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of RUHS. He added that during the hospital hours, when he is not on the visit to the wards to see the patients, he listens to some of his favourite music. “I have never experienced the kind of pressure which we have seen since March 1. The phone keeps ringing and you are always surrounded by people, especially the attendants of patients. But you need to be calm in every situation,” he added. Likewise, Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller SMS Medical College listens to his favourite music to de-stress. “I have speakers installed at every corner of my house. Be it my bedroom, drawing room or reading room, I switch on my favourite songs. Also, I engage myself in some yoga early morning,” he said. Doctors say that they too have faced acute stress during the pandemic so far and have to turn to various things to de-stress. “Since my college days, I was inclined towards cricket. So, occasionally on Sundays, when there were no restrictions, I have been playing. I had played in some matches. To me, batting for an hour or more relaxes me,” said Dr Girish Chauhan, surgeon (Laparoscopic surgery), who is presently working at RUHS for Covid management. Similarly, the para medical staff have also turned to brisk walks, music and some of them have started learning cooking through Youtube. “I could only make tea and now, I can cook anything. I think cooking is the best thing to de-stress. After hospital, whenever I went to my rented room, I started cooking, from January onwards,” said Nilesh Maheshwari, a male nurse at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/how-docs-med-staff-kept-sane-during-covid-crisis/articleshow/83469937.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Hyderabad||Keep jewels in Hyderabad, Nizam’s kin Himayat Ali Mirza writes to PM Modi||HYDERABAD: Nizam's great grandson Himayat Ali Mirza has raked up the Nizam jewellery issue requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to relocate them in Hyderabad by setting up an exclusive museum in the city. Mirza has also offered to identify a suitable plot of land in the financial district for the museum where the jewellery of the last ruler of princely Hyderabad would be on permanent display. In a memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister on Wednesday, Himayat Ali Mirza, who is the grandson of Moazzam Jah, the second son of the Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan, urged Modi to keep the jewellery in Hyderabad as most of the diamonds used in them were mined from the Krishna river valley, popularly called Golconda mines in history and heritage parlance. “I can easily identify acres of vacant land which is in the environs of Hyderabad located almost in the heart of the financial district, for setting up the high-security display museum facility,” he said, adding that the Nizam’s jewellery are among the most coveted precious items available in the world and the most sought-after by institutions like Christies and Sotheby. These jewels in the early 1990s were sought to be auctioned and that too at a throwaway price. Himayat Ali Mirza said his mother Fatima Fouzia had filed a writ petition and ensured that the attempt to sell them to private parties was aborted. “It was at her insistence that the jewellery could be saved. It was later handed over by the trustees. They were sold for a very nominal sum of ₹217 crore to the government of India, which holds it as a national heritage,” he said. They are now valued at ₹1,00,000 crore He said many were shocked to realise that it was impossible to take photographs of the jewellery with a flash on because of the blinding glare reflected to such an extent that it was found it necessary to put tracing paper between the jewellery and the camera lens so that the flash would not result in a blinding reflection. “These jewels have no parallel anywhere in the world and can rightly be said to be a permanent wonder of the world,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/keep-jewels-in-hyd-nizams-kin-write-to-pm/articleshow/83469934.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Chandigarh||BJP disbands Asr IT wing, relieves OBC cell leader||Amritsar: With Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trying to secure their political future after severing of ties with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), the Amritsar unit of the party has dismantled its IT and social media wings, besides dismissing president of the OBC Morcha, saying they were “hijacked” by dissidents. Talking to TOI on Friday, Amritsar BJP president Suresh Mahajan said, “These people were appointed to further the party’s work and disseminate information among the general public about the party policies and the work done by the BJP leadership for masses, but they were working in the interest of one person,” he said, without naming former cabinet minister Anil Joshi. He (Joshi) had first questioned his own party’s stand on farmers, following which another senior BJP leader, Master Mohan Lal supported him. BJP sources said they were expecting a “few” more leaders to join the dissidents’ bandwagon in the near future. Sources in the party said the dissidents wanted BJP to expel them so that they could portray themselves as “martyrs” in the eyes of farmers. BJP general secretary and in-charge, Majha Zone, Jeevan Gupta said they had brought the issues raised both by Joshi and Lal to the knowledge of the party high command. However, he said they should have expressed themselves on the right platform. Gupta said if both the senior BJP leaders had any roadmap or formula to resolve the farmers’ agitation, then they should have brought it to the knowledge of the party leadership. Last year, two former confidants of Joshi, including BJP leader R P Maini left BJP to join SAD. To this, sources in the BJP said the party leadership believed that Maini joined SAD with the tacit consent of Joshi. He added that giving an ultimatum to one’s own party’s leadership was a clear sign of “mutiny.” Recently, Joshi had given an ultimatum to the BJP to clear its stand on farmers’ issues in 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-disbands-asr-it-wing-relieves-obc-cell-leader/articleshow/83470985.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Pune||Weekly review affecting traders & economic activities in Pune, says senior minister||PUNE: A group of state cabinet ministers is planning to call on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to seek a review of the “weekly positivity rate (WPR) assessment” mandated in the state’s “break the chain” order, based on which the administrators of bigger cities and districts have been told to offer relaxation in the curbs in their areas. A senior cabinet minister, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI that the opening and closure of establishments based on WPR was leading to widespread confusion among traders and even among the administrators executing the relaxation orders. TimesViewSeveral logistical issues are involved in the operation of bigger establishments. The policy asking such businesses to “start and stop” based on a weekly positivity rate review and oxygen bed status will hamper the economic activity. As suggested by experts, other parameters indicating a declining trend in cases and vaccinations carried out can be considered for a sustainable relaxation plan instead of a weekly “on and off” method. Simultaneously, the administration should ensure that Covid appropriate behaviour is strictly adhered to by the establishments allowed to operate, besides carrying out drives to vaccinate the staffers.The move to determine locking and unlocking based on WPR has caused unrest among the traders in Pune. They are uncertain if they would be allowed to operate in the coming week as a slight change in the positivity numbers would prevent the opening or might even have orders revised. The TOI had highlighted the concerns of traders and citizens because of the frequent changes in norms and a set of different curbs for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune rural limits in its June 12 edition. While the traders in the PMC limits welcomed the relaxations offered, civic chief Vikram Kumar’s rider that these orders would get revised if the current WPR crossed five next week came as a dampener. Most establishments, including malls and restaurants, need to make purchases in bulk and pay salaries of workers. Hence, an uncertainty about closure and opening affected their functioning, the traders complained. “I am aware of these concerns of traders and the confusion among the citizens. Some of my senior colleagues in the cabinet and I will speak to the chief minister on this in the next couple of days,” the senior minister said. Also, the state government had announced a lockdown till June 15 and as such a review meeting regarding the further plan was due shortly, he added. Local officials admitted that allowing businesses to operate according to the five different levels was very confusing, more so in the case of Pune district — divided into three administrative units to offer relaxations under the break the chain order. According to these norms, the PMC was placed at level 2 on Friday as its WPR was 4.95%. The PCMC, having a positivity rate of 5.2%, was placed at level 3 and Pune rural continued to be at level 4 even as its WPR had reduced to 9.6. “The opening and closing every week will definitely not be good either for economic activity or for controlling the spread. The levels are understood by the administrators and not the people at large. One cannot ask people to open for seven days and then go back to closure,” a senior officer said. “A general WPR and oxygen bed status alone will not help understand the situation thoroughly. Overall number of cases, positivity rate and the declining plateau should be considered as parameters for the relaxation policy,” a state task force member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weekly-covid-situation-assessment-affecting-traders-economic-activities-will-speak-with-cm-maha-minister/articleshow/83469948.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Similarly a girl from Pune is expected to get the medicine from crowdfunding. These are the two cases which keeps me motivated and my hopes alive. We are also expecting that we will be able to get the required money through crowdfunding as this is the only option available for me as arranging Rs 16 crore for the injection. So we request people to help us out in the times of crisis for saving life of my only baby,” said 29-year-old Zishan Ahmed, Fatima’s father who earns around Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per month. A shot of the US-manufactured drug Zolgensma, which is a one-time gene therapy, costs Rs 16 crore. This therapy will change genetic composition and synthesize SMN protein. In SMA, a body does not produce SMN protein, which causes SMA disease. “Ayaansh and the Pune girl live in bigger cities than Bikaner. It is difficult to reach people for crowdfunding and Covid is also a deterrent,” said Ramzan Hussain, uncle of the girl. He said, “We have managed to collect only Rs 40 lakh and we require another Rs 16.6 crore before October as the doctor has told us to get the injection within the first year of birth of the baby for better results.” “We are sharing details of Zishan Ahmed’s account number (37482054850, SBI, branch Jail Road, Bikaner, IFSC SBIN0030346) so that if anyone wants to help him to save his daughter can contribute,” said Shageer Ahmed, cousin of Zeeshan, who is helping in raising funds. The worry for the family is that they are not getting any financial support from the Centre or the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bikaners-family-hopeful-of-getting-r16-crore-injection-through-crowdfunding/articleshow/83469940.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

Born to a Bengali mother, Ruma Saha, and a Punjabi father, Narinder Kumar Chadha, Manek was into sports at school and had represented Bengal at the national level in both swimming and rowing. She had almost been barred from the Class XII board exam for poor attendance as she was away for four months training in Dusseldorf, Germany. It was only when the sports ministry spoke to the school that she was allowed to sit for the ISC exams. “At 18, I left for the UK on a rowing scholarship to Royal Halloway, University of London. The psychology course that I studied was secondary. It was only when I won an academic scholarship from University of Birmingham and pursued clinical research in postgraduation that I got interested in the subject,” she said. Currently, she is the director of business development and marketing at Britain’s National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network. She played a key role in supporting companies to bring vaccine trials to the UK, generate the data required for marketing authorisation and help with the development of the vaccine research registry. Even as the first lot of vaccines were being administered in the UK, she visited Kolkata to be with her parents. Her father, who had been her inspiration, died of a heart attack during the visit. “When I left India for the UK, my father gave me a flight ticket and £500, and told me: ‘Be good, do good and do something amazing that you get to meet the queen’. When they announced my name on the OBE list, my father’s words rang in my ears. It now truly feels like I have done something good. Maybe I will get to meet the queen because we have done something amazing,” she said. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-woman-gets-order-of-british-empire-honour-for-role-in-vax-trials/articleshow/83468869.cms||Subhro Niyogi

There was traffic congestion on the mall road. Even though most shops were closed due to the ongoing curfew, some hotels, particularly those on the outskirts, saw 5% to 10% occupancy. Meanwhile, several tourists took a dip in the Kempty Falls in violation of social distancing. Around 30 to 40 tourists gathered in the pool. “As soon as we received information, we removed the errant tourists from the pool and issued several challans. We will strictly ensure that such violations do not occur in the future,” said Dhanaulti sub divisional magistrate Sandeep Tiwari. On the Mall Road, many tourists were seen without masks. “The pandemic has not ended yet and such a large number of tourists roaming about town without masks is highly risky. Strict action must be taken to ensure tourists follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Pushpa Padiyar, a resident. Other local residents said that authorities must ensure tourists are coming to Mussoorie with RT-PCR certificates and hoteliers are strictly following Covid protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tourists-return-to-mussoorie-after-long-lull/articleshow/83468910.cms||Anmol Jain

The purpose: To allow families of those who succumbed to Covid-19, the opportunity to immerse the ashes in Varanasi, Haridwar, Prayagraj or Gaya. It’ll also facilitate families to conduct and watch the rituals (Shradha). Officials said that the Telangana postal department is currently short-listing the post offices from the city and other districts that will open its doors for these bookings. “Postal department officials are working out modalities to launch this unique facility for the benefit of hundreds of kith and kin of the deceased. People who are unable to travel to Haridwar, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gaya to immerse the ashes of their beloved family members due to lack of transportation problem, can avail of this facility,” said S Rajendra Kumar, chief postmaster general, Telangana postal circle. The state recently received the ‘standard operating procedure’ from the mail business division of the department of posts. The department has tied up with a socio-religious platform, Om Divya Darshan (ODD), that’s taken the responsibility of immersing the ashes, organising the Shradha rituals and also delivering ‘Ganga Jal’ to all those who enrol with them. It also offers a ‘live webcast’ of the ceremony to the bereaved family members during the Shradha ceremony. While the Asthis (ashes) have to be booked by the relatives of the deceased, the cost of sending Ganga Jal will be borne by ODD, said Rajendra Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asthi-visarjan-scheme-for-kin-of-covid-19-victims/articleshow/83470813.cms||Sunil Mungara

The daily toll in the state had touched 159 at the height of the second wave on May 1. India reported 80,627 new cases on Saturday, the lowest daily count in 73 days since 71,747 infections were recorded on March 31, as per TOI’s Covid database. The day’s death toll too dropped below 1,700 to 1,698, the lowest since April 19. This does not include 1,606 deaths from earlier days added to the overall toll by Maharashtra. The state added nearly 15,000 ‘backlog’ deaths since May 17. Odisha reported its highest daily toll so far of 47. Even as around 800 deaths in the state are yet to be scrutinised to ascertain whether these were due to Covid, there has been a comparative rise in the daily reports of fatalities for the past few days owing to the speedy audit of pending cases, government authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-daily-cases-hit-73-day-low-zero-deaths-in-jharkhand/articleshow/83474215.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Passing Out Parade held at IMA under Covid shadow, Indian Army gets 341 new officers||DEHRADUN: The Indian Army got 341 new officers after the Spring Term Passing Out Parade (POP) at the Indian Military Academy (IMA) on Saturday whereas 84 gentlemen cadets (GCs) from friendly foreign countries like Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Bhutan, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Tonga, Maldives and Kyrgyzstan were commissioned in their respective countries’ armies. The parade was reviewed by Lt Gen RP Singh, GOC-in-C, South-western command of the Indian Army.  Due to heavy rain and thunderstorm in the morning in Dehradun, the parade started with a delay of over 2 hours but the inclement weather failed to dampen the enthusiasm of the 425 GCs who followed Covid protocols like wearing of mask and ensuring social distancing, and marched to the tunes of ‘Colonel Bogey’, ‘Sare Jahan Se Achha’ and ‘Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja’ at the Drill Square in front of the historic Chetwode Hall which houses the administrative headquarters of the IMA and is also the hub of academic training for the GCs. The maximum cadets to pass out this term were from UP (66), followed by Haryana (38) and Uttarakhand (37). Punjab gave 32 officers to the Indian Army, whereas the number of cadets from Bihar were 29. Eighteen cadets passed out from Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir each. Addressing the GCs, Lt Gen RP Singh said, “This is a momentous occasion which shall be etched in your memory and treasured forever by you. These are extremely challenging times while the world battles with the Covid pandemic and witnesses a host of varied conflicts. You are stepping into an era typified by disruptive technologies, blurring definition of threats, expanding domains of conflict and an interplay of multi-polar complexities.” He added that “the external and internal challenges that our nation faces from adversarial forces are only set to increase as we rise to take our destined place in the new global order.” “As warrior leaders of the future, your awareness, proficiency and leadership has to therefore remain extremely dynamic and evolve constantly. The ‘Chetwode Motto’ must always remain at the core which accords priority to your nation and the men you command. Character, selflessness, empathy, risk-taking and firm resolve must guide you as young leaders. To inspire and motivate, there is no substitute to personal conduct and a soldierly ethos,” he added. The pipping ceremony -- in which family members formally put the stars on a cadet’s uniform marking his transition to officer -- was carried out by Army officers and instructors as visitors were not allowed at the POP due to Covid restrictions. A few GCs could be seen sharing the moment with their families via video calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/passing-out-parade-held-at-ima-under-covid-shadow-indian-army-gets-341-new-officers/articleshow/83468975.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Crimes are increasing by the day – murders and rapes occur frequently, and now child kidnapping. This is a complete failure of law and order in Goa. What is the home minister doing that he has no time to pay attention to the law and order situation?” GFP women’s wing president Ashma Sayed told reporters while referring to the case of kidnapping of an infant from GMC on Friday. Minutes later, GFP president Vijai Sardesai tweeted supporting Sayed’s statement. “Goa needs a full-time home minister, because under this incompetent CM/HM@DrPramodSawant – he has brought complete #lawlessness in the state & our innocent children are paying the price for his negligence!” Sardesai’s tweet read. Sayed said that BJP had promised that there would be zero tolerance against crimes against women. “With murders and rapes happening frequently, what will be the fate of Goa if it becomes a jungle raj. This wasn’t happening in Goa earlier. (If this continues), Goa’s identity will be lost,” Sayed said.

Only shops that are selling essential commodities are allowed to open on these days. The attempt of the government is to bring down the test positivity rate below 10%. The state which has been witnessing the lockdown from May 8 had gone for a triple lockdown in between and is again continuing with the lockdown till June 16. The state road transport corporation has suspended all its services for these two days. No parcel services were also allowed in the hotels. Only home delivery of food is allowed. However, there are complaints that the police had forcefully shut several supermarkets in various parts of the state. The police have restricted the movement of vehicles and only those people who are working with emergency services are allowed outside. Police have made it clear that severe fines would be imposed and action taken if anyone found violating Covid-19 protocols. On Saturday, the police registered 5,346 cases for lockdown violations and 10,943 incidents of people not wearing masks were reported. As many as 2,003 people were arrested and 3,645 vehicles were seized. The government will take a decision on whether to extend the lockdown on Monday. The chief minister is learnt to announce his decision in the review meeting convened on Monday on the Covid-19 situation in the state. Already, there has been demand from various quarters to end the lockdown and hence the government is likely to take a favourable decision. The chief minister himself had made it clear recently that the threat of the second wave is far from over in the state. He also cautioned that it is not time to relax. Hence what the chief minister decides in Monday’s meeting will be crucial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/will-strict-two-day-curbs-yield-results/articleshow/83469077.cms||---
---||Delhi||Promoting work from home among plans to deal with pandemics||NEW DELHI: Recognising the havoc that the Covid-19 pandemic caused, the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 calls for permanent arrangements to deal with such crises. The plan stresses on taking precautions and implementation of norms such as promoting decentralised workspaces and developing home-based work concepts. MPD41 aims to develop more community spaces with provision for kitchens for possible use as refuge areas during pandemics. It also seeks development of rental and ownership housing options for the poor and hostels for men and women to reduce crowding within dwelling units. An important agenda is developing multipurpose plots that can be used during such pandemics to create critical facilities. However, a civic official was critical of the idea. “The concept for mixed use development of plots in which a person can live as well as work while also able to avail of services like grocery and shopping to avoid going out or interacting with too many people sounds good, but these concepts are far from reality,” the official said. “There is already such a mess in commercial mixed land use areas that concepts like these can’t be implemented. Also, the city has reached its saturation and there are no vacant spaces available for such sites.” MPD41 seeks to promote decentralised workspaces in the form of co-working spaces and shared workspaces within slum rehabilitation projects that can support home-based work. Delhi Development Authority has also suggested the development of large green areas, mandatory creation of open areas, public spaces and plazas and reduction of built densities through planned regeneration. These will support the requirements of social distancing during pandemics while providing an active public realm in normal times. “See, DDA’s proposed concept isn’t possible to implement in already developed areas. In fact, in DDA residential neighbourhoods, there are hardly any provisions for planned parking, plazas or wide green patches, except parks,” pointed out Pankaj Aggarwal of Safdarjung Enclave RWA. “But yes, DDA is making an attempt to incorporate such a concept in its upcoming projects, which is welcome.” MPD41 also says that there is the need for the creation of multi-facility plots, particularly in dense unplanned areas, that can be used temporarily repurposed alongside other government facilities for disaster alleviation measures. “Better habitat design and green rated development shall be promoted to reduce the dependence on mechanical ventilation systems, which pose a threat during air-borne epidemics,” states the draft plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/promoting-work-from-home-among-plans-to-deal-with-pandemics/articleshow/83470956.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Restaurants, bars demand extended operating hours||MUMBAI: Restaurants, bars and retailers here expressed displeasure over a government decision to allow them to operate with a level 3 deadline of 4pm (full closure on weekends), when city has reached level 2 in terms of weekly Covid positivity rate. In level 2 cities like Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune, resto bars operate till 11pm even on weekends. In level 2, malls and theatres can operate with 50% capacity with normal closing hours. In level 3, malls and theatres cannot operate. Continuing with opening and closure of establishments as per level 3 is leading to confusion among traders and hotel owners. The move to determine locking and unlocking on the basis of weekly positivity rate caused unrest among traders, unsure if they will be allowed to operate the next week or call staff frequently, depending on levels. Now, officials are suggesting a biweekly positivity rate to avoid confusion and ensure smooth management of staff and services at establishments. “We are disappointed with the decision on restrictions for level 3 after the city moved to level 2. Restaurants and bars were looking forward to re-opening businesses once the city moves to the next level, but such decisions are destabilizing things, and make a mockery of the system and procedures announced by the administration,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, Association of Hotels and Restaurants, in a letter to civic chief Iqbal Chahal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-restaurants-bars-demand-extended-operating-hrs/articleshow/83470952.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

These roads are Laxmi Road, Bajirao Road, Shivaji Road, Tilak Road, Kelkar Road and Kumthekar Road. The officers will coordinate with road development, drainage and water supply departments to expedite the work in the next few days. Commuters have been facing hardships because of incomplete road repair work even after expiry of the deadline. The dug-up roads have reduced carriageways, leading to frequent traffic snarls. Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in PMC, said that regular updates would be sought from officers and the departments concerned on the restoration work. “A meeting of all authorities was held on Friday in which it was decided to appoint dedicated officers for all roads. Four engineers have been appointed at present for six roads. The officers will ensure completion of pending work,” he said. Bidkar said that the departments have been told not to take up any new road digging work. He said that the work related to bigger projects like 24X7 equitable water supply will continue, but with all necessary precautions. The administration had initiated replacement of 40-year-old drainage lines along Bajirao Road, Laxmi Road and Kelkar Road. However, work in some patches was pending, which delayed restoration. Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have sought completion of all pending work within the next few days. The pipeline laying and other work under the 24X7 water supply project will be initiated in a phased manner. For example, a strategy like digging a 100-metre patch, completing the work in that patch and then going for the next section will be adopted. Instructions are being issued to contactors not to dig up the entire road stretch, which would disrupt traffic.” Civic activist Vivek Velankar said that the restoration and resurfacing work should be carried out scientifically, else the condition of roads will deteriorate in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-appoints-dedicated-officers-to-expedite-pending-road-restoration-work/articleshow/83469990.cms||---

Talking to TOI on Friday, Amritsar BJP president Suresh Mahajan said, “These people were appointed to further the party’s work and disseminate information among the general public about the party policies and the work done by the BJP leadership for masses, but they were working in the interest of one person,” he said, without naming former cabinet minister Anil Joshi. He (Joshi) had first questioned his own party’s stand on farmers, following which another senior BJP leader, Master Mohan Lal supported him. BJP sources said they were expecting a “few” more leaders to join the dissidents’ bandwagon in the near future. Sources in the party said the dissidents wanted BJP to expel them so that they could portray themselves as “martyrs” in the eyes of farmers. BJP general secretary and in-charge, Majha Zone, Jeevan Gupta said they had brought the issues raised both by Joshi and Lal to the knowledge of the party high command. However, he said they should have expressed themselves on the right platform. Gupta said if both the senior BJP leaders had any roadmap or formula to resolve the farmers’ agitation, then they should have brought it to the knowledge of the party leadership. Last year, two former confidants of Joshi, including BJP leader R P Maini left BJP to join SAD. To this, sources in the BJP said the party leadership believed that Maini joined SAD with the tacit consent of Joshi. He added that giving an ultimatum to one’s own party’s leadership was a clear sign of “mutiny.” Recently, Joshi had given an ultimatum to the BJP to clear its stand on farmers’ issues in 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-disbands-amritsar-it-wing-hijacked-by-dissidents-removes-obc-cell-leader/articleshow/83471014.cms||Yudhvir Rana

It is suspected that they contracted the virus at the funeral as they were mingling with the gathering. Vanamala’s result of the rapid antigen test, conducted on June 4, came negative. But on June 5, she complained of breathlessness and was rushed to a hospital in Karimnagar where she succumbed. When Vanamala was not feeling well, Sandhya visited her mother. Sandhya started having health issues and was taken to a hospital in Karimnagar. After battling for a few days, she succumbed on June 11. Her grandmother also tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-and-daughter-fall-victim-to-virus/articleshow/83471052.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Along with the efforts of health officials, the strict actions by cops too contributed towards steep fall in the positive cases, said police officials. Total 78,508 persons were fined during the two months by the police and a cash fine of Rs 7.85 crore was collected. For the same period Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) fined 12,689 persons and collected fine of Rs 1.26 crore.In June, as the government announced relaxations in restrictions, police are continuing to penalize those caught without masks to prevent spread of infection again. “There are relaxations in restrictions but we are ensuring that people follow Covid appropriate behaviour. Police will enforce the rule strictly,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. Strict vigil by cops in containment areas deterred people from venturing out unnecessarily. Police registered cases against those found loitering outside despite being instructed to stay indoors by health officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). “People are already facing several problems such as lockdown-induced unemployment, loss in business and the fine collection drive is adding to their misery. Wearing a mask is important but it is suffocating as well,” said Akshay Ghoghari, a college student. “Police initially created awareness about the importance of masks by distributing free masks. But as the situation worsened we had no option but to be strict,” said a police officer. Police officials noticed that people started wearing masks as the situation became worse in April and most of those moving on the road were found wearing masks. The majority of the violators were found in market places where people without masks were present in the crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/1-mask-rule-flouter-fined-every-minute/articleshow/83467149.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Delhi||Pedestrian-only stretches back in focus in MPD draft||NEW DELHI: Delhi is currently experimenting with two major pedestrianisation projects in Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh. If proposals made by the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 are implemented, many more pedestrian-only streets will be seen in commercial and mixed-land use areas. The draft plan recommends that local bodies convert streets below 9m right of way — road width — in marketplaces into pedestrian stretches. “Local bodies shall prepare plans for improving traffic management, parking and public spaces along existing streets,” MPD 41 adds. A senior municipal official said the concept of pedestrian shopping streets was also part of MPD 2021 but it did not materialise, but with a renewed thrust on walkability, these proposals might come to fruition this time. “Hundreds of small stretches with the right of way less than 6m were declared pedestrian-only in 2006 to save commercial establishments from sealing at that time. But not much has changed on the ground,” the official added. “In many cases, conditions have further worsened. But the current draft has much more emphasis on walkability and bicycle infrastructure.” The 2006 notification by the urban development department lists 430 such pedestrian stretches spread over 11 different administrative zones. Civil Lines with 116, Sadar Paharganj with 134 and Shahdara South zone with 124 stretches share the largest chunk, while south Delhi’s Central zone has 20, South zone eight and West zone two such roads. TOI had earlier carried out an on-ground check to find that many of these stretches have been further encroached upon and traffic movement continues. The new master plan will once again put focus on these smaller pedestrian shopping streets. Under the section on shifting to shared mobility, MPD 41 states that the agencies and the traffic police will identify specific areas with heavy footfall such as tourist hotspots and markets as “pedestrian-only” zones. “Tactical urbanism measures to convert streets into fully pedestrian zones for specific time durations to be encouraged, so that overall traffic flow is not hampered,” the draft points out. The street design regulations, which are now part of the draft, state that if pedestrian traffic is greater than 8,000 per hour on the streets with the road width of 18m or less, the entire road width should be notified for pedestrianisation. “Streets may be considered for pedestrianisation even if pedestrian traffic is lower than 8,000 per hour, depending on the potential to improve economic activity and safety and convenience,” it adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pedestrian-only-stretches-back-in-focus-in-mpd-draft/articleshow/83471037.cms||Paras Singh

In government hospitals, 539 oxygen beds are now available. They also have a centralized oxygen distribution system. In addition to this, 957 oxygen cylinders are also kept ready in government hospitals to meet any emergency situation, said health department officials. In the district hospital, which is a fully Covid-19 treatment centre, 58 oxygen beds are available. In Kinfra Kanjikode 260 oxygen beds are available; Mangode Medical College (100); Pattambi taluk hospital (36); Mannarkkad taluk hospital (45); Ottapalam taluk hospital (30) and Women and Child hospital (1). Thus there is no shortage of oxygen beds in the district now, said CFLTC nodal officer Dr Jyothymary Wilson. In the Covid first-line treatment centre being set up at Plachimada Coca Cola building, 100 beds will be arranged with centralized oxygen supply. There will be a total of 500 beds available for Covid-19 treatment here. In Attapadi in the Agali community health centre 30 centralized oxygen beds are available, Wilson said.

---||Hyderabad||12 defected MLAs must resign: Cong||Hyderabad: Congress has demanded that the 12 party MLAs who had defected to TRS must resign from their MLA posts or chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should ask them to resign. Former MP and Telangana Congress working president Ponnam Prabhakar on Saturday said former minister Eatala Rajender had resigned to his MLA post before formally joining BJP. “This is the proper and ethical way of leaving a political party to join another political entity. Eatala is most likely to seek re-election from Huzurabad on a BJP ticket. Likewise. even the defected Congress MLAs should resign and seek re-election on TRS ticket because they had won from their respective constituencies on Congress ticket,” Prabhakar said. In June 2019, 12 Congress MLAs, who constituted two-third of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), had joined the ruling TRS Legislature Party (TRSLP) in the assembly. As a result, Congress strength fell from 19 to six, and it lost the Opposition party status in the assembly. The assembly secretariat later issued a bulletin confirming the merger of the CLP with TRS. Though 19 Congress candidates were elected MLAs, TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy had resigned from his Huzurnagar assembly seat following his election from Nalgonda Lok Sabha seat, and later the party could not retain the seat in bypoll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/12-defected-mlas-must-resign-cong/articleshow/83469089.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Private hospitals in Mumbai can’t place vax orders as new norms kick in||MUMBAI: Private hospitals involved in Covid vaccination in Mumbai have not been able to place fresh orders for stocks from manufacturers since June 7. This follows the Central health ministry’s guidelines dated June 8 that said states would “aggregate the demand of private hospitals keeping in view equitable distribution between large and small private hospitals and regional balance.” An official with the Serum Institute of India confirmed no new orders from private hospitals or hospital chains were being accepted since June 7. However, the Maharashtra government is not clear about its role in this private hospital drama. On Saturday, a senior health official told TOI that the Centre hasn’t yet taken the final call on whether states should get into the facilitators’ role. Another official said it is optional. When contacted, state National Health Mission director N Ramaswami said matters would get clearer in the coming week. “A few states had said they wouldn’t be able to monitor the private sector and wanted a centralised procurement and distribution system, but we are expecting a clearer directive in the coming week,” he said. The state government’s plan is to appoint a nodal officer to oversee the procurement and costing by private hospitals. “The price of the vaccines has been decided. The quota for the private sector has been fixed at 25%. The service charge for private hospitals has been fixed at Rs 150. The state has to monitor that all the rules are being followed,” said a senior doctor from the public health department. In Mumbai, due to paucity of vaccines with the public sector, private hospitals dominate the drive. On Friday, for instance, 77% of the 53,427 shots were given by private players. Many big-name hospitals have bought stocks that could last them for a month. “Some clarity should be available before the June 21 deadline that prime minister Narendra Modi set for the Centre’s new policy to kick in,” said a doctor. Joy Chakraborthy of Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, said the hospital vaccinates over 2,000 people a day at its hospital and at corporate offices. “We have stocks to last us until July 15 or more,” he said . TOI had reported on Saturday about how private hospitals would be allotted doses based on location and demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/private-hosps-in-mumbai-city-cant-place-vax-orders-as-new-norms-kick-in/articleshow/83470060.cms||Malathy Iyer

Biryani, who was imprisoned in Ahmedabad, had jumped the parole on February 20. He kept low for quite some time and continued to fox cops. A police official said that most accused used to show up in Godhra and their whereabouts could be traced. “It was not difficult to trace them and ensure that they are nabbed, but Biryani was much smarter and ensured that he evaded being nabbed again,” said an official. It is believed that Biryani was always wary of being nabbed and did not spend a lot of time at any place. He was present at a hotel in Popatpura when the police raided the place and nabbed him. Besides the train carnage, Biryani has been named as an accused in other serious offences too. He was arrested in March 2002 in connection with the train carnage case that took place on February 27, 2002 killing 59 persons. The incident had sparked widespread communal riots in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/godhra-carnage-accused-who-jumped-parole-arrested-again/articleshow/83469002.cms||---
---||Ranchi||UNICEF donates 20L masks, 800 O2 concentrators to Jharkhand||Ranchi: The UNICEF on Saturday donated 800 oxygen concentrators and 20 lakh masks, among others, to chief minister Hemant Soren to help the state government in its fight against Covid-19. UNICEF’s chief of field office (Jharkhand unit) Prasanta Dash met the CM and a few health department officials in Ranchi to hand over the supplies. Hemant, while thanking the UN agency, said, “We appreciate UNICEF’s support in this critical period. UNICEF has been a valued partner in Jharkhand and I am sure that these critical supplies will help the most vulnerable receive medical aid and help us win the fight against Covid-19. The UN agency’s life-saving work is commendable and I thank them for their assistance.” Besides the oxygen concentrators and masks, UNICEF has also donated cold chain equipment and RT-PCR machines to the health department, Dash said. “In the past one year, the healthcare system has been put under a lot of strain. There is immense pressure on the doctors and nurses and despite their best efforts, much remains to be done for providing timely medical help to the patients. As part of our technical support, we decided to provide the government with critical care supplies,” he said, adding, “These equipment will strengthen the state’s fight against Covid-19.” The state unit of UNICEF is also working closely with the National Health Mission and other government departments to promote Covid-appropriate behaviour, including wearing of masks, frequent sanitisation of hands and maintaining physical distance, among the commoners. “We have strengthened our communication and community-engagement programmes, including generating age and gender-tailored messages in order to provide guidance to the care-givers. We are also providing essential items like soap and detergent to the high-risk and vulnerable population to help them maintain a basic hygiene level,” Dash said. The CM was flanked by additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh and his secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey who also expressed their gratitude to UNICEF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/unicef-donates-20l-masks-800-o2-concentrators-to-jharkhand/articleshow/83470021.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Monsoon arrives in Jharkhand through Sahibganj, Pakur||Ranchi: The southwest monsoon entered Jharkhand on Saturday from the northeastern districts of Sahibganj and Pakur instead of its usual path, the southeastern district of East Singhbhum, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. In its afternoon bulletin, the IMD said the southwest monsoon has further advanced into some parts of Jharkhand. "The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) passes through Diu, Surat, Nandubar, Raisen, Damoh, Umaria, Pendra Road, BOlangir, Bhubaneshwar, Baripada, Purulia, Dhanbad in Jharkhand and Darbhanga in Bihar," the bulletin said, adding that the conditions are favourable for further advance of the southwest monsoon into the remaining parts of Jharkhand during the next 24 hours. Acting director of IMD Ranchi office, Abhishek Anand, said a low-pressure belt over northwest Bay of Bengal adjoining Odisha and the Gangetic West Bengal coasts is likely to become more marked and move west-northwestwards across Odisha, Jharkhand and north Chhatisgarh during the next two to three days. "Depending upon the movement of the low-pressure belt, almost the entire state is likely to receive light to moderate rainfall during the next five days," Anand said. In its forecast for the next five days, the weather office has also issued alerts for heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated parts of the state. "Under the influence of the low-pressure area which is shifting north-northwestwards, widespread rainfall activity along with isolated heavy to very heavy rain is likely over the districts of Jharkhand during next five days," Anand explained. Though the monsoon system has hit the northeastern districts comprising Sahebganj and Pakur and was over Dhanbad, other parts of the state also received rainfall under the influence of the monsoon system. The highest rainfall of 96mm was recorded in Hazaribag, followed by Maithon in Dhanbad with 57.2mm rainfall. "Ranchi recorded 50.4mm while light rainfall of 3.5mm was witnessed in Daltonganj and 2.2mm in Jamshedpur," Anand said. Weather scientist and agromet advisor at the Birsa Agriculture University, Dr A Wadood said the timely arrival of monsoon is a boon for the farmers, who were otherwise financially hit because of the pandemic and the lockdown. "Jharkhand has received adequate pre-monsoon showers enabling the farmers to prepare their fields. This time, the state agriculture department was also proactive in the timely distribution of seeds. As the monsoon has also arrived on time, the farmers have ample time to sow seeds and the coverage is expected to be almost 100% this season," he said. Wadood pointed out that timely sowing helps in getting bumper harvests. Other agriculture experts believe that under conducive conditions, the paddy yield is expected to reach 50 lakh metric tonnes on 18 lakh hectare of land utilised for Kharif cultivation. Commenting on the extraordinary sickle-shape NLM, Waddod said it was because of the extra curve that the monsoon entered from northeastern districts. "Though the monsoon seems to be advancing in normal speed, the extra curve indicates that the Arabian Sea component of the monsoon is more active than the Bay of Bengal component of the southwest monsoon," Wadood said expressing concern that unless the Bay of Bengal component strengthens, rainfall activity over Jharkhand and adjoining places may be subdued later. "There is no scientific basis for my concern but I have observed over the years that whenever the Arabian Sea component is stronger, monsoon activity gets subdued," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/monsoon-arrives-in-jharkhand-through-sahibganj-pakur/articleshow/83470074.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The report on the status of malnourishment in the city claims that the study, conducted in April, covered around one lakh children below five years and it was found that 2.5% of them were malnourished with stunted growth. The document has been submitted to the government for action planning. According to officials of the women and child development department, the survey was carried out by Anganwadi workers using anthropometric measurements (it includes measurement of height, weight and body mass index (BMI). During the survey, visible signs of weakness and stunted growth were recorded and most number of such children were found in the urban areas. “The study has found that slums have the maximum number of malnourished children. These kids mostly belong to families of migrant workers and are living under extreme conditions with poor state of hygiene, sanitation, and drinking water. The survey was conducted to assess the situation that will form the basis of our intervention to improve the nutritional status of these children,” said Sunaina Khatri, the district programme officer. The department now plans to coordinate with the health department and conduct medical screening of these children. It will determine the kind of medical care and nutritional support each child needs. “We are reaching out to industries and corporations and inviting proposals under their CSR activities. They can help us provide nutritional meals and other support that these children need,” Khatri added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/nearly-2500-kids-in-gurgaon-are-malnourished-says-study/articleshow/83471175.cms||---

In a press statement, CRPF said it has eliminated an armed Maoist cadre of the Chhotu Khairwar group after an encounter at the forested area of Kookoo Piri in the morning but the villagers claimed that it was stage-managed and said the deceased was one Brahmadev Singh of their locality. Latehar SP Prashant Anand intervened in the matter to pacify the irate villagers and agreed to verify the antecedents of the deceased. According to the CRPF's statement, a joint operation comprising two troops of 203 CoBRA battalion, two assault groups of Jharkhand Jaguar and one company of 214 Battalion of the CRPF went to the forests of Latehar where an encounter took place around 8.30 am. “The troops later recovered the body of a Naxalite and four weapons,” the statement said. However, Anand said the deceased could be a villager. “Villagers usually venture into the forests to hunt wild boars with country-made guns and according to preliminary information, it could be one of the villagers who came in the crossfire,” Anand said. Local police said the weapons recovered are country-made firearms but claimed that the villagers who went hunting into the forest fired on the security forces in nervousness and in self-defence the security men retaliated. The villagers are, however, not ready to buy the argument saying that forest dwellers do not venture for hunting on Saturdays and claim that the deceased was killed in cold blood and another sustained injuries in his arm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoist-killed-by-crpf-in-gunfight/articleshow/83469992.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

SP Rishav Kumar Jha said acting on a tip-off, he formed a team and arrested the smugglers swiftly. Those arrested included Himanshu Kumar alias Honey, who is the BJP youth wing member. Jha said he got information that one Dheeraj Kumar, a resident of Kesri Chowk of the town area, was peddling the contraband item for supply to his customers. Dheeraj was caught “red-handed” with 2.1 gms of brown sugar. Based on his information, the eight other members of his gang including Honey, were arrested. The other seven arrested were identified as Amit Gupta, the supplier of the illegal item, Anurag Kumar, Chandan Kumar, Nawal Dangi and Prem Dangi, Roshan alias Bhagirath Dangi and Abhishek Thakur. He also said police have seized 296gm of brown sugar, a car, a bike, eight mobile phones and Rs 7.74 lakh cash from their possession. “Amit, Honey, Anurag and Chandan were caught travelling in an SUV and seized 3.2 gm of brown sugar and the cash from them,” Jha said. Chatra is becoming a hotbed of illegal drug trade in the wake of widespread cultivation of poppy and opium, which are used in the manufacture of brown sugar. Jha said from May 1, 2020, to June 10, 2021, police have recovered 572 kg of opium, 2.241 kg brown sugar besides more than nine quintal ganja (marijuana) from different smugglers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-youth-leader-among-nine-held-with-300gm-brown-sugar/articleshow/83470034.cms||---
---||India||Soon, dabbawalas won’t just drop off lunch, but cook it too||Sexagenarian Yamnaji Ghule is a worried man. The second generation dabbawala is not sure of what to make of his future emerging from a pandemic that dished out a blow to the humdrum of his decades-old vocation of delivering cooked lunches to Mumbai’s office-goers. “We’ve worked through the worst situations... rains, floods, terror attacks but never seen anything like this before. My team of seven dabbawalas used to make around 20 deliveries in a day between Mahim-Worli-Sion and now not more than four,” said the veteran tiffinwala who had returned to his village Rajgurunagar in the Khed taluka of Pune to farm for his survival for the first eight months of the pandemic. “I came back to Mumbai in January when deliveries restarted but it’s stopped again. I’ll have to wait and watch. I’ve been doing this for more than 40 years, it’s the only work I know,” he frets. Mumbai’s 130-year-old dabba distribution fleet has been a legendary workforce of 5000 tiffin carriers like Ghule — picking up food from home cooks and delivering to two lakh office-goers on their cycles and local trains — to meet the daily “tiffin” needs of the city’s rapidly expanding working population. As Covid changed culinary culture, delivering hot lunches that would fetch dabbawalas a monthly earning of Rs 14,000 to 20,000 was suddenly down to nil. Following lockdown, around 3000 dabbawalas — mostly from Pune, Junnar, Ambegaon, Mulshi, and other parts of Maharashtra — retreated to their hometowns. “When offices started opening up last June, we were able to restart our services but with 300-400 dabbawalas. Now in the second lockdown, there’s work for only 100-150,” explained Ulhas Shantaram Muke, president of the Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust, ruing the loss of old customers who had transitioned from “once-in-a-while” cook to a new work-from-home normal of realising the virtues of cooking at home. Struggling to resume services, they found a new breed of tiffin takers — Covid care facilities, people in home quarantine, isolation centres and healthcare workers in hospitals. Even as some took to moonlighting as watchmen or tied up with farmers to deliver fresh produce, and found a helping hand from restaurateurs like Riyaaz Amlani who teamed up with them to tide over losses, it wasn’t enough to sustain. Mumbai’s dabbawalas saw their business plunge by nearly 90% with most offices in Mumbai still closed. But there is no turning back the wheel. The world of lunchbox carriers has been a resilient lot — constantly reinventing itself — English lessons, computer literacy, women entering the all-male bastion and ditching bicycles for motorbikes. Looking for fresh ways to tackle the new world order and their trade, the modern dabbawala — increasingly intuitive about the sway of digital marketing and food delivery startups — is in for yet another change. The tiffin carriers will no longer just be dropping off lunch boxes at people’s homes but will also be rustling up a seven-day rotating menu of lightly-cooked home-style lunches in a “cloud kitchen”, aimed at time-starved millennials. “We’ve taken up a 1000 sq ft community kitchen in Saki Naka that was lying unused in the pandemic. Some of our dabbawalas and their wives are currently being trained by an F&B expert on hygiene, storage and culinary skills and we should be ready to launch our new service by mid-June,” informs Ritesh Andre, 25 a fourth generation dabbawala with an MBA degree who chose to use his skills to reinvent a culture founded by his great grandfather. “We’re creating a website where people can directly place their orders. One can choose between monthly or annual subscriptions and we’re also introducing online money transfer to make payments easier. Dabba services have always depended on cash transactions, a reason why most dabbawalas didn’t have savings or even bank accounts and led to major financial difficulties during the pandemic,” says Andre who plans to harness technology to ease processes but remains mindful of their time-honoured tiffin distribution model. “Our dabbawalas aren’t tech savvy like the delivery boys in e-commerce. The idea is to use their unique sorting skills to diversify, generate employment, bring stability and pride in what is India’s oldest food delivery chain,” explains Andre pointing at their intrepid new avatar which will allow people to choose between mini meals (two rotis and two sabjis) and regular meals (two rotis, two sabjis, a portion of rice and dal, pickle, papad and salad) — which dabbawalas will prepare, pack and deliver from Dahisar to Churchgate and Ghatkopar to CSMT in specially designed two-tier and four-tier dabbas — in a fresh twist to their colour-alphabetic-numeric code to identify where to deliver the stainless steel dabbas everyday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soon-dabbawalas-wont-just-drop-off-lunch-but-cook-it-too/articleshow/83474640.cms||Mohua Das
---||Nagpur||‘Vehicle scrappage policy will only benefit the auto industry’||Gautam Sen, the vice president (external relations) at Fédération Internationale de Véhicules Anciens (FIVA), the international federation for historic vehicles, feels that the vehicle scrappage policy will only help the country’s automobile industry. Sen, who founded India’s first newsstand car magazine Indian Auto in 1986, is directly associated with the automobile industry in India and Europe. He has worked with eminent designers such as Gerard Godfroy, Tom Tjaarda and Marcello Gandini. Since 2010, Sen has also published several critically acclaimed books on automobiles.In an interview to TOI, Sen said both scrapping of old vehicles and deregistration of 15-year-old vehicles will not help in bringing down emission. Excerpts...Q. What kind of changes have you seen in India’s auto industry?A. In the 80s, I started the country’s first car magazine ‘Indian Auto’. In those times, we had only three Indian companies — Hindustan Motors, Fiat and Standard Motors. Then came Maruti in 1984 and by 1986, the numbers grew with five car makers. But at that point of time, the two-wheeler industry was already booming. Since then, there has been a massive rise in the number of vehicles even though the state-of-the-art cars designed in the 1950s like Ambassador, Premier Padmini etc. were immensely popular in the 80s. In those days, cars were in good demand, unlike today. In that sense, the industry has completely transformed as at that time we were a fledgling young industry and today, it’s a very mature industry with the largest tractor manufacturers, second largest two-wheeler manufacturers and top five car makers. India’s current auto technology matches world standards.Q. What is Fédération Internationale de Véhicules Anciens all about and in what way is it connected to India?A. FIVA is a 55-year-old organization established in 1966. It is a federation of different bodies and clubs dealing in historic vehicles. FIVA works towards protecting, promoting and preserving the history of vintage cars. FIVA has a presence in 85 countries, has more than 105 members and represents about five million people the world over. The need for such a conglomeration of bodies of classic vehicles was necessitated as governments across the globe cite high vehicular emissions as the reason to bury vintage vehicles into obscurity. While FIVA believes it is a part of the automobile history, the government thinks that these cars/vehicles will be used on a daily basis but the fact is that they should be allowed for occasional use is something we feel is part of our heritage and FIVA is there to protect that. Q. What are your views about the transport ministry’s argument that getting rid of an estimated 9 million old vehicles will mean cleaner air and boost automobile sales? A. Yes, it will boost automobile sales. The reason why countries have vehicle scrappage policy is primarily to benefit the automobile industry. For every car that you junk, you are probably replacing three to four new vehicles on the road.Q How does India’s V-VFMP compare with similar programmes in Europe, USA and the far East? A. China is one country which has a compulsory vehicle scrappage policy. Vehicles that run over 6,00,000km or are more than 15 years old are scrapped in China. So the sale of new vehicles on an average has been topping 20-23 million in the last few years, whereas scrappage is four to five million. How can pollution levels be controlled by scrapping old vehicles?. It is completely illogical and the argument that scrapping vehicles will mean less air pollution is honestly rubbish. To clean up the air there are other ways to do it and China has a solution. In Beijing, the public transport vehicle share is only 3%. People use their private vehicles only to go to office and back. Rest of the time they use public transport. So, these 3% vehicles contribute to almost 30% of pollution in Beijing. So, they decided to convert these 3% vehicles into electric on priority and bring down emission by 30% or so.Q. The transport ministry has notified that all vehicles owned by the Central, state governments, PSUs and local self government bodies shall be automatically deregistered after 15 years. Is deregistration not a burden on the exchequer?A. If the usage of vehicles is minimal or most of them carefully maintained, it should be allowed. In Kolkata, the Army (eastern command) has a beautiful Austin Sheerline, a Dodge Kingsway and a Mercedes Benz used by General Niyazi in the 1960s. These vehicles are all part of their staff cars. Won’t it be a criminal to discard a part of our history? Scrapping such vehicles of heritage value would be wrong and instead, they should promote preserving vintage vehicles.Q. The transport ministry has notified via a draft policy about preservation of vintage vehicles by classifying them as 50-year or older ones. A. The reasoning is simple: 50 years or more will knock off General Niyazi’s Mercedes Benz. India’s specific automobile industry is between 30 and 50 years. Our automobile industry, especially two-wheeler, started growing in the ’70s and cars emerged in the ’80s. If we consider the 50-year mark for preservation of vintage vehicles then we obviously have to scrap all vehicles manufactured in the 1970s and 80s. A major chunk of India’s own automotive industry will be destroyed.Q. With the imminent changeover from internal combustion engine to electric vehicles in the future, how do you see the scenario unfolding for India?A. There are cars which are being accepted by more and more people across the world. It has a limited range. People can’t use multiple vehicles. Today, EVs are a luxury. People who have electric vehicles use these only intra-city. Q. In what way can we make EVs more user-friendly?A. It is a question of battery technology. In another two to three years or so there will be batteries which will have enough range to use EVs on almost a daily basis. EVs will be going to be much more expensive and the government must give encouragement by giving rebates in taxes.Q. Despite a historic record, is the government promoting collection of vintage vehicles? A. I don’t think the government is doing so. But some states have funded museums to preserve vintage vehicles. Many people are doing that to get some benefit from the government and that’s the reason people are putting together a collection of vintage vehicles. Of course, it’s a very elitist hobby. If you have a big collection and can afford to have a museum then you have an advantage. If you just own two or three cars, you are nobody. In that sense, the government is nothing for them, as we are not a rich country. Actually, the government is discouraging them and helping richer collectors. The new policy, which India is bringing, will encourage only big collectors and small collectors will be finished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vehicle-scrappage-policy-will-only-benefit-the-auto-industry/articleshow/83470206.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

This section is part of the 31.2km long Akshardham to Baghpat stretch of the EPE. “Work on the second section, which is from UP Gate to Baghpat, has already started. Tenders for the stretch from Akshardham to UP Gate had been floated in January this year. A total of 13 companies have shown interest. By next month, we hope to award the work order. Construction of the road will start soon after that,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. The 6-lane access-controlled corridor, Garg said, would provide seamless connectivity to western UP districts from Delhi via Ghaziabad. “The project was conceived to decongest Delhi and reach Baghpat. It now takes at least 3 hours to cover the distance. But this corridor will reduce the travel time to less than 30 minutes,” he added The 31.2km stretch will further connect with the 155km long NH-709B, which leads to the Saharanpur Bypass. The NH-709B project is being constructed in four packages — Akshardham to Loni, Loni to Baghpat, EPE intersection-Shamli Bypass and Shamli Bypass-Saharanpur Bypass. Work on the EPE intersection-Shamli Bypass section started in February 2019, while that on Shamli Bypass to Saharanpur Bypass stretch in January that year. There is also a plan to extend NH-709B to Dehradun. “The distance between Delhi to Dehradun is 235km and it takes more than 5 hours to cover the journey. But if the entire stretch becomes operational, it will reduce the distance by about 68km. It will then take just 2.5 hours to reach Dehradun from Delhi,” said Garg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/work-on-delhi-baghpat-stretch-may-start-in-july/articleshow/83470275.cms||Abhijay Jha

A rare and complicated ‘Superior Capsula Reconstruction’ surgery performed by orthopaedic surgeon Dr Mukesh Laddha has brought back her arm movement. In this procedure, the surgeon transplanted a muscle from the woman’s thigh into her shoulder.Dr Laddha claimed that it was the first such surgery performed in Central India.“The supraspinatus tendon in the shoulder, a very important muscle in the rotator cuff, was broken after the woman tackled a thief at her hometown in Uttar Pradesh. Proper diagnosis on time could have helped correct it through telescopic surgery. Due to delay in treatment, the arm movement stopped completely,” said Dr Ladhdha.The patient told the doctors that she couldn’t even move her hand up and down and there was tremendous pain too. Doctors then decided to conduct Superior Capsular Reconstruction surgery.“Harvesting a similar type of muscle from thigh and implanting it in the shoulder is a very difficult and complicated task. The procedure was developed by Dr Teruhisa Mihata in Japan who has refined the technique in such a way that many shoulder surgeons around the world can successfully and reliably perform this very complex operation,” said Dr Laddha.Rotator cuff strains or tears are caused by overuse or acute injury. In this the tendons that connect muscles to bones can overstretch (strain) or tear, partially or completely. Many patients unknown to this cause keep on suffering from the pain and shoulder-lock like situation for years. The rotator cuff can also strain or tear after a fall, accident, or another sudden injury. According to doctors, if diagnosed early, such tears can be repaired with the help of telescopic surgery.It will take near six months for the patient to recover fully. Doctors said she will be able to move her hand in a normal way after physiotherapy for a few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thigh-muscle-transplanted-into-shoulder-to-restore-arm-movement/articleshow/83470326.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

After landing at Heathrow, he was taken on a three-hour bus journey to a hotel in Swindon, 106km from the airport, where he was given two single beds and a cot for his entire family – and nothing but pizza for dinner. Apart from having to sleep on the floor despite having shelled out the compulsory fee of over £3,000 (Rs 3 lakh), Dwivedi was shocked to find fungus in the kettle, a blood-stained duvet and the only vegetarian option in the evening to be a dairy-free pizza. Security guards patrol the corridors outside the room where he, his wife, his one-and-a-half-year-old and nine-year-old daughters have to spend 10 days as part of Covid protocol since India was added to the UK’s red list. The windows only open slightly, and the family is only allowed out for 15 minutes each day, under the close watch of the security. "My baby is frustrated as she has just started walking, and she has no space to walk," said Dwivedi, who tries to work as his family watches movies with headphones on all day. "We don’t feel ok after paying so much money, and with four of us in one room, it is overcrowded." What has surprised Dwivedi the most is that the entire UK hotel quarantine system seems to have been outsourced to a call centre in India. "They can barely understand English, and the phone line is terrible," the 39-year-old, who was born in Assam and now lives in Edinburgh, said. Not only did his request for a family room go unanswered, he had to wait until four hours before his flight to receive the invoice. The document arrived only after he had tagged several people in a tweet – and that was when he found out the hotel was in Swindon. The family had gone to Lucknow in February as his mother-in-law passed away in January. In early April, he, his wife and his father-in-law came down with Covid. They were unable to find a hospital bed; so were forced to buy oxygen concentrators in the black market. His wife lost her job in Edinburgh as she failed to show up for work. Nearly nine thousand travellers from red-listed countries have joined a Facebook group to share their own UK quarantine horror stories, and several petitions addressed to MPs have sprung up, all demanding that the system be axed. "I don’t blame the hotel, it’s the company that UK government has outsourced the whole quarantine thing to that is the problem," Dwivedi said. "It is shambolic." Sunil Amar, a private banker from London, has been waiting for India to be taken off the red list since April. He travelled to Gurgaon in December to carry out some repairs on his flat and then got stuck. His daughter is seven months pregnant and he is losing business opportunities as he is unable to meet clients face to face in London. Now he plans to return next week. "It’s not going to be easy but what choice have I got," he said. "It seems like a money-making machine." A government spokesperson said, "Our top priority has always been protecting the public and the robust border and testing regime we have in place is helping minimise the risk of new variants coming into the UK. Hotels do their utmost to take any necessary steps to address concerns raised by guests."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/returnees-rant-over-uk-hotel-quarantine-horrors/articleshow/83474917.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Defence maintains primacy in Pak budget||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s government has proposed to allocate Rs 1.37 trillion (about $8.9 billion) for the defence sector in its budget for fiscal 2021-22, an increase of almost 6.3% over the estimated allocations for the last financial year. An interesting aspect of this year’s defence budget is that all armed services have got an equal raise of about 6.2%. The army as always has the biggest share of the pie at Rs 651.5 billion (47.55% of the defence budget), the Pakistan Air Force will be given Rs 291.2 billion (21.3%), the Pakistan Navy will get Rs 148.7 billion (10.9%), and inter-services organisations are being allocated Rs 278.5 billion (20.3%) The proposed defence allocations, announced by Pakistan finance minister Shaukat Tareen on Friday, constitute 16% of the total federal budget outlay, which is Rs 8.48 trillion. Moreover, the allocation is 2.5% percent of GDP, indicating its magnitude vis-a-vis other allocations of public importance. The allocation, however, does not give the full picture of the actual amount the country would be spending on its armed forces. For instance, the Rs 360 billion to be paid to retired military officers would come from the civilian government’s current expenditure instead of the defence budget. Moreover, major military acquisitions are believed to be funded separately. Funds for the nuclear weapons programme, which are placed under a secret head, are also not included in planned defence expenditure. Additionally, spending on a newly set up national security division and some other military expenditure are also not included in the defence budget. If these were to be added, Pakistan’s real spending on defence would be much higher. Last year’s figures for the defence budget had been revised. The original allocation for FY 2020-21 was Rs 1.29 trillion, which was later increased to Rs 1.33 trillion, meaning the armed forces had overspent by about 3%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/defence-maintains-primacy-in-pak-budget/articleshow/83474950.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

At the same time, top Senate Democrats demanded that former attorneys general Jeff Sessions and William Barr testify publicly before Congress about the leak investigations, including about subpoenas issued to tech firms in 2017 and 2018 for the records of at least a dozen people tied to the House intelligence committee. The senators vowed to “vigorously investigate”. Apple, which complied with a subpoena for information related to more than 100 email addresses and phone numbers in February 2018, said on Friday that it did not realise that the records belonged to Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, and his associates. Microsoft said it was also subpoenaed by a grand jury as early as November 2017 for data related to an email account for an aide to the panel. Democrats and privacy advocates denounced the exceedingly unusual seizures as an abuse of power. The episode added fuel to accusations of politicisation in the Trump-era justice department.The Biden justice department had disclosed in recent weeks that the same investigators secretly seized phone records of journalists at Washington Post, CNN and NYT. The White House has vowed to put an end to those practices. In an interview with Politico, Barr sought to distance himself, saying he was “not aware of any congressman’s records being sought in a leak case” while he was AG. The subpoenas to Apple, Microsoft were issued before his tenure.

The security agency which deployed guards at the plant claimed complaints were lodged many times about theft of machinery in 2016. A former nominee director, employees of the plant along with leader of opposition in assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, had demanded that manufacturing of vaccines and medicines related to Covid-19 be started from this plant located in Hingna MIDC.Following an intervention filed by former employee and factory’s union leader Suresh Gotmare pleading for resumption of the plant for production of Covid-19 vaccine and Remdesivir, the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court on May 4 had directed the central and state government to submit replies. On May 14, Hindustan Antibiotics Limited, the central government company which had started the plant, had expressed its inability to resume operations citing problem of skilled manpower and other issues. Guardian minister Nitin Raut had reportedly directed joint director of industries AP Dharmadhikari to inspect the plant and submit a report on its revival for Covid vaccine and medicines.Dharmadhikari along with Gotmare and representative of former nominee director in MAPL — Environmental Engineering Inc (EEI) — Sudhir Paliwal visited the plant on May 17. “Dharmadhikari reported to Raut that not a single machinery was found at the plant. Raut did not give further directives,” said an official from the industries department.TOI visited the plant along with Gotmare and found no machinery there. Paliwal and Gotmare told TOI that the machinery would today cost around Rs50 crore. “machinery were made in Germany and have a long life. The machinery weigh in tonnes and were on all three floors (G+2) of the building. Along with machinery, heavy injectable lines are also missing,” they said.Suspecting that it is not a job of any ordinary thief, they demanded a thorough police investigation and registering offences against those responsible for the theft. “Public money was spent for these machinery. It also means big setback to revival of plant,” they said.Gotmare added HAL should be held responsible as the plant was in its custody. “The main gate of the plant is on Hingna main road. There is a compound wall and the premises has dense trees. Investigation should also find out who could benefit if the plant cannot be revived,” he said.Production of dry powder, liquid injections, tablet, capsule etc was started at the plant in May 1981. “After it was shut in 2002, employees still came to the plant till 2004 and were offered voluntary separation scheme,” said Gotmare.On August 21, 2015, the then Union minister of state for chemicals and fertilizers, Hansraj Ahir, along with city MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari and Fadnavis (then the CM) had held a programme at MAPL plant and announced its revival. Ahir also declared Rs100 crore package.Paliwal said he was invited to the programme. “The ministers and I had found the machinery in working condition at that time,” he said.Bombay Security Services of Amravati were in charge of the plant in 2002. Agency owner Ramesh Upadhyay said, “HAL had appointed 15 security guards from 2002 to 2015. For reasons known to HAL, it was reduced to only three from 2015. We had lodged complaints with MIDC police station about theft of machinery in 2016 several times. Police only caught a few local thieves once,” he said.Gotmare raised question over machinery going missing after 2015 and not between 2004 and 2015. Fadnavis said he had recently written to the Union minister to consider HAL’s plants at Nagpur and Pune for manufacturing of vaccine. “I don't have any information about machinery going missing. If it’s true, then it’s a serious crime and should be dealt with an iron hand,” he told TOI.Managing director of HAL Nirja Saraf said the machines were neither shifted nor disposed of. Saraf claimed police complaints about theft of machinery were lodged in 2015-16. “I joined HAL in October 2016 and for details I will have to look into the files,” she said.As per report of Committee on Public Undertakings submitted in Lok Sabha on January 29, 2021, and on the same date in Rajya Sabha, NBCC (India) Limited was appointed/being appointed as land management agency and MSTC Limited as auctioning agency. These information was given by HAL to the committee.Paliwal said, “MSTC Limited deals with disposing of scrap and condemned plants. It means HAL on record confirmed there were machinery in MAPL plant till January this year,” he said.The MAPL plant sits on a sprawling 12.5 acres land taken on lease from MIDC for 95 years from 1979.Paliwal said NBCC was appointed for disposing of the land.The PI of MIDC police station Yuvraj Hande said he was not posted at the police station in 2016. “I don’t remember any such complaint since joining here. I will have to check the records,” he said.Ahir refused to comment on machinery going missing from the plant stating it falls “under Gadkari’s constituency”. A message and call to Gadkari’s office went unanswered.

---||Kolkata||Monsoon arrives in Kolkata; pockets receive light rain||KOLKATA: Monsoon arrived in Kolkata on a cloudy Saturday morning even as it rained intermittently, a day after its scheduled date of arrival. The city received short spells of drizzle through the day and will continue to receive light rain over the next 48 hours. Last year, too, monsoon had reached Kolkata on June 12. “While all the necessary conditions for the advent of monsoon had been fulfilled on Friday, there was too little rain to declare the onset of monsoon. On Saturday morning, Kolkata received around 20 mm rain which satisfied the only unfulfilled requirement for the advent of monsoon,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. Monsoon waves now cover 95% of the state, including the whole of south Bengal. The remaining areas will be covered by Sunday. The other requirements for the onset — clouds, moisture and wind — got stronger on Saturday. But heavy rain may elude Kolkata due to a strong wind shear that has been blowing away clouds floating in from the Bay of Bengal, said the Met office. “A strong northwesterly wind has been driving away the clouds towards Bangladesh, which are then entering Bengal through the neighbouring country. By the time the clouds and the rain reach south Bengal, they are either turning weak or are again being pushed towards the western districts of the state and Jharkhand. This is why Purulia and Bankura have received heavier showers over the last two days while the rest of south Bengal, including Kolkata, have got only drizzles,” explained Das. Kolkata will continue to receive short spells of shower. But the rain may add up to 70 mm over the next 72 hours, said RMC. While last year, monsoon had arrived in Kolkata a day late — on June 12, it had been delayed by 10 days in 2019. Even though it’s on time this year, this doesn’t reflect on the possible volume of rain for the entire season. “We are just heading for the beginning of monsoon and there can’t be any prediction for the month or even the first week of monsoon. Usually, June is the driest of the monsoon months in Kolkata while July is the wettest. The pattern, however, is often broken,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/monsoon-arrives-in-kol-pockets-receive-light-rain/articleshow/83468837.cms||---

After he was declared brain dead, his family members agreed to donate both his kidneys and liver to needy patients. The Zonal Transplant Coordination Center (ZTCC), Nagpur, coordinated the organ donation — 73rd in the city, and only the second after the second wave of Covid-19. Dr Ashwini Choudhry, who counselled the deceased’s family, said, “Prakash Kapse was admitted in critical condition at New Era Hospital on June 9. Despite all the treatment, his condition neurologically deteriorated and doctors declared him brain dead on June 11.” Prakash’s wife Savita and son Prathamesh (22) agreed to donate the organs. The liver and one kidney were retrieved and transplanted to needy patients at New Era hospital, while the other kidney was taken to Seven Star Hospital, where a 23-year-old got a new lease of life. It was the first kidney transplant at Seven Star Hospital. ZTCC secretary Dr Sanjay Kolte said that it was the second donation happening in a span of 48 hours. “This proves that people, especially youngsters, are aware of the process as they are giving consent even after losing their loved ones,” he said. ZTCC Nagpur president Dr Vibhavari Dani said, “Organ transplant has gained momentum again after Covid-19’s second wave. We have come across two well-aware families in the last two days. This awareness is giving a new shot at life to recipients.” LIFE IN DEATH Donor | Prakash Kapse (58), Shriram Wadi resident Consent by | Son Prathamesh (22), wife Savita Liver transplanted to a 58-year-old man at New Era Hospital First kidney to a 50-year-old man at New Era Hospital Second kidney to a 23-year-old at Seven Star Hospital||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-dies-after-fall-in-factory-yet-gives-life-to-three/articleshow/83470442.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Refusal to nix Covid tax anti-people, says TMC||KOLKATA: The BJP-led Centre’s refusal to remove tax from life-saving Covid drugs and medical equipment in the middle of the pandemic was “unfortunate and inhuman”, the Trinamool Congress said on Saturday. The decision to go on with GST on even ambulances ferrying patients to hospital even as crores were being spent on projects like Central Vista was “anti-people”, Trinamool seniors added. Party Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray referred to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s May 9 letter to PM Narendra Modi, in which she mentioned how organisations, individuals and benevolent agencies — who had come forward to donate medicines and medical equipment like oxygen concentrators and cylinders — were pleading for exemption from customs duty, GST and other taxes. “We have noted with concern that these demands, forwarded by CM Banerjee, have not been acknowledged,” Ray said. Bengal education minister Bratya Basu said the Trinamool Congress would take this to the people. “This government, instead of helping people during a crisis, is bent on taxing them. We want this decision to be reversed. There should be no tax on life-saving drugs, equipment and ambulances,” Basu added. Ray called the Centre’s priorities “baffling”. “We have seen bodies being buried along river banks or flung into the Ganges. But, the Centre does not seem to be bothered by all this; it is imposing taxes when people are suffering and need help,” he said. Banerjee, in her May 9 letter, had pointed out that the GST rate varied between 5% and 12% on various items now being used to treat Covid. Exemption of GST and duty was a critical issue to facilitate augmentation of medical infrastructure and logistics, she had added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/refusal-to-nix-covid-tax-anti-people-tmc/articleshow/83470883.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi eateries may reopen on Monday with 50% cap||NEW DELHI: About eight weeks after they were closed to check the rampaging second wave of Covid-19, the capital’s restaurants are likely to be allowed to open from Monday with 50% of their sitting capacity, according to sources. This will come as a big relief to the restaurant industry since many establishments have virtually gone out of business with even online delivery and takeaways getting a lukewarm response because of the Corona scare. The Covid-19 situation appears to be under control and the positivity rate is consistently falling. Delhi reported 213 fresh cases and 28 deaths on Saturday and the positivity rate was 0.30%. This, say sources, has prompted the government to allow more economic activities for reviving employment opportunities. No instant relief for gyms, salons & theatres likelyA part from the restaurants, weekly markets – which have remained closed for weeks together – are also likely to be allowed to function with restrictions. It is likely to be one market each day for each zone with strict Covid-19 protocols and Covidappropriate behaviour. Some restrictions on the number of vendors may also be imposed. Gyms, spas, saloons, cinema halls, public parks, water and entertainment parks, swimming pools, educational institutions, social and political gatherings and all other prohibited economic activities are not likely to be allowed yet. A file on the likely unlocking measures is with the lieutenant governor who has to review and approve these. A formal announcement will be made only after that. Last week, relaxations in the lockdown were given till June14 (5am). The unlocking order from Delhi Disaster Management Authority is likely to be issued on Sunday. Restaurant owners have been asking the government to allow them to reopen. Delhi Gym Association has also appealed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to allow gyms to function from Monday. The Gujarat government has allowed gyms to reopen. Chirag Sethi of Delhi Gym Association said reopening of the gyms will allow the owners to revive their business. All shops at malls and markets, including liquor shops in Delhi, were allowed to open on an odd-even basis from last Monday between 10am and 8pm and Delhi Metro resumed services at 50% capacity. Private offices have already been permitted with a maximum of 50% staff. All non-essential neighbourhood shops have also been allowed to remain open on all days. A fortnight back, the government had permitted manufacturing/production units within closed premises in approved industrial areas to operate and construction activities within work sites to resume.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-eateries-may-reopen-tomorrow-with-50-cap/articleshow/83475003.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Goa||Lokayukta begins hearings, old cases to be taken up soon||Panaji: The new Lokayukta for the state, retired judge of the Bombay high court Justice Ambadas Joshi, has started hearing the cases filed before the institution. Sources said the cases pending for registration after the retirement of previous Lokayukta have been taken up for hearing. Also, the hearing in old cases will be taken up soon. There are around 75 cases pending before the Lokayukta. In April, the government had appointed the new Lokayukta for the state. On March 9, former high court judge U V Bakre, who is currently the chairman of the Goa Human Rights Commission (GHRC), withdrew his consent to be appointed as Lokayukta citing “personal reasons”. The term of the previous Lokayukta PK Misra ended on September 17, 2020. Misra held the position of chairman of the rights commission before being appointed as the Lokayukta. In January, the high court had extended the time frame by two months for the state government to appoint the new Lokayukta. Subsequently, the state government had approached the high court seeking an extension after being unable to find a retired Supreme Court judge or retired high court chief justice willing to move to Goa to take up the post. The state then amended the act so that a retired high court judge could be appointed as the Lokayukta. Stung by several indictments by the Lokayukta in cases involving corruption by public functionaries, the government amended the Act to severely dilute the powers of the institution. The amendments have omitted provisions enabling complaints against public functionaries on allegations of nepotism, lack of integrity, maladministration and improper or corrupt motive. The first Goa Lokayukta, former Supreme Court judge Justice Sudershan Reddy, was appointed in March 2013, but he resigned within seven months citing personal reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lokayukta-begins-hearings-old-cases-to-be-taken-up-soon/articleshow/83470520.cms||---
---||Business||Mitra claims ‘voice muzzled’ at GST meet, Centre denies charge||NEW DELHI: A war of words broke out between the Centre and the West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra after he shot of a letter to union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman saying he was not allowed to speak during Saturday’s GST Council meeting. The charge was denied by junior finance minister Anurag Thakur saying Sitharman has never stifled dissent in the top policy making entity. Mitra in his letter recorded his dissent protesting the GST on vaccines and said his “voice was muzzled” at the meeting which he termed as a blow to cooperative federalism. “I was not given the floor, despite repeated requests to respond to your comments. Instead, you gave the floor to the minister from UP, who sought deletion of some of my comments by name and shockingly you agreed,” Mitra said in his letter. He said he was not given a chance to speak and the revenue secretary brought the meeting to a close and the virtual link was cut off. In the past too, Mitra has often raised issues after the GST Council meeting and also skipped important discussions. Shortly after Mitra’s letter surfaced, Thakur took to Twitter to set the “record straight”. “It is unbecoming of a senior member of the (GST) Council to suggest that this has happened.” He said during the speech by the UP FM nobody heard Mitra speak up nor did he ask to have his opinion heard. Other members can attest to this, he said. Thakur also said at the end of the discussion, when Sithraman asked the council whether anyone would like to speak and add their comments, Mitra again remained silent, and did not speak up. “During the GST Council discussions today, it seemed as if the FM from West Bengal did not have a stable VC connection. Revenue secretary repeatedly informed him his line was breaking, that he was not properly audible and to turn off his video for better connectivity,” said Thakur rebutting the claims made by Mitra in his letter. In his letter, Mitra said the decisions taken in Saturday’s Council meeting would mean that GST would be imposed on vaccines and items like masks, PPEs, hand sanitisers, temperature check equipments, medical grade oxygen, Covid testing kits, ventilators. BiPap machines and several other items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mitra-claims-voice-muzzled-at-gst-meet-centre-denies-charge/articleshow/83475020.cms||Surojit Gupta
---||Kolkata||Most patients in West Bengal hospitals are those who have not got a shot, says study||KOLKATA: Ongoing studies on the effectiveness of vaccines at the state’s largest hospital for Covid treatment has revealed that the number of patients admitted for Covid treatment after being vaccinated is about 25 times times lower than the number who hadn’t received the shot. And, the number of those who died after receiving both doses of vaccines was 265 times lower than patients who had not received a single dose. Experts involved in the project, however, said the study is still at an initial stage and a detailed analysis is needed to reach a conclusion based on these figures. A few private hospitals that are keeping records of their Covid patients have also reported a significantly lower number of admissions of vaccinated people and even lower number of deaths among them. The study by the state health department is being carried out at four state hospitals — MR Bangur, Medical College, RG Kar and ID Hospital — but figures are available for only M R Bangur for now. According to data emerging out of MR Bangur Hospital, of the 13,094 positive patients admitted between April 2020 and the first week of June 2021, 501 had taken the vaccine jab against 12,593 who had not received a single dose of any vaccine. Among the 1,593 deaths that occurred during the period, only six had taken both doses of the vaccine. Health experts say even if the data is initial, it is clear that vaccines provide protection. Health experts stress that even if a single vaccinated person is infected, it is necessary to go back to the dates of the first and second doses and the date when the infection was detected. “If a person gets infected three days after the jab, you cannot blame the vaccine. One needs to wait for about three weeks after the first dose and two weeks after the second for the immune response to get activated. We also need to find out if any variant is causing the infection,” said clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi. The health department had, about a month ago, set up a clinical research steering committee with senior professors like Tripathi, professor of pharmacology at IPGMER Avijit Hazra, medicine HOD at RG Kar Medical College Jyotirmoy Pal and principal of BC Roy Hospital for Children Dilip Paul in it. The study is part of the committee’s initiative. “The data from MR Bangur Hospital requires more analysis along with data from the other three hospitals,” said a member of the panel. Even private hospitals have started maintaining data on the infected. “Among the 530 Covid patients admitted in the last month, 444 had not got a single dose while 83 had the first. Only 3 had the second dose. Of the 76 deaths,16 were among those who got the first dose and they had co-morbidities. There was no death among the three who had taken both doses,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital. At CMRI Hospital, among 650-odd patients admitted in a month, about 32 had got two doses and all but one — a diabetic in his late 60s — recovered. “We observed that those infected after the first or second dose have had a mild disease,” said CMRI director of pulmonology Raja Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-patients-in-hosps-are-those-who-have-not-got-a-shot-study/articleshow/83471167.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

As per Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s grievance redressal app – Nagpur Live City, the NMC is flooded with complaints of overflowing sewage and choked lines in Laxmi Nagar with 6,166 complaints and 6,362 in Mangalwari zones. Of these, a cumulative 4,275 complaints are related to the public health engineering department only. Data revealed that the two zones have also registered more complaints pertaining to solid waste management, Mangalwari zone (1,457) and Laxmi Nagar (1,355). The problems in the two zones are becoming chronic due to choked sewerage lines as complaints pertaining to contamination of wells are on the rise. The then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had launched the Nagpur Live City app in 2020. Every registered complaint is forwarded to the department concerned for necessary action and post an update. Since then, the dashboard shows that the NMC has received as many as 39,128 complaints about various civic amenities. The highest number of complaints (13,451) related to choked sewerage, followed by solid waste management or irregular lifting of garbage (7,817). The data also revealed that 3,409 complaints about streetlights and 2,723 are encroachments cases across the city apart from those about bad roads. Even stray cattle and dog menace increased in the city, as reflected in the app. The veterinary department, which looks after stray cattle and dogs, received 2,483 complaints. Ill-maintenance of gardens by the NMC saw registration of 1,509 complaints on the app. The NMC claimed to have promptly resolved over 90% grievances registered on the Nagpur Live City app. Citizens, however, differ. Mohan Thakre, a resident of Gaddigodam, said he had lodged a complaint pertaining to a damaged road. The following day, he was notified that the complaint was forwarded to the junior engineer Mangalwari zone and action had been taken. But nothing changed and the road was still the same, he alleged. A Nandanwan resident Rahul Lokhande complained about the damaged sewer line. Two days later, he received a message that the problem had been resolved. But it was never attended to, Lokhande said. So, he registered a complaint again, and four more times. “Each time, the complaint was promptly closed with the notification: ‘Action taken’ and each time, the overflowing of the sewerage line remained as it is,” he said. He further said, “The zone office has not taken any cognizance of my complaint so far. Finally, the local residents pooled in money and got the sewer line repaired.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-says-civic-complaints-resolved-residents-differ/articleshow/83470547.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

While these FMs had lodged their grievance outside the panel, the issue was also flagged in the allpowerful body on Saturday. “... I don't want to comment on what was said outside. In the Council, the three Congress ministers said that in the future at least you should consider having us in GoM. The selection into a GoM is never made on party basis, neither is the exclusion. There are several GoMs and several ministers are made members of the GoM. Neither the inclusion, nor the exclusions happen on political party affiliations,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fms-of-cong-led-states-protest-gom-exclusion/articleshow/83475044.cms||---
---||Goa||Span of abandoned Borim bridge snaps||Ponda: A nearly 60m-long span of the 50-year-old bailey bridge at Borim collapsed on Saturday afternoon. The incident came to light after a passerby noticed the span missing. The bridge was in a dilapidated state and had been put out of use by the public works department (PWD) 15 years ago. A 33kVA electricity cable passing along the bridge was seen hanging, posing a threat to marine vessels navigating the river below. The electricity department later clarified that the cable is not electrified and hence, there was no risk of electrocution. However, it contacted the river navigation department to issue an advisory to the marine vessels, alerting them of the risk. The old Borim bridge, as it is known, was constructed during the expansion of the water treatment plant at Opa-Khandepar in Ponda to supply potable water to the Zuari Agro plant. However, after the commissioning of the Selaulim dam, the factory started getting water from there. The pipeline was then used to supply water to Raia and Loutolim. But after these areas too began receiving water from Selaulim, the bridge and the pipeline were abandoned in 2005, chief engineer of the water division Santosh Mhapne said. It may be recalled that former PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar was planning to bring the bridge and the pipeline in use to supply 10 MLD potable water from the JICA-sponsored water treatment plant at Selaulim to Shiroda and Borim. However, looking at the cost of repairs, the PWD laid an alternative underwater pipeline in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/span-of-abandoned-borim-bridge-snaps/articleshow/83470573.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Cong petitions court for probe into rebel MLAs||Panaji: With Goa Police refusing to act on the Congress party’s complaint of forgery and cheating against 10 Congress turned BJP MLAs, state party president Girish Chodankar has petitioned the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) asking the court to direct Goa Police to register an FIR. The party has also requested the court to direct Goa Police to conduct an “independent, free and proper investigation” and to keep the court informed about the progress of the investigation. The case is likely to come up for hearing on June 23. Chodankar had filed a police complaint at Panaji police station on April 20 against the 10 MLAs and former Congress office bearers, alleging that forged documents were used to create false evidence. The false evidence was in turn used to justify the merger of the Congress legislative party with the BJP. “Till date Goa Police has failed to register an FIR on our complaint in respect of forgery and fraud and other offences under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code 1860, which compelled us to move the JMFC,” Chodankar said. Chodankar’s petition seeks directions to be issued to the Panaji Police inspector to register an FIR, conduct an independent, free and proper investigation. “We have also prayed the court to monitor the investigation and direct the police inspector to timely submit the progress of investigation to the court,” he said. Chodankar has also challenged speaker Rajesh Patnekar’s dismissal of the disqualification petition before the high court of Bombay at Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-petitions-court-for-probe-into-rebel-mlas/articleshow/83470637.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Explicit video chats to beat lockdown blues led to increased ‘sextortion’ too||Nagpur: The city cyber cell on Saturday extended assistance and security to a 35-year-old businessman from Mumbai who had called up a local officer seeking help after getting entangled in a blackmailing trap after some obscene video chats with a stranger which is being now labelled as ‘sextortion’ by experts.From full lockdown to partial Covid restrictions, the cyber cell is inundated with requests from victims of blackmailers threatening to make their explicit images and video viral on social media and also send them to their contacts.In the past, a 54-year-old fashion designer had been one of the victims of such blackmailing or ‘sextortion’ following which he had to cough up a substantial sum. As the demands from the blackmailer was growing, he had to seek assistance from the cyber cops who ensured he was saved from repeated extortions.In another case, a second year law student too was helped by the cyber cell when he was being threatened by blackmailers.Cyber lawyer and activist Mahendra Limaye too said blackmailing via video chats has increased during the lockdown. “Victims first get a friend request from an ID of a woman and after acceptance, there is an invitation for a video chat in which explicit images and actions are recorded to use them as a tool for blackmailing or extortion,” he said. “Initially, the amount is Rs 2,000-Rs 5,000 which increases gradually,” said Limaye. “Such fraudsters can be booked under section 66E of the Information technology Act and also extortion and other provisions of the Indian penal code (IPC),” he said, adding, one must have control over emotions and not indulge in explicit acts on digital platforms.Cyber expert and senior inspector Ashok Bagul said many victims are being lured by the blackmailers through dating apps and then the extortion begins. “People avoid approaching investigating agencies due to social stigma. Reporting such matters to the cyber cell is important too,” he said. Dr Rajesh Rathi, a psychiatrist, said online platforms have also increased sex-related activities which is one of the reasons for such cases coming to the fore in more numbers now. “Excessive use of online platforms are treated by us as ‘internet use disorders’ which is also related to the over dependency on pornographic material. To address these addictions, both psychological and pharmacological interventions are required,” he said. “Another reason for this pornographic dependency is seeking pleasure out of married life or less satisfying conjugal bonds,” he said.Sexologist Dr Sanjay Deshpande said single or unmarried people are more vulnerable. Even married men seeking extramarital satisfaction too can get trapped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/explicit-video-chats-to-beat-lockdown-blues-led-to-increased-sextortion-too/articleshow/83470688.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||Dog sniffs out deer skin near Sonegaon Lake||Nagpur: Out for the regular evening walk on Friday near Sonegaon Lake with his trainer, seven month-old Golden Retriever ‘Luke’ kept pulling at the leash constantly. At first, professional dog trainer Amit Gire found this to be a regular canine deviation from the fixed walking route but soon gave in to Luke’s persistence. As it turned out, Luke’s object of curiosity was a discarded sack with deer skin stuffed inside. “Dog’s do have a natural curiosity but they won’t go sniffing around with such aggression for regular trash strewn around. Luke seemed very adamant and that’s why I decided to follow him,” said Gire, who is training the dog owned by city resident Uday Damle. “I too was taken aback after seeing deer skin, as that’s not what you expect to see on the road,” said Gire. “We found it near the airport wall on the road where you come from Sonegaon Lake,” said Gire. Fortunately, Gire did not ignore his ‘citizen’s responsibility’ and decided to inform the authorities right away. No time was wasted in bureacratic delays as a call to the cops anyways would have been routed to the forest department. Gire’s first call was directly to Nagpur’s Honorary Wildlife Warden Kundan Hate. Immediately after learning about the development, Hate informed forest officials. “Officials reached the spot and conducted the panchnama. Going by the photos, it seems that the skin is quiet old because it’s broken into pieces. A new skin does not disintegrate like that,” said Hate. Hate feels it’s most likely a citizen who did not have a certificate of ownership. “In 2004, a rule came into effect, that those possessing such things must apply for a certificate, and it was granted too. Then the Wildlife Act was ammended and if such items are found in people’s possession, without certificate, then it’s illegal. So it seems that some owner tried to discard it sensing trouble from the law,” said Hate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dog-sniffs-out-deer-skin-near-sonegaon-lake/articleshow/83470780.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Early rains: Delhiites ready, not city drains||NEW DELHI: The good news is that hot and humid Delhi may get monsoon rains from June 15, a full 12 days ahead of the normal date. If the forecast proves accurate, it would be the earliest monsoon onset in the capital in 13 years. The bad news? The city may find itself inundated because the civic agencies have still not finished the desilting of the capital’s drainage network, with officials reporting that 30%-40% of drain clearing work is pending at many locations. The PWD, which is responsible for the condition of Delhi’s big drains, has completed clearing the silt from 60% of the network so far. "The work was affected due to the pandemic. Now that the monsoon has advanced, we will increase the manpower significantly from Monday onwards to finish the remaining work," a PWD official assured. 30-40% desilting pending in many areas, capital stares at waterloggingThe municipal corporations oversee the maintenance of the smaller drains, and all three have claimed at least 60% of work completion, with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation even asserting it has achieved 107% of the desilting target. The normal desilting deadline for agencies is June 15, but work in the past two years has been impacted by the Covid lockdowns. The official desilting report from the engineering department of East Delhi Municipal Corporation shows that just over 35% of the work still is pending, with Shahdara North zone especially vulnerable as only 51% of the work has been completed there till June 11. The civic body has taken out 29,689 metric tonnes of silt from 219 drains against the target of 46,086 tonnes. Of the drains under EDMC’s jurisdiction, 149 have been cleared and work is under way in 70 others. North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is responsible for 192 drains of a cumulative length of 108km, claimed to have achieved 88% of the target. Mayor Jai Prakash said that following the forecast of an early monsoon, he has called a review meeting on preparedness so that the remaining work can be expedited and vulnerable spots covered. “We will also pursue the matter with other agencies because most of the municipal drains have outfalls into major drains managed by PWD and the irrigation & flood control department,” he said. Amazing as it sounds, SDMC has asserted it has accomplished 107% of the desilting target over 188.4km of drains it maintains. The civic agency reported that till June 10, 29,606 MT of silt had been removed from its 272 drains. The lofty claims will soon be tested once the rains start. The multiplicity of agencies with jurisdiction over Delhi’s drainage network has often been blamed for the annual urban flooding. Municipal corporations largely manage the smaller drains in residential areas, while PWD carries out maintenance of drains along wider roads. Other agencies like I&FC department manage 426km of much larger drains. Bodies like DDA, DSIIDC and Delhi Cantonment Board also have some drainage network under them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/early-rains-delhiites-ready-not-city-drains/articleshow/83475093.cms||Paras Singh
---||Chennai||7% of Tamil Nadu’s 45-60 age group fully vaccinated||CHENNAI: After 3.26 lakh people got their shots on Saturday, the cumulative tally of vaccination doses in Tamil Nadu crossed 1 crore. According to the immunisation wing, at least 21 % of people above the age of 45 years have got at least one dose of the vaccine and 7% have completed the course. In the 18-44 years, 5% of the population have taken the first dose in government vaccination centres so far. Over the last one week, vaccinations in the state slowed as many districts did not have adequate stock. On Saturday, Tamil Nadu received 4.26 lakh doses —1.26 lakh doses of Covaxin and 3 lakh doses of Covishield — which were dispatched to districts by late evening. Since June 1, the state has received 13.3 lakh doses and is expecting another 29.2 lakh doses by the end of the month. “We are attempting to vaccinate as many people before any (further) outbreaks,” said joint director (immunisation) Dr K Vinay Kumar. Health minister Ma Subramanian said the state has been lobbying with the Centre for more vaccines so the number of vaccinations does not come down. Chief minister M K Stalin wrote to the Centre seeking 50 lakh doses, he said. “He will soon speak to PM Modi directly for more vaccines,” Subramanian told reporters after inspecting the vaccination drive at Koyambedu Market Complex, an erstwhile hotspot . So far, the state has received1.1 crore doses of the vaccine and has used 1.01 crore doses. With an increase in the number of people turning up for vaccinations, the daily vaccine wastage has dropped to almost nil. The overall wastage came down to less than 2% from nearly 8.3% in March. “In the first three months more than 3 lakh doses were wasted. In the last two months, there was an increase in the number of people taking the vaccine. This brought down the wastage,” he said. In addition to the vaccines at government centres, 3.59 lakh people have taken the vaccine from private centres since May1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/7-of-tamil-nadus-45-60-age-group-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/83475103.cms||---

According to the analytics released by state police on World Day Against Child Labour, around nine percent of the children rescued are forced to do labour as they have no parental care. The data is based on the information collated by the police during the last four phases of Operation Muskaan in which they rescued 34,037 children. Amongst these rescued kids, 51% of them work as coolies (manual labour), 12% of them are street kids without any work, around 2% happened to be beggars while the rest work in different shops and fields like begging, cashew nut shops, chilli fields, tea shops, motor mechanics and dhabas. Community-wise analysis show that around 44.54% of the rescued kids fall under backward class category. The community break up of children rescued is 18% Muslims, 15.7% belong to schedule castes, 12.6% to schedule tribes and nine percent from other castes. In terms of educational background of the rescued kids, 61% of them have completed education between class 6 and 10. Twenty-six percent completed schooling between class 1 and 5 while the rest 12% happened to be illiterate with no educational background. Interestingly, the percentage of rescued kids, who failed in exams, is only 0.16%. Age-wise analysis of the police data shows that majority of the kids (76%) are aged between 11 and 15 years. Around 21% of the rescued children are aged between 6 and 10 years while a marginal sum of 2% are between 0 and 5 years. On the bright-side, 90% of the rescued children during the last four phases of Operation Muskaan were not found earlier. This indicates that there is a decline in recidivism when it comes to child labour. Only close to 10% of the kids were found in the previous operations. Police data shows that around 16% of the kids, who showed symptoms of Covid-19 were tested. Out of which, the Covid-19 positivity rate stands at a mere one per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/poverty-the-main-reason-behind-child-labour-police-data/articleshow/83467104.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The three — identified as Patnala Srinivas Rao, Manoj Kumar and Ravi Teja — are accused of floating a real estate firm called MK Construction and claiming that they owned 15 acres of land in Gannavaram area where apartment towers would come up. Cops said the accused published ads in various newspapers with “limited period offers” and offered flats for Rs 18 lakh against the actual market price of Rs 40 lakh for people who book within a stipulated time. They also appointed marketing agents to attract more customers and even paid significant incentives to them. Hundreds of gullible customers ended up investing in the offer and later realised they were cheated when the firm failed to hand over the flats. The accused even opened branches in Hyderabad to create a positive impression among the customers. A preliminary investigation by the cops found that MK Construction never owned or purchased lands in the first place and sold flats through fake agreements. A special team has been formed to trace the whereabouts of the accused. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fake-realty-firm-cheats-customers-of-rs-7-crore/articleshow/83467110.cms||---

The two universities, among others, were among the promises made to the state during its bifurcation and were also part of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. While the Petroleum university was supposed to be part of the proposed ‘Petro Corridor’ at Kakinada in East Godavari district, the location of the Tribal university was left to the state government. Accordingly, the government decided to have the varsity in Paderu. The government has also acquired land for both the universities. The Petroleum university is proposed to come up at Vakalapudi village in Kakinadau rural mandal. Establishment of national institutions like IIT, NIT, central university, Indian Institute of Science Education & Research, AIIMS and National Institute of Disaster Management were part of the AP Reorganisation Act. The IITs, NIT and the central university were sanctioned and set up in the state after the bifurcation, while the Tribal university and Petroleum university are set to be turn into a reality soon. The Central Institute of Plastic Engineering & Technology, which was not part of the Bifurcation Act, has also been established in the state. Though the central government had taken the initiative to establish some of these premier institutions, the process was delayed as the state government took time to delegate the required land. The two-day visit of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to the national capital is said to have yielded some positive results, as far as the fate of these two universities are concerned. Sources said the Centre has asked the chief minister to hand over the documents related to delegation of land for the two institutes, and accordingly, Jagan has asked chief secretary Adityanath Das to prepare the required documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/petro-tribal-varsities-to-turn-into-reality-soon/articleshow/83467129.cms||Gopi Dara

It is likely to become more marked and move west and northwest-ward across Odisha, Jharkhand and northern Chhattisgarh over the next two–three days. Due to the low-pressure system, fairly widespread rain and thundershowers are expected in north-coastal Andhra while scattered rainfall is expected along the state’s southern coast. Wind speeds going up to 40–60kmph are expected and fishermen have been warned about rough conditions at sea over the next couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/thundershowers-in-coastal-andhra/articleshow/83467137.cms||---

Han, a native of Hubei province in central China, was arrested by the BSF on Thursday for illegal entry through the India-Bangladesh border and booked by police on Friday under the Foreigners Act. Sources said police had pleaded for a seven-day custody, but the court granted a day less. “The Chinese national will be in police custody for six days. He will be produced in court again on June 18,” said assistant public prosecutor Mehtab Alam. After the BSF handed over the intruder to Kaliachak police, he was grilled by various security agencies — including the NIA and ATS — in Malda’s Mahadipur. According to investigators, Han admitted that he entered India six times and ran a hotel on lease in Gurgaon for a year and a half with an Indian ally. Officers said Han had smuggled around 1,300 Indian SIM cards into China with the intention to commit financial fraud. One of his Chinese business partners, Sun Jiang, was arrested by ATS Lucknow. Following Sun’s interrogation, a case was registered against Han and he was denied Indian visa. His wife and he had left the country earlier this year. Han’s lawyer Gyanendra Dewan said: “My client had a valid passport and visa for Bangladesh. Indian agencies can cross-check with the government there. While touring Bangladesh, he mistakenly entered Indian territory by mistake, as there is no fencing or demarcation. Let us wait for police investigations.” Malda SP Alok Rajoria said: “We have taken him (Han) into custody. We may seek the help of other agencies if needed.” Rajoria did not rule out the possibility of ATS seeking Han’s custody in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chinese-intruder-sent-to-six-day-police-custody/articleshow/83470746.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Mukul Roy's son lashes out at BJP on Article 356 threat, communal card||KOLKATA: A day after rejoining Trinamool Congress, Mukul Roy and his son Subhrangshu were on Saturday given state security cover both at their Kanchrapara and Salt Lake homes. Though Mukul said he had “released” his central security, the CISF detachments continued to remain, awaiting “formal orders”. “We have written (to the Centre) to give up central security,” Subhrangshu said. Mukul got ‘Z’ security cover and his son ‘Y’ cover from the Centre. The state is likely to provide them the same. While Mukul chose not to speak on his “homecoming”, Subhrangshu spoke at length on the issue while speaking to reporters. “A new government, which is not even a month old, has come to office with huge public support. We did not like the manner in which the threat of Article 356 was being used, how central agencies were harassing leaders and the manner in which the communal card was being played,” he said, harping on “we” in his statement. Subhrangshu, significantly, added that during his mother’s illness and also when his father fell ill, “the only one who always helped and enquired over phone or in person was this government”. He added: “She is now on ECMO support. This is done after ventilation. Her condition is not well and we are trying to take her to Chennai. Doctors here have been doing a tremendous job.” Mukul’s wife Krishna is being treated at a private hospital. Sources said due to the medical exigency in the family, a formal statement on the reasons behind Mukul, a BJP national vice-president, leaving the party to join TMC after 45 months may be delayed. During a briefing at Trinamool Congress Bhawan on Saturday, party MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said at the onset, “No political questions please.” State education minister Bratya Basu said the party had nothing to add since “this issue has already been addressed by the chief minister”. Interestingly, phrases like “working as a team” and “working in unison” were part of statements issued on Friday as Mukul returned to TMC. Party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee wrote on Twitter: “We empathize with his many struggles in BJP & assure him that we'll work together as a team to ensure the brightest future for all Indians under chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s leadership.” TMC, in a statement, said: “We understand the multiple challenges he faced in BJP. We look forward to this new journey whereby we can work in unison, prioritizing the wellbeing of the people of India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mukul-son-lashes-out-at-bjp-on-art-356-threat-communal-card/articleshow/83471179.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: ‘Courtesy call’ stirs rumours of BJP neta’s return to TMC||HOWRAH: Former state minister-turned-BJP leader Rajib Banerjee made an hour-long “courtesy call” to Trinamool Congress general secretary Kunal Ghosh on Saturday, sparking speculation of a second blow to the saffron camp after Mukul Roy’s ‘ghar wapsi’. While Banerjee was in the talks, posters appeared in Bankra under Domjur assembly constituency from Bankra Trinamool Congress against his possible re-inclusion into the Trinamool fold. A few days ago, similar posters were visible in Howrah’s Salap. Banerjee timed the “courtesy call” after his controversial post on social media against the BJP’s “over-dependence” on Delhi on the day when Bengal BJP had called a state office-bearers’ meet. Banerjee didn’t attend it. On Saturday, the former minister reached Ghosh’s residence around 5.30 pm after “meeting an ailing relative”. The car in which he was travelling carried a Trinamool logo on its windscreen. Banerjee stayed there for an hour. Banerjee had joined the BJP in January after holding a series of talks with Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee at his Naktala residence. “The government has come with a huge mandate just a month back. If anyone tries to dislodge this government by imposing President’s rule or tries to create disturbances over communal lines, people will reject that,” Banerjee said after the meeting. While Banerjee refrained from commenting on his future stance, he said: “While in the BJP I opposed division on the lines of religion. I am opposed to that even today. But you should not interpret my visit today as a step towards any political decision.” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh used his Twitter handle and said: “If a wilted leaf falls, it does no damage to the tree. In fact, the tree gets filled with new leaves and gets a new vigour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rajib-makes-courtesy-call-to-kunal-sparks-buzz/articleshow/83471241.cms||Rohit Khanna

Bloc leaders have had two stormy sessions with Left Front chairman Biman Basu over the issue and want the Front to fight future elections on its own. “The people of Bengal have rejected the tactic. The Left Front was formed to take street movements to a political level. Why the need for crutches?” Bloc secretary Naren Chatterjee said on Saturday. Chatterjee wrote to Basu to drive home his point. “We will join the Left Front meeting on Tuesday after receiving a letter from the chairman, giving primacy to the Left Front in electoral matters.” At the CPM state committee meeting a few days ago, party state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra had said CPM would not “exclude” any partner of the Sanjukta Morcha on its own. “But, parties are free to leave Morcha,” Mishra had said, making it clear CPM wanted to continue an alliance with Congress and ISF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bloc-writes-to-biman-against-cpms-poll-crutches-meeting-on-tuesday/articleshow/83470817.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As leader of the opposition I will see to it that the anti-defection law is enforced in Bengal. It may take two to three months, but I will make it happen,” Adhikari said after a meeting of BJP’s Ghatal organizational committee on Saturday. Saying he had no problem if a person switched parties, Adhikari added: “Take my case. I gave up all posts and resigned as MLA before taking BJP’s primary membership. No one will oppose him if he does that. But this practice in Bengal has to end. I had a discussion with Union law minister and BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad on this.” Read AlsoWest Bengal: ‘Courtesy call’ stirs rumours of BJP neta’s return to TMCFormer state minister-turned-BJP leader Rajib Banerjee made an hour-long “courtesy call” to Trinamool Congress general secretary Kunal Ghosh on Saturday, sparking speculation of a second blow to the saffron camp after Mukul Roy’s ‘ghar wapsi’.But BJP representatives in Krishnanagar North are a divided lot. While BJP Ranaghat MP Jagannath Sarkar asserted that Mukul’s exit wouldn’t have any effect on the organization, the party’s Krishnanagar North organization committee leader Asit Das blamed the present leadership under Dilip Ghosh for the poll debacle and desertion by heavyweights. “Mukul played an important role in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and gave BJP the results. But this time, Dilip Ghosh spoilt the favourable situation by making irresponsible comments. I am not going to abide by Ghosh’s diktat,” said Asit. The situation was similar in North 24 Parganas where Mukul had organized majority councillors in municipalities to defect to BJP. At least three BJP MLAs — Subrata Thakur from Bongaon North, Ashok Kirtaniya from Gaighata and Biswajit Das from Bagda — from the Matua belt gave a miss to Ghosh’s organizational meeting at Bongaon-Chakdah on Friday. BJP MP Shantanu Thakur was also absent in the meeting. Biswajit put it bluntly, saying: “I didn’t attend the meeting because it was held at a local businessman’s house. I know the person. He is allegedly into shady deals.” Das has an excellent rapport with Mukul. “I do not deny that. I also have good relations with Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee. But they are all at a personal level,” the BJP MLA said. BJP Noapara candidate and TMC-turned-BJP leader Sunil Singh sounded soft on Mukul, unlike Singh’s relative and Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh. “Mukul is a political heavyweight. It was he who brought me to TMC from Congress in 2009,” Sunil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-calls-for-defection-case-as-rumblings-hit-bengal-bjp-ranks/articleshow/83471205.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Noida||Noida hospitals have given Rs 19L Covid refunds||NOIDA: Fourteen patients admitted for Covid treatment at private hospitals in the city, or their families, have over the past few weeks received refunds that collectively amount to Rs 19 lakh. Though recommended by the complaints cell on overbilling set up by the government, it’s discounts through the panel’s intervention on humanitarian grounds that account for a bulk of the refunds. Established on May 7, the complaint cell has wrapped up all investigations. Overall, it dealt with 74 complaints, of which 30 were found actionable. The last one landed on its table on June 9. Officials said since no major violation of norms was found, the committee refrained from recommending criminal proceedings against any of the hospitals. The 3-member committee was headed by Dr Anil Gupta. The minimum refund was Rs 3,500 and the maximum Rs 3.6 lakh. Of the 14 people who got refunds, eight were in cases of overbilling in which a total of Rs 6.5 lakh was returned. The others got waivers amounting to Rs 12.5 lakh. The highest — Rs 3.6 lakh — was given to a family from Dadri that lost its sole earning member. The committee’s chief told TOI private hospitals in Noida and Greater Noida had largely followed the rules laid down for Covid treatment on charges and it was found that cost of treatment exceeded the recommended limit in cases where individuals were found to be suffering from other complications or conditions besides Covid-19. Other than overbilling, other complaints the panel received related to denial of admission, negligence or lack of professionalism, non-availability of health bulletins or lack of communication, theft, unhygienic conditions and poor food quality. In its probes into overbilling, the committee summoned records from the patient as well as the hospital. “On examining the documents, we did not come across glaring anomalies. In some cases where slight deviation was observed, the hospitals were asked to revise the bill amounts. We have issued warnings to seven hospitals and ask-ed them to be careful over the past one month,” said Dr Gupta. DP Singh, who paid Rs 2.15 lakh to a private hospital in Greater Noida where his brother was being treated last month, was among those to get a refund after the panel found merit in his complaint of being overbilled. “His condition had deteriorated and we took him to the ICU. The bill amount was brought down by 15%. I had pointed out in my complaint that hefty amounts were charged for personal protection kits, doctor visits, D-dimer test, etc. The medicine cost amounted to Rs 1 lakh and an additional Rs 60,000 was sought for providing oxygen,” said Singh, adding his brother was discharged after nine days in hospital but passed away at home. Sushil Chauhan was handed a Rs 9 lakh bill by a hospital in Greater Noida. “The patient was admitted for a long duration and I approached the committee with a request to get the bill amount revised. I will not call it a complaint as such. I wanted clarity if the bill was calculated as per treatment protocols. The hospital offered a discount of Rs 1.5 lakh soon after that,” said Chauhan. Treatment cost has been capped in three categories — moderate sickness (isolation beds with oxygen support), severe sickness (ICU care without ventilator) and very severe sickness (ICU with both invasive or non-invasive ventilator care). Daily charges, including the PPE cost, have been fixed at Rs 10,000, Rs 15,000 and Rs 18,000, respectively. Broadly, the daily cost covers bed charges, meals, monitoring, imaging, regular tests, visit charges and nursing care. For comorbid patients, hemodialysis also has to be provided within the same cost. A committee member said the overall treatment line and health condition of the patient was examined while investigating complaints. “Oxygen charges were levied in an arbitrary manner and all hospitals have been warned against doing that. Specified protocol covers investigations such as X-ray and regular tests such as complete blood count, liver function test, and kidney function test, among others. Specialised tests such as D-dimer, IL-6, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, LDH and HRCT scan are not covered. Additional charges have been taken when patients developed other complications. Additional visit charges have to be paid in instances where cardiologists, pulmonologists, oncologists have to be called for guidance. People feel these charges are also covered under the protocol,” said the panel member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-hosps-have-given-rs-19l-covid-refunds/articleshow/83471117.cms||Shalabh

The car-borne couple and a juvenile, who were caught on camera stealing the goats last week, struck at a broiler chicken shop in Korattur. CCTV camera footage of their latest theft went viral on Saturday. The shop on Vallalar Street in Padi belongs to a man named Boopalan. When he found about 10 country chickens missing from his shop, he lodged a complaint at Korattur police station. A case was registered and a team combed through CCTV camera footage at the shop. To their surprise, they found the thieves reaching the shop in a sedan around 5 in the morning. The 10-minute-long clip shows the driver who was in a lungi, getting down and wtaching out for any signs of movement for a few minutes. In between, a boy is also seen getting down and boarding the car again. A few minutes later, a woman sitting in the rear row opens the back door, after which the man brings chickens from the shop and dumps them in the car. He makes three more rounds then gets into the car and drives away. Police launched a hunt for the suspects with the help of the car’s registration number. A few weeks ago, a woman complained that her goats went missing from Korattur. Police are verifying if the same gang is behind both incidents. In the goat theft case, Indira, 56, of Amman Koil Street, left her goats tied to the front of her house. She woke up in the middle of the night on hearing the goats bleating and found a couple dumping her goats into a car. They soon escaped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/couple-behind-goat-theft-strike-again-at-korattur-poultry-shop-in-chennai/articleshow/83475158.cms||---

District immunisation officer Dr Praveen Jadia told TOI, "All those citizens of Pakistan residing here can now take their Covid-19 vaccines after online registration on the CoWIN app. Since these people don't have identity documents like Aadhaar cards issued to Indian citizens, they must register with the help of their passport." "The registration with a passport is allowed on the CoWIN app as it was done in the case of a citizen of the Netherlands, who had taken the first dose of Covishield at one of the centres in May," added Dr Jadia. A 49-year-old citizen of the Netherlands was given the first dose of Covishield vaccine at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Centre in Sukhliya on May 10. The clearance to vaccinate Pakistani Sindhis was given after a delegation met Indore district collector, Jadia said, adding, "I have got permission to vaccinate the Pakistani nationals residing in Indore." ‘Around 4,000 with Pak passports need vaccine’Local BJP MP Shankar Lalwani, who had been championing the cause of Pakistani Sindhis seeking Indian citizenship, told TOI, “About 4,000 people with Pakistani passports need Covid-19 vaccines in the district. These people are living on long-term visa in the district.” Also, most of them have decided to reside in India and have applied for citizenship after completing seven years of residence here, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/indore-pakistan-nationals-living-on-extended-visa-to-get-jab/articleshow/83475282.cms||Antriksh Singh

According to agency reports, the four women lodged in a jail in Kabul are Soniya, Merin, Nimisha and Raheela, all Keralites. The news of Keralites joining the IS surfaced after the state government contacted various central agencies IB, NIA, RAW in 2016 about the veracity of reports about 19 missing people from the state. According to some of the relatives they are believed to have joined the IS. These 19 included 10 men, six women and three children and of these, most of them hail from Kasaragod and a few from Palakkad and include Christian and Hindu converts. In the past three years, a few of those who had joined the IS were reportedly killed. The husbands of these Kerala women were among those who were killed. If the government thinks that she has committed crimes against the country, she should be brought back here and made to stand trial before the courts here, Bindu said. Bindu wants her daughter to face the law in IndiaBindu, whose elder son is a Major in the Army, said that the people who allegedly radicalised her daughter were leading a peaceful life here and no investigation agency in the country seemed to be interested in their activities. “The college where she studied and where she was radicalised still functions without any problem. Her roommate who played a key role in radicalisation and the people who presided over her conversion, all of them continue to lead a peaceful life here,” Bindu said. Bindu said that she had filed a complaint to then home minister Ramesh Chennithala seeking his intervention after she learned about her daughter’s religious conversion. She even filed a habeas corpus petition before the high court to know the whereabouts of her daughter. The court had, in turn, instructed the Kasaragod police to update her whereabouts periodically. It was almost six months after this, she flew to Afghanistan along with her husband Bexin alias Isa, Bindu said. “If there were proper follow-up actions to my complaints, Nimisha would not have ended up where she is now,” Bindu said. While she wants her daughter to face the law in India, Bindu wishes to take care of her 4-yr-old grandchild and provide her a safe home. Nimisha was seven months pregnant at the time of her departure to Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mother-of-is-recruit-jailed-in-afghanistan-seeks-her-return/articleshow/83475344.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan

A probe into the construction of the temple has also been ordered. IGP (Prayagraj range) KP Singh told TOI that police teams are making efforts to create awareness among people about the virus and convince them that no religious activity will be of any help in fighting it. The IGP also said that police ordered a probe into the issue after a villager, Nagesh Kumar Srivastava, had submitted an application to Sangipur police station. Temple came up 3 days agoIn the application he claimed, that his brother Lokesh Kumar, who arrived from Ghaziabad a few days ago, had set up a Corona Mata temple without consulting his family. Police said the temple came up three days ago and hundreds of villagers started visting to offer prayers. The villagers believed that the “shadow of Covid-19 will never befall on Shuklapur and adjoining villages” owing to the blessings of Corona Mata. The temple was built by a group of villagers with donations. The villagers followed Covid protocols, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance, while offering prayers at the temple.

---||Chandigarh||Don’t end Covid-19 exemptions in August: Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal to GST council||CHANDIGARH: Reacting to the decision to limit Covid exemptions in August, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Saturday said the GST council’s group of ministers (GoM) should stop acting like a ‘shahenshah’ of yesteryears and instead let compassion speak through its decisions. Demanding that all Covid-related goods must be zero-rated during the pandemic, Manpreet said he vehemently opposed the imposition of GST on Covid-related items at this time of a national crisis and recorded their note of dissent. “The other alternative is to charge 0.1%, which is well within the powers of the GST council, and this measure should be in place till the pandemic is over. Covid crisis is a once in a century calamity,” he said. Manpreet vehemently criticised the attempt to garner revenues from furnaces from crematoriums stating that this category should be even above the exemption category. “Is this how the Union government wishes to collect revenues?” he asked. “Covid-related exemptions should not be over by August31. Is Covid going to be over by then, he asked? We need to have a more realistic and reasonable time frame and one, which is based on compassion,” he said. Referring to his observations made at the 44th meeting of the GST council last month, Manpreet said he had urged the Centre to include representatives of the Congress in the group of ministers (GOM). “It is preposterous that the principal opposition party of India in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha has been excluded in the GoM,” he said. He also demanded that the chairperson should operationalise the position of vice chairperson of the GST Council. Further, the GST council must have its own secretariat, and it should be empowered to adjudicate on Dispute Resolution Mechanism where there are divergent views. He regretted that the GoM is not acting with compassion, and it is parroting the Union Government, perhaps out of the fear that they may not be included from a future GoM. Manpreet reminded the GoM that health care services, including all recognized systems of medicine (allopathy, ayurveda, unani, homoeopathy, yoga), are already exempt under GST. The supply of medicine that is a part of the treatment package is also exempt since the entire transaction is considered a service. He criticised the discussion for restricting GST on government hospitals versus private hospitals. “The idea that we need GST registration and billing and later file returns are farcical. What would a consumer feel on seeing GST reflected on an invoice?” he said. The imposition of GST on Covid preventive materials,starting with GST on vaccines and items like masks, PPEs, hand sanitisers, medical-grade oxygen, testing kits, ventilators, Bipap machine, and oximeters among others reflect “insensitivity and lack of compassion,” he said. Manpreet cautioned that the attempt to “pick and choose” exemptions on the grounds of inverted duty structure or cheaper imports would end up destroying the foundation of GST.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-end-covid-19-exemptions-in-august-punjab-fm-manpreet-singh-badal-to-gst-council/articleshow/83475386.cms||---

The two parties, represented by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, described the alliance as a historic decision. The seat-sharing formula agreed by the two sides gives SAD 97 seats and BSP the remaining 20 seats in the 117-member assembly. BSP has got eight seats in the Doaba region, five in Majha, three in Malwa and four in Puadh region. The two parties will soon form a coordination committee to ensure seamless working in all the constituencies and to jointly chalk out various programmes ahead of the assembly polls. Announcing the alliance, Mishra said, “Today is a historic day. The BSP, which is a national party, has chosen to align with the strongest party in Punjab. This alliance will continue forever now.” The two parties, Mishra added, had come together after 25 years and last time when they had contested 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab together and had won 11 of them. After the two parties snapped ties, the SAD under the leadership of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had a long-standing alliance with the BJP which was snapped last year over the three contentious farm laws passed by the BJP government at the Centre. During the period, BJP used to contest 23 seats as junior partner in the state assembly elections. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said: “Today is a new day in Punjab’s politics, a historic day… a day of big turn in Punjab’s politics.” Apart from the entire senior SAD leadership, including MP Naresh Gujral who played a crucial role in stitching this alliance, BSP Punjab affairs in-charge Randhir Singh Beniwal and state president Jasbir Singh Garhi were also present. Sukhbir Badal said the alliance was not limited to the 2022 assembly elections but would continue after that as both the SAD and the BSP had the same ideology and had always worked for the welfare of farmers, poor and farm labour. BSP president Mayawati had wanted to come to Punjab and announce the alliance herself but was not able to make it due to the Covid-19 restrictions, said Mishra. After the alliance was announced, Mishra also called on SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal in Chandigarh, who spoke to BSP supremo Mayawati on phone and congratulated her for the alliance. He even asked her to contest from Punjab. Ironically, it was Badal Senior’s unilateral decision to support the Vajpayee government in Delhi in1996, which led to the breaking up of the alliance and BSP founder Kanshi Ram, who belonged to Punjab, had at the time accused him of ditching the BSP. The alliance at that time had won 11 out of 13 seats in Punjab and BSP had won the three seats and Kanshi Ram had himself won from Hoshiarpur. In a statement issued later by SAD, Badal Senior described the formation of the alliance as the “beginning of a secular, federal democratic revolution in the state and the country for a total socio-economic and political revamp of our polity. The process of justice and equality for the poor, the down-trodden and the minorities will also get a boost with this development.” He said: “It marks the triumph of the concept of Sarb Saanjhivalta, Sanman te Smajik Insaf (Fraternity, Equality and Dignity) based on the ideal of Sarbat da Bhala (Welfare of All).” As farmers make the majority support base of SAD, Mishra made it a point to state that BSP would struggle handin-hand with the SAD to ensure the three ‘anti-farmer’ agricultural laws were not implemented and praised former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal for resigning as a minister in support of the farmers. He also criticized the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for praising the hated agricultural laws and only to go back on its stand due to pressure from the farmers. He also alleged that the Congress government was discriminating against Dalits by not releasing funds reserved for Scheduled Castes to them, deleting lakhs of Aata-Daal and old age pension cards, not filling SC and OBC vacancies, not releasing SC scholarship fee to students and not implementing the Shagun scheme and houses for the houseless scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-sad-bsp-announce-tie-up-97-20-seat-sharing-pact/articleshow/83475422.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: 25% of Indian Military Academy’s newly minted officers belong to region||CHANDIGARH: Nearly one fourth of the total 341 gentleman cadets (GCs) who passed out from Indian Military Academy (IMA) on Saturday to join the Army as commissioned officers are from Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Lt Loveneet Singh, who received the bronze medal for standing third in order of overall merit among the cadets in the current batch, too happens to be from Punjab’s Jalalabad. As many as 87 of the 341 cadets who passed out as officers are from Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Chandigarh. Of these, 38 are from Haryana, 32 from Punjab, 16 from HP and one from Chandigarh. The total figure of 87 cadets from the region constitutes more than 25% of the total strength. Haryana, which constitutes only 2% of the country’s population, has been maintaining a record presence in the passing out parades for the past several years. In terms of percentage of area and population, Haryana is the largest producer of officers for the armed forces. Punjab, which had declined in sending officers into the armed forces, has also significantly improved in the recent past. In fact, over 20% of those passed out as officers are from the two states of Haryana and Punjab. While Haryana has secured second position in the entire country for producing the second-highest number of officers after Uttar Pradesh (66), Punjab is at number four slot among all the states. With 16 cadets, the tiny hill state Himachal Pradesh has also produced a significantly high number of officers. The state of Jammu and Kashmir too has a significant presence, with 18 cadets from the strife-torn state being commissioned into the Army. Lt Gen R P Singh, Army Commander, Western Command, reviewed the parade as reviewing officer. On account of restrictions due to Covid-19, the family members of the cadets were not invited for the ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/25-who-passed-out-from-ima-as-officers-belong-to-pb-hry-hp/articleshow/83470086.cms||Ajay Sura

In her letter, Soni said late night power cuts were taking place frequently in peak summer season. Due to scheduled and unscheduled power cuts at night, public representatives were not being heard in the electricity complaint center, she alleged. She pointed out that there are more than 60,000 power consumers in Sirsa city but not enough employees in the power facility.

---||Chandigarh||Administrator for municipalities: HC expected to decide issue on June 17||Chandigarh: The grouse of various municipal bodies of the state against the Haryana government’s move to appoint sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) as administrators to run the affairs of municipalities, whose tenure has either ended or going to an end by the end of this month, is expected to be decided by the Punjab and Haryana high court on June 17. Bahadurgarh municipal council chairperson Sheela Devi had filed a petition in HC alleging there was no provision of appointment of administrators for the municipalities and by doing so the state government had “completely deteriorated the democratic fabric of the municipal bodies”. “Counsel for the petitioner states that the term of the petitioner (five years) has not expired and hence in this backdrop the provisions of section 254 of the Haryana Municipal Act, 1973, could not have been invoked to dissolve the municipal council and appoint administrator. At this stage, the state counsel informed the court that the first meeting of the municipality took place on June 16, 2016, which was to be completed on June 23. It is not a case that the municipality has been dissolved. Hence, this matter is being adjourned to June 17 for further arguments,” the court said. Division bench comprising Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Archana Puri passed these orders while hearing the petition. The HC has been informed that the elections to various municipal councils in the state were held on May 22, 2016. The term of some of the civic bodies was to expire in 2021. However, due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, fresh elections had not been notified. Faced with this situation, the petitioner and other persons filed a petition with a prayer for extending the tenure of the respective councils till the fresh elections are conducted. In the meantime, the urban local bodies department issued a notification on May 28, 2021, for appointment of administrators. Through a notification dated May 3, 2021, the state election commission deferred the schedule for distribution/updation of electoral rolls of 45 municipalities. The final date of publication of the rolls has been postponed indefinitely from June 7. “The decision of the Haryana government to appoint administrators from June 24 is perpetuated by mala fide, both in fact and in law. When the state government itself has prevented the conduct of the elections, there is no occasion for... appointment of administrator to the municipalities. The elections have been suspended in perpetuity. It would imply that the local bodies have in effect been high jacked by the state government in totality,” the petitioner has alleged. It has also been argued that the government has itself prevented the state election commission from proceeding with the civic polls, which is an indirect way of doing something which is not permissible under the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/administrator-for-municipalities-hc-expected-to-decide-issue-on-june-17/articleshow/83470116.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Chandigarh||Punjab, Haryana way behind in maternal mortality ratio||CHANDIGARH: In a telling indicator of the healthcare scenario in Punjab and Haryana, both figure among states having a high maternal mortality ratio (MMR). They need to do more to improve the health and safety of mothers -- before and after childbirth. As per the data published in the Sustainable Development Goals- 2020-21 report of Niti Aayog, MMR in Punjab stands at 129 per lakh live births against the national average of 113, while Haryana has a mortality rate of 91. The central government has set a target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per lakh live births. Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have already achieved the set target. None of the three states in the region have managed to achieve 100% immunisation of children in the age group of 9-11 months for Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG), measles, and 3 doses each of polio and DPT that aims to end preventable deaths of newborns and children. Himachal Pradesh has the lowest coverage of 86%, followed by Haryana with 87% and Punjab, having 89% immunisation of children against the all-India average of 91%. Lacking proper nourishment. Children in the region are underweight and stunted. In Haryana, 34.9% of children under five years are stunted, while the percentage in HP and Punjab is 28.4 and 24.3. The aim is to reduce stunting to 6%. Haryana has been found lagging behind in providing the required manpower in the health facilities. The state has only 26 physicians, nurses and midwives per 10,000 population while the average count of manpower at the national level stands at 37. With 66 medical professionals per 10,000 population, the hill state of Himachal has the highest health workforce in the region while Punjab has 56. Punjab (0.08) and Haryana (0.09) are among the states with high HIV incidence per 1,000 uninfected population while at 0.02, Himachal Pradesh is close to achieving the target of zero HIV incidence. The average monthly per capita out-of-pocket expenditure on health is 14.40% of the monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in Himachal, the highest in the region, followed by Punjab (13.50%) and Haryana (10.40). Out-of-pocket medical payments are expenditures borne by a patient where insurance does not cover the full cost. With 255 cases per one lakh population, Haryana has the highest notification rate amongst states, followed by Himachal (235) and Punjab (196). The latter two states are yet to achieve the target of 242.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-haryana-way-behind-in-maternal-mortality-ratio/articleshow/83475528.cms||Vinod Kumar

A number of trees were uprooted in Sirsa, due to which many vehicles and even shops were damaged. The meteorological department said this was part of pre-monsoon showers, which would continue in Haryana from June 15 to June 16. The Rama Opticals showroom and a few shops at Geeta Bhawan Street Market were damaged in the storm. Power supply in parts of the city was also affected. Professor Madan Khichar, head of the agriculture meteorological department, Haryana Agricultural University, said on June 11, the wind pattern in Haryana changed, due to which moist winds from the Bay of Bengal came in, causing pre-monsoon rain. He said it was likely to continue on June 15 and June 16. Light to moderate rain with isolated thunderstorms and strong wind is likely across the state and heavy rain was possible in a few areas of northern Haryana. Due to this, day temperature would decrease by 5 degrees to 7 degrees Celsius, Khichar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rain-strong-wind-lash-parts-of-haryana/articleshow/83470130.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Teen’s suicide after sexual abuse post: NHRC steps in||Gurgaon: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed the state home department to transfer the abetment to suicide case of a 17-year-old boy, who had jumped to death last year after being accused of sexual harassment by a former classmate in an Instagram post, to the state CID from Gurgaon police. Pulling up the cops handling the case so far for a slow investigation, the NHRC also directed a probe into the role of the investigating officer, followed by departmental action if any negligence or laxity was found. Asking the principal secretary (home) of the Haryana government to bring in the CID, the NHRC on June 9 observed that there hasn’t been a fair investigation in the case registered at Sector 53 police station in Gurgaon on May 5, 2020 under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC. The 17-year-old had jumped to death from the balcony of his flat in DLF-5 the previous night. The post, written in the wake of the “BoisLockerRoom scandal that was breaking on social media at that time, was shared by the girl the same evening. The 17-year-old was viciously trolled after that. The trolls turned on the girl after the boy died by suicide. “The investigating officer will also inquire (into) the role of police/IOs for committing lapses during the investigation and take suitable action against them, if found guilty. As the complaint involves a serious issue, in which the life of a young boy has gone because of cybercrime,” said the NHRC missive. The state has to submit a report within eight weeks. The NHRC response came after a complaint was filed by the boy’s father. His counsel Amish Aggarwala told TOI, “The accused and their accomplices are still scot-free, making a mockery of the legal process. They have used all possible unfair means to derail justice. The tragedy is that justice has been delayed and denied to the boy and his parents.” The boy’s father said, “With all the information available, statements of the witnesses show it was a planned and strategised conspiracy between several persons.” His son, he added, lost his life due to a “mischievous, prejudiced, imaginary and slanderous post” made on social media by the girl. The boy, the father claimed, was bullied and threatened after the post that pushed him to commit suicide. In July 2020, a Gurgaon court while hearing the case had observed that “the investigating officers are working at a low pace in the present matter for reasons best known to them”. The court exercised its power under Section 156(3) of the CrPC to monitor the investigation. According to the girl, the alleged incident took place they were both in Class X and had become friends. The boy, she claimed, had come to her housing society and proposed a walk in the basement. There, she claimed, he had touched her inappropriately and demanded sexual favours. After her post, another one by a person identifying himself as the brother of the teenager claimed the boy had received threat calls and texts, after which he had tried to defend himself and also told his friends he was innocent. According to this post, the boy couldn’t handle the constant threats and believed his side of the story would not be heard. The writer of the post also lashed out at the girl, saying she should have gone to the authorities to file a complaint if she thought she was right.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/teens-suicide-after-sexual-abuse-post-nhrc-steps-in/articleshow/83470158.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Privacy concerns: Asha workers to shun track app||Gurgaon: Citing privacy concerns, more than 22,000 Asha workers have unanimously decided to shun a mobile app introduced by the National Health Mission. The app — MDM 360 shield — has been developed by the government for tracking and updating daily targets of Asha workers. The app allows the senior officials to track the location of the Asha workers and add/delete information on the handsets provided by the department. These accredited social health activists, who have been up in arms against the lack of safety net and highlighted gaps in the state government’s Covid management, have now raised objections against the mandatory downloading of the app. Terming it as a “surveillance app”, the Asha workers fear that it will make them further vulnerable to greater scrutiny and harassment from officials. A delegation of workers from all the 22 districts has decided to hand over their smartphones, provided by the health department, as a symbolic gesture to uphold their Right to Privacy. Last month, Asha workers had suspended work for a day to protest against the government for not providing them with safety kits, salaries and insurance coverage promised in 2020. “Asha workers have been protesting against the government since 2018 and the government wants to silence them through surveillance. They want to track down workers who are leaking information about the administration’s mismanagement and the ground situation, and arm-twist them to fall in line,” said Surekha, general secretary of Asha Workers Union (Haryana). The Asha workers, however, have cried foul and accused the department of choking their voices. Many workers told TOI that the government officials have been threatening them for going to the media and organising protests in the past few weeks. Meanwhile, NHM state coordinator Chand Singh Madaan, said: “Asha workers are being misled by politically motivated people. The idea of this app is to track the work of Asha workers. These phones were meant for official use. It will help us monitor that workers are not misusing it. Also, it will help us tackle technical issues they face and update their app or add new features.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/privacy-concerns-asha-workers-to-shun-track-app/articleshow/83470224.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: As monsoon nears, road repairs will have to wait||GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will start roadworks in several sectors of the city after the monsoon. The metropolitan authority has invited bids from private agencies for the repair work. The total cost of the project is expected to be around Rs 4.5 crore. The selected agency will also be required to look after the maintenance of the repaired stretches for a year, officials said. The stretches included in the project are dividing roads for sectors 45/46, 29/30, 45/52, 51/52, 42/5, outer road in Sector 26 and the road near Sector 72A. A separate tender has been floated for the repair work of dividing roads for sectors 3/5 and 4/7. A GMDA official said, “The craters in the roads are not only an inconvenience but are also a safety concern as they can cause accidents. So, we have invited agencies for the project and once the bids are evaluated, we will allocate them to the relevant bidders. Roadworks should begin immediately after the tenders have been allotted.” Meanwhile, the metropolitan authority has also floated bids for developing missing links in the road connecting IMT Manesar with the road dividing sectors 87/91. The said link was never constructed due to litigation hurdles. The construction of the patch will offset the agency by Rs 70 lakh, officials said. TOI had earlier reported that bringing in relief for thousands of new sector residents, GMDA invited agencies for the work of building the missing links of master dividing roads of sectors 81/82 92/95, 81/86 and outer roads of sectors 91 and 92. The new sectors do not have proper connectivity as land for patches between the roads were under litigation. This caused grave inconvenience to the residents living in the areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/as-monsoon-nears-road-repairs-will-have-to-wait/articleshow/83470263.cms||---

Eight policemen of the Virajpet station have been suspended and the inquiry has been handed over to CID. “Whoever the culprits may be, they will be punished based on an impartial inquiry,” southern range IGP Praveen Madhukar Pawar said. Roy D’Souza was mentally unstable due to epileptic fits and on Wednesday night, ran out of home with a sickle in his hand, his family said. Police said he tried to attack them when asked why he had stepped out of home when a Covid curfew was in force. Roy’s mother was called to the police station around 3am and found him in a semi-unconscious state, Roy’s younger brother Robin said. Roy lived with his mother in Virajpet while Robin, who lives in Bengaluru, rushed to Kodagu after the incident. Roy was admitted to a private hospital in Madikeri and later moved to the district hospital where he died. Robin has filed a police complaint and urged SP Kshama Mishra to ensure an impartial investigation. ‘Mom found patient lying near police station’Robin alleged that his brother was beaten up badly and their mother found him lying in front of the police station, barely conscious. “He died in hospital due to multiple injuries sustained from the beating,” he alleged. The CID probe team is expected to reach Kodagu on Sunday. Those suspended are head constables MU Sunil and KG Nehru, and constables NS Lokesh, HJ Tanukumar, NH Satish, ML Sunil, A Ramesh and BT Pradeep.

---||Ghaziabad||Son away, elderly couple found murdered at home in Ghaziabad||GHAZIABAD: An elderly couple was found smothered to death at their home in Loni on Friday evening. The bodies of Surendra Singh Dhaka (70) and his wife Santosh (63) were found on the floor by their son Ravi, who was out for work, police said. The police are probing if the couple were killed for resisting a robbery bid. Ravi has told the cops the house was ransacked when he came back from work and cash and jewellery were missing. However, personal enmity is not being ruled out. “Surendra would lend money to people on interest. He had been living with his wife and son in this Balram Nagar house for the past 20 years,” said Atul Sonkar, the circle officer of Loni. “On Friday evening, the couple’s son found their bodies lying on the floor of the house when he returned from work and informed the police. It looked like they had been smothered to death. The entire house was ransacked. The son also alleged that cash and jewellery were missing. These indicate a robbery,” he added. The cops, however, did not find any signs of forced entry, which means the accused were known to the family. “We have called a forensic team and are investigating the case from the angle of personal enmity,” added Sonkar. Ravi has told the cops he had left the house after having lunch around 1pm. “The assailants must have entered the house soon after Ravi left. Since the elderly man was involved in the business of lending money on interest, it is quite possible he had developed testy ties with some people. We are probing if his business had anything to do with the murder. The robbery may have been staged to deflect our attention,” said Sonkar. Surendra’s elder son, Gaurav, had died in a road accident. “Both their sons are married but their wives were away at their fathers’ place when the murder took place. We are questioning the relatives and friends of Ravi for any possible leads. We hope the case would be solved soon,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/son-away-elderly-couple-found-murdered-at-home/articleshow/83470272.cms||---

The patient’s son, who allegedly threw a mobile phone at the doctor, has been arrested. The patient, a middle-aged man, was being treated for severe pneumonia and doctors were explaining to his wife and son why his condition appeared to be deteriorating. “The patient was Covid positive and later tested negative, but his condition was worsening with severe inflection in the lungs. He was being treated in the non-Covid ICU,” a hospital source said. The patient’s son, Jagadish Kumar, suddenly lost his temper and flung his phone. The hospital called in the police and later filed a complaint, saying the life of healthcare workers was at risk. Accused claims he was frustrated over his father’s illnessPolice arrested 26-year-old Jagadish, a resident of Devarachikkanahalli off Bannerghatta Road. Police said he has been charged under section 323 of IPC for voluntarily causing hurt and released on bail. Kumar told police that he was frustrated about his father’s failing health and threw the phone in a fit of rage. A complaint has been registered under the state’s law to prohibit violence against medicare service personnel. “All this happened inside the hospital ICU where there are no security personnel. The doctor was only explaining the complications of Covid. Though the man had tested negative for Covid, he suffered from acute pneumonia and his condition was not improving. Doctors are doing their best to treat him,” a hospital source said. There was no clarity on whether the patient was moved out of the hospital. Authorities at the hospital refused comment. Since the beginning of the pandemic,12 such attacks have been reported against healthcare workers in the state. In most of the cases, resident doctors bore the brunt. On June 2, the Karnataka Resident Doctors’ Association had written to the chief minister, seeking a state legal cell to tackle assault on doctors and other healthcare personnel. Previous instancesSon attacks woman doc in Ballari: On May 23, in Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences, Ballari, a 65-year-old Covid patient died of a heart attack.

It is equally correct that the recent pandemic has seriously shaken this perception of privilege as so many of the wealthier populace succumbed to its perils. This, in turn, may well lead to a socio-cultural reconciliation that is nothing short of a minor revolution, albeit through an unfortunate conduit. It is essential to start with healthcare as the well-endowed can now access the finest treatment for cancer, heart disease and so much more. But the cure for this virus rests in scalable optimality and not maximising science, which is exactly where the national unification of grief emerged. In spite of gargantuan bank balances and insurance policies, the sheer unavailability of ICU beds led to deplorable fatalities, in tandem with comorbidities often derived from exceptional indulgences. Till recently, the poorer rural sections were relatively unscathed as cities bore the brunt of the carnage. This narrative extends effortlessly to the softer domains of foreign holidays and ravishing SUVs as we were pretty much stuck at home — whether a villa or a shanty. Fine dining restaurants were rendered unserviceable and the restriction of guests to 50 made weddings sadly abbreviated. So many NRIs are stuck in India, unable to flee to their first-world havens. Those who had shunned the humble kirana store for the dashing aggregators were forced to backtrack for supply of milk, cheese and eggs. Internet connectivity remained the steadfast equaliser — as an enabler of work, sustenance and indulgence. Even the vaccine centres are designed for universal access and it is pleasing that a black market nexus did not spontaneously emerge. We realise today that our lives are no more special than those who serve us and that affluence is a misleading surrogate for genuine metrics. A truthful representation of this being the crematorium chaos, where no amount of wealth could ensure priority or even dignity during the final moments. Across experiences, whether sordid or delightful, the gap between the rich and poor is narrowing as we are reconnecting with the basic tenets of survival. But then, one day soon, all this will end but this wake-up call must lead to a better societal equilibrium, by both intuition and persuasion. There is no better chance or timing for barriers to be bridged and inclusiveness becoming a much-needed stock in trade. This is exactly where brands and influencers must contribute in a decisive manner, shedding their historical patterns of conformity. An instant noodles ad must depict street children dining with condominium kids during a birthday party while an ad for a toilet cleaner reinforces the task as a joint family activity. Successful urban families must introduce the joys of Jabalpur, Bhopal and Hampi to their next-gen, in abundant partnership with the Singapore junkets. Home-cooked food must make a due comeback as a delicacy and not just staple while gadget-free family time becomes a conversation starter. Spirituality is a valuable support system and this must be entrenched in our DNA while public places get repositioned as community crucibles, like the Western world. Schooling must truly become inclusive once again as bespoke private education is contradictory to inclusive social existence. While the pandemic has been a distressing global tragedy, the imbalanced culture of privilege has been an emerging urban tragedy for many years. It is driven mostly by first-generation successes who refuse to embrace universal virtues of equality while strangely reviving traditional markers of prejudice. If the cities talk to the towns and villages, India will truly become stronger.

The arrested person has been identified as Sumit Kumar resident of Meham in Haryana. Bhullar (39), who belonged to Ferozepur, had a reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head, and Jassi (34) from Kharar in Mohali district, had Rs 5 lakh. They had shot dead two cops from CIA Jagraon of Ludhiana rural police. ADGP counter-intelligence and organised crime control unit Amit Prasad said they have managed to arrest Sumit, a close associate cum business partner of Bharat Kumar, who helped Jaipal Bhullar and Jassi in escaping from Morena, Gwalior and arranged a hideout for them in Kolkata., after they killed ASIs Bhagwan Singh and Dalwinderjit Singh of at the Jagraon grain market on May 15, 2021. Bharat was arrested with .30 bore pistol and Honda Accord car from near Shambhu Border in Rajpura area on June 9, and his questioning led the police to the hideout of Jaipal and Jassi . The ADGP said that preliminary investigations had found that both Sumit Kumar and Bharat Kumar, who were business partners since 2015, were involved in illegal sale of fancy mobile numbers, including mobile numbers of foreign-based telecoms, purchased from different countries and other states, which they used to sell in Punjab, Haryana at exorbitant rates. He said that Bharat was also found to be in possession of an official ID of one constable Amarjit Singh, which they had used to evade toll plazas while escaping from Gwalior. "Although, Bharat claimed that Constable Amarjit is his and Sumit’s mutual friend, cops are investigating why he was in possession of Amarjit’s official ID, and if the latter had any knowledge about it being misused by Bharat," said ADGP Amit Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-man-whose-id-used-to-rent-kolkata-flat-held/articleshow/83475580.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Public transport users left out of Unlock plans||BENGALURU: The state government has allowed autorickshaws and cabs to start ferrying commuters from June 14, when the new Unlock phase begins, but it is yet to give the green light to BMTC and KSRTC bus services and Metro rail. People who rely on public transport are upset with the decision, saying they may be forced to pay more every day to reach their workplaces. Before the Covid-19 surge, BMTC carried around 25 lakh passengers a day and Namma Metro about 2 lakh. The services were suspended on April 27 as part of measures to slow the number of infections and remained shut as the lockdown was announced. A transport official said that all four state-run bus corporations, including BMTC, were preparing to restart services with social distancing after nearly 50 days of lockdown. Currently, BMTC operates skeletal services for essential workers and six Vayu Vajra buses from Majestic to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). Many people who don’t own vehicles prefer buses because BMTC offers passes at concessional rates. “It’s difficult to commute in the city without BMTC. I can’t afford to buy a second-hand scooter or travel by cab or autorickshaw. I cycle to work near Shantinagar; it’s time-consuming and tiring. I hope the government allows BMTC services soon,” said security guard S Manjunath, who lives in CV Raman Nagar. Experts say for health safety, transport operators, whether public or private, should ensure social distancing norms are strictly followed and vehicles/coaches and surfaces are frequently sanitised. Vaccinating the staff is also crucial. Nearly 70 per cent of BMTC employees have been vaccinated. “There is no good reason for not allowing buses. Buses have sufficient ventilation compared to cabs. The government should balance life and livelihood. At a time when many people are losing jobs or seeing their earnings fall, it should restart buses, a transportation mode the poor depend on,” said Shaheen Shasa, an activist with the Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike. “Before lockdown, around 25 lakh people were travelling in BMTC buses, but overcrowding was not an issue.” Ravi Gadepalli, an independent consultant and transport expert, said that so far, no studies had been conducted in India to determine a link between public transport and Covid cases. “Cities like London conducted tests that showed that public transport is safe. When the government is allowing offices to reopen, why is BMTC not permitted to operate buses? Economic activities are being restarted, but several people will be without affordable transport options to reach their workplaces. This, in turn, will affect work and delay recovery,” he said. Geeta Menon, joint secretary of the Domestic Workers’ Rights Union, said that prolonged suspension of bus services would badly hit house helps. “In the absence of these services, they have to shell out more as autos can carry only two passengers at a time. For the poor, buses are the primary mode of transport. Not owning a vehicle is not a crime,” she said. Dr US Vishal Rao, a member of the Covid expert committee, said that the seven-day moving average of the test positivity rate should be monitored. “Public transport is likely to be allowed in another one to two weeks. We are concerned that the poor will be affected because of the lack of buses. But we should understand the fact that the virus is not moving, people are. And they are more vulnerable, especially when travelling as a group in a bus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-public-transport-users-left-out-of-unlock-plans/articleshow/83475610.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Premier medical institute PGI will conduct it to know the extent of antibodies developed due to any recent or old Covid infection in children. “This will be for paediatric group. It will be a unique serological survey, where the focus will be on children between the age of 2 and18 years,” said Prof Jagat Ram, director, PGI. “We are working on the modalities like ethical clearance, logistics, planning in urban, rural and slum areas. The sample size will be 2,400-2,500,” he added. Blood samples will be taken for immunoglobulin G (IgG) based test. The survey will give some estimate of how many children have been infected and if they have developed any antibodies against the virus. Concerns abound that a third wave of the pandemic would hit the children largely on the presumption that they would not be vaccinated compared to adults. “Children have not been vaccinated, so they have not developed any antibodies due to the vaccines. The survey will be exclusively based on natural antibodies developed due to infection only,” said the PGI director. One of the limitations of serological survey after the second wave is that most have been vaccinated and some have been infected or are asymptomatic. Taking children in this study will overcome the limitation and allow researchers to understand natural antibodies developed after infection. The study will be conducted for a month. “It will help us to know how many children are likely to be infected in the third wave as we will have a database. This will prepare the city for the third wave,” said the director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/first-sero-survey-in-chandigarh-to-focus-on-kids-starts-next-week/articleshow/83475644.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||World||Biden urges G-7 leaders to call out and compete with China||CARBIS BAY: Leaders of the world's largest economies unveiled an infrastructure plan Saturday for the developing world to compete with China's global initiatives, but they were searching for a consensus on how to forcefully to call out Beijing over human rights abuses. Citing China for its forced labor practices is part of President Joe Biden's campaign to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with Beijing. But while they agreed to work toward competing against China, there was less unity on how adversarial a public position the group should take. Canada, the United Kingdom and France largely endorsed Biden's position, while Germany, Italy and the European Union showed more hesitancy during Saturday's first session of the Group of Seven summit, according to two senior Biden administration officials. The officials who briefed reporters were not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. The communique that summarizes the meeting's commitments was being written and the contents would not be clear until it was released when the summit ended Sunday. White House officials said late Saturday that they believed that China, in some form, could be called out for "nonmarket policies and human rights abuses.'' In his first summit as president, Biden made a point of carving out one-on-one-time with various leaders, bouncing from French president Emmanuel Macron to German chancellor Angela Merkel to Italian prime minister Mario Draghi as well as Japan's Yoshihide Suga and Australia's Scott Morrison, a day after meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson as if to personally try to ward off memories of the chaos that his predecessor would often bring to these gatherings. Macron told Biden that collaboration was needed on a range of issues and told the American president that "it's great to have a US president part of the club and very willing to cooperate.'' Relations between the allies had become strained during the four years of Donald Trump's presidency and his "America first'' foreign policy. Merkel, for her part, downplayed differences on China and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline which would transport natural gas from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. "The atmosphere is very cooperative, it is characterized by mutual interest," Merkel said. "There are very good, constructive and very vivid discussions in the sense that one wants to work together.'' White House officials have said Biden wants the leaders of the G-7 nations _ the US, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy _ to speak in a single voice against forced labor practices targeting China's Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. Biden hopes the denunciation will be part of a joint statement to be released Sunday when the summit ends, but some European allies are reluctant to split so forcefully with Beijing. China had become one of the more compelling sublots of the wealthy nations' summit, their first since 2019. Last year's gathering was canceled because of COVID-19, and recovery from the pandemic is dominating this year's discussions, with leaders expected to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries. The allies also took the first steps in presenting an infrastructure proposal called "Build Back Better for the World,'' a name echoing Biden's campaign slogan. The plan calls for spending hundreds of billions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector while adhering to climate standards and labor practices. It's designed to compete with China's trillion-dollar "Belt and Road Initiative,'' which has launched a network of projects and maritime lanes that snake around large portions of the world, primarily Asia and Africa. Critics say China's projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence by Beijing. Britain also wants the world's democracies to become less reliant on the Asian economic giant. The U.K. government said Saturday's discussions would tackle "how we can shape the global system to deliver for our people in support of our values,'' including by diversifying supply chains that currently heavily depend on China. Not every European power has viewed China in as harsh a light as Biden, who has painted the rivalry with China as the defining competition for the 21st century. But there are some signs that Europe is willing to impose greater scrutiny. Before Biden took office in January, the European Commission announced it had come to terms with Beijing on a deal meant to provide Europe and China with greater access to each other's markets. The Biden administration had hoped to have consultations on the pact. But the deal has been put on hold, and the European Union in March announced sanctions targeting four Chinese officials involved with human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Beijing responded with penalties on several members of the European Parliament and other Europeans critical of the Chinese Communist Party. Biden administration officials see an opportunity to take concrete action to speak out against China's reliance on forced labor as an "affront to human dignity." While calling out China in the G-7 communique would not create any immediate penalties for Beijing, one senior administration official said the action would send a message that the leaders were serious about defending human rights and working together to eradicate the use of forced labor. An estimated 1 million people or more _ most of them Uyghurs _ have been confined in reeducation camps in China's western Xinjiang region in recent years, according to researchers. Chinese authorities have been accused of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents. Beijing rejects allegations that it is committing crimes. Johnson, the summit host, also welcomed the leaders from "guest nations" South Korea, Australia and South Africa, as well as the head of the United Nations, to the summit to "intensify cooperation between the world's democratic and technologically advanced nations.'' The leaders planned to attend a barbecue Saturday night, complete with toasted marshmallows, hot buttered rum and a performance by a sea shanty troupe. India was also invited but its delegation is not attending in person because of the severe coronavirus outbreak in the country. Biden ends the trip Wednesday by meeting in Geneva with Russia's Vladimir Putin. The White House announced Saturday that they will not hold a joint news conference afterward, which removes the opportunity for comparisons to the availability that followed Trump and Putin's 2018 Helsinki summit, in which Trump sided with Moscow over his own intelligence agencies. Only Biden will address the news media after the meeting. Putin, in an interview with NBC News, said the US-Russia relationship had "deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years.'' He added that while Trump was a "talented'' and "colorful'' person, Biden was a "career man'' in politics, which has "some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements'' by the US president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/biden-urges-g-7-leaders-to-call-out-and-compete-with-china/articleshow/83475625.cms||---

The government is planning for the smooth roll out of the vaccination drive among the young population. Andhra Pradesh has about 1.33 crore people falling into the age bracket of 45 and above. While 19 lakh people already received the two Covid-19 vaccine doses, about 53 lakh people have got their first jab. This translates to partially or fully vaccinating about 54% of this age bracket. According to the state health officials, the Union government has allocated 36.94 lakh doses to Andhra Pradesh for June free of cost. However, the state can purchase 20.74 lakh doses directly from the manufacturers through the 'other than the GoI channel', totalling to about 58 lakh doses for June. The health department is yet to receive 47 lakh vaccine doses under its June quota. Health officials expect that the remaining people in this 45+ age bracket would be covered in the next one month or so as the second dose gap for Covishield has been increased to at least 84 days. Consequently, the department would launch the Covid-19 vaccination for people aged 18 and above. The Union government has allowed mass inoculation for 18+ from May 1 itself under its 'liberalised' vaccination drive. But Andhra Pradesh took permission from the Union health ministry to defer the vaccination for the young cohort till the time if first concludes the ongoing drive for 45+. The Andhra Pradesh health department has identified 2.04 crore people aged between 18 and 44 years and floated global tenders to purchase two crore vaccine doses. But the bidding process has not so far yielded any response from the vaccine manufacturers. Meanwhile, the state has added foreign education/employment aspirants and young mothers having children less than five years old to the priority groups in the vaccination irrespective of their age. The Paediatric Covid-19 Task Force Committee, in its report, recommended preferential vaccination for these mothers, considering the anticipated impact of the pandemic on children during the presumed third wave. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal, said that the state has so far given about 1.28 lakh doses to the mothers and the foreign education aspirants. 'All the people in the 45+ age bracket would be covered in the next one month or so. Then, the health department would launch the drive for 18+ in the state," said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-poised-to-launch-covid-19-vaccination-for-18-plus-in-july/articleshow/83475572.cms||---

Compared to the scenes over the past week, more people and vehicles were seen on the roads. There was a rush of morning shoppers in Shivajinagar, Jayanagar, KR Market and Malleswaram. Central business district (CBD), Chamrajpet, Corporation Circle and Anand Rao Circle, among other places, saw relatively heavier traffic. Police teams said that most people who ventured out had a genuine need. Buying groceries, visiting a hospital and getting vaccinated were the top reasons. The movement of vehicles from other districts to Bengaluru also increased on Saturday. Toll booth staffers at Tumakuru highway, Old Madras Road, Hoskote Road and Devanahalli reported lines of private vehicles bound for the city. “Families that had left the city are returning. As the government has not restricted intrastate and interstate movement of private vehicles, the numbers were more on Saturday,” said a police officer. Authorities anticipate more vehicles to enter the city on Sunday. “Our offices, which had permitted WFH earlier, have directed us to return to Bengaluru. Also, online classes will begin in a few weeks and we need to get books,” said Srikant Krishnan, who was waiting at the Devanahalli toll plaza.

The little girl was identified as K Bhavya Sree. Police said Bhavya Sree and her mother Parvathi were sleeping on the veranda of their house when Vinod, who is a relative of the girl and is believed to be mentally unstable, slit the girl’s throat and fled from the spot. When her mother woke up after hearing her daughter’s cries, she found her gasping in a pool of blood. Though neighbours immediately rushed her to a nearby hospital, she was declared brought dead. Elwinpeta police station SI K Krishna Prasad said the accused, according to locals, is mentally unstable and used to often roam around the village and threaten people with a knife. “He is nowhere to be seen after the crime. As of now, he is our main suspect. We have launched a manhunt to nab him. It’s difficult to establish the exact motive behind the murder till Vinod is nabbed.

---||Kolkata||Relief at Kolkata airport in rainy season: Tamil Nadu hunters trap 7 jackals||KOLKATA: An indigenous tribe from Tamil Nadu helped the airport authorities in capturing seven jackals just before the onset of monsoon. Jackal straying on the runway and taxi track is a major problem during rains when their burrows get flooded, forcing them out. Denied permission to cull jackals, Kolkata airport authorities recently recruited 22 Narikuravars — the indigenous tribe in Tamil Nadu — who are expert in capturing jackals. The deployment gave results as the hunters managed to trap seven golden jackals from the airport premises. The jackals were handed over to forest department. TOI had written on March 20 that the authorities, unable to control the jackal menace, had written to the state forest department, seeking permission to cull animals that abound the airport grounds and are a major threat to flight safety. However, since jackals are listed as a Schedule III animal under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, they enjoy protection. The airport authorities then turned to Narikurava (Jackal men in Tamil) hunters to trap the animals. The tribe had been to the airport earlier and had successfully captured a number of jackals too. This time, too, 22 men from Tamil Nadu were flown in and over a period of seven days, they cleared the airfield of the animals. “Recently, we have caught seven jackals and handed it over to the forest department for rehabilitation. At present, no jackal menace is being observed,” said C Pattabhi, the Kolkata airport director. According to officials, jackal sightings had shot up since the start of the year triggering alarms with pilots reporting jackals on or near runway on more occasions than ever before. Two pilots had reported spotting jackals on February 26. “A collision with a jackal weighing 8-10 kg can lead to a major accident,” said veteran pilot Sarvesh Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relief-at-airport-in-rainy-season-tamil-nadu-hunters-trap-7-jackals/articleshow/83468896.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
