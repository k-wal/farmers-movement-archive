This phase allows parks to reopen for a little while. Talking to TOI, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike chief health officer, Dr BK Vijendra said, "It is mandatory to wear masks when walking or jogging." This has once again brought up the discussion of whether it is advisable to wear masks and jog. Ultramarathoner Dharmendra Kumar, feels that joggers don’t need to wear masks "because everyone runs at their own pace and naturally maintain social distance." Another runner, Charan Manjunath says that he avoids running in parks and opts to run on roads to avoid any contact with other people. "Wearing masks while running causes suffocations and could lead to further health complications," he opines. Insisting that it is a good move, Dr Aditya Chowti, general physician, Specialist Hospital, says that wearing a mask prevents the spread of respiratory droplets and limits the spread of the virus. "Cloth masks are breathable and allow sufficient oxygen flow. The breathing pattern of joggers is much heavier when running and so that too can accelerate the travel distance of droplets which the mask can arrest. Maintaining distance from other joggers is also advisable," says Dr Aditya, adding that in case of shortness of breath or dizziness, one should get to a safe distance from others and then take off the mask. Explaining how one can work around wearing a mask while jogging or exercising, fitness educator and coach Yash Vardhan Swami says, "If we can breathe properly, we can continue with the exercise in the same intensity and if we are facing breathing issues, we should reduce the activity intensity and effort level. Masks are necessary for our own and others' safety." Yash also advises people to look into being properly hydrated. "Enough water along with electrolytes would help. And those who are just restarting their fitness journey should take it slow," he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-directive-rekindles-the-debate-on-mandatory-use-of-mask-for-joggers/articleshow/83570074.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

And if you happen to be a shopaholic, Jaipur is no less than a heaven for you. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, markets, malls and public places in general were shut for nearly two months to contain the spread of the virus. Recently, as part of the phased unlock plan, markets and malls have reopened in Jaipur from 6 am to 4 pm, much to the relief of locals. So, those planning to come to Jaipur to explore the city can look forward to shopping here again. Sanitiser dispensers and markers for social distancing are in place as shopkeepers welcome customers after facing a long spell of no income. There are countless choices for shopping in Jaipur, say shopkeepers“We have opened our shops with high hopes. We are taking all the safety measures so that customers can shop more and worry less about the risk of getting infected,” says Mohan Prakash Agarwal, a shopkeeper in Bapu Bazaar. “It might take a while for our sales to go up but we are witnessing people coming out for shopping. There are countless choices for shopping in Jaipur and as shopkeepers, we are making sure that our customers feel safe. From wearing masks, keeping sanitisers to not allowing more than three to four people inside our stores at a time, we are taking all the precautions. We are also making sure that our workers get vaccinated before they resume work,” says Anand Sharma, a shopkeeper at World Trade Park. In-person shopping has its own charm, say shoppers Not just shopkeepers, but even the shoppers are equally excited about indulging in in-person retail therapy. While they are understandably concerned about their health and won’t be going out without masks and hand sanitisers, they are keen to hit the stores and visit their favourite retailers. Aishwarya Mathur, a BA student, says, “I just want to get away from the internet for a while and do some shopping at my favourite stores in Jaipur. I overdosed on web series.” Pratishtha Singh, a corporate professional, says, “It’s been so long that I haven’t gone out for shopping. While online shopping is convenient, I think in-person shopping has its own charm. You can bring your friends along for shopping, which makes the whole experience so much fun!”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/it-might-take-a-while-for-our-sales-to-go-up-says-shopkeepers-in-jaipur-amid-covid-19-phased-unlock-plan/articleshow/84132515.cms||Neha Chaudhary

---||World||Pakistan NA Speaker bans 7 lawmakers from House till ‘further orders’||ISLAMABAD: A day after the Opposition and treasury benches clashed — verbally and physically — during the post-budget address of Leader of Opposition Shahbaz Sharif, Pakistan’s National Assembly (NA) Speaker on Wednesday barred seven lawmakers, four from the opposition and three from the governing Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), from entering the House. In a Twitter post, Speaker Asad Qaiser said that members who disrupted the session during Sharif's speech have been barred from entering the House as their behaviour was “unparliamentary” and “inappropriate”. The legislators who have been stopped from entering the House are Ali Gohar Khan, Chaudhary Hamid Hameed, Sheikh Rohale Asghar (all PML-N), Faheem Khan, Abdul Majeed Khan, Ali Nawaz Awan (all PTI) and Syed Agha Rafiullah (PPP). A separate statement issued by the NA secretariat said that the ban on the lawmakers would last until further orders. “The NA Secretariat has issued instructions to the MNAs concerned and to the assembly security,” it said. On Tuesday, the NA turned into a battleground as the Opposition and treasury members scuffled with each other and threw budget documents and books to disrupt Shahbaz’s budget speech for a second consecutive day. Qaiser suspended the proceedings of the House three times when the treasury members, led by some of the senior ministers who had come directly to the House after attending the weekly cabinet meeting, refused to pay heed to his directives to stay calm. They kept on sloganeering, whistling and desk-thumping. Maleeha Bokhari, a parliamentary secretary for law, was also hit by a flying object and injured in the eye. She later received first aid at the Parliament House dispensary. Besides Bokhari, some MNAs also complained that they had received bruises during the scuffle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-na-speaker-bans-7-lawmakers-from-house-till-further-orders/articleshow/83585866.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Dead 'murder hornet' near Seattle is first found in US in 2021||SPOKANE: Scientists have found a dead Asian giant hornet north of Seattle, the first so-called murder hornet discovered in the country this year, federal and state investigators said Wednesday. Entomologists from the state and U.S. Agriculture departments said it's the first confirmed report from Snohomish County, north of Seattle, and appears to be unrelated to the 2019 and 2020 findings of the hornets in Canada and Whatcom County, along the Canadian border, that gained widespread attention. The 2-inch-long (5-centimeter-long) invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. The world's largest hornet is much more of a threat to honeybees that are relied on to pollinate crops. They attack hives, destroying them in mere hours and decapitating bees in what scientists call their ``slaughter phase.'' How they got here from Asia is unclear, although it is suspected they travel on cargo ships. ``Hitchhikers are a side effect of all the commerce we do globally,'' said Sven Spichiger, an entomologist with the state Agriculture Department who is leading the fight to eradicate the hornets. In the latest sighting, a resident found the dead hornet on his lawn near the city of Marysville and reported it June 4 to the state agency. Entomologists retrieved it June 8, reporting that it was very dried out and a male hornet. Given the time of year, that it was a male and that the specimen was exceptionally dry, entomologists believe it was an old hornet from a previous season that wasn't discovered until now, officials said. New males usually don't emerge until at least July. There is no obvious pathway for how the hornet got to Marysville, officials said. ``The find is perplexing because it is too early for a male to emerge,'' said Dr. Osama El-Lissy, deputy administrator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's quarantine program. El-Lissy said the federal agency would work with state officials ``to survey the area to verify whether a population exists in Snohomish County.'' Because it was found for the first time in that county and had different coloring than previously collected specimens in North America, the hornet was submitted to the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for final verification. On June 11, entomologists confirmed it was an Asian giant hornet. DNA testing indicated the specimen appeared to be unrelated to the hornet introductions in Whatcom County or Canada. Spichiger said the newly found hornet lacked orange bands on its abdomen and likely came from a country in southern Asia. ``This new report continues to underscore how important public reporting is for all suspected invasive species, but especially Asian giant hornet,'' he said. In 2020, half of the confirmed Asian giant hornet sightings in Washington and all of the confirmed sightings in Canada came from the public, officials said. ``We'll now be setting traps in the area and encouraging citizen scientists to trap in Snohomish and King counties,`` Spichiger said. ``None of this would have happened without an alert resident taking the time to snap a photo and submit a report.'' The USDA has placed the giant hornets on the list of quarantine pests, giving Washington state more tools to help eradicate the invasive species.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/dead-murder-hornet-near-seattle-is-first-found-in-us-in-2021/articleshow/83585891.cms||---

Police claimed the accused, identified as Manish Thakur of Reasi’s Chassana Mahore, had gone underground after committing the crime in June 2017. He had since been evading arrest, continuously shifting between his hideouts in Mahore, Basohli in J&K and Himachal Pradesh. Reasi SSP Shailender Singh said, “Chassana Police had booked him in June 2017 for raping a 17-year-old girl. Meticulously planning, coordination and quick action finally led to his arrest.” The SSP appreciated the efforts of the police team for apprehending the accused from outside J&K and carrying forward the resolve to leave no stone unturned to arrest absconding criminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-the-run-for-4-years-rape-accused-from-jk-finally-arrested-in-himachal/articleshow/83585905.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Not friends, negotiators: Brisk Biden-Putin summit makes small gains||GENEVA: US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Wednesday to hold arms control and cyber-security talks, recording small gains and big differences at a first summit they both described as pragmatic rather than friendly.  The discussions at the lakeside Villa La Grange in Geneva lasted three hours - less than Biden's advisers had said they expected - but the US president said they had been intense and detailed, and that "we didn't need to spend more time talking".  Putin, 68, called Biden, 78, a constructive, experienced partner, and said they spoke "the same language", but added that there had been no friendship, rather a pragmatic dialogue about their two countries' interests.  Biden said he had told Putin "we need some basic rules of the road that we can all abide by", adding: "I did what I came to do."  The scheduling of separate news conferences meant there was none of the joviality that accompanied a 2018 meeting in Helsinki between Putin and Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, where Putin presented Trump with a soccer ball. There was also no shared meal.  In a joint statement issued after the news conferences, the two sides said the meeting showed that they were able to make progress on shared goals even in periods of tension.  Putin, who was first to brief reporters, said the meeting had been constructive, without hostility, and had showed the leaders' desire to understand each other.  He said it was "hard to say" if relations with the United States would improve, but that there was a "glimpse of hope" regarding mutual trust. There were no invitations to Washington or Moscow.  Biden, speaking shortly afterwards, said there was "no substitute for face-to-face dialogue", and that he had told Putin his agenda was "not against Russia" but "for the American people".  He, too, underlined the businesslike tone, saying: "This is not about trust, this is about self-interest and verification of self-interest." But he said there was a "genuine prospect" of improving relations. Cyber attacks Biden said they had spent a great deal of time discussing arms control and cyber-attacks, where he had told Putin that "critical infrastructure should be off-limits", giving him a list of 16 strategic sectors.  And he said he believed Putin was genuinely concerned about being "encircled" and about Washington wanting to "take him down".  In perhaps his strongest remark, Biden said the consequences would be "devastating for Russia" if jailed opposition figurehead Alexei Navalny, who has recovered from a hunger-strike to protest against his detention conditions, died.  Both men said Moscow and Washington shared a responsibility for nuclear stability, and would hold talks on possible changes to their recently extended New START arms limitation treaty.  Putin showed little appetite for compromise on a range of other issues, dismissing Washington's concerns about Navalny, about Russia's increased military presence near Ukraine's eastern border, and about US suggestions that unidentified Russians were responsible for a series of cyber-attacks in the United States.  Putin said Navalny had ignored the law and had known what would happen if he returned to Russia from Germany, where he had received treatment for an attempt inside Russia to kill him with poison. He also accused Kyiv of breaking the terms of a ceasefire agreement with pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.  The Kremlin leader said Russia had been the target of numerous cyber-attacks originating in from the United States.  Biden said he had raised human rights issues because it was in the "DNA" of his country to do so, and also the fate of US citizens jailed in Russia.  Putin said he believed some compromises could be found, although he gave no indication of any prisoner exchange deal.  Asked about a crackdown on Russia's political opposition, Putin said he did not want riots in Russia or a movement akin to the US Black Lives Matter movement. Biden called the comparison "ridiculous". Arms control Arms control is, however, one domain where progress has historically been possible despite wider disagreements.  In February, Russia and the United States extended for five years their New START treaty, which caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads they can deploy and limits the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.  Both sides had said in advance of the summit that they hoped for more stable and predictable relations, even though they were at odds over everything from arms control and cyber-hacking to election interference and Ukraine.  The first round of talks - which included Biden, Putin, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - lasted almost two hours, officials said.  Talks resumed after a break at around 4 pm (1400 GMT), with Moscow's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov among those present. That round ended at 5:05 pm (1505 GMT).  Relations have been deteriorating for years, notably with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, its 2015 intervention in Syria and US charges - denied by Moscow - of meddling in the 2016 election that brought Donald Trump to the White House.  They sank further in March when Biden said he thought Putin was a "killer", prompting Russia to recall Antonov from Washington for consultations. The United States recalled its ambassador soon after.  Putin said on Wednesday that he had been satisfied by Biden's explanation of the remark.  Trump's summit in 2018 with Putin in Helsinki had included a meeting accompanied only by interpreters, but Biden and Putin had no solo talks.  Standing beside Putin in Helsinki in 2018, Trump refused to blame him for meddling in the 2016 US election, casting doubt on the findings of his own intelligence agencies and sparking a storm of domestic criticism.  Biden had already left the podium at his news conference when he turned back to emphatically correct a reporter who asked him why he was "confident" Putin would change his behaviour.  "I'm not 'confident he'll change his behaviour'," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/not-friends-negotiators-brisk-biden-putin-summit-makes-small-gains/articleshow/83586410.cms||---
---||World||World's third largest diamond unearthed in Bostwana||GABORONE: A 1,098 carat diamond believed to be the third largest gem-quality stone ever to be mined, has been discovered in Botswana, according to a joint venture between Anglo American's De Beers and the government. The stone was presented to President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Wednesday by Debswana Diamond Company's acting managing director Lynette Armstrong. It is the third largest in the world, behind the 3,106 carat Cullinan stone recovered in South Africa in 1905 and the 1,109 carat Lesedi La Rona unearthed by Lucara Diamonds in Botswana in 2015. "This is the largest diamond to be recovered by Debswana in its history of over 50 years in operation," Armstrong said. "From our preliminary analysis it could be the world's third largest gem quality stone. We are yet to make a decision on whether to sell it through the De Beers channel or through the state owned Okavango Diamond Company," Armstrong said. Minerals minister Lefoko Moagi said the discovery of the yet-to-be named stone, which measures 73mm long, 52mm wide and 27mm thick, could not have come at a better time after the COVID-19 pandemic hit diamond sales in 2020. The government receives as much as 80% of the income from Debswana's sales through dividends, royalties and taxes. Production at Debswana fell 29% in 2020 to 16.6 million carats while sales fell 30% to $2.1 billion as the pandemic impacted both production and demand. In 2021, Debswana plans to increase output by as much as 38% to pre-pandemic levels of 23 million carats as the global diamond market recovers with the easing of travel restrictions and reopening of jewellers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/worlds-third-largest-diamond-unearthed-in-bostwana/articleshow/83586262.cms||---
---||India||Not hearing bail plea violates rights of accused, says Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Holding denial of hearing on bail plea as an infringement of the rights and liberty assured to an accused, the Supreme Court has said that timely hearing must be granted in such cases even during the pandemic. A bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian expressed shock that the Punjab and Haryana high court did not take up the bail plea for over a year. The accused approached the apex court after his request for early hearing was rejected by the HC. “Normally, we do not interfere with an interim order passed by the high court but we are constrained to pass the present order as we are shocked to see that the bail application under Section 439 CrPC is not being listed for hearing for more than one year. The accused has a right to hearing of his application for bail. In fact, the denial of hearing is an infringement on right and liberty assured to an accused,” the bench said on Tuesday. The order was uploaded on the SC website on Wednesday. “Therefore, we hope the high court will be able to take up the application for bail at an early date so that the right of the accused of hearing of application for bail is not taken away...” the bench said, and asked the HC registrar general to bring this order to the notice of the “competent authority to take remedial steps at the earliest”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-hearing-bail-plea-violates-rights-of-accused-says-supreme-court/articleshow/83587603.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||World||Man who drove at Minneapolis protesters charged with murder||MINNEAPOLIS: A St. Paul man accused of speeding up and driving into a group of protesters in Minneapolis while he was drunk, killing one person, was charged Wednesday with intentional second-degree murder.  Prosecutors say Nicholas Kraus, 35, was visibly intoxicated Sunday night when he sped up and tried to "jump" a car that was being used as a barricade by protesters in the city's Uptown neighborhood. Deona Knajdek, 31, was killed.  There's nothing in the criminal complaint to suggest Kraus' actions were motivated by political views or anger at protesters. The murder count alleges Kraus intended to cause death, but his actions were not premeditated. He's also charged with two counts of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon, for injuring two other protesters.  According to the criminal complaint, Kraus told officers he saw the car and believed he needed to get over it. He said he saw people in the area, but "he accelerated in order to try and jump the barricade and acknowledged that he did not attempt to brake," the complaint says. It also says he admitted that he thought he might have hit someone.  Kraus will make his first court appearance Friday and it wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney to comment on his behalf. He's being held at the Hennepin County jail, which does not take messages for people in custody.  Protests have been ongoing in Uptown since members of a U.S. Marshals Service task force fatally shot Winston Boogie Smith Jr., a 32-year-old Black man and father of three, on June 3. Authorities said they were trying to arrest Smith on a warrant for being a felon in possession of a firearm when he displayed a handgun from inside a parked SUV. Authorities also say evidence shows Smith fired his gun from inside the SUV, but a female passenger has said she never saw him with a gun.  Minneapolis has been on edge since the death of George Floyd, who died last year after an officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the ground, and the fatal police shooting of another Black man, Daunte Wright, in a nearby suburb.  On Tuesday, city crews began clearing and reopening streets near the site of Smith's shooting and Knajdek's death, but after police left, protesters moved back in and blocked traffic. Police say 30 people were arrested Tuesday night, with most receiving misdemeanor citations.  The street was open to traffic Wednesday afternoon. Though obstructions to traffic were removed, a memorial featuring messages in chalk and flowers left by mourners remained intact.  The Minnesota National Guard tweeted that - at the request of the city - it was prepared to send about 100 soldiers to Minneapolis in the event of unrest.  Witnesses have said Kraus was driving an SUV when he struck a parked car, sending it into the crowd of demonstrators. Police said protesters pulled Kraus from his vehicle and witnesses reported demonstrators struck him. Kraus was arrested and treated for injuries at a hospital.  Kraus has five convictions for driving while impaired dating back to a 2007 incident, according to online court records. At one point, he told officers that the SUV he was driving on Sunday was in another person's name because he had no license due to his drunken driving offenses, the complaint says. Court records show his driver's license was canceled in 2013.  A search warrant affidavit seeking a blood sample from Kraus says he admitted several times that he was the driver, without being asked, but when asked specific questions he gave illogical and irrelevant answers. Kraus told police his name was Jesus Christ and Tim Burton, that he had been a carpenter for 2,000 years, and that he wanted to get his children to the Super Bowl, the affidavit says.  The officer tried to perform a field sobriety test, but Kraus "was unable to follow directions and would not keep his eyes open long enough to complete the test," the affidavit said.  Results from the blood tests are pending.  Other injuries and deaths have been reported involving vehicles at protests across the U.S. as people have increasingly taken to the streets to press their grievances. In Minneapolis, marching onto freeways has become a common tactic. Last year, a semitrailer rolled into a crowd marching on a closed freeway. No one was seriously injured.  Republican politicians in several states, including Oklahoma, Florida and Iowa, have sought legal immunity for drivers who hit protesters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-who-drove-at-minneapolis-protesters-charged-with-murder/articleshow/83587818.cms||---
---||India||Cops may send notices to Twitter, others for sharing ‘unverified’ video||GHAZIABAD: Police haven’t ruled out sending notices to those booked for sharing an “unverified video” of a 72-year-old man alleging he was subjected to a hate crime, including microblogging site Twitter where the video was circulated, a day after filing an FIR against six individuals and three private entities. Late on Tuesday night, an FIR was filed at Loni border police station in Ghaziabad against Mohammed Zubair, co-founder of fact-checking website Alt News, journalists and commentators Rana Ayyub and Saba Naqvi and Salman Nizami, Maskoor Usmani and Shama Mohamed of Congress, besides Twitter Inc, Twitter Communication India Pvt Ltd and a news portal, reports Abhijay Jha. Ghaziabad police chief Amit Pathak told TOI on Wednesday, “An FIR has been lodged against Twitter and others, and should the need arise and new investigations warrant so, a legal notice could also be issued to Twitter.” A senior inspector has been appointed investigating officer in the case, said the SSP. “As the investigation proceeds and new facts come to light, more arrests will be made and this includes those who had a role to play in giving the incident a communal hue,” he added. Another FIR, the third since Abdul Samad filed a police complaint on June 6, was registered on Wednesday night, this one against Samajwadi Party functionary Ummed Pehelwan Idris, who had accompanied Samad to the police station. “It has come to light that Ummed went live on Facebook with Samad sitting by his side in which he could be seen giving provocative statements,” said Akhilesh Mishra, SHO of Loni border police station. “He made the video viral without verifying facts of the case and there was an attempt on his part to disturb communal harmony and give the incident a communal twist,” added Mishra. The FIR also says that in the entire incident, Facebook did not try to verify the facts and allowed Idris to use its platform. No charges were, however, invoked against Facebook. Bulandshahr resident Samad was on June 5 assaulted by a group of men, who had also cut his beard, during a visit to Ghaziabad. The video of that assault along with another one in which Samad claimed he was called a Pakistani spy by his assailants and asked to say “Jai Shri Ram” reached social media earlier this week. Police, however, pointed out Samad had made no mention of communal abuse in his June 7 complaint. The cops also claimed Samad had hid the fact that he knew the main accused, Pravesh Gujjar, to whom he had sold an amulet and the attack was a fallout of Gujjar being upset about the amulet bringing him misfortune. Idris has been booked under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 505 (publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report with intent to incite) of the IPC and under Section 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the IT Act. The complaint was filed by sub-inspector Naresh Singh. The FIR against Twitter and the eight others contains charges under IPC Sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A, 295A, 505, 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention). Idiris claimed to have held various party positions in the district as an SP functionary and was also a member of the Ghaziabad Development Authority board. He had on Tuesday told TOI he had no role to play in Samad’s second video alleging a hate crime. Less than a day after their arrest, meanwhile, two accused in the assault case, Adil and Kallu, got bail on Wednesday. Gujjar remains in jail. Loni circle officer Atul Sonkar said efforts are being made to nab the three other accused in the case. “We have formed teams that are raiding possible hideouts of Poli, Aarif and Mushahid,” said Sonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cops-may-send-notices-to-twitter-others-for-sharing-unverified-video/articleshow/83587879.cms||---

In one of the documents submitted by the agency, a copy of which is with TOI, the firm’s address is listed as being in Ansal Chambers, Bhikaji Cama Place, East Delhi. There is no Bhikaji Cama Place in East Delhi. On the company’s website, their corporate address is mentioned in a building in Sector 63, Noida, which TOI found was a tin shed. None of the phone numbers listed on the website was in service. TOI spoke to one of the directors of the company who said the incorrect addresses were “manual errors” and phone numbers were unreachable since they had been submitted on “old letterheads of the firm”. She also said the property in Noida — where a tin shed currently stands — was once a factory. “We shut shop two years ago. But the website still has that address,” she said. Read AlsoHow an LIC agent's search for answers exposed Kumbh Covid test scamAn ICMR probe found that a lakh Covid test reports were forged. This could just be the tip of the icebergWhen pressed further, she said they were now operational from Ansal Chambers, South Delhi, but had given their registered office on lease to a courier company during lockdown. “We will cooperate with the state’s investigation. The samples were collected and data was generated by two private labs that we had an MoU with, we were simply mediators,” she said. On Wednesday, TOI also found that the company’s proposal of interest to conduct testing during Kumbh was initially rejected by the Haridwar health department. Chief medical officer (CMO), Haridwar, Dr S K Jha, said the agency had approached them to get empanelled as a Covid-testing agency. “They were not given permission as they did not have approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” he said. The firm managed to get an approval from the mela administration to conduct Covid tests. The mela administration was created during Kumbh to take all decisions pertaining to the festival. Mela health officer Dr Arjun Singh Sengar said the agency was given the green light as it had an MoU with two private labs, both of which were ICMR-approved laboratories. But an official who is part of the Uttarakhand health department investigation said, “How can a company get the contract based on a simple ‘expression of interest’? Was there a tender to award the contracts? Who vetted the company? They had no track record of working with the state government.” Nine private agencies and the state government had conducted 4 lakh tests during the festival period in Haridwar after the Uttarakhand high court had directed the state to conduct 50,000 daily tests in Kumbh. The agency under scanner had been tasked with conducting tests in key mela areas.

---||World||China seeking to control bodies like WHO, Interpol: UK parliament panel||LONDON: Autocratic nations like China are seeking to manipulate, undermine, or even break up multilateral organisations, such as the WHO and Interpol, set up in the wake of World War II to establish an international system based on shared values of peace, prosperity and freedom, a new report has found. The report, published Thursday by the UK House of Commons foreign affairs committee, which is made up of 11 MPs who scrutinise the country's foreign policies, warns, "If the UK and its allies do not respond to the corrosive influence of states, including China and Russia, there is a very real risk that democratic states will lose multilateral organisations to authoritarian states who have done little to demonstrate that they wish to uphold the values these organisations represent." "We have seen attempts by countries such as China to seize control of strategically important organisations and fundamentally redefine the once universally agreed principles on which they are based. The UK has played a leading role in the foundation and development of multilateral organisations. This system remains on a slow drift toward capture by autocratic states," the report warns. It found that China was increasingly using aggressive means, including bilateral economic leverage, to coerce states in multilateral organisations to back their position or their candidates and then it "uses the organisations to shift policies away from the cooperation the organisations were created to promote". The report recommends that the UK work with a coalition of like-minded states within these bodies to publicly call out states who are undermining the system and publicly vote against attempts by such states to secure leadership positions. The report criticised the disengagement of the Trump administration, saying it had allowed China to consolidate its grip over several multilateral organisations. The report looks at six major multilateral organisations — the World Health Organisation, the World Trade Organisation, Interpol, the United Nations Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Court and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. "There are examples of China using its economic leverage, through the Belt and Road Initiative, to achieve support in multilaterals. Use of aggressive diplomacy by China, or ‘bullying’, can be seen in operation at the OHCHR and HRC as well as the WHO," the report said. It added many HRC member states "hold an alternative view of human rights to those they initially ratified in the UN charter" and that China held a sway over the WHO disproportionate to its funding or representation on the secretariat. The report expressed grave concern over the funding of these bodies, saying that there was a risk of them being "captured" by state or private donors who could influence their agendas. TOI had reported in March how the OHCHR had accepted a $10,000 donation from pro-Khalistan Sikhs for Justice. The foreign affairs committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, said: "Dictatorships are taking over the institutions built out of the wreckage of the Second World War to defend democracy."

---||India||Mehul Choksi fled as he knew action was likely: CBI||MUMBAI: A series of moves made by fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi two months before the first FIR was registered against him in February 2018 has led the CBI to conclude that he had prior knowledge about the impending criminal proceedings. “Hence, Mehul Choksi fled the country on January 4, 2018, with dishonest intent, to evade the process of law,” the CBI said in its supplementary chargesheet against Choksi and 21 others. The investigating agency said that in December 2017, Choksi met dummy directors of his suppliers in Hong Kong and apprised them of the enquiries by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which too has registered cases against him. The CBI said that Choksi told the dummy directors to apply for Thailand visas as the Hong Kong operations would be closed. Subsequently, when the fraud came to light, he allegedly got them to move to Bangkok in February 2018. “In January 2018, Vipul Chitalia (vice-president of Choksi’s Gitanjali Group of Companies) conveyed to these dummy partners, directors, authorized signatories that Mehul Choksi had instructed that they should not visit India as they might (face) trouble from the investigating agencies from India,” the chargesheet said. Yet, they returned in the second quarter of 2018. The chargesheet also said that in February 2018, Choksi called up Punjab National Bank (PNB)’s Brady House branch’s head and promised to settle the repayment of the outstanding fraudulent LOUs (Letter of Undertaking) and bills discounted against fraudulent FLCs (Foreign Letters of Credits). Choksi has been accused of obtaining these fraudulently. Read AlsoFirms owned by Choksi siphoned off over Rs 6,344.96 crore from PNB using fraudulent LoUs: CBICompanies owned by fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi have allegedly siphoned off over Rs 6,344.96 crore from the Punjab National Bank (PNB) using fraudulent letters of undertaking and foreign letters of credit, a CBI investigation into the scam has detected.Among the 22 individuals and companies charged in the case by the CBI, the new additions are Sagar Sawant, PNB’s single window operator; Sanjay Kumar Prasad, PNB’s former branch head; Dhanesh Sheth, whole time director in Gitanjali Gems Ltd; and Sunil Varma, international head of Gitanjali Group of Companies. The CBI has also invoked destruction of evidence charge. It said that arrested accused, Gokulnath Shetty, former deputy manager of PNB, dishonestly and fraudulently returned all the original applications along with other accompanying documents, which should have been in the custody of the bank. The CBI said that these documents were recovered from the rented premises of one of Choksi’s employees. Before their recovery, the documents were shifted to various places across the city with the intention to cause disappearance of evidence. “During investigation, the records of fraudulent LOUs and FLCs transaction maintained in the Google Drive by Vipul Chitalia at the behest of Mehul Choksi were recovered,” the CBI said. The CBI chargesheet also said that PNB had issued 165 LoUs and not 142 as earlier alleged. “However, it is found that against 165 unauthorised LOUs, accused companies availed 142 Buyer’s Credit,” the CBI said. It alleged that Choksi, in conspiracy with accused bank officials, dishonestly and fraudulently got the LoUs issued from PNB’s Brady House branch in 2017 on behalf of his companies claiming import of freshwater pearls. The CBI said that this was done despite knowing that he had exhausted the sanctioned limit and without providing 110% cash margin—which was required in cases beyond the sanctioned limit. It alleged that the aggregate amount defrauded was raised to Rs 7,080 crore. The CBI also said that the bank had paid Rs 3,154 crore to the six overseas lending banks since the detection of the fraud in 2018. The investigating agency also said that further investigation was required to be conducted into the role of Bishnubrata Mishra, then chief internal auditor of PNB’s Brady House branch. Investigations will also continue against fraudulent LOUs issued in 2015 and 2016 and fraudulent amendments made under FLCs issued in 2014, 2015 and 2016 by the accused PNB officials. “The remaining allegations in respect of alleged diversion of Rs 942.18 crore under the credit facilities sanctioned to three accused companies as well as to Ms Asmi Jewellery lndia Ltd. mentioned in the additional complaint…to be investigated,” the chargesheet said. Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said, “This supplementary chargesheet after three years shows that it is only an attempt to cover up anomalies that the defence has pointed out in first chargesheet. Moreover, addition of section 201 of IPC (destruction of evidence) is not legally tenable as a document becomes evidence only after filing of the court, and the allegations are of a period much prior to even FIR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mehul-choksi-fled-as-he-knew-action-was-likely-cbi/articleshow/83588596.cms||Rebecca Samervel

In a virtual address at the Asean defence ministers-plus meeting, Singh said maritime security challenges were an area of concern for India. “The sea lanes of communication are critical for peace, stability, prosperity and development of the Indo-Pacific region,” he said. “In this regard, developments in the South China Sea have attracted attention in the region and beyond. India supports freedom of navigation, overflight, and unimpeded commerce in these international waterways,” he added. India hopes that the ‘code of conduct’ negotiations will lead to outcomes that are in keeping with international law, including the UNCLOS, and do not prejudice the legitimate rights and interests of nations that are not party to these discussions, he said. China has been flexing its muscles and showing aggressive behaviour in territorial disputes in the South China Sea over the last few years, which has led to heightened tensions with its neighbours as well as the US. US secretary of defence Llyod Austin was also part of the Asean virtual meet on Wednesday, with its eight dialogue partners — India, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US. Taking a swipe at Pakistan as well, Singh said terrorism and radicalisation are the gravest threats to peace and security that the world is facing today. “India shares global concerns about terrorism and believes that in an era when networking amongst terrorists is reaching alarming proportions, only through collective cooperation can the terror organisations and their networks be fully disrupted, the perpetrators identified and held accountable,” he said. “Strong measures be undertaken against those who encourage, support and finance terrorism and provide sanctuary to terrorists. As a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), India remains committed to combat financing of terrorism,” he added. India’s engagement with the south east Asian region, of which Asean has been a primary component, is based on its ‘Act East Policy’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-chinese-minister-presence-rajnath-backs-free-open-scs/articleshow/83588743.cms||---

DAP is the most widely used soil nutrient after urea. Last month, the Centre had decided to increase the subsidy on DAP fertiliser by 140% at a high-level meeting chaired by PM Modi. Minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya said this has been done for the benefits of farmers. “Farmers will continue to get DAP at the old rate of Rs 1,200 per bag,” he said. One bag has 50 kilograms of the fertiliser. According to him, the subsidy for DAP fertiliser has been increased to Rs 1,200 per bag from Rs 500 per bag to provide relief to farmers. Mandaviya said that in the case of urea, the maximum retail price is fixed while the subsidy amount keeps changing. On an average, he said the government is providing Rs 900 per bag subsidy on urea. But the government provides a fixed amount of subsidy on non-urea fertilisers, including DAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-keep-fertiliser-prices-in-check-cabinet-okays-rs-14775-crore-subsidy/articleshow/83588863.cms||---

Kim Avis was found guilty of of raping three women and sexually assaulting a minor following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow, Scotland, last month. The 57-year-old was convicted of 13 charges related to sexual offences that occurred between 2006 and 2017, and an additional charge of failing to attend a previous trial date after he fled to America, the Scotland prosecutor's office said.  Avis was sentenced last week to 12 years in prison for the sexual offenses and three years for failing to appear at an initial trial in March 2019.  Avis was on bail when he flew into Los Angeles International Airport in February 2019, using the name Ken Gordon-Avis.  Several days later, his teenage son reported him missing at Monastery Beach off the coast of Carmel, California, after he said Avis went for a nighttime swim in treacherous waters. Searchers found no trace off the area sometimes called "Mortuary Beach" for its deadly reputation.  After three days of intense searching, detectives began to suspect a hoax. They said the son's account lacked crucial details, and he couldn't answer basic questions like how the two got to California's central coast after traveling by air from Scotland to Los Angeles.  Authorities in California then discovered that Avis, who is from the Edinburgh area, was wanted on multiple counts of rape in Scotland. His son subsequently returned home and did not face charges for filing a false report.  The investigation was turned over to the U.S. Marshals Service, which has responsibility for catching wanted criminals. Avis was arrested five months later in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and extradited back home to Scotland, where he was held in prison until his trial.  "Kim Avis went to great lengths to evade justice for his crimes," said Fraser Gibson, the public prosecutor for High Court sexual offenses. "Thanks to the efforts of police and prosecutors, working together with US law enforcement, he has been brought to justice."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/scottish-man-who-faked-death-in-california-jailed-for-rape/articleshow/83589209.cms||---

Talking to reporters, Chirag said the rebel group’s decision to remove him from the national president’s post was against the party’s constitution, adding that he was bracing for a long legal battle to wrest control of the family outfit. The second-time MP from Jamui said the betrayal of his own family members hurt him more than the conspiracy by his political opponents. “I was looking up to my uncle (Pashupati Kumar Paras) when my father and other uncle passed away. I didn’t become an orphan when my father passed away but I did when my uncle betrayed me. My mother tried to talk to him till Tuesday afternoon but it failed,” Chirag said while referring to the revolt by Paras and four other party MPs. He said it was unimaginable for him to see cousin Prince Raj revolting against him. Chirag, who introduced himself as “sher ka beta”, trained his guns on Nitish Kumar whom he had targeted in last year’s Bihar polls, alleging that the Bihar CM had always believed in “divide and rule”, and claimed that a conspiracy to dislodge him was hatched while he was ill. “Some tried to divide us. When I say some, it’s particularly JD(U). JD(U) doesn’t want to see the emergence of Dalit leaders,” he added. Chirag said he decided not to be part of the alliance with JD(U) because of LJP’s ideology. “If we had gone with them, we would have swept the state. There are some people in the party who don’t want to struggle, but want to practice politics of comfort. We went with an agenda to people and got more than 6% votes. For us, it was an achievement,” he said. Responding to a question on his removal from the party president’s post, Chirag said the LJP constitution specifies that a change can happen only when the incumbent chief dies or resigns. He said even Paras’s election as the party leader in Lok Sabha was against the LJP constitution, asserting that in the absence of the party’s parliamentary board, it was only the president who could take such decisions. Earlier in the day, Paras left for Patna. He said he was going for the party’s national council meeting where a new national president would be elected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chirag-paswan-attacks-jdu-for-split-mum-on-bjp/articleshow/83589216.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Business||US Federal Reserve signals rate hikes for 2023 as inflation rises, virus fades||WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday brought forward its projections for the first post-pandemic interest rate hikes into 2023, citing an improved health situation and dropping a longstanding reference that the crisis was weighing on the economy. New projections saw a majority of 11 of 18 US central bank officials pencil in at least two quarter-percentage-point rate increases for 2023, even as officials pledged in a statement to keep policy supportive for now to encourage an ongoing jobs recovery. That rate-hike view, coupled with a new forecast for three years of inflation running above the central bank's 2% target, suggests concerns about overheating have risen sharply inside the Fed's policy-setting committee. "Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States" the Fed said in a statement after its latest policy meeting, a substantial shift for an institution that has conditioned policy for the past 14 months on battling the pandemic. The Fed reiterated its promise to await "substantial further progress" before beginning to shift to policies less tuned to the pandemic and more to a fully open economy. The new language does not mean a change in policy is imminent: The Fed on Wednesday held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and said it will continue to buy $120 billion in bonds each month to fuel the economic recovery. But new economic and interest rate projections appeared to add some urgency to the Fed's planning. Policymakers at the median now see the first rate increase coming in 2023 instead of 2024. The projections showed the outlook for inflation jumping this year, though the price increases were still described as "transitory". Overall economic growth is expected to hit 7%. Together, the projections were indicative of a recovery moving faster than anticipated, and justifying discussions about the next phase of policy for the Fed. "This change in stance jars a little with the Fed’s recent claims that the recent spike in inflation is temporary," said James McCann, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. "The pressure is on to explain the change in stance without setting hares running." Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news briefing at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to elaborate on the statement, and possibly provide more details on how the Fed's policy discussion will proceed. JOBS SHORTFALL The economy remains about 7.5 million jobs short of where it stood at the onset of the pandemic in February, 2020. Fed officials still describe that level as "far" from their goal of restoring maximum employment. But, increasingly, they have also attributed the employment shortfall more to logistical issues around workers returning to jobs, factors which the Fed cannot easily change, than the strength of the economy. On the matters it can influence - the overall demand for goods and services, and the need for workers to provide them - the Fed feels it is closer to its goal. There was roughly one job opening for every unemployed person as of May. U.S. stocks dropped and bond yields rose after the release of the statement and the new economic and interest rate projections. The S&P 500 index was last down more than 1% and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to about 1.55% from 1.49% before the statement's release.

The case fatality rate among such women was also much higher during the second wave at 5.7%, against 0.7% in the first wave. The study underlines the importance of vaccination of pregnant and lactating women against Covid-19 as they were more severely affected during the second wave of the pandemic compared to the first. Overall, 2% maternal deaths were estimated during both the waves. While Covid-19 vaccination is recommended for all lactating women in India, the government has still not allowed vaccinating pregnant women, citing lack of clinical trial data. Minutes of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) meeting showed that the group has suggested vaccinating pregnant women as the benefits of vaccination may outweigh the risk. However, it suggested that women should be informed that long-term adverse events and the safety of the vaccine for the foetus and the child were yet to be established. The government is yet to take a final decision on vaccinating pregnant women against Covid-19. Last week, the WHO had recommended vaccinating pregnant women if they faced high risk of exposure to Covid-19 and if they had co-morbid conditions.

Kerala displaced Maharashtra (1.56 lakh cases) and Karnataka (1.53 lakh) to take the second spot. Andhra Pradesh is ranked fifth (1.1 lakh cases), followed by Odisha (82,000) and Bengal (79,000). However, all these states have made significant progress in containment efforts, bringing down the total count of cases by almost 40% or more as compared to a couple of fortnights ago. As a result, the all-India count of cases too has climbed down significantly — 12.6 lakh in the last fortnight compared to 25.35 lakh in the fortnight before and 45.7 lakh during May 4-17. Maharashtra was reporting almost 8 lakh cases every fortnight between April 8 and May 4, being at the top among states reporting high cases. Karnataka, UP and Kerala also added more than 4 lakh cases in a fortnight during this period. Delhi with three lakh cases was at the fifth position during April 21-May 4. Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have made remarkable progress in containing the pandemic. The total cases in UP have come down to 10,228 (June 1-14) as compared to 4.25 lakh during April 21-May 4. In Delhi, the cases have dropped to 4,407 from a high of 3 lakh during the same period. Delhi has added the minimum number of cases to the all-India tally, followed by Jharkhand, Goa, Uttarakhand, MP, Himachal, Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat and UP. Smaller states like Goa and Uttarakhand, which saw 6,152 and 6,700 cases respectively in the last fortnight, need more containment measures before easing of lockdown. Himachal Pradesh, too, needs to be on guard with the state having added 7,625 cases in the last two weeks. Fortnightly cases in Assam, Telangana, Punjab, J&K and Chhattisgarh were in the range of 14,000-50,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/5-states-recorded-over-1-lakh-covid-19-cases-in-first-2-weeks-of-june/articleshow/83589563.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||World||Ohio House expels former Republican speaker in historic vote||COLUMBUS: Members of the Ohio House expelled a defiant Larry Householder, the indicted Republican ex-speaker, in a bipartisan vote Wednesday, invoking their powers to remove a member for the first time in 150 years.  The GOP-controlled House voted 75-21 to remove Householder, of Perry County, approving a resolution that stated he was not suited for office because of the indictment.  "I have not nor have I ever taken a bribe or solicited or been solicited for taking a bribe," said Householder, as he reiterated his innocence on the House floor before he was expelled.  The full House took to a vote after Republican lawmakers forced the measure to the floor instead of waiting for the expulsion resolution to work through the committee process.  Reps. Brian Stewart and Mark Fraizer, both Republicans representing districts that border Householder's, encouraged their colleagues to "do the right thing" and remove Householder from his seat.  "This has been a distraction. This has been a stain on the institution and it is time for us to come together as one body," Fraizer said, adding that "this institution is greater than any one man."  Householder and four associates were arrested in July in an investigation connected to legislation containing a ratepayer-funded bailout of two Ohio nuclear power plants. The $1 billion rescue would have added a new fee to every electricity bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo.  Federal prosecutors allege Householder and his allies took FirstEnergy money in exchange for orchestrating a scheme to elect Householder speaker, put his allies into House seats, then pass the bailout bill and thwart a subsequent ballot effort to repeal it.  If he is convicted of the federal charges against him, he could face up to 20 years in prison.  The historic Wednesday vote was met with colorful reaction from both Democrats and Republicans in Ohio.  "Justice, decency and common sense gave a standing ovation to today's vote to expel Mr. Householder from the People's House," Republican Attorney General Dave Yost tweeted shortly after the vote.  State Rep. Emilia Sykes, the top House Democrat, who has been urging lawmakers to expel Householder for over a year, said the disgraced lawmaker gave the chamber "no choice but to act."  "Make no mistake, there is no joy in seeing a former Ohio speaker removed from office in disgrace, but this is our opportunity to stand against corruption and to turn a page on this dark chapter in Ohio history and begin to rebuild the People's trust in a government that's supposed to work for them," Sykes said in a statement.  A day before his colleagues voted him out, Householder appeared in front of a committee where he delivered an hours-long testimony on why removing him from office would be the wrong thing to do.  "Just think of the precedent this will set: Allegations are enough to remove anyone from office," Householder testified Tuesday. "That's absurd."  Two of Householder's co-defendants and an involved nonprofit have pleaded guilty in the case. FirstEnergy, the energy company at the heart of the latest scandal, has acknowledged in court filings making the bulk of the payments in an alleged $60 million bribery scheme.  The last time the Ohio House expelled a sitting lawmaker was in 1857 when John P. Slough was removed for punching a fellow legislator.  On Tuesday, Householder went on to compare the bipartisan efforts to remove him to the attempts by Congressman Adam Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to impeach former President Donald Trump earlier this year. "This is clearly politically motivated and I think everyone in this room knows that," he said.  In 2004, Householder left the House the first time due to term limits while he and several top advisers were under federal investigation for alleged money laundering and irregular campaign practices. The government later closed the case without filing charges.  After a nasty battle, Householder was again elected speaker in 2019.  ___  Farnoush Amiri is a corps members for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

---||India||Covid-19: Experts say one vaccine dose enough for five people||BENGALURU: Given the acute shortage of Covid-19 vaccines, one way to ramp up the vaccination programme is by providing a smaller quantity of the vaccine in an intradermal (ID) way, said experts. This means injecting 0.1ml into the skin, which is a fifth of the volume of the current dose of 0.5ml given intramuscularly in the shoulder. In short, a 0.5ml dose now given to one recipient will be able to vaccinate five persons by the intradermal route. “This is done successfully in rabies vaccination. The concentration of antigen-processing cells in the skin is responsible for the strong immunologic response to vaccines administered through the skin, despite the lower amount of vaccines injected. An intradermal shot is expected to stimulate precisely the regional lymph nodes and quickly generate an immune response that is sometimes better than the intramuscular response,” said Technical Advisory Committee chairman Dr MK Sudarshan, who has the expertise of working on rabies vaccines. The Union government has to take up the matter with the manufacturing companies to conduct a study on the same, Dr Sudarshan added. The World Health Organization approved intradermal rabies vaccination in the 1980s and India introduced it in 2006. “Rabies is practically 100% fatal and IDRV (intradermal rabies vaccination) is successfully used to treat and prevent rabies in those bitten by rabid animals. On the contrary, Covid-19 is fatal in less than 1% of those infected and the Covid vaccine is given to prevent the disease in healthy adults as preventive vaccination,” said Dr Sudarshan. According to him, a well-planned clinical trial may be conducted involving 10 healthy volunteers each for Covishied and Covaxin. “The study, with necessary approvals from the ethics committee of a medical college, can check whether the vaccines are safe and immunogenic when given through intradermal route. A dose of 0.1ml is given in the ID route on days zero and 28. The antibody response in the vaccinated persons may be checked four weeks after each dose through tests. These studies can be fast-tracked and conducted in three months,” Dr Sudarshan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-experts-say-one-vaccine-dose-enough-for-five-people/articleshow/83589884.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||India||Covid-19: Decision to extend gap between doses was unanimous, says govt||NEW DELHI: The decision to increase the gap between two doses of Covishield vaccine from 4-6 weeks to 12-16 weeks was “unanimous” and based on studies that showed that a longer interval resulted in higher efficacy, the government’s top advisory group on immunisation said on Wednesday. Responding to a Reuters report that three members of the group denied backing the 12-16 weeks dosage interval, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) countered the report and said there was no dissent from any member when the decision was vetted by the Covid-19 working group and the standing technical sub-committee (STSC) under NTAGI. “We have a very open and transparent system where decisions are taken on scientific basis. The Covid working group took that decision, with no dissenting voice. This issue was then discussed threadbare at an NTAGI meeting, again with no dissenting notes. The recommendation was that the vaccine interval has to be 12-16 weeks,” said Dr N K Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 working group of the NTAGI. The record of minutes of the meetings of the two groups released by the health ministry shows the Covid-19 working group agreed in favour of a dosing gap of 12-16 weeks. When this suggestion was further discussed by a larger group of experts at the STSC of NTAGI, a dosing interval of “minimum three months” was recommended. The decision to increase the gap was based on scientific studies regarding behaviour of ‘adenovector’ vaccines which were seen to function with longer gaps, Dr Arora said. “In both the meetings, that is the Covid-19 working group and the STSC, no dissent was given by any of the three members who have been quoted in a news report by Reuters, namely Dr Mathew Varghese, Dr M D Gupte and Dr J P Muliyil. Further, it is on record that Dr Varghese has denied talking to Reuters on the issue of his alleged dissent,” the ministry said. Meanwhile, health minister Harsh Vardhan said the issue was being “politicised”, referring to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s tweet on the Reuters report. “Decision to increase the gap between administering two doses of Covishield has been taken in a transparent manner based on scientific data. But in front of Rahul Gandhi’s unparalleled wisdom, even Aryabhatta and Aristotle will fail,” he said on Twitter. Dr Arora also cited two studies by PGIMER Chandigarh and by CMC Vellore, which showed that the effectiveness of the vaccine was almost the same in the case of partial immunisation and after two shots. Two other studies from two organisations in Delhi showed that breakthrough infection with one dose was around 4%, and around 5% with two doses, Dr Arora said, underlining hardly any difference in efficacy after one or two doses. Though the interval between two doses of Covishield has been extended in many countries, it created a stir in India in May as it came amid reports of vaccine shortage. However, the government has maintained that the decision was driven by scientific reasons. Thereafter, the UK’s decision to reduce the gap further fuelled the controversy. In the last week of April, data released by Public Health England, the UK’s executive agency of the department of health, showed that vaccine efficacy varied between 65 and 88% when the interval was 12 weeks. “This was the basis on which they overcame their epidemic outbreak due to the Alpha variant. The UK was able to come out of it because the interval they kept was 12 weeks. We also thought that this is a good idea, since there are fundamental scientific reasons to show that when interval is increased, adenovector vaccines give better response. Hence, the decision was taken on May 13 to increase the interval to 12-16 weeks,” Dr Arora said. This also gives flexibility to the community, since everyone cannot get the second shot precisely at 12 weeks or so, he added. The government now plans to have a tracking system to monitor different trends related to vaccine administration in the local population. “When NTAGI took this decision, we also decided that India will establish a vaccine tracking platform — to assess not only the impact of the vaccination programme but also type of vaccine and interval between doses, and what happens when someone is fully or partially immunised. This is very important in India since around 17-18 crore people have received only one dose, while around 4 crore people have received two doses,” Dr Arora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-decision-to-extend-gap-between-doses-was-unanimous-says-govt/articleshow/83590008.cms||---

Although, Wednesday’s case count of 67,549 was slightly higher than the fresh cases reported a day earlier; it is much lower than over 90,000 cases reported on last Wednesday. Wednesday also saw 1,332 deaths which are lower than Tuesday’s tally of 1459 deaths. Even after the continuous decline which is ongoing for more than a month, India remains the world’s worst-hit country in terms of daily cases by a fair margin. Brazil, the second on this list has reported 39,846 cases. Five other countries have reported over 10,000 daily cases and this includes Colombia, Argentina, Russia, the USA and Iran. Even in deaths, apart from India, the latest daily tally for no other country has crossed the thousand benchmark. There are however three countries that reported between 500 to a thousand deaths and this includes Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. Overall only 14 countries reported more than a hundred deaths on June 16. Among states, Kerala reported the highest cases on Wednesday for the second consecutive day and was followed by Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra — these three being the only states to report over 10,000 daily cases. Six other states reported over a thousand cases on Wednesday and this includes Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Assam, West Bengal and Telangana. Among large states, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi, Punjab and so on are all reporting less than a thousand cases. Only worrying signs are coming from Manipur which appears to be going through a spike in cases. The state recorded 752 cases on Wednesday which was at the same level of 785 cases reported on Tuesday. This was the state’s highest case count for over a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-sees-67-5k-new-covid-cases-1332-deaths/articleshow/83590141.cms||---

Asked about the timeline to ramp up vaccine manufacture in the country, the department in its written response said, “The proposal is to increase the production by around 1 billion doses by the end of 2022.” Responding to TOI’s questions on plans to ramp up vaccine production under the ‘Quad Vaccine Cooperation’, the DBT said, “Considering India’s strengths in vaccine manufacturing, the country has been identified to provide manufacturing support. Quad partners will address financing and logistical demands for production, procurement, and delivery of safe and effective vaccines.” Under the cooperation to accelerate the global Covid-19 response and to build longer term global health security, the Quad partners will work to use the “shared tools and expertise”, through mechanisms at institutions including the United States Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) and others. “JICA is in discussions with the government of India to provide concessional yen loans to expand manufacturing for Covid-19 vaccines. We are still in the preparation process, and will inform the matter of assisting Indian vaccine manufacturers later,” said Nagai Shinsuke, senior representative, JICA India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/quad-ties-india-targets-1-billion-covid-vaccine-output-by-end-of-2022/articleshow/83590300.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The beginning of mandatory hallmarking was made in 256 districts. For the time being, small jewellers with annual turnover of under Rs 40 lakh have been exempted from the requirement. Currently, only 30% of gold jewellery in India is hallmarked. The scheme is being implemented by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) to ensure that consumers do not face quality issues. The districts covered in the first phase will have BIS-recognised assaying and hallmarking centres for gold jewellery and artefacts that will certify if a product is 14, 18 or 22 carats. Carat measures the purity of gold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hallmarking-of-gold-jewellery-now-mandatory/articleshow/83591126.cms||---
---||World||Lawyer: US drops lawsuit, grand jury probe over John Bolton book||The Justice Department has abandoned its lawsuit against John Bolton, former President Donald Trump's onetime national security adviser, over his book that officials argued disclosed classified information, according to court documents and Bolton's representatives. Prosecutors also have dropped a grand jury investigation over the book's publication, Bolton's lawyer said Wednesday.  The Trump administration sued last year to block the release of Bolton's book, "The Room Where It Happened," and to recover copies of the book that had already been distributed. The book, released in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, offered a behind-the-scenes, and unflattering, account of Trump's foreign policy dealings. It described how Trump asked China's President Xi Jinping to help the American's reelection prospects and how Trump had pressured his Ukraine counterpart for politically charged investigations.  Justice Department lawyers who sued over the book had insisted that the manuscript contained classified information that could damage national security and that Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had failed to complete a prepublication review process designed to prevent the disclosure of government secrets.  On Wednesday, the Biden administration filed a document in federal court dismissing the suit, formally bringing the yearlong court fight to an end.  "These actions represent a complete vindication for Ambassador Bolton, and a repudiation of former President Trump's attempt, under the pretext of protecting classified information, first to suppress the book's publication and when that failed in court, to penalize the ambassador," said Bolton spokeswoman Sarah Tinsley.  Bolton's lawyers say he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, had said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.  That official, Ellen Knight, described in a letter submitted to the court last September how Trump administration officials repeatedly exerted political pressure in an unsuccessful effort to block the book's release. She described an unusual process of delay tactics and legal maneuverings.  Knight, a career government records professional, said through her lawyer that after she had determined that the manuscript no longer contained classified information and was ready for clearance, she learned that a political appointee with no experience in the prepublication review process had been assigned by the White House to conduct a new review.  That official subsequently flagged hundreds of passages in Bolton's manuscript that the official believed were still classified.  A federal judge last year rejected the Justice Department's efforts to halt the book's release, partly because hundreds of thousands of copies had already been distributed. But the judge expressed concern that Bolton published the book before receiving a formal clearance letter, which Knight said was blocked by the White House.  Besides suing Bolton, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation over the book, though that inquiry has now been dropped, said Bolton's representatives. A department spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday.  Bolton's lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, described the government's efforts to block the book as part of a "politically motivated order" by Trump.  "By ending these proceedings without in any way penalizing Ambassador Bolton or limiting his proceeds from the book, the Department of Justice has tacitly acknowledged that President Trump and his White House officials acted illegitimately," Cooper said in a statement.  The book generated substantial attention even before its publication after news broke during Trump's first impeachment trial that Bolton had written how Trump had linked the supply of military assistance to Ukraine to that country's willingness to conduct investigations into Trump's Democratic rival, now-President Joe Biden.  Those allegations were at the heart of an impeachment trial that ended with Trump's Senate acquittal in February 2020. Bolton though refused to testify at impeachment proceedings.  Bolton's time at the Trump White House was unsurprisingly rocky. A noted national security hawk, Bolton was an odd choice for Trump, who advocated ending the United States' overseas military operations. The two continued to clash in public comments long after Bolton left office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/lawyer-us-drops-lawsuit-grand-jury-probe-over-john-bolton-book/articleshow/83591160.cms||---
---||Business||‘Deliberate defiance’: Prasad attacks Twitter’s refusal to act||NEW DELHI: Communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday slammed Twitter for “deliberate defiance” and failure to comply with the country’s new IT rules, which has led to the US giant losing its intermediary status in India and becoming liable for users posting any unlawful content. Prasad said Twitter has “deliberately chosen the path of non-compliance”. The minister also mentioned that if any foreign entity believes that it can portray itself as a flag bearer of free speech in India to excuse itself from complying with the law of the land, “such attempts are misplaced”.  In recent weeks the microblogging platform and the government have quarrelled over issues with Twitter first taking a hard line on the new rules but later suggesting that it had fallen in line but is yet to comply with the guidelines, unlike other social media outfits.  “There are numerous queries arising as to whether Twitter is entitled to safe harbour provision. However, the simple fact of the matter is that Twitter has failed to comply with the intermediary guidelines that came into effect from May 26,” he said in social media posts. He posted a series of messages on Koo — Twitter’s homegrown replica — and then on Twitter itself, saying the US social media giant “was given multiple opportunities to comply with the same, however, it has deliberately chosen the path of non-compliance”. “Further, what is perplexing is that Twitter fails to address the grievances of users by refusing to set up process as mandated by the law of the land.Additionally, it chooses a policy of flagging manipulated media, only when it suits, its likes and dislikes,” Prasad said.  He also referred to tweets by few journalists and factchecking website co-founder allegedly giving communal colour to a dispute over the sale of a ‘tabeez’ (amulet). He said what happened in UP was illustrative of Twitter’s “arbitrariness” in fighting fake news. “While Twitter has been overenthusiastic about its fact-checking mechanism, its failure to act in multiple cases like UP is perplexing as well as points towards its inconsistency in fighting misinformation.” Prasad said Indian companies that go to do business in the US or in other countries overseas, voluntarily follow local laws. “Then why are platforms like Twitter showing reluctance in following Indian laws.” The culture of India varies like its large geography, he said, adding that in certain scenarios, with the amplification of social media, even a small spark can cause a fire, especially with the menace of fake news. “This was one of the objectives of bringing the Intermediary Guidelines,” Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/deliberate-defiance-prasad-attacks-twitters-refusal-to-act/articleshow/83591023.cms||---

The department of empowerment of persons with disabilities (DEPwD) under the ministry of social justice and empowerment, through these EICs, seeks to eliminate or reduce the severity of disabilities at an early stage so that kids can achieve their full potential.To begin with, EICs have been set-up in seven national institutes working on different disabilities and seven composite regional centres across states as a pilot project that will be scaled up eventually. Officials, explain that the EICs in each of the NIs/CRCs will be equipped to screen and intervene in respect of all categories of disabilities covered under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. With no such facilities and specialised personnel for rehabilitation of children with disabilities available at the district and sub-district levels, these EICs are being cited as models that can be eventually replicated by states at the grassroots to enable access to families at the neighbourhood level. DEPwD plans to set up EICs at the remaining 13 composite regional centres next year. The seven EICs at NIs are located in Kolkata, Cuttack, Mumbai, Dehradun, Delhi, Secunderabad and Chennai. The seven centres at composite regional centres are at Lucknow, Kozhikode, Sundernagar, Nellore, Patna, Rajnandgaon and Bhopal. According to officials early intervention can provide specialised support and services for infants and young children at-risk or with disability or developmental delay and their families to help their development, well-being and participation in family and community life. Research studies suggest that early childhood (0-6 years) is the most critical phase of brain development. “Therefore providing quality childhood intervention early in life helps to develop the skills needed to enable a child to lead an independent and dignified life,” an official said. So far, each national institute is serving a particular category of disability but the EIC in all these institutes will be equipped to screen and intervene in respect of all categories of disabilities. As per the project plan, the EICs will provide identification of risk cases and refer the child for appropriate rehabilitative services. As part of the therapeutic services these centres will provide physiotherapy, speech and occupational therapy. The parents and peers of the child will also be provided counselling. These centes will also focus on school readiness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-sets-up-first-of-its-kind-centres-for-disabled-kids-kin/articleshow/83591340.cms||Ambika Pandit

Never before have these priests — known as ‘bhumkas’ or ‘bhagats’ — battled for any vaccine in this way. And it’s paying off. Tribals in 30 villages, who were earlier reluctant to take the vaccine, are now ready and willing, collector Amanveer Singh told TOI. In Betul’s tribal regions, there are at least 25 panchayats where no one has been vaccinated, the collector said. Another 47 have less than 5% vaccination, primarily because of rumours related to Covid vaccines. To counter this, the administration reached out to local religious heads, who readily agreed to spread awareness. Now, officials are sharing videos of these ‘bhagats’ on social media, urging people to get vaccinated in local dialect.  “The government is running this vaccination drive for your safety,” Sagan Marskole, the ‘bhumka’ of Junapani village, is heard saying in Gondi dialect in one such video. Gondi is spoken by majority of tribals in Betul. Videos of 14 such tribal religious priests are being circulated along with videos of tribals’ first-hand accounts of being vaccinated. In Borgaon village, for instance, there were rumours of post-vaccination deaths, which were baseless, said Parvat Rao Dhote of Borgaon. “Around 30 deaths took place in the past two months, four of them due to Covid-19. Only one elderly person, who was vaccinated, died but due to natural causes. Our panchayat was aware of this, and people got themselves vaccinated,” he told TOI. Betul collector Amanveer Singh told TOI that the bhumkas’ word is aiding the vaccination drive. “Traditionally, tribals have their own parallel health system and beliefs, and if some information comes fromthere, it has its effects. We identified local priests, held meetings with them, convinced them, and they are now spreading awareness. Targeted vaccination is being carried out in villages where there is a mixed ratio of tribal and non-tribal population. When those people are getting vaccinated, it is creating awareness in neighbouring tribal villages,” Singh said.  It’s already paying off, said the collector. “In the past 10 days, there is a noticeable change in mindset. We did a survey in 47 villages where vaccination percentage was low. People in 30 of these villages are now ready for vaccination and said they would get vaccinated if camps are organised,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/priests-turn-myth-busters-ask-mp-tribals-to-get-jabbed/articleshow/83591393.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Addressing virtually a digital start-up event in France, VivaTech, Modi said this openness is one of India’s five pillars for attracting investment along with talent, market, capital and ecosystem. PM Modi also said digital media allowed people during the pandemic to work and help others. Digital technology helped people cope, connect, comfort and console, said Modi according to a statement issued by the government. “Today, India has nearly 1.2 billion mobile phones and 775 million internet users. This is more than the population of several nations. Data consumption in India is among the highest and cheapest in the world. Indians are the largest users of social media. There is a diverse and extensive market that awaits you,” he said. Talking about the disruption in different sectors over the past year, Modi said disruption did not have to mean despair. Instead, the focus should be kept on the twin foundations of ‘repair and prepare’, he said. “This time last year, the world was still seeking a vaccine. Today, we have quite a few. Similarly, we have to continue repairing health infrastructure and our economies. We in India implemented huge reforms across sectors, be it mining, space, banking, atomic energy and more. This goes on to show that India as a nation is adaptable and agile, even in the middle of the pandemic” said PM Modi. Underlining the need for innovation, Modi also said the role of India’s start-up sector had been paramount in the fight against Covid. According to Modi, India’s universal and unique bio-metric digital identity system — Aadhaar — helped to provide timely financial support to the poor. “We could supply free food to 800 million people, and deliver cooking-fuel subsidies to many households. We were able to operationalise two public digital education programmes — Swayam and Diksha — in quick time to help students,” said Modi. Talking about innovation, the PM said the private sector played a key role in addressing the shortage of PPE kits, masks, testing kits etc. “Doctors adopted tele-medicine so that some Covid and other non-Covid issues could be addressed virtually. Two vaccines are being made in India and more are in the development or trial stage,” he said, adding that indigenous IT platform Arogya-Setu enabled effective contact-tracing and the CoWin digital platform app had helped ensure vaccines to millions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-cites-india-openness-seeks-global-investment/articleshow/83591398.cms||---

He said the number was lower than that of other countries, adding that the UK and some other nations have had an anaphylaxis incidence rate of 15 for every million doses. On Tuesday, the AEFI committee confirmed that a 68-year-old man had died in March after taking the vaccine. Dr Arora said anaphylaxis was seen during previous vaccination programmes as well. Usual rates are one to five events per million doses with most of the paediatric and adult vaccines, he said, adding that post jab monitoring has helped spot adverse reactions on time. The death assessment of 31 serious adverse events after immunisation was submitted by the government panel after the causality assessment was done for cases reported in February and March. The report was out on June 4. “Nearly 70-80% of AEFI events occur within 30 minutes of vaccination. Across states, programme personnel and vaccinators have been able to immediately identify, treat and arrest such events. All vaccination centres have AEFI kits and trained staff have been able to prevent any untoward event,” Arora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rate-of-post-vaccine-severe-allergic-reaction-one-in-a-million-official/articleshow/83591464.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Chairing a meeting, which was also attended by both deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi as well as the ministers and senior bureaucrats of all departments concerned, the CM asked the officials to do analysis and reviews on a regular basis to ensure that the works taken up under the JJHA are completed at a faster pace. The JJHA was launched by Nitish on the occasion of ‘Bihar Prithvi Diwas’ on August 9, 2019. The state government had decided to implement it in a mission mode. Later, the state cabinet had approved Rs 24,524 crore for implementation of the campaign in three financial years (2019-20 to 2021-22). Speaking at the meeting, Nitish said the JJHA was now being hailed at world level. “When Bill Gates had arrived in Patna, we held discussions over the campaign. Gates had lauded the campaign after returning from Bihar. The Abhiyan was also lauded in the United Nations,” he said. Nitish said the green cover of Bihar was reduced to 9% after bifurcation of the state in November 2020. “We launched Hariyali Mission and decided to plant 24 crore saplings in the coming years with an aim to increase our state’s green cover area. A total of 22 crore saplings have so far been planted and the state’s green cover has now increased to more than 15%. We have a target of increasing the green cover more than 17% and for this we are planting more saplings across the state,” the CM said. He asked the officials to motivate and educate people for production and use of solar energy as well as saving conventional energy. The CM also asked the energy department officials to install solar panels on the buildings of all colleges, old schools and newly-built institutions to generate maximum renewable energy in the state. “All concerned departments should hold a joint meeting and prepare a work plan for the installation of solar panels on the government-owned buildings,” Nitish said. He also asked the officials concerned to make all public hand pumps functional and construct soak-pits near the renovated wells and hand pumps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-states-green-campaign-being-lauded-across-world/articleshow/83554828.cms||---

Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said at least one Covid test centre has been functioning at each of the three stations. “During the past two weeks, not a single passenger reaching by special trains from Mumbai, Delhi, Punjab, Gujarat and other places from south India, was reported positive for Covid-19. Railways intends to continue with the Covid test on passengers till the state health department finally winds up the test centres," he said. The DRM said there was only one Covid patient undergoing treatment at the Danapur divisional railway hospital, while majority of them were discharged after recovery last week. “The Danapur division, which had 700 plus Covid positive cases in April-May months, has five cases only,” he said. According to the DRM, railways has decided not to allow passengers make compromise with the Covid-19 health protocol on railway premises. “Wearing a mask is mandatory for each passenger. S/he is also supposed to undergo compulsory thermal screening at the time of entering the railway station premises to board trains,” he said, adding that alert RPF men were on the job to impose punitive fine on those not wearing masks during journey. The DRM said except passenger reservation system (PRS) counters, no other unreserved ticket booking counters are functional at major stations of the division with an aim to check unnecessary rush of people on station premises during pandemic. “It is with this end in view that railways has not started issuing platform tickets at any station in the division. Besides, railways does intend to restore local passenger trains on different sections of the division only after getting a nod from the Railway Board,” he said. About the railway community kitchen, the DRM said though it was functioning, demand for meals had come down following recovery of Covid-19 patients. “The footfall of passengers has slightly picked at Patna Junction, up to 40,000 per day, with restarting long-distance special mail and express passenger trains from Patna Junction," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-19-tests-at-railway-stations-to-continue/articleshow/83582910.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Patna||RJD, Congress back Chirag, flay LS Speaker’s decision||PATNA: After facing rebellion from his own party MPs, Jamui MP Chirag Paswan is getting support from opposition RJD and Congress in Bihar. Leaders of both the parties not only invited Chirag to join Mahagatbandhan, but also trained guns at his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla for setting a wrong precedence. The opposition leaders, however, are enjoying the coup in LJP. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan on Wednesday said notifying Paras as the new LJP parliamentary party leader was against the parliamentary practices. “Who will be the party’s leader in the House is informed by the party's national president to the House Speaker. Even if five out of six MPs made Paras as their leader, notifying him as the floor leader without recommendation of the party’s national president is against the practices,” Gagan said, adding, “Leader of any party in the House as well as the MPs of that party can neither call a meeting of the party’s national working committee nor initiate action against the party’s national president.” Gagan cited a similar situation in Congress when its national president S Nijalingappa in 1969 had replaced Indira Gandhi from the post of parliamentary party leader with Ram Subhag Singh. “That time, the majority of Congress MPs were in favour of Indira but the then Lok Sabha Speaker, G S Dhillon, recognised Singh and Indira was recognised as the leader of a separate group, Congress (R),” he said. RJD’s national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari also supported Chirag, saying he is the root of LJP. “Ram Vilas Paswan Ji had made Chirag the party’s national president. He might have apprehended a dispute in future regarding the party’s leadership.” Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre criticized BJP for not supporting Chirag in this situation. “Chirag is facing the anger and frustration of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Though Chirag was against JD(U), he always stood with the BJP and called himself as Hanuman. Where is his Ram now?” asked Rathorre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-congress-back-chirag-flay-ls-speakers-decision/articleshow/83583145.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Traffic on several roads also came to a grinding halt as dug-up and pothole-ridden roads added to people’s woes. Angry motorists and pedestrians held the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) and other agencies responsible for the chaos. Rajiv Nagar resident, Pratyay, told this reporter that the main nullah in his area was once again brimming with dirty water. “The choked nullah will soon create a flood-like situation and spell disaster. I wonder what the PMC has been doing,” he claimed. An annoyed Nabhneel, who lives in Rajendra Nagar, asked why the authorities repaired roads in the monsoon season. “The dug-up and pothole-ridden roads have made life difficult for us,” she added. The authorities, on the contrary, claimed that all necessary steps were being taken to drain out the excess rainwater. An official of the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCO) said, “A team of more than 70 engineers has been roped in and a 24x7 control room set up for informing us about waterlogging in any area. Assistant and junior engineers have also been appointed at all the 25 temporary pumping stations of the BUIDCO.” He added, “We are working in close coordination with the PMC, irrigation department, Patna Electric Supply Undertaking, forest department and all other stakeholders.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rain-chokes-roads-traffic-comes-to-a-grinding-halt-in-patna/articleshow/83583096.cms||---

They were administered the first dose of Covaxin at Prakhar hospital here on Wednesday. Though all the children were sent back home, the experts will monitor any reaction of the vaccine on them for next one week. This was the second group of children who were administered Covaxin as a part of the vaccine trial. Last week, children in the age group of 12 years to 18 years were administered the vaccine. So far, 37 children, belonging to the two age categories, have been given Covaxin jab and they are being monitored, said principal investigator for Covaxin trial, Dr JS Kushwaha while talking to TOI. He said out of 37 children, 17 were given Covaxin shot on Wednesday. They were in the 6 years to 12 years age category. "We have to include 50 children in this trial. So far, trials on 37 children have been completed. Now, children in the 2 years-6 years age category are left to receive the first shot. But this task will be carried out only after getting permission from the ICMR", Dr Kushwaha said. He said a doctor couple from Lucknow arrived at the vaccine trial site along with their daughters who were in the 6-12 years age group. "We administered a vaccine jab to both the girls", he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/17-children-in-age-group-of-6-12-years-get-first-covaxin-dose/articleshow/83585143.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Day 1 a hit at restaurants, bars as regulars return||Kolkata: The first-day-first-show for city restaurants and bars after a gap of 45 days was a moderate hit. For some popular restaurants, it was a bigger event considering the fact that all were operating with Covid protocols and 50% seating arrangements. ‘Jamai Shashthi’ came in handy for the restaurants, offering a slight boost. According to an estimate by the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI), the bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata, which employs over 80,000 people in the greater Kolkata area alone, has suffered a loss of Rs 4,000-Rs 4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic in April 2020. Loyal patrons turned up at their favourite food joints on Wednesday. Anindya Pal, who works in a private office around Park Street was at Mocambo enjoying his Chicken A-La-Kiev with mixed fried rice and beer with a colleague at his pre-pandemic lunch time at 2.30pm. “This has been my favourite lunch place for years. I was at office today and couldn’t miss the chance to come over with a colleague. It feels good to be back here after a long time,” said Pal, a resident of Lee Road. HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar, who runs restaurants like Songhai, Manthan, told TOI that the 50% seating capacity was almost full during lunch and, around 7pm, there was a queue. “The response is overwhelming and we have done good business. We are expecting to do at least 40% of our normal business today considering the fact that capacity was 50% and we got two hours of prime time compared to five hours in the evening,” he said, adding that if this trend continues, it will be good for the industry as home delivery and takeaways constitute only 10%-15% of revenue of most players. T S Walia, former national president of FHRAI, also felt the initial trend was very good. Nitin Kothari, HRAEI member and owner of restaurants like Peter Cat and Mocambo, was happy about the footfall on Wednesday. He opened Mocambo on Wednesday and is planning to reopen Peter Cat on Friday. “We were full during lunch and there were patrons waiting in the evening. Now it is being operated with 50% capacity as per guidelines. This would be 50%-60% of our normal business. A lot of people opted for early dinner at Mocambo,” he said. Charles Mantosh, owner of Moulin Rouge, Floriana and Magnolia, also had a good response from patrons. “All my restaurants have started operation today. The capacity was almost full,” he said. Debaditya Chaudhury, director of Chowman, Oudh and Chapter 2, echoed them. “Dining was good and there was a huge demand for takeaways due to Jamai Shashthi,” he said. However, Aminia director Kabir Azhar felt it would take some time for the industry to recover fully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/day-1-a-hit-at-restaurants-bars-as-regulars-return/articleshow/83585480.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

According to sources, several central universities had been admitting students through a joint entrance test till 2020. This year, however, a seven-member committee submitted a report to the government in April in which it mooted the idea of a common entrance test (CUCET) for all the 54 central universities. Since the government is yet to announce its decision, the entire process of admission is in limbo. CUSB vice-chancellor (VC) H C S Rathore, who is a member of the committee, told this newspaper on Wednesday, “The admission process has been delayed due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now that the situation is improving, a decision regarding CUCET will be taken soon.” Sources said the Ministry of Education was likely to convene a meeting of the VCs of all the central universities within a week. “There is a lack of consensus on whether entrance exams should be held this year or not. Many universities want to follow their own merit-based admission system,” they added. After the meeting, if a consensus is achieved on holding the exam this year, CUCET-2021 will be applicable only to undergraduate courses. Rathore pointed out that the National Education Policy-2020 also proposed a common entrance test for higher education. He added, “The committee had recommended that the CUCET would be conducted by the National Testing Agency in the online mode and comprise two sections — general aptitude and the disciplines concerned.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lack-of-consensus-delays-process-of-admission-in-central-varsities/articleshow/83583199.cms||B K Mishra

This centre will motivate girls and women for pursuing higher education, health goals, self-respect, economic independence and use of technical resources. Giving this information, the vice-chancellor of this lone open university of the state, Prof Seema Singh said, “The Center for Women’s Studies will reach out to the women and make them aware about the public welfare schemes of the state and central government to provide them with the maximum benefits of various government schemes that are specially introduced for them.” Prof Ruchi Bajpai of the department of Hindi, School of Humanities of UPRTOU has been made the convenor of the centre, she added. The VC further told TOI that the purpose of the WSC, which is being established for the first time in the university, is to provide maximum benefits of various government schemes to the women and make them aware with adequate information and practicality of the same. She said that through this centre, the university would make the women aware of the traditional evils prevalent against them in society and also about the life philosophy of successful women. Prof Singh said that the university would endeavour to conduct workshops in the villages and inculcate a sense of security among women by forming women’s safety committees. The vice-chancellor said that the main focus of this centre is to remove the hesitation from the women of the village so that they can raise their voice against the evils prevalent in the society like ‘Purdah Pratha’ and dowry. “Parents will be motivated to educate their daughters and let them go out of the house. To ensure the future of daughters, the members of the centre will try to win their trust by mingling with the women of the houses and motivating them to let their daughters pursue higher learning and stand on their own feet,” said the first woman VC of UPRTOU. Prof Singh informed that the newly established centre will organise programs related to the development of women throughout the year in which the problems related to women’s health will be addressed prominently. For this, the support of the university’s health sciences department will also be taken. This centre will also run an awareness campaign to ensure that nutritious food is provided to the children, especially the girl child. This centre will also give them access to information about the laws made for women, informed the university’s media in-charge Prabhat Chandra Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/uprtou-to-establish-women-study-center/articleshow/83583940.cms||---

---||Business||ICICI Bank offers IT stack to corporates to draw new customers||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: With competition for quality corporate borrowers intensifying, ICICI Bank is leveraging technology to rope in more corporate customers. The bank has launched an ICICI stack for corporates that allows all stakeholders of a company — suppliers, distributors, and promoters — to directly plug into the bank through APIs (application programme interfaces). This allows more self-service options, faster money movement and automates reconciliation. For ICICI Bank, this ‘ecosystem banking’ will allow extending banking services to the corporate’s stakeholders and solve the problem of delayed payments by providing short-term credit. The bank’s stack for corporates is a set of digital banking services designed for 15 industries that can be further tailored for individual companies within an industry. “Customers can use the API to integrate with their ERP system. They will also have an option to deal with us in a physical channel. All the teams within ICICI Bank who are required to cater to the ecosystem will be housed in the ecosystem branches,” said ICICI Bank ED Vishakha Mulye. The digital services that will be provided to corporates include an API-based digital account-opening service, which is a first in the industry. This will also help the bank in gaining more salary accounts. The stack also provides an electronic bank guarantee (e-BG) that acts as an electronic repository of authenticated BG, with an inbuilt tracking mechanism for the corporates. This would be made possible with automated stamping (AeS), which eliminates the need for physical stamp paper from branches for bank guarantees. The corporate will have access to a suite of API-based payments and collection solutions that directly integrate with its ERP system. The other digital products include end-to-end digitisation of inland trade and iValidate, an API-based real-time reconciliation system of collecting funds from multiple parties. According to Mulye, besides getting new customers, the bank would be in a better position to monitor credit quality due to all the information that it has access to. She added that during the lockdown, the working capital cycle has got extended for industries such as steel because of delayed payments. The stack will enable the bank to provide credit to customers and speed up payments to corporates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/icici-bank-offers-it-stack-to-corporates-to-draw-new-customers/articleshow/83586977.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||India 2nd only to Turkey in share of central bank surplus transfers||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was second only to Turkey in terms of reserves transferred to the government as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for the fiscal year 2020-21. In FY20, the RBI stood fourth when ranked by the ratio of surplus as a percentage of GDP. The central bank, however, said that the transfer will not impact its operations. Last month, the RBI transferred a Rs 99,122-crore surplus to the government — 73% higher than the Rs 57,128 crore paid out in 2019-20. “An aspect of the annual report that has raised considerable heat and dust in the media is the surplus transferred to the government. Mainly stemming from saving on balance sheet provisions and employees’ superannuation and other funds, the surplus constitutes just 0.44% of GDP,” the RBI said. The State of the Economy report published by the RBI said that the surplus transfer ratio was low enough to enable the central bank to conduct monetary policy free of fiscal dominance. The report said that the surplus transfer ratio was a measure of seigniorage — a term used to describe profits the government makes by printing currency. In other words, the difference between the face value of currency notes and its production cost. The report quotes research to point out that seigniorage between 0.5% and 1% of GDP allows the central bank to conduct monetary policy with a fair degree of independence. The report also says that the surge in the number of foreign exchange reserves can be deceptive, and a better gauge of external sector vulnerability is an assessment of indicators like the export cover. “In terms of projected imports for 2021-22, the current level of reserves provides cover for less than 15 months, which is lower than for other major reserve holders — Switzerland (39 months), Japan (22 months), Russia (20 months), and China (16 months). Another reason why India’s forex reserve position is deceptive is that it co-exists with a net international investment position of -12.9% of GDP. This means that India is a net recipient of foreign investment and should this money be withdrawn by investors, the reserves can deplete fast. In early June, the level of foreign exchange reserves crossed $600 billion. With this development, India is the fifth-largest reserve-holding country in the world, the 12th-largest foreign holder of US Treasury securities and the 10th-largest in terms of gold reserves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-2nd-only-to-turkey-in-share-of-central-bank-surplus-transfers/articleshow/83588074.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar second from last in vax coverage: Govt data||PATNA: Bihar is the second last state after Uttar Pradesh in vaccinating its population against coronavirus. The state has so far inoculated only 15.11% of its eligible population with the first dose of the vaccines. Uttar Pradesh has vaccinated only 14.45% of its population, according to the data shared by the Ministry of Health. However, the state was at 8th place in the country in administering the total number of first doses among all the three age groups. Altogether 1.02 crore people have received their first doses while 21,03,774 have got the second shots in the state so far, which took the cumulative figure of vaccination up to 1.23 crore. The state health department’s bulletin showed that maximum 34.3 lakh beneficiaries who have taken their first shots are in 60 and above age group, closely followed by 31.9 lakh in the 45-59 and 26.3 lakh in above 18 years age group. One of the main reasons behind the poor performance of Bihar in administering Covid vaccines was the dense population of the state, said Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Bihar. Bihar, with a total population of 128 million people, is the third most densely populated state after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. “Secondly, Bihar is the economically backward state could not procure the number of doses required. The non-availability of vaccines and poor monitoring of the drive are also some of the reasons in lagging behind other states in vaccinating its population. Vaccine implementation team should be formed at state, district, sub-divisional and block levels,” Dr Rajiv said. The pace of vaccination was also slowed down due to non-availability of vaccines for some duration as well as hesitancy among rural population to take theshots. Noted surgeon Dr AA Hai attributed multiple reasons behind the poor show, including the lack of awareness and hesitancy among large sections of the population. “Rumours are associated with the vaccine, which scared the people. Had our community been educated, the situation would not have been like this. The state government needs to be more active. First they started vaccination in both government and private health facilities, then they stopped giving the doses to the the private facilities, which also gave a bad impression,” he said. “Dithering about the second dose after four, six or eight weeks meant incongruity about the facts,” Dr Hai added. Dr Ajay Kumar, senior vice-president of IMA-Bihar, attributed the slow pace of the drive to non-availability of vaccines. “If we get enough stock, the state can perform better. More people will be vaccinated if the government provides free vaccines to private health facilities as well,” he said. Noted gynaecologist Dr Manju Geeta Mishra said people, especially in rural areas, are hesitant to take the vaccine. “This has led to poor performance of state in vaccinating the population. People are scared because of rumours associated with it like the vaccine causes impotency or even death. The government health facilities are also wasting the vaccines,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-second-from-last-in-vax-coverage-govt-data/articleshow/83585409.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar: Rain brings relief, but seasonal diseases rise||PATNA: The onset of monsoon may have brought relief from the unbearable heat, but it has also given rise to several vector-borne diseases and seasonal ailments like fever, cough, sore throat, and diarrhoea. This, doctors believe, has created a lot of confusion amid the Covid-19 pandemic as people infected with coronavirus develop similar symptoms. A Muzaffarpur-based paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah, told this newspaper on Wednesday that after the lockdown restrictions were relaxed in Bihar, a large number of patients suffering from seasonal diseases consulted doctors. “Quite a few cases of water-borne diseases like cholera and typhoid have been witnessed in the district,” he added. Talking about the precautionary measures that one should take against water-borne diseases, Dr Arun said, “People should avoid eating junk food that is prepared in an unhygienic manner. They should drink boiled water at home.” Dr Chandra Mohan Kumar, an additional professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, claimed that he had treated some kids suffering from fever and dysentery during the last few days. He said, “A rise in cases of cold, flu, viral hepatitis, typhoid, and diarrhoea is likely to be witnessed in the coming days. Dengue, malaria and chikungunya cases will also increase between July and November.” Another paediatrician, Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, pointed out that two children with jaundice, four with typhoid and more than 25 with diarrhoea had consulted him in one week due to a change in weather. “Luckily, no malaria cases have been reported yet,” he added. Dr Nigam also urged people not to confuse influenza-like symptoms with those of Covid-19. “Since both have common symptoms, all my patients are undergoing rapid antigen test.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rain-brings-relief-but-seasonal-diseases-rise/articleshow/83582954.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Vijayawada||Centre to expedite mega project in Andhra Pradesh||AMARAVATI: The Centre is keen to kickstart work on a petrochemical cracker complex in the state. On Wednesday, the Centre constituted a working group under the chairmanship of joint secretary (refineries), ministry of petroleum and natural gas, with senior officials of the state government. Engineers India Limited and SBI Caps have been advised to rework the financials in view of the recent regulatory changes in corporate tax and interest rates. The decision to take the strategic project in the state forward comes after a high-level delegation comprising industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy, chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das and special chief secretary Karikal Valaven met Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and secretary Tarun Kapoor in New Delhi on Wednesday. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy urged Dharmendra Pradhan to consider the revival of the long-pending petrochemical cracker complex project in the state during his visit to New Delhi last week. Following the instructions of the chief minister, the state delegation met Pradhan and made a presentation on the issue of viability gap funding and requested him to clear the hurdles. The officials explained there would be no need of extending viability gap funding as sought by the HPCL and IOCL consortium keeping in view the reduction in corporate taxes by the Centre. The state urged the Centre to grant the project as part of its bifurcation promises as it would create a level-playing field in generation of employment. Speaking to the media after the meeting, Mekapati said that investments to the tune of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 crore would flow into the East Coast Corridor in the next three years once the Centre clears the project. He added that the petrochemical project would generate about 50 lakh jobs once all proposed projects were launched. “Total investments into the petrochemical complex including ancillary units will touch Rs 2 lakh crore if everything goes according to our plans. This is going to be a game-changer for the state,” said Mekapati. He said that Pradhan has assured them of monitoring the progress of the project and ensuring it takes wings shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/centre-to-expedite-mega-project-in-ap/articleshow/83583018.cms||Samdani MN

The accused has been identified as Anjani Yadav, 30. Police said Pappu Kumar, Srinarayan Yadav and one Rajkrishore Yadav are still evading arrest in connection with the kidnapping and marriage of the minor boy. Suchmarriages are called ‘pakadua vivah’ in rural areas of the state. Police said all four are named accused in the FIR registered in connection with the kidnapping for marriage case. Fatuha police station SHO (in-charge) Mithilesh Kumar said the boy is aged hardly 16 and is a native of village Shivchak under Fatuha police station area. “After kidnapping him on Monday, they took him to Masaurhi and forcibly got him married to the daughter of one Sipahi Yadav,” he said. The SHO said the minor was going with his cousin Shailesh Kumar to one of their aunt’s house at Bhagwanganj in Patna when he was kidnapped. Kumar said Sipahi is a native of Bhikhua village under Fatuha police station area. He said police suspect that he first gathered information about a suitable boy of the same caste for his daughter and then kidnapped him for marriage with his daughter. “Police detained a few family members from the girl’s side for interrogation. It was only after their detention that the boy was set free in Masaurhi on Tuesday. Later, police reached the spot and recovered him,” he said. The SHO said it was yet not clear where in Masaurhi actually they got the minor married. “The victim youth was completely unfamiliar with the locality. So he could not tell where he was forcibly taken for marriage and held captive the whole night,” he said. Kumar said raids are going on to arrest the three remaining named accused. He said police are also investigating to know who all from the girl’s family were involved in getting the minor boy kidnapped for marriage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/1-arrested-for-forcibly-getting-minors-married/articleshow/83583105.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kochi||Kerala: Spurned youth murders woman in Malappuram||KOZHIKODE: Drishya (21), a second-year law student, was stabbed to death by her former schoolmate at Elamkulam near Perinthalmanna in Malappuram on Thursday morning after she had spurned his romantic advances. Police identified the deceased as the daughter of Balachandran of Chemmattil house at Ellad. Her sister Devashree (13), who sustained grievous stab injuries in the attack, is being treated in the ICU of a private hospital in Perinthalmanna. Police said that Vineesh Vinod (21), who hails from Muttungal, rushed upstairs into Drishya’s room and stabbed her around 8am. She died on the spot. Her sister Devashree, who tried to save her sister was stabbed in the chest and hand. Vineesh was nabbed by the police within hours of the attack. Police said that the accused had allegedly set fire to the toy and stationary shop owned by Balachandran at Perinthalmanna at 9.45pm on Wednesday. Perinthalmanna deputy SP Devassia K M said Drishya and Vineesh were formerly schoolmates at a higher secondary school and the attack was allegedly carried out as a reprisal for having spurned his proposals. Relatives of the deceased woman said Vineesh was pestering Drishya for long. Balachandran told the media that the accused had approached them with a marriage proposal three months ago following which the family approached the police. He said Vineesh told the siblings during the attack that he had set fire to their shop. Drishya’s uncle Madhusoodhanan said the accused had been troubling her and the family had filed a complaint with Perinthalmanna police. They didn’t go ahead with the case after the parents and relatives of Vineesh gave a written undertaking before the police that he wouldn’t trouble her again. “We suspect that the attack was elaborately planned and setting fire to the shop could be an attempt to ensure that her father and relatives weren’t there at home during the attack,” he said. Only the daughters and their mother were at home when the attack took place. Perinthalmanna inspector of police Sajin Sasi V said that the accused had set fire to the shop owned by Balachandran to exact revenge. The shop owned by Balachandran had caught fire on Wednesday night and fire and rescue services personnel took one hour to douse the fire that had gutted the entire stock, including bags and footwear. The accused could be nabbed by the police swiftly due to the presence of mind shown by the driver of the auto which Vineesh took to escape. Auto driver Jawhar drove him straight to Perinthalmanna police station after he got calls from a neighbour and later from the police during the trip that his passenger had committed a crime. Jawhar had his suspicions as the clothes Vineesh was wearing were drenched and the accused had told him that he had been in an accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/spurned-youth-murders-woman/articleshow/83616395.cms||---

The baby has been kept in a special neonatal care unit of the Government women’s hospital in Ghazipur before being sent to a shelter home. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who took note of the recovery of the baby girl on Wednesday, announced that the government will bear the cost of her nurturing and also provide benefits of government schemes, including a house, to the boatman who had rescued her. Presently, the local authorities are collecting details of the boatman to assess his eligibility for government benefits. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “After the CM’s announcement, district magistrate Ghazipur MP Singh reached the hospital to check on the condition of the girl. Her health condition is being monitored by the doctors as a precautionary measure. Singh had also rushed a team of officials to collect details of the rescuer boatman Gullu Chawdhary for ensuring follow-up action.” According to deputy director (woman and child welfare) Varanasi division Pravin Kumar Tripathi, after Ghazipur police took the girl from the boatman, the district child protection unit and child welfare committee admitted the baby to the hospital under the supervision of Childline. “After she is discharged from the hospital, she will be kept in a shelter home for children and looked after properly,” he added. Chawdhary had found the child floating in a wooden box on June 14 at Dadri Ghat along river Ganga under the limits of Kotwali police station of Ghazipur. The box was decorated with red cloth and photos of Goddess Durga and Lord Vishnu. A horoscope containing the date and time of her birth and also her name, Ganga, was found in the box. There was a red ‘chunri’ tied on the girl’s waist. A large number of people gathered at the spot after the recovery of the girl. Chawdhary said, “I decided to take the girl to his place after rescuing her.” Many people recorded the rescue on mobiles and soon videos went viral on social media. The police came to know about the incident after a couple reached Chawdhary’s place with a wish to adopt the child, but the boatman refused. The Kotwali police was alerted after which police reached Chawdhary’s house to take the baby with them for initiating legal formalities as per Juvenile Justice Act.

At least four persons were killed after lightning struck. People residing in flood-prone villages of Alamnagar and Chausa area of Madhepura district are spending sleepless nights as incessant rain continued even on Wednesday. Madhepura district magistrate Shyam Bihari Meena on Tuesday held a meeting with the officials to take stock of the pre flood preparations The DM gave them direction to complete all sorts of pre-flood preparations to cope with the possible threat. The southern-bound main Kosi river flows within the bunds upto Beldaur block area under the Khagaria district and turns to flow towards the eastern direction between stretch of Beldaur and Kursela in Katihar district flooding riparian villages under two blocks of Madhepura district. The river finally meets the sacred Ganga in Kursela . Parmanand Yadav, Shakaldeep Paswan of Sukharghat and Sunil and Vibhash Paswan of Kapsiya village under the Alamnagar block have all observed the water-level surging continuously in Kosi river. "The river is also posing erosion threat to about more than a dozen huts and houses at Amni Basa village under Morsanda panchayat in Chausa block," said Ajay Muni of the village.

The Surser river is also reportedly on the surge. The rising water level has led to concern among the people of riparian Ramganj and Sonpur villages of Rahta panchayat under Kumarkhand block . Though prevention work against erosion is being carried out in the river along the villages, the residents apprehend fresh threat in this monsoon. "The local administration is on alert mode to cope with the possible situation," said Kumarkhand citrcle officer Jai Prakash Rai .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flood-threat-looms-over-madhepura-dist/articleshow/83582717.cms||Deo Narayan Saha

Coming on a day when there were intermittent showers and no public transport, it was reason enough for mall operators and retailers to believe that the turnaround will happen in just over a month. Three factors appear to have played a part in the encouraging turnout — a sense of confidence after vaccination; steady decline in Covid-19 figures over a month and Jamai Shashthi, which jump-started the food-and-beverage segment. With everyone who walked in making a purchase, retailers clocked good business. Among the categories that did particularly well were kids’ wear, sportswear and saris. Several major retailers said they had recorded twice as much business at the end of the day than they had done when the mall restarted operations a year ago. Model and actor Ankushree Maity, who was out with choreographer husband Tuban Chakraborty to buy shoes for their 18-month-old daughter Amaira, ended up purchasing a lot more than they had set out for. “I could have made the purchase on the internet but wanted the touch-and-feel experience. So I waited for the mall to open,” she said. Shiv Daswani, owner of kids’ wear brand Littleshop that has 13 stores in all major malls as well as New Market, said sales had been impressive. “The sales at stores in South City and Forum Courtyard have been particularly good with multiple billings for kids’ wear worth around Rs 25,000. Among the sales that have happened are two toy cars worth around Rs 30,000. Among those who walked in were pregnant women, new mothers and parents of young children who outgrow clothes fast,” he said. Mall operators, while happy to see customers, said they will continue to be cautious and closely monitor adherence to all Covid norms and take necessary corrective measures if required. But what was heartening, they felt, was that all customers maintained self discipline, wore masks and avoided crowding shops or counters. Everyone, though, sensed a major change in customers’ attitude. While they were cautious, the sense of fear they had witnessed in 2020 was missing. Instead, there appeared to be a quiet confidence about what they needed to do to ensure safety. All the malls — South City, Mani Square, City Centre I and City Centre II — also recorded high occupancy at their car park. With public transport off roads, people used personal vehicles. The footfall would have been higher had there been public transport, said mall operators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-confidence-spikes-footfall-as-malls-reopen-sparks-quick-turnaround-hope/articleshow/83585454.cms||Subhro Niyogi

But two major travel companies have come together to launch a scheme under which the tourist can pay after returning from the holiday. Thomas Cook India and SOTC Travel have together launched a ‘Holiday first and pay when you return’ scheme to provide customers the flexibility and benefits of paying only once they return from their holiday, Thomas Cook said on Wednesday. “The customer doesn’t bear any additional cost,” a Thomas Cook spokesperson told TOI. The scheme has another aspect to it, called ‘TravShield’ , which the companies claimed is a “comprehensive safe travel commitment designed with meticulous health and safety protocols to safe guard customers across holidays, MICE and business travel.” In these times of travel restrictions and uncertainties brought on by the pandemic, the scheme might turn to be a shot in the arm for the ailing tourism industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/holiday-first-pay-later-plan-amid-covid/articleshow/83588381.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Widespread rainfall in Bihar till Friday: IMD||PATNA: Widespread rainfall was witnessed across the state in the last 24 hours and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued orange code alert for downpour on Thursday and yellow code alert for Thursday and Friday. The rainy season has been quite aggressive this year. Following its early onset on last Saturday, monsoon has remained active on most days in the state. Weathermen claimed that Bihar has, in fact, received 242% more rainfall over the last one week. While an orange code alert stipulates that authorities should be alert for extreme weather developments, the yellow code alert asks the authorities to be watchful. The Patna meteorological centre also issued a warning for intense lightning in the state over the next two days. IMD also stated in its evening bulletin that frequent cloud to ground lightning along with moderate to severe thunderstorm is very likely to occur in Bihar till June 18. “The prevailing very active monsoon phase over Bihar is highly conducive for large-scale lightning activities over the entire state in association with cumulonimbus clouds. The probability of intense lightning is very high during the next three days, which is till June 18,” read a special bulletin issued by the Patna meteorological centre on Wednesday. It further stated that all open fields, rivers, waterlogged areas, mango and litchi orchards will remain vulnerable to lightning strikes. “Both the direct and indirect lightning strikes can prove fatal in such circumstances. The general public is advised to observe full caution during the period,” the bulletin stated. Uday Shankar Sinha, metrereologist at Patna meteorological centre, said as earlier predicted, moderate rainfall was witnessed at most places in the state in the last 24 hours. He said few places in north-western parts of the state witnessed very heavy rainfall and one or two places in north-central parts witnessed heavy rain. Places which received significant rainfall included Lauria (200mm), Ramnagar (170mm) and Valmiki Nagar (170mm), Chanpatia (140mm), Chatia (120mm), Triveniganj (100mm), Bagaha (100mm) and Nirmali (100mm) among others. The prevailing rainy condition has been primarily attributed to a cyclonic circulation over east Uttar Pradesh and a trough line passing through Bihar, leading to active monsoon rainfall. “Rainfall is expected to continue with similar intensity over the next 48 hours,” Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/imd-widespread-rainfall-till-friday/articleshow/83583024.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Kolkata||Day 1 a hit at Kolkata restaurants, bars as regulars return||KOLKATA: The first-day-first show for city restaurants and bars after a gap of 45 days was a moderate hit. For some popular restaurants, it was a bigger event considering the fact that all were operating with Covid protocols and 50% seating arrangements. ‘Jamai Shashthi’ came in handy for the restaurants, offering a slight boost. According to an estimate by the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI), the bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata, which employs over 80,000 people in the greater Kolkata area alone, has suffered a loss of Rs 4,000-Rs 4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic in April 2020. Loyal patrons turned up at their favourite food joints on Wednesday. Anindya Pal, who works in a private office around Park Street was at Mocambo enjoying his Chicken A-La-Kiev with mixed fried rice and beer with a colleague at his pre-pandemic lunch time at 2.30pm. “This has been my favourite lunch place for years. I was at office today and couldn’t miss the chance to come over with a colleague. It feels good to be back here after a long time,” said Pal, a resident of Lee Road. HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar, who runs restaurants like Songhai, Manthan, told TOI that the 50% seating capacity was almost full during lunch and, around 7pm, there was a queue. “The response is overwhelming and we have done good business. We are expecting to do at least 40% of our normal business today considering the fact that capacity was 50% and we got two hours of prime time compared to five hours in the evening,” he said, adding that if this trend continues, it will be good for the industry as home delivery and takeaways constitute only 10%-15% of revenue of most players. T S Walia, former national president of FHRAI, also felt the initial trend was very good. Nitin Kothari, HRAEI member and owner of restaurants like Peter Cat and Mocambo, was happy about the footfall on Wednesday. He opened Mocambo on Wednesday and is planning to reopen Peter Cat on Friday. “We were full during lunch and there were patrons waiting in the evening. Now it is being operated with 50% capacity as per guidelines. This would be 50%-60% of our normal business. A lot of people opted for early dinner at Mocambo,” he said. Charles Mantosh, owner of Moulin Rouge, Floriana and Magnolia, also had a good response from patrons. “All my restaurants have started operation today. The capacity was almost full,” he said. Debaditya Chaudhury, director of Chowman, Oudh and Chapter 2, echoed them. “Dining was good and there was a huge demand for takeaways due to Jamai Shashthi,” he said. However, Aminia director Kabir Azhar felt it would take some time for the industry to recover fully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/day-1-a-hit-at-restaurants-bars-as-regulars-return/articleshow/83586159.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

On Wednesday, the Centre constituted a working group under the chairmanship of joint secretary (refineries), ministry of petroleum and natural gas, with senior officials of the state government. Engineers India Limited and SBI Caps have been advised to rework the financials in view of the recent regulatory changes in corporate tax and interest rates. The decision to take the strategic project in the state forward comes after a high-level delegation comprising industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy, chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das and special chief secretary Karikal Valaven met Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and secretary Tarun Kapoor in New Delhi on Wednesday. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy urged Dharmendra Pradhan to consider the revival of the long-pending petrochemical cracker complex project in the state during his visit to New Delhi last week. Following the instructions of the chief minister, the state delegation met Pradhan and made a presentation on the issue of viability gap funding and requested him to clear the hurdles. The officials explained there would be no need of extending viability gap funding as sought by the HPCL and IOCL consortium keeping in view the reduction in corporate taxes by the Centre. The state urged the Centre to grant the project as part of its bifurcation promises as it would create a level-playing field in generation of employment. Speaking to the media after the meeting, Mekapati said that investments to the tune of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 crore would flow into the East Coast Corridor in the next three years once the Centre clears the project. He added that the petrochemical project would generate about 50 lakh jobs once all proposed projects were launched. “Total investments into the petrochemical complex including ancillary units will touch Rs 2 lakh crore if everything goes according to our plans. This is going to be a game-changer for the state,” said Mekapati. He said that Pradhan has assured them of monitoring the progress of the project and ensuring it takes wings shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/centre-to-expedite-mega-project-in-ap/articleshow/83593038.cms||Samdani MN

SHO Priya Jyoti told TOI, “Of the 15 named accused, Chotan, Ashok, Jitendra, Mahendra and Mahesh have been nabbed. We are, however, yet to trace the people, who took away the rifle of one of the constables.” A four-member raiding team was chased and attacked by the locals on Monday, but rescued after more police personnel reached the village. ASI Vijay Narayan Manjhi, who was leading the team, said nearly 50 villagers carrying wooden sticks, iron rods and weapons had attacked him and two constables, Premjeet Singh and Raghunandan Thakur, after surrounding them from three sides. “The attackers hit me on the head from behind and beat me up. They then threw me on the road in a semi-unconscious state. They also hit Premjeet and dragged him to a field after snatching his loaded rifle,” the ASI said, adding that their driver, Ramakant Kumar, managed to escape, leaving the police vehicle behind. Calling the attack a “pre-planned conspiracy”, Manjhi said, “Another constable, Raghunandan, was also assaulted, but he escaped with the help of a biker.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/five-nabbed-for-attacking-cops/articleshow/83584343.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||Mentally-ill at Thane hospitals get Covid vaccine and that dose of feeling wanted||MUMBAI: Khushiram*, 61, flashes his trademark smile and folds his hands into a quick namaste while a nurse prepares to jab him at the Thane Mental Hospital. For a good part of a decade that he has been here, Khushiram has not had any visitors to check on his well-being. His story is not too different from most other patients who are "forgotten" by their families and have no identity documentation.  So their "guardian"-- the hospital superintendent-- facilitated their online registration for the Covid vaccine using his own phone number and a group of 400 patients got life-saving shots between Tuesday and Wednesday. While they may not understand the importance of getting jabbed, hospital doctors hope their inoculation will result in herd immunity in the wards. The Union Health Ministry recently issued an SOP for registration on the CoWin platform for all those individuals who do not have photo identity documents. The SOP says that a key facilitator with a valid ID card can become a pointperson for vaccination of the entire group. Unlike other institutions like prisons or old age homes, it wasn't feasible to gather the patients together on the premises as that would need an army of hospital attendants. So, doctors took the vaccination camp to the wards instead. "Our volunteers went from ward to ward with doctors and nurses. Patients were called out for jabs and were then kept in observation for half an hour," said Shishir Joshi of Project Mumbai. a non-profit that assisted in the vaccination process. Nurses will be keeping a round-a-clock watch on the vaccine beneficiaries as some may not be able to express if they run up a fever or suffer any other side effects. Among those vaccinated were a bunch of 12 from a ward reserved for undertrials and convicts that have been medically certified as mentally ill. Two former patients, now in their fifties and volunteering as food servers, were also vaccinated. A little over 190 patients had contracted Covid-19 and cannot be inoculated immediately. The facility, which has only one ambulance, was in desperate need of oxygen when the second wave of Covid was at its peak. Project Mumbai donated 15 oxygen concentrators in May and provided gloves, sanitisers etc., for the vaccination drive.

Bhagalpur district horticulture officer (DHO) Vikash Kumar said Jardalu mangoes from the orchard of farmer Krishnanand Singh of Simri village under Kahalgaon sub-division in Bhagalpur district were selected and sent through an export registered farmers’ agency after quality certifications. “The mangoes were cultivated by organic farming technique and no pesticides or chemicals were used in growing the mangoes. Registration of farmers of Bhagalpur region from APEDA for exporting the mangoes in future is under process in order to get the exports done by the mango growers and horticulturists in the region," he said. “The state government’s decision to export Jardalu mangoes to the UK is inspired by CM Nitish Kumar’s vision of "one food item from Bihar in every Indian’s plate".

---||Business||Second Covid wave may leave Rs 2 lakh crore dent on economic output: RBI||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has estimated that the second wave may result in a Rs 2-lakh-crore loss in output during the current fiscal, in what is the first such exercise conducted by the central bank or the government. A loss of economic output may not have a direct corelation with the GDP, but points to some loss in the value-addition across the economy. Already, several agencies, including the RBI, have lowered growth projections for the year. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe RBI’s output loss is factored into its revised GDP forecast in the latest monetary policy estimates, where it slashed growth projections from 10.5% to 9.5%. The state of the economy report released on Wednesday said the projection was on the assumption that real GDP will grow by 18.5% in the first quarter, which is on a much lower base given the contraction last year. Providing more details on the economic impact of the second wave, the RBI said the rate of decline in deposits has been higher, indicating that household savings have dropped in sharp contrast to the first wave. “Additionally, currency holding with the public has also decelerated significantly to 1.7% during April 2021 in comparison to the growth of 3.5% a year ago, implying heavy outgo towards Covid-induced medical expenditure.” It said the second wave’s toll is higher due to the impact on domestic demand as several aspects of aggregate supply, such as agriculture and contactless services, are holding, while industrial production and exports have surged amid pandemic protocols. “Going forward, the speed and scale of vaccination will shape the path of recovery,” the report said. As for life beyond the pandemic, the report highlights the advantages of repurposing and reprioritising revenue and expenditures to extract “bang for the buck”. The report said that the public sector can lead the private sector in unlocking growth opportunities. In addition, it can partner the private sector, and step back to allow the private sector to take the lead in sunrise areas. “While Covid has tested the limits of flexibility in fiscal policy frameworks in India as in the rest of the world, it has offered a unique opportunity to redefine fiscal policy in a manner that emphasises ‘how’ over ‘how much,” the report said. The report, authored by RBI deputy governor M D Patra highlights the finance ministry estimates that to achieve herd immunity and regain recovery momentum, the target population to be vaccinated is 70 crore by September 2021 and around 113 crore more doses are needed. Accordingly, around 93 lakh vaccinations are required per day to achieve the herd immunity.

Since March, Tata Motors — through recruiter Egon Zehnder — has been searching for a successor to Butschek, who is on an extension till June 30. To be sure, Tata Motors had selected German national Marc Llistosella as Butschek’s replacement in February. But it withdrew the chief executive job offer a month later in an unusual U-turn for such a high-level automotive appointment. There is speculation that Butschek’s term could be extended again. His original five-year tenure with Tata Motors had ended in February and his contract was renewed for another four and a half months. The Tata Motors board will meet soon to consider Butschek’s extension or a CEO’s appointment. Tata Motors declined to comment for this report, which it described as speculative. It said that it’s the prerogative of the nomination & remuneration committee and the board to make this decision. If Tata Motors is without a CEO after June 30, it will be the fourth time in the past 27 years where it is without a chieftain and where its operations will have to be overseen by the chairman N Chandrasekaran. Before Butschek, Tata Motors was without a CEO for two years (2014 till 2016) after Karl Slym’s sudden demise. At that time, former Tata Motors chairman Cyrus Mistry supervised its functioning. The company was also without a CEO for 10 months in 2012, after Prakash Telang superannuated. Before that too, it was without a CEO for 10 years (1994 to 2005), after J E Talaulicar retired. Tata Motors chairman emeritus Ratan Tata oversaw the company’s operations during that period. Current Tata Motors chairman Chandrasekaran will then have to devote more time to the company and work along with its six-member management team to take the Tata Group flagship to the next growth level amid challenges and competition. Butschek, also a German national, has been managing Tata Motors from his home country Austria for most of the Covid pandemic that has restricted human mobility. If Butschek’s term is further extended till Tata Motors finds his successor, he would prefer continuing to work from Austria, it is learned. Butschek has been restructuring the company’s operations by narrowing its losses, cutting costs, lowering debt and spinning off the passenger vehicle business into a separate entity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tamo-yet-to-name-new-ceo-butschek-to-get-extension/articleshow/83588494.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Police said that Vineesh Vinod (21), who hails from Muttungal, rushed upstairs into Drishya’s room and stabbed her around 8am. She died on the spot. Her sister Devashree, who tried to save her sister was stabbed in the chest and hand. Vineesh was nabbed by the police within hours of the attack. Police said that the accused had allegedly set fire to the toy and stationary shop owned by Balachandran at Perinthalmanna at 9.45pm on Wednesday. Perinthalmanna deputy SP Devassia K M said Drishya and Vineesh were formerly schoolmates at a higher secondary school and the attack was allegedly carried out as a reprisal for having spurned his proposals. Relatives of the deceased woman said Vineesh was pestering Drishya for long. Balachandran told the media that the accused had approached them with a marriage proposal three months ago following which the family approached the police. He said Vineesh told the siblings during the attack that he had set fire to their shop. Drishya’s uncle Madhusoodhanan said the accused had been troubling her and the family had filed a complaint with Perinthalmanna police. They didn’t go ahead with the case after the parents and relatives of Vineesh gave a written undertaking before the police that he wouldn’t trouble her again. “We suspect that the attack was elaborately planned and setting fire to the shop could be an attempt to ensure that her father and relatives weren’t there at home during the attack,” he said. Only the daughters and their mother were at home when the attack took place. Perinthalmanna inspector of police Sajin Sasi V said that the accused had set fire to the shop owned by Balachandran to exact revenge. The shop owned by Balachandran had caught fire on Wednesday night and fire and rescue services personnel took one hour to douse the fire that had gutted the entire stock, including bags and footwear. The accused could be nabbed by the police swiftly due to the presence of mind shown by the driver of the auto which Vineesh took to escape. Auto driver Jawhar drove him straight to Perinthalmanna police station after he got calls from a neighbour and later from the police during the trip that his passenger had committed a crime. Jawhar had his suspicions as the clothes Vineesh was wearing were drenched and the accused had told him that he had been in an accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/spurned-youth-murders-woman/articleshow/83623220.cms||---

It shows that 51% of the children in Delhi have an unhealthy Body Mass Index (BMI). The percentage of children having unhealthy BMI was more only in Bengaluru and Chennai (53%). The findings are part of the 11th annual health survey conducted by Sportz Village Schools, which also highlights that compared to the previous survey, the unhealthy BMI percentage for children in Delhi has increased. As per the last year’s survey, 50% of the children in Delhi were having unhealthy BMI. The nationwide survey covered 2,54,681 children in the age group of 7 to 17 years from 364 schools across 250 cities and towns. It looked at the state of the health of children on fitness parameters such as BMI, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, abdominal or core strength, flexibility, upper body strength and lower body strength. At the national level, the survey reveals that 1 in 2 children do not have healthy BMI. Moreover, the percentage of children having healthy levels of aerobic capacity and core strength during this period dropped drastically by 33% and 10%, respectively. Aerobic capacity is the ability of the heart and lungs to get oxygen to the muscles, while core strength is the strength of the muscles of the torso, which helps determine posture. In Delhi, 9 in 10 children were found unhealthy in terms of aerobic capacity, while in terms of core strength, 2 in 5 children were found to be unhealthy. Overall, the percentage of girls with healthier BMI levels (48%) was found to be more when compared to that of boys (44%). The girls also fared better in flexibility and upper body strength. However, they did not fare well on aerobic capacity and lower body strength parameters. Saumil Majmudar, co-founder and group CEO of Sportz Village, said, “Our health survey clearly highlights the low levels of ﬁtness in children across the country. Although this is a cause for concern, we know how to combat the issue. Structured play that is inclusive and age-appropriate directly impacts several health parameters such as upper body, lower body strength, aerobic and anaerobic capacity.” “School leaders can help address the key challenge through the inclusion of adequate structured sports or physical education periods, both online and offline, in the academic curriculum for the coming academic year. Parents can also help improve their child’s ﬁtness by encouraging good screen time that gets children active at home in case there are restrictions around play in the neighborhood,” Majmudar said further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-home-and-sick-of-it-51-of-delhi-kids-surveyed-have-unhealthy-bmi/articleshow/83587830.cms||Shradha Chettri

Sources said that the amount of rainfall recorded in western Nepal has been higher than the forecast made by the IMD and other agencies. At around noon on Wednesday, water discharge through the Valmiki Nagar barrage was static at 4.12 lakh cusec. The earlier forecast of the agencies concerned was that the discharge through the barrage would be around 3 lakh cusec, but it has exceeded by 1.12 lakh cusec. Incidentally, the highest water discharge through the Valmiki Nagar barrage was 3.82 lakh cusec on July 20 and 21 last year, which had resulted in widespread flooding in the lower reaches of the river, besides breaches were caused in the six zamindari bandhs and damage inflicted at two points, one each along the main eastern and western Gandak embankments. Accordingly, the discharge of 4.12 lakh cusec of water through the Valmiki Nagar barrage has rendered the towns like Bagaha in West Champaran district and others lying in Gopalganj district, especially in its Baikunthpur assembly constituency, vulnerable to the floods. Similarly, several villages lying between the east and west Gandak embankments have become vulnerable. Accordingly, West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Saran and Siwan districts, as well as the areas closer to Nepal, have been put on high alert. As a result of it and also in response to the call of CM Nitish Kumar made at the high-level review meeting held in Patna on Tuesday to assess the floods situation -- officials were doing miking in the vulnerable areas, asking the villagers to shift to higher places with their cattle and other property, or to the campus of identified schools. WRD sources said that if there is no heavy rainfall in Nepal on Wednesday night, then the water discharge through the Valmiki Nagar barrage will begin to fall from the peak of 4.12 lakh cusec from Thursday afternoon, and people will have some respite. Incidentally, on Wednesday, reports from Gewaghat in Nepal, 90 km north of Valmiki Nagar, said that water discharge is falling. At Bagaha, incessant rains in the catchment area of the Gandak river since Monday has also led to swelling of other minor rivers like Bhapsa, Manor, Jhikeri, Kosil, Masan, Pandai, Harbora and Oria. The campus of Border Outpost (BOP) at Jhandutola of Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB), 21st battalion Bagaha, is under three-feet deep water. The SSB jawans are making border surveillance on country boats. At present, the villages affected are Shripatinagar under Semra-Labdeha panchayat and Manjharia panchayat area under Piparassi block, besides neighbouring villages in Khadda block of Kushinagar district in UP. CPI (ML) MLA from Sikta Birendar Gupta said that he had asked the district administration and WRD to plug the breached gap. Done branch canal, which originated from Tirhut canal, breached its north embankment near Chhataraul under Laukaria police station, flooding 100 acres of sugarcane crop and paddy fields. A newly-built approach road, connecting Marjadpur-Marajadi Kathaha bridge, was washed away. A diversion on Lauria-Narakatiaganj road near the Ashokan pillar suffered the same fate. Incessant rains had made life miserable in the Bagaha town. Many houses of low-lying wards of Nagar Parishad are also under knee-deep water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/heavy-rainfall-in-nepal-poses-flood-threat-to-several-north-bihar-dists/articleshow/83582585.cms||Abhay Singh

A decision in this regard was jointly taken by the state road construction department (RCD) additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena and water resources department (WRD) secretary Sanjeev Hans on Wednesday. As a result, traffic movement on Faijalapur-Kesaria bridge will remain suspended, while traffic on Bangra Ghat bridge will continue. The three cuts on the 810-metre approach road is being made in view of the alarming rise in the water level of the river Gandak, and consequent discharge of 4.12 lakh cusec of water through the Valmiki Nagar barrage. Earlier, the engineers and the team of experts from National Institute of Technology (NIT) Patna had recommended construction of three bridges on the approach road to facilitate waterways and protect the Gandak embankments. Now, the bridges will be constructed after the monsoon is over. Meanwhile, the WRD communique said that the divisions concerned have been asked to deploy one daily wage workers at every 1 km of the embankments to keep round- -the-clock watch on the vulnerability of the embankments. The workers deployed will keep the engineers concerned posted about the situation, while the engineers themselves have been asked to maintain utmost vigil along the embankments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gandak-bridge-approach-road-to-be-cut/articleshow/83582640.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Business||BrowserStack raises $200m, 15th to join unicorn club in ‘21||Chennai: Software testing platform BrowserStack has closed a $200 million series B funding round at a valuation of $4 billion. US-based marquee investment firm Bond, which has backed tech giants such as Facebook, Airbnb, Uber and others, led the round, which also saw participation of Insight Partners and existing investor Accel. With this, BrowserStack becomes the 15th unicorn in India in 2021. It also joins Freshworks, Druva, Icertis, Chargebee and others in the Indian SaaS unicorn league. The investment will help support strategic acquisitions that BrowserStack plans to take up, expansion of its product offerings and continued scale and growth, the company said. The company recently acquired Percy, a visual testing platform. The startup also wants to reward its employees and said it would be kicking off a buyback as part of the raise after completing one last year. Founded in 2011 by IIT-Bombay grads Ritesh Arora and Nakul Aggarwal, BrowserStack was bootstrapped until 2018 when it raised its first external funding of $50 million from Accel. The platform helps companies to move their software testing to the cloud and counts over 50,000 customers including Microsoft, Twitter, Ikea, Spotify, Expedia and others. BrowserStack provides developers access to a cloud platform that allows them to test their websites and mobile applications, replacing the need for teams to own and manage an in-house test infrastructure. “This funding will allow us to explore the different ways in which we can bring new products to market - via acquisitions, via acqui-hires or by investing more heavily in our product and engineering teams,” Ritesh Arora, co-founder and chief executive office, Browserstack, said. “We plan to double our headcount to 1,600 over the next 18 months, across all our locations,” he added. As Covid accelerates digital transformation and drives companies to leverage cloud solutions to replace on-premise infrastructure, BrowserStack claims it has seen a significant uptick in business. The company has been profitable since day 1, and says it has more than tripled its employee base to over 750 employees across seven countries in the last three years. The startup has offices in Dublin, San Francisco, New York and Mumbai, and its R&D team is spread across locations. BrowserStack has also opened ten new data centers worldwide in the last three years to take their global network to 15 data centres. “As software continues to rewire everything, the bar on speed and quality continues to rise, and testing software across the expanding number of browsers and devices is a huge and expensive challenge for development teams to manage on their own,” Jay Simons, general partner at BOND, said, noting that the product is a boon for today’s web and app developers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/browserstack-raises-200m-15th-to-join-unicorn-club-in-21/articleshow/83585318.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

STET 2019 was held for 15 subjects of which the results of 12 subjects were declared in March after long wait. However, the results of three subjects -- Urdu, Sanskrit and Science — were pending due to reports of alleged paper leak from one exam centre in Gaya district in January 2020. Principal secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar said the department had a meeting with Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) and its technical partner on Tuesday to review the publication of remaining STET results. “Technical issues have been sorted out and it is expected that the results would be published by June 22,” he said. He told this newspaper on Wednesday that the results of three subjects were upheld as question papers were leaked at an examination centre in Gaya, after which the exams were cancelled. “The exams were conducted again in September last year, but the Patna high court directed not to release the results in parts. So, after sorting out the problem, we will declare the pending results,” Kumar said. The officials at BSEB said during the STET 2019 exam held in January last year, 106 teacher aspirants were expelled at Gaya centre for creating ruckus during the exam. “Following which the exams were cancelled and re-examination was conducted in September. However, the expelled candidates moved the high court which directed the Board to conduct the re-exam of these aspirants as well. These candidates have appeared for STET in Urdu, Sanskrit and Science. That’s why the board withheld these results, so that to include the expelled candidates in the merit list,” he said. A total of 15.8% candidates have passed the exam. Altogether 24,599 candidates out of 1.5 lakh who appeared for 12 subjects have qualified the examination. The total number of students appeared in the exam for 15 subjects was around 1.78 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stet-results-of-3-subjects-next-week/articleshow/83583045.cms||Faryal Rumi

Gen Yers (between 24-29 years) accounted for the highest share of respondents (41%) who fell prey to fraud, says a report from financial technology firm FIS PACE 2021 report.Bharat Panchal, chief risk officer, APMEA, FIS said, “With the digital payment adoption accelerated as paper currency fell out of favour. Consumers have become more vulnerable to cyber fraudsters, with 34% reporting financial fraud in the past 12-months.”According to the FIS report, about 38% of Gen Zers (18-24 years) fell victim to frauds, with nearly one in five falling victim to a phishing attack. “Youngsters are more likely to prefer communications with bankers via phone or email/social media than face-to-face, puting them more at risk,” Panchal says.Unlike the Gen Z and Y, fewer senior Gen Yers (30-40 years) and Gen Xers (41-55 years) have faced frauds. One in 20 senior gen Yers have suffered cryptocurrency fraud, while one in 10 Gen Xers have experienced a card scam. “Limited income leads to limited expenses and exposure to fraud for these categories,” he added. On the other hand, cybersecurity firm Sophos said it has identified 167 counterfeit Android and iOS apps. Some (fake apps) included an embedded customer support ‘chat’ option and replies received were with near-identical language. “People trust the brands and people they know and the operators behind these fake trading and cryptocurrency scams ruthlessly take advantage of that,” said Jagadeesh Chandraiah, senior threat researcher at Sophos.“These fake applications impersonate popular and trusted financial apps from all over the world, while the dating site sting begins with a friendly exchange of messages to build trust before the target is asked to install a fake app. Such tactics make the fraud seem very believable,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/youth-most-vulnerable-to-upi-scams-phishing-attack-report/articleshow/83585361.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Then, it will plant 55 varieties of trees and shrubs, including local and fruit-bearing trees that will attract birds and animals. Amidst this green cloak there will be walking paths to encourage citizens to take a stroll or exercise. The budget and deadline for the project has not been fixed yet, said sources. The Pirana dump is spread over 80 acres. Nearly 80% of the garbage here has turned into mud since the early 1980s. There are three 55m tall garbage mounds sitting on 40 acres of land. The trash mountains are made up of 1.25 crore metric tonnes of legacy waste at this moment, said AMC officials. At present, 39 trommel machines process about 15,000 MT of garbage daily. So far, AMC has cleared 36 lakh metric tonnes of garbage from the space allotted for the garden. It estimated that the remaining two large mounds, which are between 25 to 55m tall, constitute close to 1 crore MT of garbage. “If the current waste processing pace is maintained, the mounds will be eliminated in the next three years,” says a senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/toxic-trash-to-give-way-for-o2-garden-at-pirana/articleshow/83586823.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Villagers of Sugauli, Ramgarhwa, Chiraiya and Pakaridayal blocks residing near the left embankment of Burhi Gandak river are spending sleepless nights. They have stopped going to their fields. Those living in huts have taken shelter in pucca buildings of the co-villagers out of fear. A 40-member team of officials and experts of the forest department from Patna, Muzaffarpur, Motihari and VTR with local police armed with tranquillizer guns and cage van is conducting extensive searches in the Burhi Gandak riverine areas near Pakaridayal to the tiger, which strayed from the VTR four-five days ago. VTR field director Hem Kant Roy said it might have strayed out from Manguraha range of the VTR after territorial fight between the old and new tigers. “Experts and officials of the forest department are trying to trace the tiger following its pug marks,” he said. East Champaran divisional forest officer (DFO) Prabhakar Jha said the tiger is full grown and healthy, but battling hunger. “We are keeping a close watch on its movement,” he said, adding that a tiger travels 30-40km per day/night. According to sources, the tiger was first spotted by the villagers on Tuesday in the mango orchard of Dumarbana village near Pakaridayal market, which is 15km away from Motihari. East Champaran DM Shirshat Kapil Ashok, DFO Jha and police officers reached the site and the area was cordoned off. Official sources said as soon as the operation started by forest officials, the tiger managed to escape into bushy tracks and the maize fields. Though expert gunmen of the forest department fired three shots of tranquillizer at the tiger, but the targets missed and the it managed to run towards open field in heavy rainfall. The DFO said they were keeping a close watch on the movement of tiger, which most likely has started returning towards the VTR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tiger-strays-130km-from-vtrcreates-panic-among-villagers/articleshow/83585470.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey

On Tuesday, one of the attendants, while talking to media persons about non-payment of salary, had alleged that a supervisor had demanded sexual favours from her and threatened to sack her if she did not agree. Jamnagar collector Ravi Shankar constituted the committee led by sub-divisional magistrate Aastha Dangar with other members being Dr Nayna Patel, dean of dental hospital and assistant superintendent of police Nitesh Pandey. “The committee spoke to some of the women attendants in the morning and they will record everyone's statements. We will not allow the guilty to go scot free,” he told TOI. Nearly 750 attendants were recruited in the last one year on a temporary basis to serve the Covid-19 patients as their relatives were not allowed to stay in the hospital. The issue came up in the discussion of the state Cabinet meeting in Gandhinagar and chief minister Vijay Rupani ordered an inquiry. Minister of state for home Pradeepsinh Jadeja told reporters: “Some women attendant has alleged sexual harassment, molestation and indecent demands. CM directed the district collector and health commissioner to form a three-member committee to probe these allegations.” Speaking to TOI, SDM Dangar said, “We are trying to ascertain the facts. Prima facie we have learnt that one woman had made these allegations before the media, but there is no formal complaint. We will submit a prima facie report at the earliest.” According to sources, the woman who had made the allegations, is not coming forward before the authorities, but the team has started recording the statement of other women. Officials said no formal complaint, either -written or oral, was received by the dean or any senior doctor in the hospital. One of the women also alleged that supervisors used to send them friendship offers through ward boys and those who turned down the demands had been fired. Meanwhile, Leela Ankolia, chairperson of Gujarat State Commission for Women has also asked the district superintendent of police to submit a detailed report regarding these allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/panel-to-probe-allegations-of-sexual-harassment/articleshow/83583235.cms||---

A grateful department has ensured that Pradhan’s children will be able to continue with their studies. In a move to honour Pradhan’s dedicated service of around two decades at the varsity, students, faculties and alumni of the department collected Rs 4.2 lakh fund in the past two months. They created a Shiba Welfare Fund and opened a bank account, in which people were appealed to donate. Faculties and students launched an online campaign to create awareness about the fund. “He is remembered by all the present and past students of our department. We lost an important colleague who was part of all the major developments in the department. Existing students and PhD students from the country and abroad have contributed to the fund,” said Dr Kiran Pandya, head of DHRD. After battling Covid for more than a week in the hospital, Pradhan died at the New Civil Hospital. He initially worked at the Department of Economics and later joined DHRD. Pradhan is survived by his wife and two children. “I don’t know what we will do now. But with this financial support, my elder sister and I will be able to study further,” said Samir, son of Pradhan. “We lost the earning member of our family. I will take the family back to our native village in Odisha. Hopefully the financial aid will be helpful for the children’s studies,” said Suresh, elder brother of Pradhan. “Shibabhai was a very kind person. Since his appointment was on a temporary basis the family did not have any support due to his sudden departure. But the aid will help the children,” said Naresh Solanki, a peon in DHRD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vnsgu-collects-over-rs-4l-for-kin-of-peon-who-died-of-ncov/articleshow/83583251.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Allahabad||PMC continues to cremate bodies buried on Phaphamau ghat which face threat of exposure||Prayagraj: The early arrival of monsoon this year is a worry for the district administration as the increasing level of water in the Ganga is fast eroding its banks, and as a result, a large number of bodies buried on the Phaphamau ghat are facing the threat of exposure. In the given condition, the Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) has taken the responsibility of cremating such bodies. Till date, the zonal officer of Phaphamau ghat, Neeraj Singh, has cremated over two dozen bodies, 11 of which were cremated in the last week. Seven bodies were cremated on Tuesday and three on Wednesday morning. Presently, around 70 bodies are on the verge of getting exposed at this ghat, as the strong currents of the river are fast eroding its banks. Everyday, Singh and his team inspect the bodies which are buried on the sandy banks of the Ganga, and if any of the body is threatened to be exposed, his team members dig out the corpse and cremate it after performing the last rites. Singh makes sure that all the rituals are followed without any flaw. “I don’t know any of the people whose bodies we cremate. But I feel it is my responsibility to religiously follow all the necessary rituals. I light the pyre myself amid the chanting of vedic mantras, considering them as my own family,” said Singh. This practice of cremating bodies buried on the banks of Ganga started on June 4 when Singh had cremated six bodies. Since then, this zonal officer has taken up this work dedicatedly. Till Wednesday, he has lit pyres of 24 bodies. PMC is incurring an amount of around Rs 3,000 for cremating each body, and is using its own resources for the arrangements. Sources informed that the practice would continue in the coming days as more bodies are about to get exposed, given the continued erosion of the banks. “After getting a formal approval from my higher officials, my team unearths the buried bodies, and then we cremate all of them one by one,” said Neeraj. “We have been keeping a close watch on the ghats, preventing anyone from burying a body. But at the same time, when we find that a body could get exposed and fall in the river following the erosion of banks, we dig out the body and cremate it,” said public relation officer of PMC, PK Mishra. Though bodies are buried on the river banks near ghats like Jhunsi and Daraganj also, but erosion due to the rising waters has so far been witnessed mostly at Phaphamau, said PMC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pmc-continues-to-cremate-bodies-buried-on-phaphamau-ghat-which-face-threat-of-exposure/articleshow/83583915.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana withdraws SC case, paves way for new Krishna tribunal||HYDERABAD: Telangana has withdrawn the case against Andhra Pradesh it had filed in the Supreme Court in 2015 over sharing of Krishna river water and several other issues with the neighbouring state. This would enable the Centre to constitute a new tribunal on Krishna river water dispute between the two Telugu states. Informing the decision of the Telangana government, special chief secretary of irrigation department wrote to secretary of Union jal shakti department on Monday and urged the Centre to take steps referring its complaint, sent in July 2014 limiting the scope between the successor states of AP and Telangana, to the existing Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal (KWDT)-II. Sources said the case was withdrawn by the Telangana government following an assurance given by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat at the apex council meeting held in October last year. The meeting was attended by CMs of both Telugu states to discuss river water sharing, disputes and projects between the two states. The Telangana government has been arguing that the present tribunal has no powers to redistribute Krishna waters to both Telangana and AP and review allocations, resulting in gross injustice to the new state. “The tribunal under section 89 of AP Reorganisation Act has only terms of reference to make project-wise allocation of the total 811 tmcft of water. Secondly, the AP government is diverting water to projects located outside the Krishna basin. Making use of lacunae in the present mechanism, AP is getting en bloc allocations, which should not be allowed,” a senior irrigation official of Telangana said. Telangana had informed the Centre that if Krishna water is redistributed, it was supposed to get 550 tmcft of the total 811 tmcft, whereas it was getting only 299 tmcft while AP was allocated 512 tmcft. KCR had written letters to the jal shakti minister and even Prime Minister asking them to refer Telangana’s complaints to a new tribunal or to the existing KWDT-II with new terms of reference. During the second meeting of the apex council, KCR had raised this issue again. Shekhawat said for considering the request of Telangana for a tribunal under section-3 of the Inter State River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act of 1956, it has to first withdraw its case filed before the apex court. “The ministry of jal shakti will seek the legal opinion on whether a new tribunal has to be appointed or new terms of reference can be issued to KWDT-II to hear the matter for which the Telangana CM has agreed,” Shekhawat said after the apex council meeting. The tribunal is presently considering the reference under section 89 of the Reorganisation Act as this would also avoid duplication of inquiry and multiplicity of proceedings, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-withdraws-sc-case-paves-way-for-new-krishna-tribunal/articleshow/83590285.cms||Koride Mahesh

They take his name with pride and say his heroic act motivates village youth to join the Indian Army. On Tuesday, the bhog of akhand path was performed at the martyr’s home to mark his first death anniversary. His wife, Jaswinder Kaur, with whom Satnam had a telephonic conversation a day before he was martyred, says the last year had been excruciating. “Time spent with my husband was my real life; now, I am just passing time,” she says. On the day of the clash, 20 Indian troops — four of them from Punjab, including Satnam Singh — were martyred in clashes with Chinese troops on the Line of Actual Control in Galwan river valley, Ladakh. Born in 1979, Satnam Singh of 3 Medium Regiment had joined the Indian Army on August 23, 1995, and was deployed in Ladakh when the clash took place. He left behind two children — son Prabhjot Singh,17, and daughter Sandeep Kaur, 18. “Army was his foremost priority and family was at the second place, but he was a caring husband and son,” Jaswinder says. She says he wanted to spend his retired life tilling the fields and taking care of his family and sending children abroad for higher studies. She adds the family is satisfied with the fulfillment of promises made by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/year-after-galwan-memories-of-martyr-satnam-singh-live-on/articleshow/83587907.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The fraudsters had a few days ago created a fake Facebook profile of DGP Kumar and sought Rs 5000 from nine of his contacts by sending direct messages to them. Providing details about the matter, senior superintendent of police (SSP) STF Ajay Singh told TOI, “The preliminary investigation in the case has revealed that the fraud originated from the Mewat area. We have sent a team to the region to trace the people who we suspect were involved in creating the fake FB profile of the DGP.” He added that “Bharatpur, Mathura and Mewat which form the tri-junction of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have now emerged as the epicentre of several cyber frauds.” “In particular, this tri-junction is notorious for frauds involving websites like OLX and extortion by making fake social media profiles. Previously, Jamtara--a district in Jharkhand—had similarly emerged as a notorious region for phishing attacks across the country.” Singh further said that “during investigation in several cases, leads have led the investigating agencies to Mewat where swindlers have been found targeting innocent people across several states.” “In Uttarakhand, at least 400 cyber crime-related cases have originated from this region annually,” he added. Talking about the modus operandi deployed by the fraudsters, Singh said that they procure Sim cards on fake IDs and then seek potential targets online. “They are exploiting multiple verticals including social media profiles and even online marketplaces. They intentionally do not seek out targets in their home state to avoid getting caught,” the STF SSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mewat-region-hotbed-of-cyber-crimes-says-ukhand-stf-sends-team-to-area-after-fake-fb-profile-of-dgp-traced-to-region/articleshow/83580581.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Dehradun||Firm in dock for fake Kumbh tests has tin shed ‘office’, gave wrong addresses||DEHRADUN/ HARIDWAR: A private agency, which was awarded the contract for Covid testing in key areas of the Kumbh mela in Haridwar and is now under scanner for conducting 1 lakh fake tests, had submitted dubious office addresses to the Uttarakhand health department and listed phone numbers that are not in service, a TOI investigation has found. In one of the documents submitted by the agency, a copy of which is with TOI, the firm’s address is listed as being in Ansal Chambers, Bhikaji Cama Place, East Delhi. There is no Bhikaji Cama Place in East Delhi. On the company’s website, their corporate address is mentioned in a building in Sector 63, Noida, which TOI found was a tin shed. None of the phone numbers listed on the website were in service. TOI spoke to one of the directors of the company who said the incorrect addresses were “manual errors” and phone numbers were unreachable since they had been submitted on “old letterheads of the firm”. She also said the property in Noida — where a tin shed currently stands — was once a factory. “We shut shop two years ago. But the website still has that address,” she said. When pressed further, she said they were now operational from Ansal Chambers, South Delhi, but had given their registered office on lease to a courier company during lockdown. “We will cooperate with the state’s investigation. The samples were collected and data was generated by two private labs that we had a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with, we were simply mediators,” she said. On Wednesday, TOI also found that the company’s proposal of interest to conduct testing during Kumbh was initially rejected by the Haridwar health department. Chief medical officer (CMO), Haridwar, Dr S K Jha, said the agency had approached them to get empanelled as a Covid-testing agency. “They were not given permission as they did not have approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” he said. The firm managed to get an approval from the mela administration to conduct Covid tests. The mela administration was created during Kumbh to take all decisions pertaining to the festival. Mela health officer Dr Arjun Singh Sengar said the agency was given the green light as it had an MoU with two private labs, both of which were ICMR approved laboratories. But an official who is part of the Uttarakhand health department investigation said, “How can a company get the contract based on a simple ‘expression of interest’? Was there a tender to award the contracts? Who vetted the company? They had no track record of working with the state government.” Nine private agencies and the state government had conducted 4 lakh tests during the festival period in Haridwar after the Uttarakhand high court had directed the state to conduct 50,000 daily tests in Kumbh. The agency under scanner had been tasked with conducting tests in key mela areas.

The 10-acre park will get a new 250-capacity amphitheatre overlooking the pond. The redevelopment has been undertaken by the UN Mehta Foundation. The garden was designed in 1996 by a city-based architect. According to the redevelopment project report, the new amphitheatre will be spread over 3,000 square feet and will also have a two storeyed gymnasium. The gymnasium was there, but was not used. The new design has a two-storey gymnasium covering 6,000 square feet. According to the report, the park will now also get a health cafe. It will have separate spaces for men and women. The new design will also have twenty seating clusters designed to allow unhindered views of the lake. Each cluster will have a capacity of about 12-15 people. Overall, the park will provide seating for more than 500 people. City planners who are designing the project said that for the first time a municipal garden will get a nature corner of about 1,450 sq ft. This place is for garden demonstrations, talks, and storing garden artefacts. Officials said that so far there was no dedicated parking facility and this new garden will have a secondary entrance from the service road with dedicated car parking. The bougainvillea arbour which was the identity of the garden is being restored. The garden will also have a new place created for yoga and over 12,000 sq ft. Officials said that the pathways are all being redone with eco-health friendly material and the walkways are being extended to cover 98,000 sq ft. The planting is also being redone with hundreds of new and local varieties. The planners have made arrangements for several recharge wells in the garden. The UN Mehta Foundation has developed and maintains seven parks in the city. Along with Parimal Garden, they are also developing the historic Victoria Garden, which will open soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parimal-garden-gets-overhaul/articleshow/83585598.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The meeting began with Chowdhury reading out several paragraphs on the Covid situation and calling on the committee to discuss the issue. BJP and JD(U) members Jagdambika Pal and Lallan Singh protested, saying this was not part of the agenda and resolution needs to be put before the committee to vote on. The PAC has in the past discussed issues even when a CAG report is not available as in the case of the 2G spectrum allocation. But this needs a thumbs up from the committee and as per PAC rules the decision has to be unanimous. Chowdhury could hardly be unaware that a significant number of PAC members are from NDA. The political cut and thrust saw Chowdhury insisting that the subject required urgent attention and found some support from the lone Congress member present Shaktisinh Gohil and T R Baalu from DMK and Rahul Shewale who said the committee should hear what the chair had to say. This did not wash with other members of the committee.  BJP sources said the bid to spring a discussion on the Covid situation was an attempt by Chowdhury to score political points and in violation of PAC norms and rules. The agenda for the day was CAG reports on GST which were important and needed consideration. The panel’s processes do not allow arbitrary deviations and are best served by consensus and informal discussions as had resulted in the PAC backing an inquiry into the 2G affair.  Parliamentary committees have often been a battleground for political issues and PAC is no stranger to such a situation. The panels, in their composition, reflect the strength of parties in Parliament and here BJP and its allies have a dominant position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pac-meet-sees-adhir-nda-netas-fight-over-vaccination/articleshow/83591571.cms||---
---||Chennai||MSMEs in Tamil Nadu open for business, but none to run them||Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Tamil Nadu are caught in a peculiar situation. Following the lockdown due to the Covid second wave and subsequent relaxations limited to 27 districts, they now face manpower shortage due to a different reason. The industrial estates in the Chennai region, which are gearing up to buzz once again with the unlocking of lockdown conditions, are facing shortage of workers due to lack of public transport. Those in Coimbatore and Tirupur are facing shortage of workers who haven’t returned from other states and districts. "The state government has asked all industrial units to arrange private transport, buses or vans, to ferry staff. That may economically and logistically work for larger units, but not for smaller ones," said M Balachandran, president, Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association (AIEMA), a body that represents around 2,000 MSME units, and which together with their vendors collectively employ around two lakh workers. "Take my company for instance. Four employees handling the critical operations come from Tambaram, Thiruvallur and Arakkonam. It is a logistical nightmare to plan for transportation to get them to work. Until last week, workers were not even allowed in their own two-wheelers," Balachandran said. "Suburban trains are being operated, but only those working in government offices and essential services are permitted to board them. Factory workers with identity cards should also be allowed. In the case of operating buses, the government can insist on identity cards to restrict the number of people using public transport," said Balachandran. "While taking such major pandemic-related decisions, the government should take on board an industry representative and not just the health experts," he said. The 50,000-odd MSMEs in Coimbatore district have also been impacted by reduced orders due to the economic slowdown. The spike in raw material prices has not only wiped off the profits, it has also pushed the units into losses. M V Ramesh Babu, president, Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia) said the major issue is soaring prices of raw material. "During lockdown when most industries were not functioning and there was no demand for raw materials, the price had gone up by 10% to 12%". When the prices of raw material spike sharply, industries suffer losses as they would have signed contracts with buyers based on prevailing prices that cannot be renegotiated in most cases, he said. J James, district president, Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said the price of raw material like stainless steel rod, cast iron, brass, gunmetal and pig iron had increased by 60% to 80% in the past one year, while material like plastic had become costlier by 150%. Lockdown and absence of workforce have made things worse. The MSMEs in the region employ more than one lakh workers from north Indian states and another 50,000 from other districts of Tamil Nadu — and they are yet to return. For now, the state government has allowed export and auxiliary units and industries producing essential items, which form about 40% of total MSMEs in Coimbatore, to operate with 25% workforce. But this 25% workforce is not enough to resume production. Though the units have not been functioning for the past one month, they had to pay maintenance charges, wages of workers, repay loans and pay electricity bills. Small industrialists have urged the state and central governments for moratorium on loan repayment and grant two-month time for payment of power charges. Units in Chennai region too have reported drastic increase in prices of raw material including copper, steel and alloy steel. "A 20% increase in raw material price will add 12% to our working cost. With most units working on 4%-6% margin, not only is the profit wiped out, but we will also end up in losses," an industry representative said. In addition, the state has asked industrial units to get their workers vaccinated within one month. But the supply of vaccines has been an issue. "While we at AIEMA have undertaken a vaccination drive for our workers a fortnight ago, we have so far been able to cover just about 2,000. We do not know how long it will take to cover 40,000 workers in the estate," Balachandran said. TN government is aware of the issues; it is looking for a middle ground. "We are looking at the issues affecting the MSMEs very sympathetically and addressing them. We have extended the deadlines to renew 15 licenses considering the lockdown. After industry associations approached us on the need to permit workers coming to work on two-wheelers, we allowed that in the latest relaxations. As for resuming public transport, we have to take a balanced decision considering all aspects," Tamil Nadu government secretary for MSMEs Arun Roy told TOI. In the case of rising raw material prices, the state on Wednesday held a meeting with representatives of steel manufacturers at the Secretariat and urged them to reduce the price, to which the manufacturers have agreed. "The state government has been making consistent efforts to source vaccines. We are aware of the ground situation and we will give sufficient time to complete the vaccination drive," Roy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/msmes-in-tamil-nadu-open-for-business-but-none-to-run-them/articleshow/83585638.cms||D Govardan

For the past two days, a daily footfall of over 1,000 passengers is being reported from the airport. On Monday, 14 flights operated, and 1,187 passengers travelled through Surat airport, while on Sunday 1,030 travelled through 10 flights. Airport officials said that in the past few days there has been a steady increase as the number of Covid cases in Surat are decreasing and the vaccinated citizens are preferring to travel. In February, 97,000 people travelled from the airport while in the first week of March, a single day high of 4,000 passengers was recorded. However, there was a sudden drop after the second week of March and the downward trend continued even in April and May. There was also a day when no flights took off or landed in Surat and there were also days when only eight passengers travelled on a flight from Delhi. “We are seeing this increasing trend and we are also in talks with the airlines to start new flights from Surat,” said Aman Saini, Surat airport director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-airport-witnessing-steady-increase-of-passengers/articleshow/83583417.cms||---

The accused, Kalpak Malvankar, has been booked for rape, cheating and issuing threats under relevant sections of the IPC, and also under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. He has been sent to judicial custody. In 2019, the survivor, who is a divorcee and has a nine-year-old daughter, was looking for a job to support her family when she came across Malvankar, who was working in a finance company. Malvankar interviewed her and appointed her in the company. Soon, the two became friends and started chatting and meeting outside work too. “Malvankar told her that he was unmarried and developed a physical relationship with her. The survivor has alleged that she did not object to his advances as he promised to marry her,” said investigating officer Anil Mule. However, the complainant soon learnt that Malvankar had a wife and a child. When she confronted him, he told her that his relationship with his wife was not good and he will divorce her. But in December 2020, when she returned home one day, she saw her daughter crying. When she asked what had happened, the daughter said Malvankar had sexually assaulted her. The complainant immediately took up the issue with Malvankar, but he showed her the video of the act and threatened to make it viral if she filed a police complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-rapes-divorcee-molests-her-daughter-booked-under-pocso/articleshow/83590405.cms||Ahmed Ali

The victim was identified as G Padma, a native of Yarlapudi village under Srikalahasti mandal in Chittoor district. Integrated child development services officials said Padma’s father had abandoned her after the death of her mother when she was very young. She was raised by her maternal uncle Gaganam Mallikarjuna and aunt Prasanna. However, for the past one year, she was put under cousin sister Sumati and her husband Venkatayya’s care. She was being beaten and tortured during this period, ICDS officials said, who came to her aid after a complaint was lodged by local YSRC leader Rai Devika Chowdhary. When they, along with the police, reached Padma’s residence they found her in a terrible condition. Cops first took her to the government general hospital where she was administered first aid for her injuries and later shifted her to Sakhi One Stop centre for rehabilitation. Police said Padma’s relatives were only interested in the pension she got from the government and never took proper care of her. A case has been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/relatives-booked-for-torturing-woman/articleshow/83585642.cms||---

Former vice-president of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) and BJP leader, Jampana Pratap, met director general defence estates (DGDE), Prachur Goel, in Delhi recently, and urged him FOR FSI relaxation. Goel earlier was chief executive officer of SCB and defence estates officer (DEO), Hyderabad circle. On Wednesday, Pratap reporters, “The DGDE responded positively and assured a visit to SCB in a couple of weeks to take a final decision.” The SCB is calculating 1.5 FSI at silt/basement of the land in all civil residential colonies, and regularising by charging composition fee under the provisions of Cantonment Act, 2006. “As a result, property owners are utilising the silt/basement space either for commercial use or building security rooms, parking, installing AC plant rooms, electrical cabins, and even rooms for security guards,” Pratap said. “This FSI norm has led to high levels of corruption.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/efforts-on-for-fsi-relaxation-in-cantt/articleshow/83590401.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC to spend Rs 48cr on barges with brooms to clean trash in nullahs in Mumbai||Mumbai: The BMC’s standing committee on Wednesday cleared a Rs 48 crore proposal to buy nine barges fitted with trash brooms to stop garbage from entering the sea from rivers and nullahs. The floating trash brooms are being imported from Denmark. This comes after imported amphibious excavators worth Rs 105 crore were imported from the Netherlands to clean up river Mithi, BMC officials said that barges will be deployed at nine rivers and nullahs for now. “Debris floating into the sea is a big environmental issue besides causing flooding during monsoon. This project includes removing trash from water bodies and transporting garbage to dumping grounds. This is being done in keeping with the orders of National Green Tribunal,” said a senior official. “We have aw-arded a 3-year contract for supply of equipment and operations and transportation for 3 years.” BMC officials said that the machines will be brought by a company that has a tie-up with the Denmark-based company for supply of the barges. “BMC will now spend 48.5 crore to install trash booms at various places. Earlier experiments failed where the administration spent 1.17 crore. If an earlier effort failed what is the guarantee this time too it won't? If it's an improved technique, why can’t BMC think of it in phases? Let this new company show results and then go for a bigger contract,” said Congress leader Ravi Raja, opposition leader in the BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-to-spend-rs-48cr-on-barges-with-brooms-to-clean-trash-in-nullahs-in-mumbai/articleshow/83590478.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parents go to cops as school issues leaving certs over fees||Navi Mumbai: A group of parents submitted a complaint to Kharghar police claiming that Vishwajyot High School in Kharghar sent leaving certificates to 17 students over non-payment of fees that were allegedly hiked by violating rules. The protesting parents claimed that the school principal refused to meet them. On May 31, Raigad education officer had submitted an enquiry report to the deputy director of education stating that Shevantabai and Shankarrao Foundation, which runs the ICSE school, has violated rules by increasing the fees by more than the 15% allowed every two years and recommended revoking the NOC issued by the government to the school. Abhishek Mankame, the father of a class 7 student, said, “In 2018, the school proposed to increase the fees by 30% citing a Rs 10-crore bank loan for infrastructure development. Despite the PTA’s opposition, the school has been gradually increasing the fees every year.” Ashwini Jamadar, another parent, said, “I have paid the fees of my son, who is in class IV, and daughter, who is in class II, as per the 2018-19 fee structure till the June 2021, and assured the school in writing that I will pay the arrears, if any, after the fee hike dispute is resolved. But even after paying 75% of the fees, the school sent their leaving certificates by speed post and mentioned the reason as non-payment of fees.” Vikram Deshmukh, who represents the school management, said, “Non-payment of fees has put the financial sustainability of the school at stake. This will be unfair to students whose parents are paying fees on time. The school has not issued transfer certificates to any parent who applied to us under the Vishwajyot Covid Relief Program, but only to those who have defaulted willingly and not due to inability to pay. These defaults are pre-pandemic...Due to the pandemic, we have given flexibility to parents to pay fees in convenient instalments...Despite the pandemic, there has been no reduction in school expenses. We have been paying salaries to our staff... We have formed a committee to look into the requests for readmission of students whose admissions were cancelled after their parents refused to pay the fees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-parents-go-to-cops-as-school-issues-leaving-certs-over-fees/articleshow/83591293.cms||George Mendonca

Though a murder case has been booked, no one has been arrested so far. The victim, P Raji Reddy, 44, was husband of Ibrahimpatnam MPTC member, Mamatha. Raji Reddy’s family has been living near the bus stand in Ibrahimpatnam village. On Tuesday night, Raji Reddy’s cousin Chinna Raja Reddy went to attend a pre-wedding ceremony of a relative in the village. While talking to the people at the ceremony, Chinna Raja Reddy asked a relative, S Ramesh for tobacco. “When Ramesh said that he did not have tobacco, Chinna Raja Reddy made a sarcastic comment against him. Ramesh went home and told his sons, Rakesh and Ranjit that he was insulted by Raja Reddy. The brothers confronted Raja Reddy. As they were about to assault him, elders intervened and sent them away,” Ibrahimpatnam sub-inspector (SI) K Venkat Rao said. Raja Reddy narrated the incident to his cousin, P Raji Reddy, over the phone. Raji Reddy reached the spot and picked up an argument with Ramesh and his sons. “During the argument, Ramesh, his sons along with other relatives assaulted Raji Reddy on the head with a spade. Raji Reddy suffered severe head injury and he was declared brought dead at a hospital in Armoor,” the SI said. A murder case was registered against Ramesh, his sons and four others.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: New BJP entrant a prominent face of Sikh radical movement in 1980s||JALANDHAR: Bharatiya Janata Party inducted six ‘prominent’ Sikh personalities from Punjab in the party fold on Wednesday. In a journey of contrasts, one of these newly-elected members, Jalandhar resident Harinder Singh Kahlon headed All-India Sikh Students Federation and remained one of the most important over-ground leaders of the Sikh radical movement in 1985-86, joined the BJP on Wednesday. He and five other new entrants were welcomed into the party by senior BJP leaders, including Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Harinder Singh KahlonKahlon (above), for almost one-and-a-half years, was the central and most influential figure of the Sikh radical movement as the convener of AISSF, which held sway over thousands of Sikh students and worked overground even as some of its leaders worked underground. He faced a sedition case registered against him for his speech during Sarbat Khalsa held at Darbar Sahib (Golden Temple) on January 26, 1986. He faced other cases too but was later acquitted in all. He re-joined his job as a government school teacher from where he retired 12 years ago and then started practicing as a lawyer in Jalandhar district courts. After retirement, he remained senior vice-president of the district SAD (Badal) unit. On January 5, 2019, he joined SAD (Taksali) that merged with another faction led by Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa earlier this year. When questioned whether his joining BJP was in complete contrast to his politics of the 1980s, Kahlon said, “At the time, I was working for the community and state and have joined BJP for the same purpose. I have not joined to get anything but to engage with the ruling party and attempt to work out solutions for the farm movement as well as other issues. Already state and community have suffered a lot and the ongoing tussle between farmers and government can cause more damage and we need to find out solutions.” Answering a question about the common perception among Sikhs being that BJP was adverse to the Sikh community and its interests, he argued, “In that case, why they would end the ‘Black List’ of Sikhs or help to send culprits of the 1984 anti-Sikh massacre to jail. Even if we assume they are adversaries, then too we need to engage as even tenth Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh Ji did not shut his doors on engaging with his adversary – the Mughal emperor.” Kahlon became AISSF convener in September 1984, after its president Bhai Amrik Singh was killed in Operation Bluestar and other top leaders were arrested. He was at the centre of activity till June 1986 when he was arrested. Later, AISSF fragmented into quite a few factions. “I was already a teacher when circumstances after the Army attack on Darbar Sahib pushed me to the helm of AISSF in 1984. I was also pursuing studies at that time,” he said. BJP national spokesperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura, a former senior police officer in Punjab, played a crucial role in bringing these six Sikh faces into the BJP fold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-bjp-entrant-a-prominent-face-of-sikh-radical-movement-in-1980s/articleshow/83585735.cms||IP Singh

The number of active containment zones has reduced from 759 around eight days back to 407 on Wednesday. The city had around 1,600 active containment zones around a month back. However, there has been a huge drop in the new cases of Covid-19 cases over the past one-and-a-half months and has led to a drop in active containment zones. Medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) Bapusaheb Nagargoje said there was significant drop in the number of new cases during the last one-and-a-half months. The restrictions imposed by the state government and 12-day severe restrictions by the disaster management authority of the district have yielded good results. “Awareness about maintaining of Covid appropriate behaviour has also increased among people. This overall has led to a drop in new cases. Moreover, the Covid positivity rate also reduced to 2% during the past few days even though the number of tests being conducted every day are the same,” he said, The number of active patients has dropped from 28,000 on April 23 to 1,611 on Wednesday. The city recorded its first case of Covid-19 on April 6 last year and the first containment zone was declared in Govind Nagar area of the city. Since then, a total 36,792 containment zones have been drawn, out of which, 36,385 zones have been released so far. Now, the city has 407 active containment zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/46-drop-in-nashik-citys-containment-zone-count/articleshow/83580902.cms||Tushar Pawar

The state road transport department began issuing green registration number plates to the electric vehicles about two months ago. The state has so far registered 1,390 electric vehicles in 2021, of which 321 were registered at the RTO Ahmedabad with number plates bearing GJ-01. In 2020, the number of electric vehicles registered in Ahmedabad was 388 while there were only 195 in 2019. The state had 942 electric vehicles registered in 2020 and the number was only 498 in 2019. Officials said increasing petrol prices and the low cost of travel by electric vehicles had led to the increase in purchases. The government decision to subsidize electric two wheelers for students and electric cars have led to the increase. Officials said that electric cars on a single charge go 300-odd km and the charging time is about 60 minutes. An officer said that for a mid-segment car the running cost of an electric vehicle comes to Rs 1 per km, while it is Rs 9 for petrol, Rs 6 for diesel and Rs 2.5 per km on CNG. The officer said that with increasing fuel price and the running costs even lower than CNG, people are opting for electric vehicles. The officer said that so far registration of electric cars has only been observed in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara and the trend is yet to pick up in rural areas. The officer said that if the city gets more charging stations, registrations can increased three or fourfold in Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/evs-with-green-plates-get-more-common-on-city-roads/articleshow/83585746.cms||---

The ED arrested him on Tuesday in a Rs 512 crore money laundering case connected with the Karnala Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd fraud case. In the remand application, ED stated that Patil, chairman of the bank had renewed 65 suspicious non-performing assets (NPA) loan accounts for siphoning off the bank money.  In 2019-20, RBI had asked for an audit of the bank which showed that Patil was using these suspicious accounts since 2008. The money was allegedly diverted to two other entities controlled by Patil, Karnala Charitable Trust and Karnala Sports Academy. An ED source said these suspicious accounts turned into NPA earlier, but Patil renewed them to commit the fraud. The ED source said, “All transactions were done through proper bank channels to avoid scrutiny. But renewal of suspicious NPA accounts nailed Patil.

The district administration on Wednesday issued necessary orders while capping the footfall of tourists to only 1,000 in the first half of the day and equal number of visitors during the second half with strict adherence to Covid prevention norms. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan, in his capacity as the head of the District Disaster Management Authority, has also made it clear that religious places-cum-monuments including famous Grishneshwar Temple near Ellora will continue to remain closed. Milan Kumar Chauley , superintending archaeologist with Aurangabad circle of Archaeological Survey of India, said the district administration had initially permitted reopening of only Bibi-ka-Maqbara and Aurangabad Caves, but later conceded to the demand for reopening of all the monuments. “The cap on daily footfall of tourists has been implemented based upon the recommendation of the ASI. During earlier Covid-related curbs, 4,000 tourists were allowed daily at Ajanta-Ellora caves and 2,000 at other monuments. The upper limit on the total number of tourists has been made uniform to 2,000 now for all monuments,” he said. Chauley said no projections can be made about the arrival of foreign tourists considering the outbreak of Covid-19 was a worldwide health challenge. Earlier, heritage sites and monuments in Aurangabad district were reopened on December 7, 2020 after remaining closed for nearly nine months before being closed again on March 11 this year due to the second wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ajanta-ellora-other-dist-monuments-reopen-today/articleshow/83580976.cms||---

The meetings drew sharp reaction from Trinamool Congress, which alleged that the governor was violating constitutional norms and asked him not to return to the state. Dhankhar, who met Union ministers Pralhad Joshi and Prahlad Singh Patel, is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah during his two-day visit to Delhi. He is likely to brief them on the “deteriorating” law and order situation in Bengal.  Taking to Twitter, Dhankhar said: “Had useful interaction with Union minister of coal, mines and parliamentary affairs of India@JoshiPralhad on varied issues.” Later, in another tweet, he said: “Had useful deliberations with Union minister for culture, tourism Prahlad Singh Patel on issues pertaining to Victoria Memorial, Indian Museum and Asiatic Society aimed at enhancing the impact of these bodies.” Dhankhar also met chairman of National Human Rights Commission. He had written a letter to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday, urging her to react to the law and order situation in the state and restore the faith of the people in the state administration and police in general. “With a heavy heart, I am constrained to observe your continued silence and inaction over post-poll retributive bloodshed, violation of human rights, outrageous assault on the dignity of women, wanton destruction of property, the perpetuation of untold miseries on political opponents- worst since independence and it ill augurs for democracy,” he said in the letter. TMC spokesperson Sougata Ray lashed out at Dhankhar for allegedly violating constitutional norms and not taking the state government into confidence over various decisions and statements he has made in the recent past. “We have never seen such a governor who has no regard for the Constitution and its norms. He has been violating every constitutional norm,” he said. “Uncle ji going to Delhi on June 15th he says... Do us a favour governor Sahib — don’t come back,” tweeted TMC MP Mahua Moitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-governor-in-delhi-meets-central-ministers-nhrc-chief/articleshow/83591738.cms||---

---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay develops AI-based solutions for video analytics, surveillance||MUMBAI: Spotting every biker who travelled without a helmet in Mumbai in the last week may require the police control rooms to go through terabytes of video footage. But now, that data can be extracted in a short span of time not by deploying Israeli tech, but by using local solutions developed by IIT-Bombay. The Powai college has three state-of-the-art solutions for analyzing everything video and imagery. Even bigger, the heart of all these solutions, a core platform for enabling efficient learning has been made available as an open source platform that can help effectively label and smartly train on large data sets even in noisy Indian settings. This work is a result of industry collaboration between the National Center of Excellence in Technology at IIT-B and their industrial partner SrivisifAI Technologies Pvt Ltd, said IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri. Surakshavyuh is a solution for CCTV video analytics capable of real-time intrusion detection, perimeter monitoring, loitering detection, object tracking, face recognition and crowd counting. Second, Jigyasa is a video repository and search platform with features like text and face search. And the video summarization benchmark, Visiocity, facilitates domain-specific condensation of hours’ worth of video into a couple of minutes, by preserving key events and vignettes from the original video and removing repetitive visual information. Industry partner Srivisifai will take IIT-B’s work to the market. Surakshavyuh has already been installed at the Naval Dockyard Visakhapatnam and other locations. The solution has also been effectively used on the IIT-B campus during the pandemic for contact-tracing and maintaining physical distancing. “Presently, AI is not sufficiently democratized; it is an expensive exercise. Our solutions have data efficient machine learning for resource constrained environments such as in India. That is our effort to make sure the machine learning and AI required for our software— DECILE—can be democratized toward robust replication in different environments and as green (energy efficient) in computation as possible,” said professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan, institute chair professor, IIT-B and one of the lead researchers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-develops-ai-based-solutions-for-video-analytics-surveillance/articleshow/83590627.cms||Hemali Chhapia

While there are 24,143 autorickshaw permit holders under the Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO), so far, only 5,960 have claimed the benefit of the government aid. This number is less than 25% of the total autorickshaw permit holders. A release from the Nashik RTO said that the state government, at a meeting on April 19, had decided to provide the financial aid to auto-rickshaw drivers in view of the financial hardships they have been suffering due to the Covid restrictions. The autorickshaw owners can make the application on the state transport department’s website transport.maharashtra.gov.in. According to the RTO, the number of people who have made the application is very less and they have appealed to the autorickshaw owners to take benefit of the scheme. The release said that the process of making the application is very simple as after visiting the website, they should put their vehicle registration number, permit number and the Aadhaar number. If the Aadhaar number is linked to the bank account, the aid would be transferred to the bank account. The Nashik RTO has also requested many banks to help autorickshaw drivers in opening a zero-balance bank account and link their Aadhaar cards to the same. The release said the RTO officials have requested all the autorickshaw unions to help their members in making application for the financial aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rs-1500-govt-aid-finds-few-takers-among-autorickshaw-owners/articleshow/83581077.cms||Santosh Sonawane

PTA member Nikhil Gujre, who submitted a letter to the school management on Tuesday seeking the fee relaxation, said, “Due to the pandemic, people are facing financial difficulties; some have faced pay cuts while some have lost their jobs... In such a situation, the school should give us minimum of 30% fee concession along with some alternatives to help clear dues at a later stage or allowed us to pay monthly instalments instead of a lumpsum every quarter.”  Another parent Rupinder Murjani said, “The school has hiked the fees despite the government order issued during lockdown that no school can stop online schooling facility for children if their parents are unable to pay fees for some time.” Attempts were made to contact the school management for a comment. Murjani further said, "We understands that the school have their own struggles and that the school management requires funds to pay salaries to the staffs and maintain the upkeep of infrastructure, but other than the software, the students are hardly using any physical facilities of the school, which definitely would have reduced the school expenses. With the reduced outlay, the school authorities should give us fees concession up to 30%”.  Another parent said that if school management did not take back hiked fees decision and give us concession then we would hold a demonstration outside the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kalyan-institute-urged-to-relax-fees-by-30-amid-pandemic-in-mumbai/articleshow/83591318.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Mumbai||Name Navi Mum airport after JRD: Kin||MUMBAI: Amid the controversy over the naming of the greenfield airport at Navi Mumbai, a member of the Tata family has thrown in the hat for JRD Tata, who brought civil aviation to India. ``I respectfully suggest that the new airport at Navi Mumbai should be named after JRD Tata, the father of Indian aviation,’’ said Piloo Tata, a member of the Tata family. Piloo Tata is the widow of Minocher Tata, whose grandfather and Jamsetji Tata, founder of Tata group, were siblings. Last week, the state government announced its decision to name the Navi Mumbai airport after Shiv Sena founder late Bal Thackeray. On the other hand, project-affected locals have demanded that the airport be named after late D B Patil, the leader of Peasant and Workers Party (PWP). Into the foray is now the name of a candidate whose name is intertwined with Indian aviation history. Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata flew the historic 1932 inaugural flight, carrying airmail from Karachi's Drigh Road Aerodrome to Mumbai's Juhu aerodome aboard Tata Airlines. ``J R D Tata pioneered aviation in India, and was responsible for starting our national airline, first known as Tata Airlines, and then renamed Air India after it was nationalised. He headed Air India as its Chairman for decades with great passion. He put India on the international aviation and tourism map. I cannot think of any other name which would be more appropriate to be linked with our International Airport,’’ said Tata, speaking to TOI. ``In memory of this undisputed pioneer of civil aviation in India, and in appreciation of the international passenger airline he started, I appeal to the authorities concerned to name the new airport at Navi Mumbai, the 'J R D Tata International Airport'. He is the most deserving person for this honour. His name should be remembered and linked with Indian civil aviation for ever, " she said. Unlike India, most of the countries with aviation history dating back to the fledgling years in the first half of the twentieth century have airports named after their aviation pioneers. In the US, the birthplace of aviation there is a strong tradition of honoring aviation pioneers. California’s San Diego international airport is named after Charles Lindbergh, Dayton airport honors Wright brothers, Atchison-Kansas airport is named after Amelia Earhart. Some other examples are Milwaukee airport, named after William “Billy” Mitchell, an American military aviation pioneer, Chicago-O’Hare named after naval aviator Edward H. “Butch” O’Hare and Oklahoma airport named after Wiley Post, the first pilot to fly solo around the world. Among the examples in other countries are Sydney international airport which takes its name from Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, who operated the first trans-Pacific flight from US to Australia. Turkey’s Istanbul airport is named after Sabiha Gokcen, the first female Turkish fighter pilot. Lyon airport in France named after Antoine De Saint-Exupery, the pioneer of international postal flights. In India, not a single airport is named after an aviation pioneer. Airports largely honor former Prime Ministers, freedom fighters or historical figures. Among the airports named after prime ministers are the Delhi airport named after Indira Gandhi, Hyderabad (Rajiv Gandhi), Deoghar in Jharkhand named after Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Varanasi (Lal Bahadur Shastri) and Lucknow (Chaudhary Charan Singh). Those named after freedom fighters include Ahmedabad (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), Port Blair (Veer Savarkar), Patna (Jay Prakash Narayan), Kolkata (Subhash Chandra Bose), Nagpur (Dr B R Ambedkar), Ranchi (Birsa Munda). Among the airports named after historical figures are Mumbai (Chhatrapati Shivaji), Indore (Ahilyabai Holkar), Bengaluru (Kempe Gowda, who was a chieftain under the Vijayanagara Empire) and Jaipur (Maharana Pratap). Then there are some exceptions like the Durgapur airport in West Bengal which is named after Bengali poet, writer, musician Kazi Nazrul and the Srinagar airport is named after Kashmiri Sufi saint Sheikh Ul-Alam (Nund Rishi), Amritsar after saint Ramdas and Bhopal after Raja Bhoj of the Paramara dynasty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/name-navi-mum-airport-after-jrd-kin/articleshow/83621420.cms||Manju V

The ultimatum has come in wake of the number of new Covid cases again touching the three-digit mark in the rural areas of Aurangabad district — excluding the municipal limits. Addressing a review meeting, Chavan said organised measures can ensure effective check on the pandemic situation like in the Aurangabad city. “Covid-related curbs are partially lifted in rural areas of Aurangabad district. However, no desired drop in fresh cases of Covid-19 may lead to further spread of the pandemic, which we cannot afford at any cost. The district administration will officially appreciate commercial establishments undergoing cent per cent testing for Covid,” he said. Besides mandatory Covid testing, the district administration has also pressed for speeding up the vaccination process in rural areas. Rural areas of Aurangabad district on Tuesday reported 100 fresh cases of Covid-19, whereas municipal limits of Aurangabad registered only 20 cases.

---||Lucknow||Teaching posts: Lucknow University cancels hiring advertisement, to issue fresh one||LUCKNOW: Lucknow University has decided to cancel the advertisement for recruitment on 180 vacant posts of teachers published on September 16 last year and will re-advertise the posts soon. Now, the selections will be done as per the new selection guidelines issued by the chancellor of state universities and UP governor Anandiben Patel. The move has come as a disappointment for 5,024 candidates who had applied for the vacant posts and were waiting desperately for nine months for the recruitment to begin. However, the relief for such candidates who had applied and paid Rs 1,500 as registration fee is that they will not have to apply again. The vacancies in LU include that of assistant professors, associate professors and professors. The highest number of vacancies and applications have come for assistant professors. The decision also means that students will have to wait at least for six more months before the selection process is complete and the teacher taught ratio in LU comes on a par with the UGC prescribed 1:20. Of the 516 permanent teaching posts in LU, 180 are lying vacant. At present, there are 17,054 students in LU and the teacher-student ratio is 1:39. The move will also derail LU’s plans of reassessment by the National Accreditation and Assessment Council (NAAC). In the past assessment, LU got a B grade mainly because many teachers’ posts were lying vacant. As a result, the university had decided to first fill all the vacant posts and then go for NAAC assessment to get a better grade. “We decided to re-advertise the posts because the selection process at all levels has changed,” said LU vice-chancellor Prof AK Rai. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “After the LU executive council adopted the new rules, it was decided to issue the advertisement again for the vacant posts of assistant professors, associate professors and professor. The window in LU’s recruitment portal to submit applications will be opened for some time, during which more candidates can apply. Candidates who applied earlier will not have to apply again. They will get an opportunity to update their achievements such as the publication of new research papers.” According to the new rules, an applicant for the post of the assistant professor will have to clear three rounds: a scrutiny based on academic performance index (API), a written test and a classroom presentation and finally interview. The criterion of API calculation has also been changed. Earlier, selection at entry level was based on API and interview. The selection rules for associate professor and professor have also been changed slightly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teaching-posts-lu-cancels-hiring-advertisement-to-issue-fresh-one/articleshow/83588472.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Contractor made to sit on flooded road hospitalised||MUMBAI: The civic nullah cleaning contractor who was forced to sit on a waterlogged road on Sunday for not doing his job properly and had garbage dumped on him by supporters of Shiv Sena MLA Dilip Lande was admitted in hospital following complaints of chest pain, breathing difficulty, vomiting and headache. The contractor, identified as Narpath Kumar Purohit (26), was admitted to Borivali’s Mohit Hospital on Monday morning, but he reportedly left the hospital for his hometown in Rajasthan on Tuesday. The hospital case papers revealed that Purohit complained of chest pain and nausea at the time of admission. The BJP has asked the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) to intervene and take action against Lande, an MLA from Chandivali. “This is a violation of human rights. The contractor was treated in an inhuman way. The Shiv Sena has not acted against the MLA. The SHRC must issue a notice to Lande and all agencies concerned, including the BMC. It is shocking that neither the police nor the BMC have taken any action yet,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. Mishra alleged that the Sena had put pressure on the contractor and his company and asked them to refrain from filing an FIR against Lande. “It is clear that the Sena actually got him out of the hospital and forced him to leave the city. Both the victim and the company have been threatened by the Sena. But everyone has seen the video and the SHRC and police must take suo moto action,” Mishra said. Officials said Purohit was a supervisor with a civil engineering firm which was carrying out nullah cleaning work for a BMC contractor. Mishra said Sena had forced the victim and the firm to write to the Ghatkopar police saying they have no complaint against Lande. “I was trying to call him for two hours but he did not come. So, I took him there to show him his responsibility,” Lande had said after the incident. Lande did not respond to calls and messages from TOI on Wednesday. Purohit could not be reached for comment too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-contractor-made-to-sit-on-flooded-road-hospitalised/articleshow/83590728.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||India||Remove vitamin A from national supplement policy: Experts||HYDERABAD: Nutrition experts have called for a policy change at the national level on vitamin A supplementation, stating that vitamin A deficiencies in children are no longer a public health problem in India.  They argued that vitamin A supplementation may lead to excess dosage of vitamin A or hypervitaminosis. Researchers from the city-based National Institute of Nutrition, St John’s Research Institute, Bangalore, and Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research, New Delhi, warned of a possible risk of hypervitaminosis. In their study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers evaluated whether vitamin A deficiencies still presented a serious public health problem among children below five years of age. The study suggests that the national prevalence of vitamin A deficiency risk is below 20% in children in India. “It’s high time the mega-dose of vitamin A is revised and a targeted state-based vitamin A supplementation program was taken up, ” it says. The study drew on the sample of the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey which was conducted in 30 states during 2016-2018, said NIN director Hemalatha R. “The survey showed that vitamin A deficiency based on serum retinol levels was 15.7% among 1-5-year-old children across India, lesser than the 20% mark that defines a serious public health problem”, she said. There were few kids (as low as 0.4%) with low serum retinol values at which serious clinical problems are likely to manifest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/remove-vitamin-a-from-national-supplement-policy-experts/articleshow/83591856.cms||Syed Akbar

Aditya Jain was hospitalised with gunshot injuries on his hand. Doctors said his condition was stable and that he was undergoing treatment. A native of Pali district, he washed cars at apartments in Gandhi Path and adjoining localities. According to DCP (Jaipur West) Pradeep Mohan Sharma, the shooting took place shortly after 9.30am when Jain was cleaning a car outside an apartment. Two persons on a bike came near him and fired multiple rounds. The first shot tore through the rear window of a car as Jain ducked for cover. Preliminary investigation based on eyewitness accounts revealed that one of the shooters took another shot at Jain in quick succession. This time, the bullet hit Jain’s hand, he fell on the road and tried to crawl away from the suspects. He darted across the street into a nearby shop, leaving a trail of blood along the street and on cars parked nearby. The shooting left Jain dazed even as blood was streaming from his hand. Shuddered by gunshots, the residents of the entire posh locality of Gandhi Path scurried indoors. Karni Vihar police arrived at the scene and found empty cartridges from the spot. Curious onlookers and residents were seen milling around cars splattered with blood and shredded glass of windows strewn around. According to DCP (Crime) Digant Anand, the shooting is suspected to be a result of some prolonged enmity. “The victim has been admitted to a hospital but he does not have any fatal injuries. There was no motive of looting or robbery; neither has it appeared to be an attack for gain. Prima facie it appears to be a case of some enmity,” he said. DCP Anand told TOI that Jain had been working in the city as a car washer. He was employed by local residents to clean their cars every morning. “The victim (Jain) said he had returned to Jaipur about eight months ago from Mumbai, where he worked in the food industry,” he said, adding that Jain’s family runs a tiffin centre and cleans cars as a part-time job. “The shots were fired from some illegal pistol. We have examined the crime scene and the probe is underway,” DCP Anand informed TOI. Police teams fanned out in multiple areas as soon as the news of the shooting broke. A video that emerged soon after the incident, retrieved from a nearby CCTV, showed the two accused on a bike wearing helmets, masks and caps along with a bag. Talking to TOI, Karni Vihar SHO Jai Singh said the police were continuing to follow up on leads for suspects. “The accused are at large, but we will be able to identify them soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/car-washer-shot-at-by-maskedmen-near-gandhi-path-survives/articleshow/83588492.cms||---

While some are getting ready to arrange extra kiosks to help spot registration, some said they will wait for a clear guideline. But many private CVCs said that prior self-registration and booking of slots in advance was enabling better crowd management while reducing the turnaround time for a vaccine recipient. “We have added three more counters at our three hospital vaccination sites to help people in walk-in registration. But we will still request people to register themselves and come as this will reduce their waiting time and ensure less crowd,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east), Narayana Health. All CVCs had introduced walk-in registration facilities when the inoculation drive for the 60 plus age group was launched to facilitate the elderly people. “We did not have a single person who turned up at our CVC without pre-registration on Wednesday. But we will try not to turn away if someone comes without being registered. We will help in the registration. Coming with prior appointment is always a better option,” said Peerless CEO, Sudipta Mitra. At Belle Vue, out of 700 people who got their doses on Wednesday, around 500 were registered on the spot. “Some people are not net savvy at all. So leaving room for on spot registration will help these people,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO Belle Vue. Many private CVCs are already rationing their daily doses with the uncertainty of the supply chain shift from June 21 onwards when they will start getting supply from the state government instead of the manufacturers. They feel that many turning up without prior booking may result in chaos. “Pre-registration and prior slot booking streamlines the process of dispensing the doses as people don’t have to stand in queues and it reduces the waiting period. We are, however, helping a few in on-spot registration,” said Rupali Basu, managing director, Woodlands. “The 18-44 group is largely techsavvy. Over 90% of them drop in at our CVC after prior registration. So, our team will help them getting the registration done,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO, CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. On Wednesday the number of doses administered in the state dipped to around 1,17,000. On Tuesday, it was close to 2,40,000. Health officials said the Jamai Sasthi festival could be one of the causes behind this drop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-vaccine-units-yet-to-get-guideline-on-pre-bookings/articleshow/83586022.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Nataraj was booked under several sections of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act. Nataraj had successfully contested from Kangeyam assembly constituency in 2011. Defying Covid-19 protocols, Nataraj kept his mill open during the lockdown period. On June 5, revenue department officials sealed the mill. On Tuesday evening, however, Nataraj and his workers removed the seal and operated the mill. Alampadi village administrative officer Sudhakar alerted the Kangeyam police who came to the spot and closed the mill again. The Kangeyam police registered a case against Nataraj on Wednesday. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ex-aiadmk-mla-violates-covid-19-norms-booked/articleshow/83586014.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier, a team comprising forest officials and veterinarians was formed to capture the tusker by darting it with sedatives and put the animal in a kraal to provide medication. However, there was no need to tranquilize the tusker, as the team, which comprised 30 forest field staff, succeeded in restraining the elephant at Puttur Vayal near Marthoma Nagar at Gudalur on the day. “The tusker didn’t show any sign of resentment. It’s condition seems to have aggravated. There is a swelling around the wound on its back. The kumkis that were brought from Theppakadu elephant camp in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve played a major role in the operation,” said a forest officer. I Anwardeen, additional principal chief conservator of forests, said the tusker might have fallen down a few days ago, injuring the left hind limb. “Hence, its movement was limited.” He said a team of seven veterinarians and a microbiologist was attending to the animal. “The wound seems to be very deep. We are providing proper medication to the elephant.” The officer said the pachyderm would be moved to the kraal that was set up at Abhiyaranyam in the MTR on Thursday. “The elephant will be retained at Puttur Vayal, which is a difficult terrain, on Wednesday night. Incessant rain is lashing Gudalur area as well. We need to develop a pathway for the truck to reach the Abhiyaranyam, which is some 6km away.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wounded-wild-tusker-gets-medical-help/articleshow/83586050.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: RAT tests increase to 60% in state to cover rural areas||Pune: Rapid antigen tests (RATs) now comprise nearly 60% of all Covid-19 tests done in Maharashtra while the share of the gold standard RT-PCR test has dropped to about 40%. Dr Pradeep Awate, the state surveillance expert, said rapid antigen testing had been increased to cover hot spots in rural areas, where the reach of laboratories was limited.The RAT has a faster process than the RT-PCR, which has a turnaround time of 24 hours. The ICMR’s approval for home test kits helped augment antigen testing.According to the recent Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, the aim is to widen testing in the interiors and rural areas during the second wave. The ICMR advocates antigen tests in hot spots to test and segregate early. If symptomatic patients test negative, they are referred for RT-PCR tests.On Wednesday, the state registered 42% RT-PCR tests and 58% RATs. Of the 2.22 lakh tests carried out, 1.28 lakh were antigen tests and 93,000 were RT-PCR tests. Over 80% tests are being carried out using RAT kits in several districts, said a health official. Echoing him, Awate said, “Many districts have registered more antigen tests than RT-PCR tests.”According to a report, Amravati (84%), Bhandara (91%) and Gadchiroli (87%) have registered the highest proportion of RATs. Reason: hot spots in these areas have been identified and antigen tests are being conducted on close contacts of Covid-positive patients. “Our main aim is to conduct RATs and isolate high-risk and low-risk contacts to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” said a health official.In metros, the RT-PCR test remains the key to detect Covid patients. In Pune district, more RT-PCR tests (56%) were conducted than RATs (44%). Mumbai registered only 20% antigen tests and Nagpur about 21%. ICMR officials said the way forward was to cover larger populations and focus on early detection as they had cleared three home-based RAT kits. With the state carrying out a district-wise unlocking process through five levels, antigen tests have to be monitored thoroughly.Public health expert Dr Giridhara Babu told TOI while ICMR guidelines allowed for more RATs to enable more testing with faster turnaround, it should be limited to those with symptoms or those in the high-risk or low-risk categories of those testing positive.“In the presence of symptoms, RAT has high sensitivity. So only if symptomatic patients test negative on RAT, RT-PCR can be done. In the absence of symptoms, RT-PCR continues to be the gold standard. In the absence of symptoms, use of RAT should be checked because there could be a possibility of states carrying out a lot of RATs to show more numbers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-rat-tests-increase-to-60-in-state-to-cover-rural-areas/articleshow/83588558.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Agra||TOI Impact: Aid pours in for struggling Agra widow from viral image||AGRA: When the image of the woman administering CPR to her dying husband in a desperate attempt to save him was shared widely in April, no one knew how to reach her. A day since TOI’s report tracing Renu Singhal, 43, and relating her plight, aid has been pouring in. The mayor has offered to get her documents in order and ensure monthly assistance, a retired bureaucrat wants to cover her daughter’s education, a shoe exporters' body president has said he will cover their expenses till the government benefits work out, and a number of kind strangers have reached out asking what they could do for the grieving widow. “I will ensure the child (Renu’s daughter Bhumi, 16) doesn’t face any problem with her education. The family will get a ration card, an Ayushman Bharat card and benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. They will also get monthly monetary assistance under government schemes,” Agra mayor Naveen Jain said. Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh added, “Help will be provided to the family. We will ensure the girl, who has lost her father, does not suffer. I have asked the district probation officer to provide help to the widow and her daughter under government schemes. If they face any inconvenience, they can contact me directly.” On April 23, Renu had taken her husband, Ravi, to four hospitals after he developed a breathing problem and then turned serious — all the hospitals denied him admission. After stepping out of the fourth hospital she had tried her luck at, she found her husband had fallen unconscious. While she was desperately trying to resuscitate him, a passerby took a photo, which was shared on social media. When TOI traced her on June 15, she said she had been struggling, with no help, living in penury she saw no way out of. Her story seems to have touched people’s hearts. Several organisations and TOI readers have asked for Renu’s information so they can help. Retired home ministry official and visiting professor at the Delhi Technological University, CS Arora, got in touch with TOI as well. “My family and I want to do something for the child. I would be happy to bear all expenses for her education, including coaching, up to the level she wants to pursue,” he said. Others have offered to help them till they get government aid and to navigate the process. “Till the government arranges help for her, we have planned to provide them with Rs 10,000 a month. I have spoken to the family and promised to do whatever we can to see them through this tough time,” said Puran Dawar, president of Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Chamber. Child rights activist Naresh Paras added, “I will help the family apply for benefits under government schemes. Ravi Singhal was the sole earning member in the family and died during the pandemic. Their daughter is eligible for the recently launched Mukhya Mantri Bal Seva Yojana. His wife should get a widows' pension. I will get the application process completed soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/toi-impact-aid-pours-in-for-struggling-agra-widow-from-viral-image/articleshow/83583888.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Aurangabad||Pritam Munde’s name makes round for ministerial berth in Maharashtra||AURANGABAD: The name of BJP MP Pritam Munde from Beed is making rounds for the ministerial berth amid the proposed likely expansion or reshuffle of the Union cabinet, sparking enthusiasm among a section of party workers in the region. After Pritam’s elder sister Pankaja Munde lost the 2019 assembly polls, unrest was seen among the supporters of the Munde family, which enjoys support from a section of other backward class (OBC) community in Marathwada. A qualified MBBS doctor and daughter of late BJP leader Gopinath Munde, Pritam is representing Beed Lok Sabha constituency for the second term. BJP spokesperson Shirish Boralkar said Marathwada getting another ministerial berth would benefit the region. “Different speculations make rounds whenever the cabinet expansion takes place. However, it is up to the party brass to take a call on final names to be inducted,” he said. Krishna Beedkar, a BJP worker, said the Munde sisters did not get due representation at the state and central level after the demise of Gopinath Munde. “After 2014 assembly elections, we were hoping that Pankaj tai would become the chief minister or deputy chief minister, which did not happen. We smell foul play in her defeat during the last assembly elections. Pritam tai had won her first LS election with a historic margin and secured the second term. Considering her stature, she must become a member of the Union cabinet,” he said. Former chief minister and Rajya Sabha member Narayan Rane is also being projected as one of the contenders. Rane, who is taking Shiv Sena head-on since the formation of MVA government, has a stronghold in the Konkan region. Among other leaders, Rajya Sabha member of BJP Udayanraje Bhosale, also figured in the list of possible leaders for a ministerial berth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pritam-mundes-name-makes-round-for-ministerial-berth/articleshow/83581343.cms||---

The structure of the new UG courses was finalised by LU on Tuesday. An online meeting of deans of faculties and heads of departments to draft the syllabi was held on Wednesday. The new syllabi is expected to be finalised by the end of June so that all approvals can be taken before the new session starts in September, said teachers who attended the meeting. The syllabi will be discussed and approved by the board of studies of every department. Next, it will be placed for approval in the board of the faculty of the department concerned. Finally, the syllabi will be put before the academic council, the apex academic body of LU, for approval. Once approved at all levels, the new four-year UG structure, along with the syllabi, will be implemented in LU and 524 affiliated colleges in Lucknow and four districts: Rae Bareli, Hardoi, Sitapur and Lakhimpur Kheri. More than 2 lakh students will benefit from the decision. “While making the course content, we will ensure employability at every step so that even if the student leaves the course midway, she/he can get employment opportunities after exit,” said a dean. “A letter has been sent to all department to make syllabi in accordance with NEP,” said LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivasatava Teachers said since LU is an autonomous institution it is not bound to accept the syllabi recommended by the government. Instead, it can have its syllabi focussing on its strength and regional needs as recommended in the NEP 2020. Focus on interdisciplinary learning:The four-year UG structure will comprise eight semesters. Besides two major and a minor subject, the new syllabi will include vocational and co-curricular subjects. The major subject will be of the particular stream – art, science and commerce – and the minor from another stream to promote interdisciplinary learning. Vocational subjects will be employment-oriented. The fifth semester will have a compulsory provision of internship for hands-on-training. The last two semesters will be dedicated to research and specialisation on the core subject.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teachers-begin-brainstorming-on-new-syllabi-for-ug-courses/articleshow/83588528.cms||---

As postal delivery of Aadhaar remains an issue for many citizens, the readily available e-Aadhaar is being rampantly used for much official work. RTO authorities said the official portal ‘Parivahan’ will show an error ‘Relative name not found in Aadhaar data’ in case such validation has not been carried out. “The validation of signature in e-Aadhaar is a must to proceed with the registration to get the learner’s license test from home. The initiative of getting learner’s license is a newly introduced reform and a section of citizens may feel teething problems associated with it,” said Sanjay Metrewar, regional transport officer, Aurangabad. “A question mark is printed on e-Aadhaar cards with a message — ‘Signature not verified’ — if necessary validation is not carried out. The desired formality can be completed by citizens on their own or by visiting the nearest Aadhaar centres,” Jai Patil, in charge of the local civic body run the Aadhaar centre said. As regards learners license, RTO authorities said the Parivahan portal needs confidential information including biometric details of the applicant and such data is refused by the UIDAI server in case the signature is non-validated. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/licence-process-hit-by-aadhaar-signature-non-validation/articleshow/83581326.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Kochi||Court orders registration of case against Surendran||Kozhikode: Kalpetta Judicial first class magistrate court has directed registering a case against BJP state president K Surendran in connection with the allegations that he gave money to Janathipathya Rashtreeya Party (JRP) chairperson C K Janu to contest as an NDA candidate from Sulthan Bathery constituency in the assembly polls. The order was passed on a petition filed by Muslim Students Federation (MSF) state president P K Navas. The complainant had urged the court to direct the Sulthan Bathery station house officer to register a case under IPC sections 171 E (punishment for bribery) and 171 F (punishment for undue influence or personation in elections) read with 34 against Surendran and Janu in the wake of allegations that he had paid a total of Rs 50 lakh to Janu in two instances to field her as NDA candidate under Lotus symbol from the constituency. The complainant had sought registering the case following allegations raised by JRP state treasurer Praseeda Azhikode that Surendran paid Janu Rs 10 lakh at a hotel in Thiruvananthapuram on March 7 and also on the basis of allegations by JRP state secretary Babu BC that another Rs 40 lakh was paid to her on April 3 in Wayanad. Advocate P E Sajal who represented the complainant said that the court has directed the Sulthan Bathery SHO to register case against both Surendran and Janu under the two Sections. He said a complaint in this regard was filed before the state police chief on June 3 and though it was forwarded to Wayanad district police chief and Sulthan Bathery deputy superintendent of police, no action had been initiated following which a petition was moved in the court raising the demand. Praseeda had released a series of audio clips of telephone conversations between Surendran and her to substantiate her allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/court-orders-registration-of-case-against-surendran/articleshow/83586084.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vaccination proof checks, rain lead to low turnout of morning walkers at parks, lakes in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Intermittent drizzle and vaccination certificate checks at the entrance proved to be a spoiler as parks and lakes in the city opened up for three hours in the morning on Wednesday. Only a handful took the opportunity to resume their exercise regimen in the open. At Rabindra Sarobar — where usually a few thousands walk in the morning — less than two dozen people turned up. The scene was no different at the other city parks and squares including Deshbandhu Park, Hedua and College Square in the north, Park Circus, Maddox Square, Deshapriya Park and Vivekananda Park in the south and Subhas Sarobar, Salt Lake Central Park and New Town Eco Park in the east. In addition to security guards, police were present at some entrances of Rabindra Sarobar to assist the guards in conducting the vaccination certificate checks. But with so few turning up on day-one, there was no problem as some had anticipated. IT industry employee and birder Sudip Ghosh, who lives on Southern Avenue and took a stroll when the drizzle stopped for a while, said he had never seen so few turn up at the Lake. “Even when it rains, much more turn up than they did on Wednesday. I saw at least one person being turned away at the gate for failing to produce a vaccination certificate. I managed to see a bronze-winged jacana for the first time at the Lake,” said Ghosh. Those who had come with certificates were happy to go through the checking as it would encourage others to get the jab. While, some felt mandatory vaccination would have been more appropriate in closed environments like malls and restaurants. K Rajagopal was among a few who had turned up without the certificate and was denied entry at Rabindra Sarobar. “I have taken the vaccine but had not downloaded the certificates. I will do so and get them with me on next time. But I feel this isn’t really needed in a vast open place. Carrying out thermal checks may be more practical,” he said. At Deshbandhu Park teenagers were allowed to enter as the turnout was low. IT professional Samiran Nandi, who takes walks at the Central Park, did not step out due to the rain. “The low turnout was due to the adverse weather. Very few turned up, so no one was stopped from entering,” said a KMC parks department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-proof-checks-rain-lead-to-low-turnout-of-morning-walkers-at-parks-lakes/articleshow/83586090.cms||Amit Moulick
---||Kolkata||Govt cancels orders to vaccine firms||Kolkata: The state government has decided to cancel the order of 22 lakh vaccine doses that it had ordered from the two manufacturers, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech. The move came after the Centre decided to supply free vaccine to all states from June 21 onwards. The state had placed an additional order for 22 lakh doses in June, for which Rs 70 lakh had been paid in advance to the two manufacturers. This lot was meant to inoculate people in the 18-44 age group at the government-run health facilities. But with the Prime Minister announcing free vaccine, sources at Swasthya Bhawan said that the state would no longer need to purchase the vaccine on its own. “The state already purchased 18 lakh doses in May directly from the manufacturers and these doses are being used for the 18-44 age group. The 22 lakh doses were ordered before the policy change was announced,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. The state has asked the manufacturers to refund the amount. “We have been informed verbally from Union health ministry officials that we would get 41 lakh doses by June end,” said a health department official. Till Wednesday about 39,60,750 doses have been administered in the 18-44 group in Bengal, of which 7,39,530 doses are from Covid vaccination centres in Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-cancels-orders-to-vaccine-firms/articleshow/83586077.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Nagpur||Olive Ridley turtles’ nests go up in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: The conservation efforts by the Maharashtra forest department in collaboration with local NGOs have led to increase in the nests of Olive Ridley turtles in three coastal districts of Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Raigad. “From 233 in 2019, the nests of this turtle species have doubled to 475 in 2021 in all three districts. This led to more turtle hatchlings being released back to the sea this year (2020-21) compared to the last two years,” says APCCF Virendra Tiwari, who heads Mangrove Conservation Cell, Mumbai. “Olive Ridley turtles nest sporadically on the beaches of these three districts. In the past there were major threats to the nests of these turtles due to poaching, predation of hatchlings by dogs and other animals etc,” he says. The Olive Ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) is the only species that nests along the coast of Maharashtra. On some occasions, Green Sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), and Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) have been known to get stranded on some beaches of Maharashtra or get entangled into fishing nets but nesting of these turtles is presently not known from any coastal locality in Maharashtra. “The state forest department in collaboration with local NGO Sahayadri Nisarg Mitra and local communities has been working since 2002-03 for the conservation of the sea turtles along the coast. It has established a network of hatcheries to conserve the sea turtles,” says Tiwari. Since 2006, turtle festivals have also been organized in some villages such as Velas and later on in Anjarle (Ratnagiri), where tourists come to see the release of the turtle hatchlings back to the sea. The sea turtle conservation programme being carried out by the forest department along with the local communities and NGOs includes locating Olive Ridley turtle nesting sites, excavation and relocation of eggs to the hatchery site. The hatchery is covered with a garden fencing net for protecting eggs from predators, flooding and poaching. Subsequently, the turtle hatchlings coming out of these nests are released safely to the sea by the local beach managers. “Since 2018, the Mangrove Cell and Mangrove Foundation have carried out awareness programmes in the coastal districts of Maharashtra for local beach staff regarding managing the turtle hatchery sites, locating and relocating of turtle nests etc,” says Tiwari. From 2019-20, the Mangrove Foundation has made provision for the funds through which the honorarium of the local beach managers is paid in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. The Mangrove Cell and the state fisheries department have also started a joint compensation scheme under which fishermen, who release marine protected animals such as sea turtles, cetaceans that are entangled in their fishing net by cutting the net, are given monetary compensation up to Rs25,000. “Till now under the said scheme 96 Olive Ridley sea turtles, 52 Green Sea turtles, 3 Hawksbill sea turtles and one Leatherback sea turtle have been rescued and released back to the sea by fishermen for which compensation of Rs 22.50 lakh has been given to fishermen by the Mangrove Foundation,” says Tiwari. Since 2011, NGO Wildlife Conservation & Animal Welfare Association (WCAWA) and the forest department (Dahanu) have been running the turtle treatment and transit centre at Dahanu in Palghar where sea turtles that are injured or stranded on the beaches are treated, rehabilitated, and if possible released back to the sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/olive-ridley-turtles-nests-go-up-in-maha/articleshow/83585851.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Sambhajiraje, along with several other Maratha activists, sat on silent sit-in protest at the Shahu Samadhi Sthal in Kolhapur on Wednesday. His father and head of the Kolhapur royal family, Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj, and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar were by his side. Ministers Satej Patil, Hasan Mushrif and Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar along with all MPs and MLAs from the district showed up in support. Patil and Mushrif invited Sambhajiraje to discuss the issues with the government. Patil said, “The government is positive on all the demands. We have spoken with the CM. He has assured us that all demands will be met. I am ready to take Sambhajiraje to the CM on Thursday.” Sambhajiraje responded by saying that he was ready to talk with the government, but not on Thursday. “I have to discuss the matter with the Sakal Maratha Samaj activists. We will meet the CM soon, but need some time to study the demands further.” Sambhajiraje added that if the government approves the demands, then there will be no more protests at other places. The demands include provision of benefits to students and youths from the community in education and business. Sambhajiraje has sought hostels for Maratha youths at every district headquarters and funds for the SARTHI institute. He had earlier said that if the SARTHI institute is made strong, then it will help the community in more ways than what the reservation could. Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj reiterated that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes up his mind, the Maratha community can get the reservation. “We need to convince the Centre. The PM can give reservation as he has a majority. We need an amendment to extend the scope of the reservation. The cap of 50% should be done away with.” Ambedkar, who remained silent during the protest, later said that he supports the demands. “After the 102nd amendment, the states have no authority to grant reservations. Only the central government can now grant reservations,” said Ambedkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sambhajiraje-to-accompany-sakal-maratha-samaj-team-to-meet-cm/articleshow/83581394.cms||---

Now those connected to the tourism industry are hoping for a reversal in their fortunes, which were hit with a whopping drop of 84 per cent in tourist footfall in UP in 2020. In Agra, the footfall dipped by 75 per cent, as the three world heritage sites remained closed for almost nine months since the pandemic broke out last year. According to UP’s tourism department statistics, the state received 8.70 crore tourists in 2020, including 8.90 lakh foreign nationals, as compared to the 54.06 crore in 2019. About 47.45 lakh foreigners had visited the state that year.According to UP’s tourism department statistics, the state received 8.70 crore tourists in 2020, including 8.90 lakh foreign nationals, as compared to the 54.06 crore in 2019. About 47.45 lakh foreigners had visited the state that year. Agra was the worst-affected as footfall was lowest ever in its recent history. “We don’t see a rosy picture for the tourism industry in near future as the vaccination drive in the country is under tremendous pressure and achieving herd immunity seems a distant dream,” says Tourism Guild Agra vice president, Rajiv Saxena.While in 2019, 1.08 crore tourists, including 16.80 lakh foreigners visited the city, the numbers came down to 26.97 lakh, including 4.47 lakh foreigners, in 2020. After Agra, the Prime Minister’s constituency of Varanasi gets the most foreign tourists in Uttar Pradesh. But it also saw a huge dip from 3.5 lakh in 2019 to 1.06 lakh last year. Vice president (operations) Jaypee Palace hotel and Convention Centre, Agra, Hari Sukumar, said, “The hospitality sector has suffered massive revenue losses. We are in fact fighting for our survival and it’s sad that there has been absolutely no support from the state and central governments.” He said Agra alone has seen a loss of over Rs 800 crore in revenue between the two lockdowns and over 5,500 people have lost their jobs in the hospitality sector alone. According to ASI officials, a total 1,919 tourists including 67 children visited Taj Mahal on Wednesday. However, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri recorded very low footfall as only 221 and 75 tourists visited the monuments respectively on the first day of re-opening.“We don’t see a rosy picture for the tourism industry in near future as the vaccination drive in the country is under tremendous pressure and achieving herd immunity seems a distant dream,” says Tourism Guild Agra vice president, Rajiv Saxena.

---||Hyderabad||Why no criminal case against contractor: Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday sought to know from the state government and its medical and health department authorities as to why they did not register a criminal case against an errant diet contractor at the state-run Niloufer children’s hospital despite conclusive evidence about his swindling. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by Dr P Bhagavantha Rao seeking action against constractor Koduri Suresh Babu, who was supposed to supply food to the children admitted in the hospital. After widespread allegations against the contractor, the government conducted an inquiry against him, which found him guilty of swindling hospital funds of Rs 1.13 crore and sought its recovery from him. The government also launched proceedings to recover the money from him. Petitioner’s counsel Bommineni Vivekananda urged the court to ensure registering of a criminal case against the contractor because the government inquiry itself had established the wrong-doing on the part of the contractor. The bench too questioned the government as to why it had confined itself to a civil action and not initiate a criminal action. “It seems your own officials are shielding him,” the bench said. The petitioner’s counsel said that the authorities gave diet contracts of Gandhi and Chest hospitals also to the same contractor. The bench, however, declined to pass any orders in respect of those hospital contracts because there was no evidence or inquiry as it was in the case of Niloufer Hospital. “Since he is not blacklisted by the government so far, we cannot interfere in such contracts now,” the bench said. However, the bench sought an answer from the government on the criminal action to be taken against the contractor for his misdeeds in Niloufer. The bench refused to hear the petition of the contractor questioning the state action. “His petition should go to a single judge, let him go there and argue his case,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/why-no-criminal-case-against-contractor-hc/articleshow/83586087.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

According to the VMRDA officials, these plans would be on display on the VMRDA website and at the offices of VMRDA, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, Vizianagaram municipality and other key offices falling under the limits of the VMRDA for the next one month to receive objections and suggestions from the public. Any person, residing in the VMRDA development area, can send their opinions to the e-mail address vmrdamp2041@gmail.com or in person/by post to the Metropolitan Commissioner, VMRDA on or before July 15. The master plan outlines a development vision of the VMRDA and its planning framework for the future, including housing strategies, conservation zones, industrial development plans, transportation plan, public amenities, and the like. VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said that the public can submit their objections and suggestions on the draft master plan and draft perspective plan on or before July 15. “The draft plans would be in the public domain for a month. The map depicting various land uses may be inspected at the VMRDA office and others,” said Koteswara Rao. Koteswara Rao added that all the inputs received from the public during this one month would be referred to an expert committee to check their validity and incorporate the worthwhile in the final master plan. A private agency has been entrusted with the responsibility of master plan and zonal development plans for VMRDA-2041 . The master plan works were commenced in August 2016, which were originally scheduled to be concluded in two years, August 2018. According to the VMRDA officials, they procured latest satellite imagery instead of 2012-based imageries as per the then Vuda Board directions, which delayed the master plan process. Later, the Covid-19 has also affected the process. After the state government notified its ‘development area’ in 2018, the VMRDA has also embarked on the preparation of a ‘Perspective Plan’ apart from its then ongoing exercise for the master plan. While the master plan acts as a sectoral plan covering zoning, industrial development plans, etc., the perspective plan is a strategic plan providing sector-wise goals, policies, strategies, etc. in line with the government policies for the spacio-economic development of the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vmrda-readies-draft-master-plan-for-2041/articleshow/83583938.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Kochi||SIT to augment cases by invoking PDPP, Biodiversity and Land Conservancy Acts||Kozhikode: In a bid to act tough against the accused involved in the illegal tree felling cases, the multi-agency special investigation team (SIT) will strengthen the case by invoking additional sections involving Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act, Kerala Land Conservancy Act and Biodiversity (BD) Act against the accused in Muttil tree felling scam. The relevant, new sections will be invoked by police and forest departments in cases registered by them in addition to the IPC sections slapped by police for theft and cheating. Sources said that Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, will also be slapped if tribesmen, who have been duped by the accused, give statements in support of it. While forest department has registered 42 cases in connection with Muttil tree felling under Forest Act in the district, BD Act will also be slapped in those cases while police has registered a total of three cases in connection with illegal tree felling. Forest department officers said that BD Act was being invoked as rosewood was a protected species and it was illegal to fell and transport it. This is punishable under section 7 and 24 of the Act dealing with obtaining biological resources for commercial utilization. Meanwhile, Crime Branch ADGP S Sreejith, who heads the SIT, and other top officers reached Wayanad on Wednesday and held meetings with police, forest and revenue departments to collect information. Sreejith told the media that the objective of SIT was to ensure effective coordination between departments that have registered separate cases under their purview. He said that steps would be taken to ensure that proper action will be taken in all cases. Responding to a question about cases registered against tribesmen from whose land rosewood trees were felled and taken away by the timber mafia, Sreejith said the probe team will take a considerate stand on such issues. A team led by CB IG Sparjan Kumar gathered evidence at Kuppady timber depot where seized timber logs were kept. Among the officers who attended the meet included top crime branch and vigilance officers and forest officers including Kozhikode Flying Squad DFO P Dhanesh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sit-to-augment-cases-by-invoking-pdpp-biodiversity-and-land-conservancy-acts/articleshow/83586112.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Free movement, not wearing masks a big worry, say task force members||MUMBAI: Epidemiologists, on a conservative estimate, expect up to 100 days between the peaks of two infection waves or eight weeks from the decline of one wave to the next peak. However, Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid task force, said, “The UK is facing a third wave within four weeks of ebbing of the second wave. We could be in the same situation if we don’t stay vigilant and practise Covid-appropriate behaviour.” He added: “We believe children won’t be the target of the next wave. They may not make up for more than 3.5% of the patient pool—like it happened in the first two waves.” It is expected 10% of the total cases will come from children or young adults, as in the first two waves. Since the last two weeks, the state government has gone in for a five-level unlock model based on Covid indicators like weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds. Over 15 districts and some cities like Nagpur and Pune are now enjoying considerable relaxations. “Uncontrolled crowds and disregard for Covid norms like wearing of masks and avoiding non-essential movement are worrisome. Even in Mumbai, with certain time restrictions in place, there is free movement,” said a senior official who was at the meeting. The task force believes that the population segment that escaped Covid in the first two waves is most vulnerable. “It will not be the middle- or upper-middle-classes but the lower middle class who either missed the virus in the first two waves or have highly depleted levels of antibodies that will be hit hard,” he said. The key to handling the third wave is to increase testing and vaccination and boost infrastructure . The task force members said vaccination should be conducted aggressively, to which Thackeray said that as per information, the country would be receiving 42 crore vaccine doses by August-September and the state would benefit. He directed the administration to ensure scaling-up of infrastructure and streamlining supplies of medicines, testing kits and oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-free-movement-not-wearing-masks-a-big-worry-say-task-force-members/articleshow/83592538.cms||Bhavika Jain

Cops summoned its owner and employees for interrogation. According to the police, the gangsters had stayed in the four-storey guest house, listed under Oyo properties and situated next to the Sector V Metro station, between May 22 and May 25 before they shifted to the New Town complex. “It sends shivers down our spine thinking what would have happened if the encounter had taken place here. This guest house is extremely shady and also houses a spa. Cars registered with Jharkhand are often parked outside the guest house,” said a local woman, adding that multiple memorandums seeking police raid at the guest house had been submitted before the Bidhannagar East police station but with no results. Meanwhile, Bidhannagar cops said they are planning to bring the gangsters’ accomplices, Bharat Kumar and Sumit Kumar, to Kolkata for questioning once their police remand ends in Punjab. The Bengal STF and the Bidhannagar detective department officers are slated to question them. An officer of Punjab police said that Bharat had told investigators about a Bengali woman, currently staying in Punjab, who had helped him arrange the guest house and other accommodation in Kolkata. The officer added the woman also used to operate an escort service. They are probing if she had link with the gangsters’ smuggling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shootout-cops-shut-guest-house/articleshow/83586133.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Hyderabad||Nama Nageswara Rao summoned in loan fraud case||HYDERABAD: Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials have summoned Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Lok Sabha leader Nama Nageswara Rao for questioning on June 25 in connection with a Rs 1064 crore loan fraud case. Director of the accused company, Ranchi Expressway Limited directors K Srinivasa Rao, N Seetaiah, and Nama Prithvi Teja, son of the TRS MP were also summoned. During a recent search, ED seized Rs 1 crore in cash and gold jewellery and incriminating documents related to the case from the office and residences of the accused. ED alleged that despite Rs 1029 crore released by banks there was no progress in the project. Investigations revealed that Rs 264 crore was diverted because of round-tripping in equity and subordinated debt infusion and diversion of mobilization advances. Nama Nageswara Rao is a bank guarantor for the loan. Despite several attempts, the TRS leader could not be reached for a comment as multiple calls and messages went unanswered. According to ED and CBI documents, the estimated cost of a four-lane project was Rs 1,655 crore as per the common loan agreement in October 2011, between Ranchi Expressway Limited and Consortium of Banks. Initially, a sum of Rs 1191 crore was to be funded by a consortium of 15 banks led by Canara Bank. However, the same came down to Rs 1151 crore as State Bank of Travancore backed out. The contribution of promoters was increased from Rs 463 crore to Rs 503 crore. “The director of Ranchi Expressway K Srinivas Rao and others fraudulently round-tripped a sum of Rs 50 crore given to Madhucon Projects limited, the EPC contractor in 2012 January. The amount was diverted by Madhucon Projects Limited to Madhucon Infra Limited which in turn routed to the account of Madhucon Toll Highways Limited and further to Ranchi Expressway Limited as subordinate debt,” CBI has alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nama-summoned-in-loan-fraud-case/articleshow/83586140.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Kolkata||After break, serial shooting begins in Kolkata amid Tollywood row||KOLKATA: Unlike other sectors that started functioning on Wednesday, controversy erupted in Tollywood when shooting of serials began in the city. The situation was such that a press conference was called by WATP, Artists’ Forum, broadcasters and vendors in the evening. Actor Rahul Banerjee, who plays Raja in ‘Desher Mati’, began shooting with Ruqma Roy post noon. It took them close to four hours to shoot for a confrontational scene that turned into a romantic episode. Four days after the Bengal government announced restrictions on May 16, Rahul was detected with Covid-19. According to him, shooting from home using mobile phones effectively does away with the illusion that a studio setup guarantees with proper lights and makeup. “Nothing matches the thrill of shooting on the sets. It felt so comforting when I entered the studio and met at least some familiar faces. We are shooting with a skeletal unit. I will be happy if we can go back to shooting with our proper unit,” he said. But that might not be very easy with Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) blacklisting 20 serials — ‘Krishnakali’, ‘Titli’, ‘Aparajita Apu’, ‘Gramer Rani Binapani’, ‘Baran’, ‘Khelaghar’, ‘Jamuna Dhaki’, ‘Gangaram’, ‘Jibansathi’, ‘Mithai’, ‘Sanjher Bati’, ‘Khorkuto’, ‘Sreemoyee’, ‘Mohor’, ‘Desher Mati’, ‘Rimli’, ‘Ogo Nirupama’, ‘Felna’, ‘Dhrubotara’ and ‘Ki Kore Bolbo Tomae’ — for flouting norms while “shooting at home”. Swarup Biswas, the president of FCTWEI, told TOI on Wednesday, “We have not received any reply from the production houses of these 20 serials. Technicians are extending full co-operation to the units of ‘Rani Rashmoni’, ‘Mahapeeth Tarapeeth’, ‘Amader Ei Poth Jodi Na Sesh Hoy’, ‘Agnishikha’, ‘Korikhela’, ‘Kanyadaan’, ‘Nayantara’, ‘Mompalok’, ‘Balika Badhu’, ‘Police File’, ‘Hoyto Tomari Jonno’ and ‘Bikram Betal’. There are five non-fiction shows ‘Dance Dance Junior’, ‘Rannabanna’, ‘Didi No. 1’, ‘Dance Bangla Dance’ and ‘Rannaghar’ where technicians are working. FCTWEI will not cooperate during the shooting of any new serials unless producers sign the MOU,” he said. The new ones include Tent Cinema’s ‘Rishton Ka Manjha’, Organinc Studios’ ‘Sundori’, Acropolis’ ‘Mon Phagun’ and Magic Moments’ ‘Dhuli Kana’. However, Diganta Sinha, who directs ‘Sreemoyee’, turned up for shooting. “I am part of the directors’ guild that is affiliated to FCTWEI. The producers have never exploited me and hence, I turned up for the shooting. It’s unfair to stop people from earning,” he said. Director Leena Gangopadhyay, writer of four black-listed serials, said, “We felt very helpless and insecure. We have no fights with technicians but some officials of FCTWEI have said things that are not acceptable. Our chief minister has always given us all support. It is unfortunate that some people are creating issues out of nothing and spoiling the image of our industry and work environment.” Producer Arka Ganguly, who shot ‘Sundari’ on Wednesday despite the FCTWEI dictate, is unwilling to accept such strong-arm tactics. “FCTWEI is not our guardian. Why should we reply to them? The show has to go on. Despite being threatened by FCTWEI, 90% of their own technicians turned up at my shooting on Wednesday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-break-serial-shooting-begins-amid-tolly-row/articleshow/83586163.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Varsities, teachers reach out to Covid orphans||LUCKNOW: Not only the government but universities and teachers across the state have also come forward in taking up the responsibility of children orphaned by Covid-19. The Lucknow University alone has identified 75 children who lost both the parents, or guardians to Covid-19. Drawing inspiration from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, LU vice-chancellor Prof Alok Rai said, “The CM has inspired many teachers who have come forward to help children. Such welfare schemes have made UP ahead of other states.” According to government officials, teachers from other districts like Varanasi, Prayagraj and Sultanpur are also bearing the expense of over 1,000 children and have taken responsibility of their education. Terming the CM a “messiah of orphaned kids”, Sushil Singh, a faculty member at Ramswaroop University said, “On the lines of the government’s Bal Sewa Scheme, our organisation has identified 50 children orphaned due to Covid-19. We will ensure these children aren’t deprived of education.” For Rakesh Pandey, a primary school teacher in Varanasi, the inspiration to adopt orphan children also comes from the CM. “There is no greater religion than helping someone who is in misery. Over 50 children have been identified so far whose parents succumbed to the virus,” said Pandey who has helped 500 destitute children in the last two years. Shailendra Chaturvedi, a teacher at Government Girls’ Inter College, Sultanpur, said: “All of us are constantly in touch with NGOs and identifying such children in the district. So far, 20 children have been identified.” For the systematic upbringing and education of children who lost both the parents due to Covid, the UP government had announced the Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojana, which entails a monthly stipend of Rs 4,000 for each child and state funding of their education and marriage. Further supporting the orphan children, the government made a provision of their free education at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas and Atal residential schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/varsities-teachers-reach-out-to-covid-orphans/articleshow/83588623.cms||---

They may not make up for more than 3.5% of the patient pool—like it happened in the first two waves.” It is expected 10% of the total cases will come from children or young adults, as in the first two waves. Since the last two weeks, the state government has gone in for a five-level unlock model based on Covid indicators like weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds. Over 15 districts and some cities like Nagpur and Pune are now enjoying considerable relaxations. “Uncontrolled crowds and disregard for Covid norms like wearing of masks and avoiding non-essential movement are worrisome. Even in Mumbai, with certain time restrictions in place, there is free movement,” said a senior official who was at the meeting. The task force believes that the population segment that escaped Covid in the first two waves is most vulnerable. “It will not be the middle- or upper-middle-classes but the lower middle class who either missed the virus in the first two waves or have highly depleted levels of antibodies that will be hit hard,” he said. The key to handling the third wave is to increase testing and vaccination and boost infrastructure . The task force members said vaccination should be conducted aggressively, to which Thackeray said that as per information, the country would be receiving 42 crore vaccine doses by August-September and the state would benefit. He directed the administration to ensure scaling-up of infrastructure and streamlining supplies of medicines, testing kits and oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-free-movement-not-wearing-masks-a-big-worry-say-task-force-members/articleshow/83588625.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kochi||When in dire need farmers cut trees, restore order: HRSS||Idukki: High Range Samrakshana Samithy (HRSS), a farmers’ forum in Idukki, has demanded the reinstatement of the controversial order issued on October 24 last year allowing felling of trees in assigned lands. All India Kisan Sabha, Kerala, the farmers' wing of CPI, had also said two days ago that the government should restore the order which was cancelled on February 2 following reports that the order was being used as a cover for rampant tree-felling across the state. High Range Samrakshana Samithy general convener Fr Kochupurackal said on Wednesday that the tree-cutting order was issued based on a long-term demand from farmers and farmers groups. “Timber mafia and plantations benefitted from the government order that allowed the cutting of trees on title deed lands. Small and medium scale farmers did not benefit from the order and it needs to be restored. Farmers usually sell timber during emergency situations for purposes like marrying off their daughters or for hospital needs,” said Kochupurakal. "The curbs on tree felling will have a severe impact on the lives of the poor and the farmers will have to suffer in future. If the government finds someone smuggling timber from plantations and government lands it should deal with it sternly. Most of the landholdings owned by farmers in Idukki district are below five acres. These holdings will have just about two or three matured trees and the timber is sold when the farmers require ready cash in emergency situations. If curbs are imposed on cutting down the trees, it will hit them hard," he said. "Before issuing title deeds to the farmers, the title deed holder pays tax for the trees on the patta land and the farmers have the ownership of such trees. The government should take steps to do away with the permits required from revenue and forest departments to cut trees from assigned lands," said Kochupurakal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/when-in-dire-need-farmers-cut-trees-restore-order-hrss/articleshow/83586162.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

KMC’s general body had passed the resolution to grant the tag to the site after city-based film activists raised their voices against the town planning department’s plan to sanction the layout submitted by a private developer to build residential buildings on the site.  The studio was built in the early 1930s and was one of the iconic studio, where several Marathi and Hindi movies were made. A long time ago, the studio weathered away The order accessed by TOI and signed by Kishor Gokhale, the senior secretary to the government states, states “There is no structure of the studio at the site. The site was already deleted from the list of heritage sites in 2012. The reason for including such site in the list of heritage buildings, therefore, could not be understood.” Grade 3 of the heritage list means though the structure is not present the precinct can be given the tag of the heritage site. The film activists had demanded the development of the site to make movies and any other film-related activities. Bhupal Shete, the former corporator, who had raised the voice several times to save the site, said, “We will approach the court to save the site. We will again plead to the government to cancel the order and approve KMC’s proposal as a special case to save the heritage of Kolhapur city.” The order also states that the KMC should carry out the process to sanction the layout as per the development control rules applicable for the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/udd-denies-heritage-precinct-tag-to-shalini-cinetone-studio-site/articleshow/83581502.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Guns boom in Vizag agency, six Maoists killed in encounter||VISAKHAPATNAM: Six Maoist insurgents, including two division committee members of the outlawed group, were killed in an exchange of fire with the police inside Teegalametta forests of Visakhapatnam agency in the early hours of Wednesday. A few Maoists, who are believed to have suffered injuries, managed to escape from the encounter spot under Mampa police station limits in Koyyuru mandal. At the time of exchange of fire, there were around 25 ultras of the Galikonda area committee and PLGA team, the military wing of the proscribed Naxal group, at the site. Security forces recovered weapons including one AK-47, one SLR, three .303 rifles, one tapancha, besides two walkie-talkies, explosives, kit bags and other material. It’s the first time in many years that Maoists have suffered these many casualties on AP soil. Wednesday’s encounter was the first in Visakhapatnam agency area after two years of relative lull. The last big encounter happened in October 2016, when around 32 Maoists, including several Andhra-Odisha border zonal committee leaders, were killed by security forces but it happened at Ramaguda in Malkangiri district of Odisha, close to AP border. Visakha rural SP Boddepalli Krishna Rao said the exchange of fire between the ultras and anti-Naxal force Greyhounds took place close to U Cheedipalem and Palakajidi villages, around 10km from Mampa.“We have information that some Naxals are injured. We assure the best medical treatment for them if they surrender to the police. We are also appealing to other cadres to surrender and join the mainstream,” he said. Among those killed in Wednesday’s encounter include DCM cadre leader Sande Gangaiah, alias Ashok, from Gumpula village under Odelu mandal in Peddapalli district of Telangana. Gangaiah was a member of the medical team of CPI (Maoists). The others were identified as Ranadev, alias Arjun, of Kalimela squad, area committee member Santu Nachika from Koraput district in Odisha, woman cadres Paike from Chhattisgarh and Lalita from Teemulabanda village under GK Veedhi mandal in Visakhapatnam district. The body of one more woman Naxal is yet to be identified. “We received information that Maoists were procuring essentials from nearby villages, which indicates they had already set up a camp in the area. Around seven teams of Greyhounds surrounded the area. All three women cadres were at sentry posts when the exchange of fire took place,” a police source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/guns-boom-in-vizag-agency-6-maoists-killed-in-encounter/articleshow/83590894.cms||Siva G
---||Ahmedabad||Heavy rain heralds end of dry days in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: It was a humid day for Amdavadis after a drizzle in early evening in some parts of the city, on Wednesday. The temperature remained high at 39.5 degrees celsius, but about 50% humidity drenched citizens in sweat. However, around 8pm, several parts of the city along with some areas of central and north Gujarat received thundershowers that continued for over an hour, bringing the temperature down. For citizens, it was a much needed respite from heat and humidity.  Manorama Mohanty, the regional director of the India Meteorological Department, said that the thundershowers were not part of the monsoon onset for Ahmedabad. “The city and the region at large are likely to receive rainfall on Thursday and Friday too,” she said. “We will be able to decide on Thursday whether the monsoon has advanced further in the state.” Mohanty added: “But for now, the thundershowers are the result of a cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and the rainfall is due to pre-monsoon activity.” Along with Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Patan, Sabarkantha, and Banaskantha also received showers. Leena Karia, a resident of South Bopal, said that she was reminded of the popular Gujarati song ‘Man Mor Bani Thangaat Kare’ after the sudden showers. “All the signs —humidity and heat — indicated a rainfall,” she said. “But when it arrived with strong winds, I got an exhilarating feeling that my favourite season is finally here. I wish we get good rainfall this season.” Khushboo Sahoo, a Vejalpur resident, echoed the sentiment. “Finally, there is some respite from humidity due to rain. I was eagerly waiting for the monsoon,” she said. “Let’s hope the rain continues through the days ahead.” But citizens worried about the civic works in various parts of the city ahead of the monsoon. “Construction and road resurfacing work was ongoing along the approach road to my house,” said Nishtha Shah, a Makarba resident. “The area is a bit low-lying and gets waterlogged during the rains. I don’t know how this stretch of road is going to pan out by morning as I head to work.” On Wednesday, the city recorded maximum temperature of 40.6 degrees celsius which was 2.3 degrees above normal. Minimum temperature was recorded at 29.1 degrees celsius, 1.9 degrees above normal. State capital Gandhinagar recorded 40 degrees celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/heavy-rain-heralds-end-of-dry-days/articleshow/83586204.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Rush for medicinal plant giloy during pandemic sparks tribal youth’s business idea||PUNE: The pandemic gave Thane-based Katkari youth Sunil Pawar (28) a right turn in life. When the demand for immunity boosting medicinal plant ‘tinospora cordifolia’ (giloy, guduchi) and stress-busting ‘withania somnifera’ (ashwagandha) shot up from individual users and pharma companies, Pawar set up a business gathering and selling them. He now employs 1,800 people from his community. Last year, they did business worth Rs 50 lakh. “We have orders from pharma companies Himalaya and Dabur for Rs 1.5 crore for giloy. It has to be sent in a fortnight,” Pawar said. Till two years ago, Pawar, a Std XII dropout, foraged in the forest for wood needed for rituals. A lecture in Nashik on medicinal plants by Digambar Mokat, head of the regional and facilitation centre, western region of the National Medicinal Plants Board, turned him to cultivate and sell giloy. The board under the ministry of AYUSH is located at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU).The Katkari community is one of the 75 particularly vulnerable tribal groups. “I couldn’t go to college after Std XII because we were too poor. I started working at a telecommunication company but was laid off, and came back to Shahapur, my hamlet,” he said. Around this time, the district administration had organised a camp for the Katkaris to get Aadhaar, PAN card and ration cards. “At least 5,000 people turned up and waited the entire day under the hot sun. The administration was not prepared for the crowd. Most of my people work in brick kilns where the pay is meagre. Our children lose about eight months of school. Around 10-12 of us present on this day decided to form a trust,” Pawar said. They registered as Adivasi Ekatmik Samajik Sanstha when Pawar found there is a demand for a particular wood used in rituals. “Our first order was for Rs 400 where the priest wanted 100 bundles of a particular wood. We started foraging in the forest to find the seven types of samidha (wood) used in homa. The orders continued to be small. At this point, we were told to provide giloy. We didn’t know what it looked like. Ignorance was so high that my community used giloy as firewood,” he said. Soon, Pawar and his friends started collecting giloy, drying it and selling it. “For about six months, we sold it for Rs 10-12 per kg. We needed an office and a local person, Arun Pansare, offered his land for free. Now, we had a place to store the wood. But Mokat, also a professor at SPPU on medicinal plants, guided us about planting, growing, cutting and storing giloy,” he added. Mokat said Pawar approached him immediately after the lecture in Nashik, wanting to know all about medicinal plants and how to make a business out of them. “I conducted three to four webinars for their group and went to Shahapur to train them once. They don’t have farms, but we can train them in the nursery business to nurture good quality saplings. We can offer advice on other forest products. Sunil is educated and his enthusiasm has helped hundreds of people earn a livelihood when all other activities were at a standstill,” Mokat said. In September 2019, they got the approval under the Pradhan Mantri Van Dhan Vikas Yojna and set up a centre in Shahapur. With better knowledge of medicinal plants and their market, they began collecting giloy, jamun seeds and reetha. “We do not farm them as yet, but we plant saplings in the jungle. During the first lockdown, many people came to me asking for work. Around that time, the demand for giloy shot up and I could employ them. We started with one Van Dhan Vikas Kendra and now have 11 in Shahapur. We are able to pay Rs 300 and a commission on the produce we gather,” Pawar said. Vice chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University Nitin Karmalkar said from Pawar’s example it is clear how far a person can go with guidance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rush-for-medicinal-plant-giloy-during-pandemic-sparks-tribal-youths-biz-idea/articleshow/83588671.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Goa||BJP destroyed Parrikar’s legacy bytrampling over his schemes: AAP||Panaji: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has alleged that BJP destroyed the legacy of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar saying the state government has trampled over his vision of social welfare schemes and affordable petrol. Stating that Parrikar had fulfilled his 2012 poll promise to waive the VAT on petrol in Goa and ensured petrol cost remained below Rs 60/litre, AAP’s Pratima Coutinho stated that petrol cost has crossed Rs 95/litre despite international crude prices being 30% lower than it was in 2012. Parrikar’s schemes for the common man brought the party to power, but the government has not been releasing funds under various welfare schemes, she stated. The party also raised the issue of late disbursal of funds under the Griha Aadhar and DSSS schemes Coutinho also said that the government approved only 2% of applications received under the Laadli Laxmi scheme, of which 24,000 are still pending. Coutinho said that he doesn’t have money for the common man when they most need it during the pandemic but they have soft corner for casino promoters. “To make matters worse, Sawant has made fake announcements of compensation to Covid victims, just to grab headlines and deflect criticism of his handling of the situation,” Coutinho said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-destroyed-parrikars-legacy-bytrampling-over-his-schemes-aap/articleshow/83588733.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Versatile talent Swatilekha Sengupta who excelled in acting, music, academics no more||KOLKATA: Swatilekha Sengupta, known for her unique versatility that combined the strength of powerful acting with her excellence in academics and music, breathed her last on Wednesday afternoon at a city nursing home. The Sangeet Natak Akademi Award winner, who was in the ICU for 25 days battling chronic kidney disorder, is survived by husband, theatre personality Rudraprasad Sengupta, and daughter Sohini. Born in Allahabad in 1950, Swatilekha was the first class first in the English department from Allahabad University. She had briefly taught at Loreto College. Theatre was her first love and she joined Nandikar in 1977. Encomiums poured in for the departed actor since the news of her demise broke out. “Her performance in Satyajit Ray’s ‘Ghare Baire’ will always be remembered,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Incidentally, the first time Ray saw her perform was in a brief role in Shambhu Mitra’s ‘Galileo’. Later, when they met before the shooting of Ghare Baire’, Ray had noticed Sengupta’s interest in music and asked her to play his piano. Swatilekha had studied music from London’s Trinity College and had played a Beethoven piece. Impressed, Ray had whistled a few of Beethoven’s pieces too. When ‘Gaire Baire’ released in 1984, Ray called her an ‘intelligent actress’. She accompanied Soumitra Chatterjee to Cannes where the film competed for the Palme d’Or. Later, she acted in Onir’s Hindi production titled ‘Chauranga’. “I had loved her in ‘Ghare Baire’ and was scared to approach her for ‘Chauranga’ since it was just a special appearance. But she was kind enough to agree. Later, I had told her about wanting to cast as a 70-year-old woman who is evicted from her village in my Hindi film titled ‘Three Lives’,” Onir said. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. Thirty years after ‘Ghare Baire’, Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee paired her with Soumitra for ‘Belaseshe’. The film was a box-office success and the duo acted in its sequel called ‘Bela Shuru’. Unfortunately, both passed away before its release. In the pipeline is Raj Chakraborty’s ‘Dharmayuddha’. “She plays a character that represents India and is secular. My regret is I couldn’t show the film to her,” said Chakraborty, who paid his last respect to her at the crematorium. Theatre personality and state education minister Bratya Basu, who had directed and acted with her in ‘Kanyadan’, went to the hospital to pay respect. Actor-director Kaushik Sen remembered her stellar act in ‘Sanu Roychowdhury’. “Both in ‘Pheriwalar Mrityu’ and ‘Gotroheen’, the other characters in the plays were far more shiner. Yet, Swatidi stood out by her presence. I have not watched Rudrababu and Swatidi play Crayon and Antigone. But we were moved when we heard her read the play. I also remember her directing a play with special children titled ‘Khunje Nao’ that had Sohini in the lead. It was remarkable,” Kaushik said. Swatilekha also directed ‘Football’ in Hindi, adapted-directed short plays like ‘Pakhi’, ‘Dulia’ and ‘Tomar Naam’ and established herself as a director with Nandikar’s major success ‘Madhabi’. “Baba and Ma really were a team. Ma was natural as an actor,” said Sohini. She also spoke about how she was a “fantastic cook”, loved dogs and was good with “embroidery”. “Honesty was her greatest quality and she always took the right decisions even in dire straits,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/versatile-talent-who-excelled-in-acting-music-academics/articleshow/83586209.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Coimbatore||Alarm bells ringing over growing ganja menace||Coimbatore: Ganja peddlers are having a field day right under the nose of police. The city police arrested several people, many of whom were youngsters and first-time offenders, in the last few weeks for selling the contraband. On Tuesday, Peelamedu sub-inspector M Rajkumar and team arrested a nursing graduate and her boyfriend while they were attempting to sell 2.3kg ganja near Nehru Nagar on Veeriyampalayam Road at Kalapatti. Police identified her as 21-year-old Vinothini, daughter of Balamurugan of Virudhunagar district. “She was staying with M Surya, 21, of Periyar Nagar in a rented house. Vinothini has a diploma in nursing and Surya is pursuing an undergraduate course. She had befriended Surya on Instagram a few months ago. They turned to ganja peddling to lead a comfortable life,” a police officer said. Police seized 2.3kg ganja from the couple and booked them under sections 8 (c), 20 (b) (ii) (B) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The couple was remanded in judicial custody. On Wednesday, Rathinapuri sub-inspector Dhanabalan and team arrested Pichamani of Prabhu Nagar, who was found smoking ganja at Kannappa Nagar, and seized 1.2kg of the contraband from him. Pichamani told police that he had bought ganja from a person at Erucompany. Narcotics Intelligence Bureau (NIB)-CID police arrested R Ramesh, 44, of Uthamapalayam in Theni district from Singanallur on Wednesday for smuggling ganja from Andhra Pradesh. Police seized 21kg ganja and his motorcycle. After two gangs of ganja peddlers clashed at Gandhima Nagar a few days ago, a police team conducted a march past drill there. Special teams have been formed to prevent ganja sales, police commissioner Deepak M Damor said. “A team is working to dismantle the ganja network,” he said. Peelamedu and Saravanampatti police have intensified night patrolling and beat patrolling to curb the menace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/alarm-bells-ringing-over-growing-ganja-menace/articleshow/83586211.cms||A Subburaj
---||Goa||CM: BJP MLAs must gain people’s trust||Margao: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday said that all BJP MLAs have been asked to go to the people within the next six months with a view to gain their trust and confidence ahead of the assembly elections scheduled to be held early next year even as several programmes are lined up to get the party organisaton in poll mode. “The MLAs and ministers have not been able to go to the people for the last one year due to the pandemic. They should now go the people by ensuring proper Covid control measures, and try to understand and solve the grievances of the people,” Sawant said while speaking to reporters, outside the BJP party office in Margao, where he had come to address a party meeting. With a view to gearing up the rank and file of the party into the poll mode, BJP on Wednesday held a closed-door meeting of chairpersons of all mandals (blocks) and MLAs of South Goa at the party’s South Goa district office. Sawant also addressed the meeting which also saw party president Sadanand Tanavade, besides general secretaries Narendra Sawaikar and Damodar Naik in attendance. Addressing reporters after the meeting, Tanavade said, “The assembly elections will be held in January or February 2022. There are a number of programmes to be planned and organised before that. Some programmes have also come from the Centre. The meeting dwelt largely on the organisation of the programmes and delegating tasks and responsibilities.” National general secrerary of BJP (organisation) B L Santosh during his visit to Goa last week had asked the BJP leadership here to go all out for people-contact programme ahead of the elections. Among the various programmes scheduled to be held soon are the international Yoga Day on June 21, death anniversary of the Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23, anniversary of national Emergency on June 25, PM Modi’s Mann ki Baat on June 27, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jayanti on July 6. “Yoga Day will be organized on June 21 in all constituencies by maintaining social distancing.

He further said that June 23 is observed by the party as “Balidan Diwas”, the day when Mukherjee was allegedly killed in Srinagar. Programmes will be held in all constituencies so as to enlighten the youth on Mukherjee’s life and mission. On June 25, the party will observe the anniversary of national emergency as Black Day where party leaders will address youth through virtual meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-bjp-mlas-must-gain-peoples-trust/articleshow/83588710.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It had been days since Guddi Devi, 45, and her five children had got something to eat. They had lost everything to the pandemic and the lockdown, and were now starving. On Tuesday afternoon, she was hospitalised along with her children in Aligarh but they are “not doing too well”, a nurse said. On Tuesday noon, a local NGO, Hands for Help, got an anonymous call on their helpline telling them about a family that had been going without food for days. Mandir ka Nagla village in Aligarh, the caller said, and hung up. A team from the NGO left and traced the family — it was not hard, everyone knew of Guddi Devi’s plight. Inside the house, there was absolutely nothing. They had lost, or sold off, all their possessions. Two charpoys stood in the courtyard. “They had no government documents. Because they didn’t have Aadhaar cards, they could not get ration cards,” said president of the NGO Sunil Kumar. “They told us they had not eaten for days.” Cheeks sunken, bones sticking out and the lines on her face deep, Guddi Devi weighs 38 kg now. Her eldest son Ajay, 20, weighs 40kg; Vijay, 15, 30kg, Anuradha, 13, about 25 kg and Teetu, 10, just 15kg. Her youngest son, Sundar, 6, was not weighed then. Her husband, Vijyendra Kumar, died in February last year after a long illness. They never knew what he had. Guddi kept working at the packaging unit of an export company but in March last year, she was asked to go. Her son Ajay took up the responsibility and started working as a labourer. But two months ago, he got sick and couldn’t work anymore. They lost all means of livelihood. “We had no money. My neighbours did give me food sometimes. But how much could they do?” Guddi told TOI. “I approached the local ration dealer but he refused to help. Then, I asked the village pradhan if he could come to my aid but he didn’t either.” At the Aligarh district hospital, Dr SK Verma, who has been attending to the family, declined to comment on their condition. But Meena Saxena, the nurse in charge of the ward, said their condition was not too good. “The children were very weak when they were admitted, and complained of nausea and stomach ache,” she said. Aligarh district supply officer Rajesh Soni also said the family’s condition was “not good.” He added, “An inquiry has begun. Notices have been served on the village head and the local ration dealer, seeking their replies to the family’s allegation that they refused them help. Since they didn’t have Aadhaar cards or bank accounts, their ration cards had not been made. We are providing ration kits with fruits now and their Aadhaar cards are being made.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-food-for-days-up-family-of-6-hospitalised-not-doing-too-well/articleshow/83584141.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Sapling of native plants like jamun, kinjal, amla, mohagani, bamboo and Karanj have been made available at Sulgaon nursery in Ajara tehsil in Kolhapur district for this purpose. Divisional Forest Officer Vishal Mali said, “We had arranged a forest trip for blind people where they got to experience forest and wildlife. Though they can’t see, it was a memorable trip for them exploring wildlife and forest using their sharp senses. They had also carried seed balls which were specially made by them and the same were planted in the forest. Several plantation activities and online lectures related to forest and wildlife will be undertaken till September 30.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/van-mahotsav-forest-dept-plans-various-activities/articleshow/83581574.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Ward resident Om Prakash Parewa said, “The situation has become very difficult. The authorities are providing water tankers and the entire locality turns out to fill their containers from one tanker.” Resident Man Bhar Devi of Shyam Puri Colony in the ward said filling up of water for drinking purposes is a challenge and most of them have stopped using coolers dueing summer. Councillor Mahesh Soyal said he is regularly receiving complaints from residents. “This is such a challenging task. When we request for tankers, it does not come immediately. In houses where there is a death or emergency, we have to send tankers immediately. But how long can this continue? If there was no pandemic, we would have staged a protest in front of the PHED office,” said Soyal. Moreover, in other colonies, although there is water pipeline connection, the water pressure is so low that either water doesn’t reach there or it is supplied for just 10 minutes in low pressure. Soyal said in such colonies residents have to order tankers every other day which is pinching their pockets. Commenting on the problem of motor, PHED JEN Rama Singh said, “People usually over use the motor which is why it gets burnt. The area is situated on tail-end. In summer, due to high demand, pressure drops and water doesn’t reach on time. We are checking the water line inter-connection. If there is any other problem we will connect the lines with some other line.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/residents-fume-as-water-supply-hit-in-ward-66/articleshow/83588694.cms||---

KMC is evaluating daily case surge in different localities and depending on the figures, the officials will decide on imposing restrictions shortly. North 24-Parganas, which has reported over 3.1 lakh Covid cases till Wednesday, has the highest number of active cases in Bengal. The Bengal government on Tuesday had asked the KMC and the districts to map “local hot spots” and “pockets of high incidence” and introduce “containment and micro-containment measures” to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The advisory was issued a day before the government extended the Covid-safety restrictions to July 30 but eased certain curbs. The state asked the KMC commissioner and the district magistrates to “remain on high alert notwithstanding the fact that the cases of infection have come down significantly over the past few weeks”. So for now, 33 micro-containment zones have been planned. “We are focusing on a community-based micro-containment zone plan. We are analyzing the data ward wise and gram panchayat wise. As of now, we are starting off with micro-containment zones in about 15 places in North 24 Parganas. The curbs were imposed on Wednesday at some places and at others, it will start from Thursday,” said North 24 Parganas DM Sumit Gupta. One area coming up as a micro-containment zone was near Lake Town and Bangur under the jurisdiction of the South Dum Dum civic body, bordering Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation and South Dum Dum Municipality, a source said. Three such zones are coming up in Panihati and one each in North Dum Dum and Barasat municipality areas. Bidhananagar MLA Sujit Bose said sanitization and rapid-antigen tests were conducted on Wednesday around a lane in Bangur. Similarly, the Howrah district administration on Wednesday decided to create 18 containment zones across the district to check the spread of the novel coronavirus. Nilmoni Mullick Lane and N C Ghosh Lane around Howrah Maidan will be among the areas, where containment rules would be implemented from Thursday, said a district administration official. The KMC commissioner, Binod Kumar, on Wednesday asked the chief municipal health officer to prepare a status report on Covid active cases in every borough, before deciding on micro-containment zones here. “We have asked the borough executive health officers to prepare a report on the daily Covid cases in the past two weeks. Based on the rise and concentration of cases there, we may declare some areas as micro-containment zones,” a senior KMC health official said. But, he expressed satisfaction over the decline in Covid rates in Kolkata. “The infection rate is now around 5%-6%. Even a couple of weeks ago, the rate was around 30%. The number of active cases across the city has gone down to 150. But we are not complacent and may need to take strict measures,” the civic official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/micro-containment-rules-in-15-n-24-pgns-18-howrah-pockets/articleshow/83586214.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Hyderabad||No newborn calf serum used in Covaxin, say Centre & Bharat Biotech||HYDERABAD: Bharat Biotech on Wednesday said that though newborn calf serum is used in manufacturing of viral vaccines, it is not used in the final formulation of Covaxin. The statement came after an RTI query on the contents of Covaxin led to a Congress leader levelling allegations of cow slaughter “Newborn calf serum is used in the manufacturing of viral vaccines. It is used for the growth of cells, but neither used in growth of SARS-CoV-2 virus nor the final formulation. Covaxin is highly purified to contain only the inactivated virus components by removing all other impurities,” Bharat Biotech said in a statement. “Bovine serum is widely used in the manufacture of vaccines globally for several decades. The usage of newborn calf serum was transparently documented in various publications since the last nine months,” the company added. Bharat Biotech’s clarification came after Congress party’s national coordinator for digital communications and social media, Gaurav Pandhi, tweeted a copy of the RTI response given by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to an RTI applicant, one Vikas Patni, regarding the contents of Covaxin and accused the Modi government of betraying the "faith and belief" of people. Pandhi had also tweeted a study on the method for differentiating fetal bovine serum from newborn calf serum which mentions that the newborn calf serum is the liquid fraction of clotted blood derived from healthy, slaughtered bovine calves that are less than 20 days old. The Centre, meanwhile, slammed the social media posts stating that “facts have been twisted and misrepresented” and issued a detailed note explaining the usage of newborn calf serum in vaccine making. “Newborn calf serum is used only for preparation or growth of vero cells. Different kinds of bovine and other animal serum are standard enrichment ingredient used globally for vero cell growth. Vero cells are used to establish cell lines which help in production of vaccines. This technique has been used for decades in polio, rabies, and influenza vaccines,” said a statement by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW). “These vero cells, after the growth, are washed with water, with chemicals (also technically known as buffer), many times to make it free from the newborn calf serum. Thereafter, these vero cells are infected with coronavirus for viral growth,” the government statement explained. “The vero cells are completely destroyed in the process of viral growth. Thereafter this grown virus is also killed (inactivated) and purified. This killed virus is then used to make the final vaccine, and in the final vaccine formulation no calf serum is used. Hence, the final vaccine (Covaxin) does not contain newborn calf serum at all and the calf serum is not an ingredient of the final vaccine product,” it added. A vaccine industry expert too pointed out that while various kinds of bovine serum are used in vaccine making, the serum is not extracted in India but imported from countries like US, Australia and New Zealand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-newborn-calf-serum-used-in-covaxin-say-centre-bb/articleshow/83590927.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Parents’ details fed on app to fund schoolkid uniforms||LUCKNOW: To ensure that parents/guardians do not lose out on funds meant for buying uniforms of children, head teachers in government schools have been given the responsibility to feed the correct bank account details of beneficiaries on the Prerna portal. The details are needed because the government has decided to introduce direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for the purchase of uniforms from the new academic session. Close to 1.8 crore students enrolled in state-run primary schools will be benefited by the decision. The government, both central and state, provides two sets of uniforms for students belonging to SC, ST and BPL families from classes 1 to 8 at an average cost of Rs 600 every year. Boys wear brown trousers with red check shirts and girls wear brown skirts with red tops. At present, the education department disburses grants to the school and the school management committee helps in procurement. However, students complain of late arrival of uniforms and poor quality. Introducing DBT scheme is aimed at weeding out corruption in primary education. “Transferring the money into accounts of parents will eliminate middlemen and quality issues,” an official said. The basic education department has issued a set of guidelines for the DBT module to help head teachers ensure that funds reach the correct bank account through the public financial management system (PFMS) portal. According to director general, school education, Vijay Kiran Anand, the data uploaded on the Prerna portal will be validated through the PFMS portal so that funds for uniforms directly reach the beneficiary bank account. The data includes parent/ guardian name, bank name, IFSC and account number. The head teachers need to check that the name of the guardian on Prerna portal is the same as that recorded in the school register. The name in the bank account must also match. Any spelling error will result in failure of the validation. Other things to note are names of banks, especially in cases where banks have merged. Besides, there should be no mismatch of alphabets and numbers between the IFSC filled by the teacher and the one on the beneficiary’s pass book.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/parents-details-fed-on-app-to-fund-schoolkid-uniforms/articleshow/83588786.cms||Isha Jain

CIRT would be IIM-N’s off-campus in Pune, and offer all its regular programmes, besides many automobile related courses. The memorandum of understanding would be signed between IIM director Bhimaraya Metri and CIRT director Rajendra Patil in the presence of Board of Governors (BOG) chairman Chander Prakash Gurnani and Union minister Nitin Gadkari at his home. On a visit to the city, Gurnani, also chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) of Tech Mahindra, spoke exclusively to TOI on IIM-N’s plans and other issues. Excerpts: Q. Brief us about the MoU to be inked with CIRT. A. Established in 1967, CIRT, a Government of India (GOI) undertaking, would act as IIM-N’s extension in Pune, which is a big industrial, automobile and IT hub. It offers technical training, consultancy and automobile component testing services. With this collaboration, we would be offering our various short and long term programs in Pune from the new academic year. There would also be research collaboration and faculty development programmes, where our teachers would impart lectures there. Q. What’s the objective behind collaborating with CIRT? A. Our partnership is aimed at developing leaders of tomorrow and helping the country to take pole position in the sectors of transportation and mobility. The focus would be clearly on skill development and bringing managerial competencies in India, particularly in the automobile sector. This is a project of national importance, where technologies related to transportation would be the thrust area, and we’re aiming to produce world class leaders, who can drive those. Q. Which kind of programmes would be offered at Pune campus? A. Both institutions would together offer wide ranging and industry oriented programmes in transportation and shipping management that would also help the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector. Those would be a combination of data analytics, artificial intelligence and modern management techniques, which I consider as future management. Digital marketing would be one of the key components of all our courses there. Q. Any new courses IIM-N would be offering and plans to increase intake? A. We would be offering an Executive Development MBA programme for working executives in Nagpur, which would immensely help working professionals. We would be increasing our capacity to 240 students from the new session, from 210 currently for our Post Graduate Programmes (PGP). Our admissions for the new session are already over and their online classes will commence from July 4. Some of our second year students will start arriving on campus from next week for physical lectures. Q. When would IIM-N shift to its permanent campus in Mihan? A. It was originally slated for May-June this year, but due to Covid-19 pandemic and labour problems, it was delayed. Now, we’re planning to shift by September-October, as 75% of the work has been completed. Spread over 32 acres, it is really a world class campus, which I visited today along with National Highway Authority of India advisor Vaibhav Dange, also a BOG member, to review progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/iim-nagpur-courses-at-cirt-pune-off-campus-soon-gurnani/articleshow/83586222.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The announcement comes less than a week after Ocugen informed bourses in the US that it had dropped plans to seek an emergency use approval (EUA) from US Food & Drug Administration based on the regulator’s recommendation and would be taking the BLA (biologics licence application) route to bring Covaxin to the US market. Ocugen had also said it would be filing an EUA with Health Canada for taking Covaxin to Canada. Ocugen’s senior vice president of manufacturing and supply chain, JP Gabriel, said in a statement that Ocugen was fully committed to bringing Covaxin to the US and Canadian markets because it has the potential to save lives by adding a weapon to the arsenal. “Securing US-based manufacturing capability is a critical step as we prepare to submit our regulatory submissions to the FDA and Health Canada. Based on Bharat Biotech’s strong track record of developing and commercializing vaccines globally and Jubilant’s proven track record in manufacturing,” Gabriel added.  Jubilant Pharma Ltd CEO Pramod Yadav said: “With two facilities in North America working to manufacture multiple Covid-19 vaccines and therapies, we remain committed to supporting efforts to eradicate this global pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ocugen-ties-up-with-jubilant-to-make-covaxin-for-us-canada/articleshow/83586226.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

A bench of Justices S P Deshmukh and Girish Kulkarni was hearing a PIL on Covid-19 management. The state had previously been directed to inform about Covid-19 affecting those consuming tobacco and bidis. The HC had said if it is fatal to health of citizens, “measures would be required to be taken to ban sale of cigarettes and bidis during the pandemic.” Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said Tata Memorial Centre has submitted an expert’s opinion on June 15, in which reference is made to studies done worldwide. “30-40 papers published indicate smokers are likely to be more adversely affected... The opinion is an analysis of those papers,” said the AG. “Give your opinion on what can be possible steps taken by the government if there is adverse effect of Covid on smokers,” said Justice Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/list-steps-to-avoid-effects-on-smokers-bombay-hc/articleshow/83588790.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The former chief minister refused to confirm that he would contest the next elections under the Congress banner, but said the decisions taken by the Congress high command will certainly shape his preparations for the 2022 assembly elections. “I can stand and contest any constituency and even as an independent. The people know me and are with me,” said Naik while speaking to TOI. Replying to a question on the sidelines of a function in Ponda, Naik didn’t rule out contesting from Madkai, the bastion of MGP. Former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar represents Marcaim for many years now. “I could contest from Madkai, Shiroda or Ponda. Let’s see.... people are with me,” he said. Naik has been estranged from the Congress camp ever since both his sons quit Congress and joined the rival BJP camp. Current state president Girish Chodankar has written off Naik by asserting that he no longer counts the Ponda MLA as a Congressman. The Ponda MLA himself has made no efforts to patch up with Congress, but has steadfastly maintained a neutral stance. “First let us see what the party decides. They have to change the state president, let us see how that goes,” said Naik. One of Naik’s sons – Ritesh and Roy – could be put up by BJP to contest from Ponda constituency. Naik has said that he is not interested in contesting the 2022 polls from Priol, a constituency represented by art and culture minister Govind Gaude. Gaude and Naik share close ties, said sources. Gaude recently announced that he is ready to join the BJP and contest the elections from Priol constituency. Interestingly, Naik was tasked by the Congress to build the party membership in five constituencies -- Ponda, Shiroda, Priol, Madkai and Valpoi. Naik claims that several of his supporters have been convincing him to contest from Madkai, Shiroda or Priol. “I have not decided from where I will contest, but I told them that the people are with me and I could contest from any of the constituencies,” said Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-mla-keeps-options-open-for-2022-state-polls/articleshow/83588755.cms||---

Expecting business after almost two months, several food vendors also set up their fares at their roadside stalls. Many shops selling non-essential items in the heart of the city, which had also been closed ever since the government imposed restrictions to check the fast spread of the novel coronavirus, resumed business. In the absence of public transport, commute was a challenge, but people worked around it, either by pooling cars or changing multiple autos or availing of bike taxis to reach offices. A large number of people also used their two wheelers. Motorcycles, scooters and bicycles were parked on the pavements of Dalhousie, Lalbazar, Ganesh Chandra Avenue, Mission Row, Bow Street, Brabourne Road, S N Banerjee Road and Esplanade. “I have taken one dose of vaccine, so did not feel too apprehensive about joining work. But transport was a worry as buses and Metro are not plying. So, some of us decided to pool in and travel by a colleague’s car. We will have to work out a long-term solution to commute to office,” said Asif Sheikh, a senior executive at a brokerage firm on Labazar Street. With people being back in offices, the street vendors did brisk business, especially in the afternoon. “Central Kolkata is always abuzz with activity as it has the highest concentration of private and government offices and commercial establishments, along with small and big eateries, not to forget the bars. When the government had imposed restrictions to check the surge of the pandemic in the second wave, all offices were shut and eateries were closed for dine-in. As a result, the area wore a deserted look. But now, life seems to be limping back to normal,” said Aditi Roy, a private bank employee. Several bars and restaurants upped their shutters from noon on Wednesday, as the government has allowed them to operate with 50% capacity till 8pm. “Some of the staff members have already been vaccinated, while others have registered for vaccination. By the end of this week, we will ensure all the staff members are vaccinated,” said the owner of a central Kolkata bar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/commute-a-challenge-but-buzz-returns-to-dalhousie-as-offices-reopen-after-cov-break/articleshow/83586236.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Officials said the sub-adult was caught on a trap camera on June 13 in Galta forest area. The leopardess had ventured into the region to look for own territory and was last seen in 2019. “When a leopard is a sub-adult, it starts looking for its own territory and it appears that the same thing happened with Cleopatra which found the required territory in Galta. The feline appeared to be healthy and we are continuously monitoring its movement”, said a forest official. Cleopatra is the offspring of Flora and sibling of Juliet. Officials claimed that since the siblings were more visible, they attracted tourists due to which Cleopatra’s absence was prominent. However, this is not the first instance in which a leopard has gone missing from Jhalana. A recent study ‘Jhalana Leopard Family Tree, 2012-2021’ by a member of leopard monitoring committee Dhiraj Kapoor revealed 32 leopards have died or went missing from Jhalana in this duration. A statistics that the research highlighted was that altogether 25 sub-adults and cubs died or disappeared from the region, which once roamed in the 20sqkm area. At present, 36 leopards are living in a 20sqkm area. The report reads, “The density of leopards is too high for an urban jungle. With new cubs being regularly born, the sub-adults get pushed out. In search of territory, these wild cats venture out and go missing or get killed in territorial fights.” With the leopard population on an upward trajectory, there is an expected spillover to the different adjoining areas of the reserve. Ideally, one male leopard requires at least 5sqkm area. The department is considering on developing surrounding forest areas including Galta, which is above 700 hectare in size.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-yrs-on-missing-leopardess-cleopatra-spotted-in-jhalana/articleshow/83588784.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Coimbatore||This tribal girl sows seeds of learning in her settlement||Coimbatore: Twenty-year old S Sandhiya is the first and the only graduate from the Chinnampathi tribal settlement in Mavuthampathi panchayat in the district. Without anyone to guide her with the studies, Sandhiya said she had a tough time during the school and college days. And she is determined to help the studious kids in the settlement with their studies, as she didn’t want them to go through the same hardships that she went through. A BCom graduate, Sandhiya is teaching 15 children in the settlement regularly. The children, who are in the classes I to V, gather at her house around 10am daily with the books that they received from their school recently. She groups them based on their classes and teaches them. To make it more lively, she sings traditional songs and dances with them when they seem to be bored. She also allows them to draw pictures once in a while. With a lunch break, the classes go on till 3pm. Some students stay back a bit longer.Sandhiya says, “I am the only person to step into a college from the settlement, thanks to my parents who constantly reminded me about the importance of education. Most of the children in the settlement stop studies after completing elementary or middle school, because of several reasons. I want to bring about a change and support the children who long for better education. If they get right exposure, they will surely scale the ladder of success.”It all began with tuition classes for the children in 2018, when she was in college. Sandhiya started fulltime classes during the lockdown last year, when schools started online classes. “We don’t get proper mobile network signals here and many of us don’t have smart phones. The children were sitting idle at home, unable to attend online classes. That’s when I started taking fulltime classes for the children,” she said.Sandhiya, who also holds a diploma in warehouse supervision, had joined a private firm in Tirupur as HR assistant four months ago. She returned home in May, when the lockdown was announced. While she aspires to study further, Sandhiya said she can’t stop working because of the financial situation of her family. “I am planning to do postgraduate studies through correspondence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/this-tribal-girl-sows-seeds-of-learning-in-her-settlement/articleshow/83586230.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The institute has tied up with a private hospital and will be vaccinating students from June 21 (Monday). Students will not have to pay for the vaccine as financial support will be extended using hostel funds. Over 3,000 students are likely to benefit from the drive. The institute was earlier negotiating with a private hospital, but the agreement did not work out due to pricing issues. Now, it has tied up with Surana Hospital which has agreed to offer vaccination at Rs 780 per dose. Professor Tapanendu Kundu, dean, student affairs, told TOI the idea is to get all students and staff vaccinated at the earliest. The vaccination drive will be open for staff and faculty as well, he said. He added that the institute is making arrangements to support vaccination for the mess and security staff through donations and other resources. The details will be worked out soon, he said. The students’ task force, which has helped to keep the campus safe throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, will be assisting in the drive. The residential campus has remained open for research scholars to ensure research does not get affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/iit-bombay-vax-drive-on-campus-for-students-from-june-21/articleshow/83588857.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Storage-on-rent units thrive in Hyderabad as WFH techies head home||HYDERABAD: The exodus of Hyderabad's migrant workforce to their home states — courtesy an extended work-from-home option — has led to the rise of a new business model in town: storage facilities. Limited to one or two pre-Covid-19, the city now has over two dozen such small and big players in the market, offering to store household items — furniture, appliances, utensils, books — for a certain price. The average charges: Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,500 per month. And these come with add-ons: insurance cover, pest control and monthly reports. “That’s only a fraction of what someone would be paying as rent for a 2BHK home. So, it is not just a convenient option but also pocket-friendly” said Chalapathi Rao, owner of Trimulgherry-based, Rent Storage, that’s been catering to 60 to 70 customers every month. “Most of them are from the IT sector who’ve been allowed to work from home for now,” he added. Also among their clientele are restaurants, coffee-shop chains and small offices that have given up their leased spaces owing to financial constraints. “Though about 70% of our customers are working professionals, there are business owners too who are using our services,” said Rahul Bellubi, head of digital marketing at StowNest Storage. The Bengaluru-based facility forayed into the Hyderabad market in December 2020, on realising the potential it held. “Now, we have over 20,000 square feet (sft) of storage space here,” he added. Other prominent brands from neighbouring Karnataka too — many with a small footprint in the past — have expanded their operations in the city now. “Pre-Covid-19, we had just about 30,000 sft of space here; that’s hit 1.5 lakh sft post-Covid-19,” said Ramesh Madisetty, co-founder and CEO of SafeStorage that offers services across five cities in India. Madisetty said his team in Hyderabad receives about 80 to 100 calls from prospective customers every day. “I think this will continue for a while since I do not see any of our clients returning to collect their stored items. Only one or two such cases have come to our notice so far,” he added. Agrees, Amit Pramanik, COO of Home Triangle that debuted in the market only a few months before the pandemic. “We have seen the business pick up phenomenally ever since. In fact, we have been able to cater to only 60% to 70% of the customers owing to the rush,” he said adding that 30% to 40% of the Bengaluru-headquartered firm’s traffic comes from Hyderabad. Several students pursing higher education too are seen using these services with their classes moving online. “Students from the districts who were living in paid accommodation have now gone back to their homes. They have stored their books and small belongings with us,” said Ankit Sharma, partner, StorageXperts that he floated with a friend in November 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/storage-on-rent-units-thrive-in-city-as-wfh-techies-head-home/articleshow/83590961.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Ahmedabad||Rs 5,000 crore revival: 60 new plants in Morbi||AHMEDABAD: The ceramics hub of Morbi seems to have bounced back after some factories were shut down recently due to weak domestic demand during the second Covid-19 wave. Moreover, Tauktae that hit parts of Gujarat in May also took a toll on demand. “About 60 new plants with capex of Rs 5,000 crore are expected to be up and running by December this year,” according to a report. “The demand for exports has risen to 35-40% currently, up from 20-25% pre-Covid.” The report, by Edelweiss Research, says that exports are likely to touch more than 50% over the next two years for the ceramics industry. In FY21, exports for the industry stood at Rs 13,000-14,000 crore, whereas the domestic market was at Rs 43,000 crore. The report titled ‘Good times set to prevail for brands’ dated June 14 states that about 300 factories had shut operations in Morbi around May 19. The reasons were weak domestic demand and the one-off scare caused by the cyclone. Of the 300 factories, 150 resumed production recently and in the next 10 days, 90% of production from Morbi is expected to resume. The impact of the second Covid wave has been significant on domestic demand, which has declined more than 50%. Exports, meanwhile, have suffered the least (10-15%), the report said. High container freight rates have had some effect on exports. “Over the last five-six days, the situation has been improving with opening up of markets across the country,” the report said. “More than half the factories that had shut operations are now up and running while others are ramping up utilization.” The Edelweiss Research team had interacted with officials of Morbi Ceramic Association (Wall Tiles). More than 90% of India’s ceramics production comes from Morbi and the world’s leading brands are produced here through the outsourcing model. There are more than 950 factories in Morbi. For the new factories, there has been a delay of 3-4 months as machinery supplies from China and Italy are running late. Higher freight rates are delaying deliveries and there have been installation delays at Morbi in the wake of the second wave. “While delays in large capacity additions is positive for branded players, the major advantage is these new plants are mainly targeted at exports (60-70% of supplies),” the report said. “Hence, they might have limited impact on domestic supplies, pricing and margins.” Given the large size of the cluster, Morbi is looking to reduce its dependence on only the Indian market and target the world’s leading markets also. Indonesia has put a safeguard duty against Indian tile exports. Despite this 12-13% duty, exports to Indonesia did not reduce, according to the report. Despite the anti-dumping duty (ADD) of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (approximately 40% of total exports pre-ADD) for almost a year, Morbi was still able to supply 70% of its annual exports. “Out of the six countries, only Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are imposing ADD,” according to the sectoral report. “Also, these countries are likely to review imposition of duty.” China and India are neck-and-neck on pricing as clay cost and power cost is almost similar in India and China. Labour cost for China is 10% higher than for India and some parts of China are still using coal, and pricing for gas is more competitive, the report said. Morbi, which has emerged as the country’s largest hub for natural gas consumption over the past two years, saw its consumption going down from 7.5-7.8 million cubic metres to 4 million cubic metres during the second wave. Over the past ten days, it has reached 5 million cubic metres and is expected to rise to 5.5-6 million cubic metres in the next 15 days with further opening of markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-5k-crore-revival-60-new-plants-in-morbi/articleshow/83586388.cms||Maulik Pathak

On June 12, Hussainialam police received an alert about the body of a man in his twenties lying at an under-construction building near Asha Talkies in Shahalibanda. Police identified the victim as Syed Zubair Ali, 22, a fruit vendor from Bahadurpura. As the victim was stabbed to death, police recorded the statements of his family members and friends to identify the accused. The complainant, Syed Munawar Ali, brother of the victim, told police that he suspected the role of Zubair’s friends —Salam, Tariq, Muzaffar and others — as they had quarrelled with him several times. As part of the investigation, police picked up the suspects, Salam Bin Abdullah Basloom, 23, Md Muzaffer Ali Khan, 19, both garments store workers from Quzipura, and Tariq Ali, 19, a daily-wage worker from Chandrayangutta on Tuesday. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), South Zone, Gajara Bhupal said the accused were good friends. “Salam was involved in property offences and Tariq also has a criminal record. Salam suspected that Zubair gave information to police about his involvement in property offences and got him arrested,” the DCP said. “During the early hours of June 12, the accused met the victim at an under-construction building. After consuming liquor, they suddenly attacked Zubair with knives and killed him on the spot,” the DCP said. After committing the murder, the accused went to Shahin Nagar and changed their clothes. They took shelter near Shahin Nagar lake and police arrested them on Tuesday. Three knives and a cell phone were seized from their possession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-friends-held-for-fruit-vendors-murder/articleshow/83586266.cms||---

However, turnout on the first day of opening after the lockdown at restaurants didn’t have the usual hustle and bustle. The state government has allowed bars, clubs and restaurants to operate at 50% capacity. Most of the bigger restaurants only opened a part or a floor of their premises for the customers, keeping other portions or floors closed. Some restaurants continued with the ‘take home’ orders only. Vinay Harwani of a restaurants in Bhopal, said, “Turnout of customers has been low. It’s only after some days that we shall be able to gauge the response of people.” He said that the decision to allow restaurants to operate was communicated late at night, so they have only opened one floor. “Most of our staff had gone back home during the lockdown. We shall open the other floors when we have adequate manpower,” he said. Manoj Bhargava of another restaurant said, “We didn’t open our restaurant today. Our other restaurant was open and and the response was good.” On the other hand, bars had business as usual. “There was doubt in the morning as there was no mention of opening of bars in the news but by the afternoon, it became known that the bars have also opened,” said Rishabh, a customer at a bar. The barman of the hotel also appeared to be happy at the response as he said, “8-9 table lagi hain saheb subah se.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bars-clubs-bustle-with-high-footfall-eateries-stay-deserted/articleshow/83586274.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The department arranged the inoculation drive in association with the state health department. The drive will continue on Thursday. A total of 1,125 teachers were vaccinated on Wednesday, much less than the total number of 1,985 who were registered by the department. This is because many, thus registered, have already taken the shots. On Thursday 1,810 teachers and non-teaching staff have been registered. The largest numbers turned up at DPS Ruby Park, with 287 were vaccinated. At MP Birla Foundation, only 199 of the total 521 turned up. “We were a centre for East Kolkata and we felt proud offering our venue to the great cause,” said Shagufta Jain, a teacher of DPS Ruby Park. “We were proud that we could partner with the state in this initiative though we are a private school,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Rammohun Mission School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1000-teachers-and-support-staff-get-free-jabs-at-nodal-schools/articleshow/83586275.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Nagpur||Nagpur municipal corporation issued highest ever 7,500 death certificates in April this year||NAGPUR: There has been a whopping 394.76% increase in the number of death certificates issued by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in April this year as compared to 2020. Last year, NMC issued 1,527 death certificates in April, and in the corresponding month this year the figure was 7,555 (a rise of 6,028 deaths). The steep rise is largely attributed to the fatalities during the second Covid wave. “Probably, it was the first time in NMC’s history that it issued such a huge number of death certificates in any month,” said a senior NMC official from the birth and death registration department. Statistics also revealed a 122% increase in issuance of death certificates in the first five months of this calendar year. Against 9,968 death certificates issued from January 2020 to May 2020, the NMC issued 22,156 certificates in the corresponding period this year. “There are many who haven’t yet applied for a certificate and the actual number of deaths could be much higher than NMC records suggest,” an official said. Statistics procured from the department revealed that in April 2020 the number of deaths in the city had declined as compared to 2019. In 2019, the NMC had issued 2,159 death certificates, while it was 1,527 last year. The data revealed that in 2019, the NMC’s birth and death registration department issued 29,426 death certificates, while in 2020 it issued 31,651 certificates. In 2019, the average number of death certificates issued per month were 2,400. The department issued the highest number of certificates in January and February, at 2,848 and 2,743 respectively. In September 2020, when the city was reeling under the first Covid-19 wave NMC issued 5,006 death certificates, while at 1,399, the lowest number of certificates were issued in May 2020, the data revealed. In January, October and December 2020 too, the department issued 3,027, 3,817 and 3,306 death certificates respectively. In the first five months of 2021, the department issued 22,156 death certificates. Apart from 7,555 certificates issued in April, the birth and death registration department has also issued the second highest number of certificates in May at 6,892. So far in 2021, NMC has issued the fewest death certificates in February at 2,304.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-issued-highest-ever-7-5k-death-certificates-in-april-this-year/articleshow/83586288.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The Haryana government's rehabilitation policy, framed pursuant to the SC order of February 19, 2020, provided for rehabilitation of those who had been living in the unauthorised village before 2003. The present lot facing the demolition of houses in Khori village settled there after 2010. On June 7, the SC had dismissed petitions seeking stay of demolition of the unauthorised houses and refused to get swayed by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves's arguments focussing on humanitarian issues staring at the settlers and their children during the pandemic.  The SC on June 7 had asked the corporation to complete demolition of all illegal structures on forest land within six weeks. Gonsalves had argued that the 2003 cut-off date in the rehabilitation policy was making almost all settlers ineligible and had requested the SC to direct the Haryana government to advance it till 2015. The SC had said the larger issue of rehabilitation cut-off date would be decided along with other pending petitions on July 27. On Thursday, advocate Aparna Bhat raised the same issues before the bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari. When the appeal on humanitarian grounds failed to impress the bench, Bhat said there were global guidelines barring eviction during the pandemic. The bench told her not to rely on global guidelines and said more than adequate time of one year was granted to the settlers to show documents to the authorities proving their title over the land/house or eligibility under the rehabilitation scheme.  "In our opinion, no indulgence can be shown to the petitioners and similarly placed persons who are bound by the earlier order dated June 7, 2021, passed by this court. The grievance of the petitioners that they are not allowed to produce documents in support of their eligibility regarding rehabilitation under the existing rehabilitation scheme is misconceived. The occupants of the unauthorised structures standing on forest land were given sufficient opportunity to do so after notification was issued by the corporation in 2020, after the order dated February 19, 2020, was passed by this court," the bench said. "The grievance of the petitioners that they are not in a position to produce title documents as these structures are erected on forest land belonging to the state does not take the matter further. The petitioners and similarly placed persons are and were obliged to produce documents before the corporation in support of their claim regarding rehabilitation under the existing rehabilitation scheme but which they failed to do," it added. "Needless to observe, this court had already recorded the assurance given by the corporation that action against unauthorised structures standing on forest land will be taken in accordance with law, including to examine the claim of the occupants for rehabilitation as per the existing rehabilitation scheme. That assurance has been reiterated and is so recorded in this order as well," the SC said.  The bench further said, "The corporation and state authorities may proceed on the basis of the commitment given to the court on the earlier occasion to comply with the directions given in order dated June 7, 2021. Nothing more is required to be said in this petition. We make it clear that pendency of this matter will not come in the way of the authorities to proceed against the unauthorised structures standing on forest land in conformity with the statement recorded hitherto."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/sc-no-stay-on-razing-of-houses-in-fbd-forest/articleshow/83617584.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||Centre refused nod to Delhi govt panel to probe O2 deaths: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Wednesday accused the Centre of denying approval for formation of an expert committee to look into complaints of Covid-19 deaths due to lack of oxygen and for granting ex gratia compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of patients who succumbed to the viral illness during the second wave. The order for formation of the committee was issued on May 27. Calling it unnecessary meddling in Delhi government’s affairs, deputy CM Manish Sisodia alleged, “The decision to dismiss the committee is unreasonable and without any logic. I would like to request the central government to stop such interference. I appeal to the Centre to stop unnecessary intervention and quit its childish practices. The people of Delhi want the elected government to work without any obstructions, but the Centre continues to act as an objector against their rights.” “During the second Covid-19 wave, there was an oxygen shortage and some deaths occurred due to lack of supply. Delhi government had announced compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of such deceased patients. Following a court directive, a committee of health experts was constituted to ascertain what led to these deaths. It’s extremely saddening that the Centre has dismissed this committee. I don’t understand why the central government has an issue with the same,” said Sisodia. Asking why the Centre likes to obstruct any good step or work being done by state governments, Sisodia said, “As a responsible government, we want to offer compensation to the families of those who died and also investigate and confirm what led to these deaths. The central government is not letting this happen.” Stressing that the Centre’s interference was not confined to Delhi, Sisodia claimed that it extended to many other states, including West Bengal, Maharashtra and Jharkhand. “The Centre should not have any issue with a state government offering compensation to the families of Covid patients who lost their lives due to lack of oxygen supply,” he added. The committee of officials had been tasked to look into complaints of deaths due to lack of oxygen and draw up the criteria to award compensation of up to Rs 5 lakh in such cases under the state’s schemes, including Rs 50,000 to the kin of those who had died due to Covid-19. However, the AAP government needed the approval of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal for forming the committee following the recent amendments to Government of National Capital Territory Act. According to sources, the LG denied approval to the committee because Supreme Court had already formed a panel for audit of supply, utilisation and distribution of oxygen supply in Delhi. The committee, which was formed on May 8 by the court, comprised AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, Max Hospital’s Sandeep Budhiraja and IAS officers from the Centre and Delhi government. The same committee could consider the complaints of deaths due to oxygen shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-refused-nod-to-delhi-govt-panel-to-probe-o2-deaths-sisodia/articleshow/83586569.cms||AlokKNMishra

Union minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways Mansukh Mandaviya and Union minister of state for culture Prahlad Singh Patel were present during the ceremony to sign the MoU. The ceremony was held at Transport Bhavan, New Delhi. The NMHC will be developed in the vicinity of the ASI site of Lothal, located about 80km from Ahmedabad. The complex will be developed as an international tourist destination, where the maritime heritage of India from ancient to modern times will be showcased. The edutainment approach using the latest technology will be adopted to spread awareness about India’s maritime heritage. For developing the project, the land transfer formalities have been completed and all land-related clearances and the environmental nod have been obtained. The NMHC will be developed in an area of about 400 acres. It will house unique structures such as National Maritime Heritage Museum, Lighthouse Museum, Heritage Theme Park, museum-themed hotels, maritime-themed eco-resorts, and Maritime Institute. These will be developed in a phased manner. Speaking on the occasion, Mandaviya said that the NMHC is to be developed as a first-of-its-kind centre in the country dedicated to the legacy of maritime heritage of India.

---||Ahmedabad||‘If Jehangir and Mumtaz graves were shifted, so can these’||AHMEDABAD: If the graves of Mughal royalty could be shifted in the past, those falling in the route of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project can also be shifted: This was the contention placed by the National High-Speed Rail Corporation Ltd before the Gujarat State Waqf Tribunal. It was opposing the suit filed by trustees of a cemetery in Bharuch’s Tham village, disputing its bid to acquire the graveyard’s land to lay down pillars for the elevated Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. The bullet train project implementing agency also offered compensation and showed willingness to shift the graves from the cemetery to another place at its own expense. However, the tribunal did not agree to the proposals and insisted that NHSRCL should slightly alter the alignment so that the route would pass through the cemetery’s open land . Thereby, saving the graves from being destroyed. The NHSRCL had filed an objection application, demanding rejection of the suit filed by the trustees against the authority’s bid to acquire 2,507 sq m land to lay down pillars for the elevated train. It submitted before the tribunal that Mughal queen Mumtaz’s grave was shifted from Burhanpur to Taj Mahal in Agra, and emperor Jehangir’s grave was moved from Kashmir to Lahore. “Looking at these instances, graves can be shifted,” the authority submitted, seeking the tribunal’s permission for the move. However, holding that according to a Supreme Court’s order, shifting of graves is not permissible unless they are constructed in an unauthorised manner, the tribunal suggested that NHSRCL should opt for an alternative remedy. It said the project is ambitious, in public as well as national interest, and the prime minister himself has fixed the deadline for its completion. Wishing to avoid any hindrance to the project, the tribunal said the project officer could make slight alteration to the alignment from a few kilometres away, so that the route passed through the cemetery’s open land. The tribunal accepted arguments advanced by trustee’s advocate Saquib Ansari that though the cemetery was not registered, it is considered waqf land as the land has been used for burial since 1958. For acquisition of such land, the law prescribes certain procedures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/if-jehangir-and-mumtaz-graves-were-shifted-so-can-these/articleshow/83586292.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Jaipur||Youth who invented chess board for six players dies in Jaipur||JAIPUR: The youngest patent holder of India Hridayeshwar Singh Bhati passed away in Jaipur following cardiac arrest on Wednesday. He suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a fatal disease that made him wheelchair bound and eventually took his life. Bhati invented a circular chess board for six players in 2012 and patented the same at the age of nine. This made him the youngest patent holder of India and youngest patent holder with disability in the world. Hridayeshwar’s father Sarovar Singh Bhati said that his son lived a proud life with positive approach. “He never let his disability become a hurdle in his life. In the end, he wasn’t able to move any part of his body except his fingers, eyes and brain activity. But he never let it impact him and kept smiling. I will remember my son as a braveheart who made our nation proud,” said Bhati. He was awarded with Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Pruaskar in 2020 and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind. Soravar said, “There were six chess players in our apartment of my son’s age. He didn’t like the idea of only two players playing at a time and demanded me to buy a chess board on which more boys can play. When I told him no such chess board is available, he wanted to develop such a chess board.” Taking inspiration from Stephen Hawking, Bhati worked tirelessly on the six-player chess board. His parents, both teachers in schools, helped him whenever necessary. Today, Bhati has left his body, but he became a role-model for millions of children across the globe presenting the fact that disability can never prevent you from reaching your dream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/youth-who-invented-chess-board-for-six-players-dies/articleshow/83588855.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Experts call for change in Vitamin A supplementation||HYDERABAD: Nutrition experts have called for a policy change at the national level on vitamin A supplementation, stating that vitamin A deficiencies in young children are no longer a public health problem in India. They argued that vitamin A supplementation may lead to excess dosage of vitamin A or hypervitaminosis. Researchers from the city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), St John’s Research Institute, Bangalore and Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research, New Delhi, warned of a possible risk of hypervitaminosis. In their study published in the prestigious American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers evaluated whether Vitamin A deficiencies still presented a serious public health problem among children below five years of age in India. The study suggests that the national prevalence of vitamin A deficiency risk is below 20 per cent in Indian children. "It is high time the mega-dose of vitamin A is revised and a targeted state-based vitamin A supplementation program was taken up, unlike the nation-wide program that is currently the norm in India," the study says.  The study drew on the sample of the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) which was conducted in 30 states during 2016-2018, said National Institute of Nutrition director Dr Hemalatha R. “The survey showed that vitamin A deficiency based on serum retinol levels was 15.7% among 1-5-year-old children across the country, certainly lesser than the 20% mark that defines a serious public health problem", she said. There were very few children (as low as 0.4%) with very low serum retinol values at which serious clinical problems are likely to manifest. But there were no significant differences in serum retinol values between urban and rural children, and boys and girls.  The study also derived the estimated average requirement as 198 and 191 micro grams per day for boys and girls, respectively for assessing dietary adequacy of Vitamin A.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-call-for-change-in-vitamin-a-supplementation/articleshow/83586296.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Ahmedabad||Fake remdesivir racket: Accused refused bail||AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Wednesday refused bail to one Harsh Patel alias Pappu, who was booked along with others for selling duplicate remdesivir injections when there was a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases. Denying Patel’s bail plea, additional sessions judge V V Parmar said, “This court is of the candid opinion that there is very strong prima facie case against the applicant looking to the role attributed to the applicant, his wilful participation in the conspiracy of selling duplicate remdesivir injections for his personal gain, and therefore, no discretionary powers can be used in favour of the applicant.” Patel sought bail claiming innocence with the argument that though he works with one Ashirwad Hospital in Himmatnagar, he does not have any knowledge of the medical field. Public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt opposed the bail plea and submitted that Patel, along with co-accused Mayur Chandubhai Dudhat, Nidhi Goswami and Vipulpuri Mukeshpuri Goswami, was found to be involved in the conspiracy to sell duplicate remdesivir injections to patients for personal gain. They used to collect empty vials of remdisivir injections, fill them with other injections used for Covid-19 treatment namely Lactagrad and Pipzo. They then charged Rs 12,000 to Rs 35,000 for an injection. After hearing the case, the court said, “Remdesivir injections are administered to Covid patients who are extremely critical and if duplicate injections are administered, the patient does not recover and this results in a high death toll in the pandemic. The accused played with the lives of the patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fake-remdesivir-racket-accused-refused-bail/articleshow/83586300.cms||---

The family also had to shell out a huge hospital bill of Rs 80 lakh on their treatment. His wife and son, who also tested positive, have recovered. The businessman’s mother died first on May 12, while he succumbed in a corporate hospital in Gachibowli on June 8. His younger sister died a week later, on June 14. Despite a surge in Covid-19 cases and warning against social gathering, the businessman organised his wedding anniversary at a function hall on April 28 amid fanfare. He felt unwell the very next day. With other members of the family too showing symptoms of Covid-19, they got themselves tested on May 1. The businessman, his wife, their 20-year-old son, his sister (45) and 70-year-old mother were infected with the virus. The mother was immediately admitted to a private hospital in Shamshabad where she died 10 days later. Meanwhile, his condition also deteriorated and he died on June 8. His sister was taken to another hospital in Gachibowli where she succumbed to the virus on Monday. While a pall of gloom descended on Thondupally village where the family resides, his wife and son battled with the virus and survived. They said though they spent Rs 80 lakh for treatment, the three members did not survive. The deceased businessman has two more sons who were not affected by the virus. “What has happened in the village is tragic. Every person in the village is sad because of the deaths in the family,” former sarpanch of Tondupally Bakka Rathnam told TOI. According to Rathnam, there have been more Covid-19 deaths in the village in the last three months. “People are taking precautions but even now at least a dozen people are Covid-19 positive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wedding-anniv-fete-proves-fatal-for-bizman-family-3-die-of-covid/articleshow/83586658.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BSP chief Mayawati raps Samajwadi Party for cosying up to rebels||LUCKNOW: A day after five rebel BSP MLAs met Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, triggering speculation of a switch-over before assembly polls, BSP chief Mayawati termed the meeting an eyewash. She said it was a “drama” aimed at deriving mileage in the run-up to elections of zila panchayat chairpersons and block pramukhs. Lashing out at SP for being a casteist outfit adept at manipulation and poaching, Mayawati said, by using the media to put out news of a meeting with BSP MLAs, SP was trying to fool people. “BSP suspended these MLAs a long time back when they sabotaged the Rajya Sabha election of a Dalit in association with Samajwadi Party and an industrialist. If SP was honest in its dealings with these MLAs, it would not have kept them in limbo for so long. The party is aware that if these BSP MLAs join their party, their own members would rebel. And some are already waiting to join BSP,” the former UP chief minister said. The seven members who were suspended by Mayawati in October 2020 included Chaudhary Aslam Ali, Hakim Lal Bind, Mohammad Mujtaba Siddiqui, Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel, Hargovind Bhargava and Bandana Singh. More recently, on June 3, Mayawati expelled the head of BSP legislative party and former minister Lalji Verma and former state president Ram Achal Rajbhar from the party on charges of anti-party activity during panchayat elections. Earlier, two other MLAs had rebelled as well. Thus, the party is left with seven MLAs of the 19 elected in 2017. BSP and SP had come together in a historic move to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in a ‘mahagatbandhan’, but their relationship has been wobbly since Mayawati called off ties after the election debacle in which the two managed only 15 seats of 80. Mayawati has since accused SP of working against dalits, a charge she repeated even on Wednesday. “It is known that SP has always been anti-Dalit and they are refusing to change themselves. When SP was in power, it stopped all projects initiated by the previous BSP government and created hurdles in the formation of Sant Ravidas Nagar district,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-raps-sp-for-cosying-up-to-rebels/articleshow/83588898.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Goa||Goa: Cancer survivors, lactating moms help others beat vaccine hesitancy||MARGAO: With a focus on reducing deaths and hospitalisations due to Covid-19, the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) has begun combatting vaccine hesitancy via social media. The group is gathering pictures of vaccine beneficiaries from high risk categories such as cancer survivors and patients with heart condition and influencers. These are then being circulated to encourage others to get inoculated. ‘Be Responsible’ and ‘get vaccinated’ messages accompany the posters of an 85-year-old heart patient and cancer survivor on blood thinners, a lactating mother and several others, including a lecturer at Carmel College, a Redemptorist priest, a cyclist from the Xaxti Riders group, etc, all of whom have taken the vaccine. “We try to put up posters of those with comorbidities and lactating mothers to tell people that the vaccine is for this group of people too and that one shouldn’t stay away just because of comorbidities. Once you get a goahead from your doctor, please take the vaccine,” one member said. The group is also getting brooches made, which vaccine beneficiaries can wear with pride at their work place to announce their status. “The whole idea is to reduce mortalities and hospitalisation,” said association president Dr Rita Vas. The association wants people to be inspired by vaccine beneficiaries from the high risk categories. “The second wave is fatal and infectious and the only option is to get vaccinated,” she said. Ambassadors, the kind that are appointed during elections, have been missing from the vaccination campaign. The association is trying to fill this gap by finding leaders and influencers across sections of society. “We cannot be wearing a mask throughout our life. The only other solution is to get vaccinated,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cancer-survivors-lactating-moms-help-others-beat-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/83588904.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Nagpur||High court slams government over relocation of Nagpur villages, other issues at Tadoba||NAGPUR: Expressing concern over various issues pertaining to Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) like relocation of villagers from protected areas and vacancies for post of forest officials, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday slammed the Maharashtra government for not taking steps since 2009 when a suo motu PIL was filed to address these issues. While hearing the case that came up for hearing after 12 years, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor directed the government to file a comprehensive reply on a variety of issues raised in the petition within two weeks. The HC had taken suo motu cognizance of TOI reports on pitiable conditions in TATR due to vacancies that had led to its closure in November 2008. Senior counsel Chandrashekhar Kaptan was amicus curiae to plead the case. On September 9, 2009, he had sought directives to the respondents to produce on record a tiger conservation plan tripartite agreement entered with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). Then government pleader Nitin Sambre (Now HC judge) had assured to provide copies of both documents within two weeks. The government has failed to submit both documents. “The petition opens various issues related to preservation and conservation of precious forest areas in Maharashtra, a majority of which are located in Vidarbha, particularly in TATR in Chandrapur. The famous park frequented by the tourists was suddenly closed down in 2008 due to non-availability of forest officials. The decision was shocking and spoke volumes about the non-performance and negligence of the government, which was its constitution duty,” the bench said. While listing out several issues for conservation of the wildlife parks, the judges asked the government to undertake work of relocation and rehabilitation of villages from the protected areas on priority. “Out of many issues mentioned in the PIL, hardly few were addressed by the government. A majority of them still linger on since 2009. The perusal of recent orders indicates that the focus of HC is on relocation and rehabilitation of forest dwellers residing in the TATR’s protected areas,” the judges said. Citing the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and ‘Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006’, the judges said both are two distinct methods to resettle the dwellers and it’s up to the government to choose the way by which it would perform its statutory duty. “It appears that the provisions of the Wildlife Act stand in the way of relocating the villages to other areas. There is a need to explore provisions of both Acts. We direct the government to apply its mind and come out with a solution. It would be necessary for it to file a reply on specific issues,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-slams-govt-over-relocation-of-villages-others-issues-at-tadoba/articleshow/83586306.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

When they didn’t get any, the kids knocked the neighbour’s door saying they were hungry and father “was not talking to them”. Suspecting something amiss, the neighbours went into their home and found their father’s body, hanging low from the ceiling. Manoj Dayal, 32, whose body was found at his home in Bareilly on Tuesday evening, had returned from Noida after the lockdown was clamped. He was working from home at a reduced salary and his wife was living with her parents after a tiff. Police said that Dayal most likely killed himself three days ago as his body was decomposing. “The children lived with their father’s body for three days and the hunger forced them to come out,” a police officer said. Their mother had left the home on Thursday. The four-year-old girl and the boy, 6, are under trauma. The neighbour, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “The children came home crying as their father was not talking to them and neither giving them any food. We later found him dead. It was difficult to stand for a moment inside the house because of the foul smell.” Bareilly’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “The post-mortem report confirmed the reason of death as ante-mortem hanging. The body was nearly three days old and children were living in the same house with the corpse of their father. They are with their uncle now. No FIR has been lodged as of now and it is a case of suicide.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-kills-himself-2-kids-live-with-body-for-three-days-before-coming-out-for-food-in-bareilly/articleshow/83584278.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s vaccine stocks to last till June 20||HYDERABAD: The Covid-19 vaccination drive in the state may get yet another break as health officials have stock for just four days. Also, there is no clarity on how many doses the state will get for the free vaccine drive announced by the Centre for people aged 18 years and above from June 21. At present, the vaccine drive for high-risk groups and self-help groups would continue till Thursday. The vaccine stock currently available with the state government would be enough till June 20. The Centre had promised to deliver free vaccine doses for people aged 18 years and above from June 21. “We don’t have any information on how many vaccine doses the state will get from the Centre. Till then, we may have to stall temporarily giving first dose,” a top source said. The state is expecting vaccine stocks in the last week of June or July first week. “About 12 lakh doses have to be delivered to the state. After calculating how many compulsory secondary doses are needed, we will take a decision,” health department sources said. “We will, however, continue giving second doses,” they added. The Centre had issued guidelines that state governments should facilitate private hospitals to purchase vaccine stocks, as their share would be 25% of the total vaccines. “We have doses to last for a few days. After that, there are no guidelines from the state government on how to go about placing orders. We are waiting for it,” a private hospital’s procurement manager told TOI. Private hospitals too were finding it difficult to place orders owing to the new guidelines. The vaccine drive in specific groups and people aged 45 and above went on swiftly, but for the 18-44 age-group it was progressing at a slow pace. Till Tuesday, 19,73,042 people were given doses and only 2,108 had taken the second dose. Meanwhile, Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy on Wednesday said there was need to panic on Covid-19 vaccine stock. “Production will be enhanced in the country. Efforts are on to complete the vaccine drive for all in the country by December-end,” he said.

We recorded how they entered her house and how much time they spent there. The spot where they partied and the alleged rape took place,” said a police official. The cops have taken statements of five eye-witnesses under section CrPC 164 before a magistrate. All the eye-witnesses including the rape victim’s friend, who was present at the party, identified the accused duo as Dishant Kahar and Nazeem Mirza. During the reconstruction, the cops found cold drinks and pizza from the girl’s residence on Wednesday. Both Kahar and Mirza had gone to the house of the girl on that fateful evening and got drunk. Kahar then allegedly raped the girl who too was in an inebriated state while Mirza is also suspected of having sexually abused her. The cops said that the duo had pre-planned the crime as they had been prying on her for months. The police have also arrested the bootlegger from whom Mirza had bought the liquor. “We have nabbed Ashish Kahar who sold the liquor. During the raid at his house, we found some more liquor bottles following which we filed another case under the Prohibition Act,” said the police. The five-day remand of the accused will end on Thursday and the cops are expected to seek further remand. “We are waiting for the FSL test reports to ascertain if both the accused raped her,” said a senior police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-reconstruct-crime-scene-at-suicide-victims-house/articleshow/83582871.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Women on top in Gondia and Bhandara vax drives||Mumbai: Bucking the trend of gender disparity widely seen in the state and most parts of the country, two Vidarbha districts, Gondia and Bhandara, have vaccinated more women than men. In Gondia, 3,347 more women have been vaccinated; in Bhandara, 2,567 more women have taken the shots than men till Wednesday (see box). In all but these two districts, more men have got inoculated, according to CoWin data. Overall, in Maharashtra, men account for 54% of the total number of people inoculated. In absolute numbers, over 16 lakh more men have taken the vaccine in the state. The trend in Gondia and Bhandara has come as a pleasant surprise as the gender disproportion in some of the other districts in the region has been massive. In nearby Gadchiroli, for instance, which has a comparable population, nearly 13,000 more men have got the vaccine. In Chandrapur in Vidarbha too, almost 24,000 more men have taken the vaccine. Both Gondia and Bhandara are among districts with a better sex ratio -- 996 and 984, respectively. But, according to P Arokiasamy of the International Institute of Population Science (IIPS), a balanced sex ratio is unlikely to have such an outcome. “It could be local factors such as the administration’s handling of the drive,” he said. However, officials themselves are surprised and are looking for answers. Dr Nitin Kapse, Gondia’s district health officer, said, the vaccination awareness programmes were designed for both men and women. “We don’t know why such a trend has emerged. But we have intensified vaccination and are targeting village by village,” he said, adding that resistance was a big factor. “Once we have covered those who are willing, we will intensify the drive to reach those who are hesitant,” he added. Both these districts have vaccinated nearly 50% of the population above 45 with one dose. Sunanda Vasashankar, an ASHA worker who has been working in Bhandara city, believes there could be multiple reasons, ranging from hesitancy to vaccine shortage. “The answer I repeatedly hear from women is that they don’t want their husbands to suffer any side-effects since it will keep them away from work. The few men that we convince sometimes get discouraged looking at long queues or hearing of shortages,” she said. Madhuri Mathurkar, Bhandara’s additional district health officer, said more men were affected in the second wave and have to wait at least three months to get vaccinated. Also, women who stay at home often get vaccinated since ASHAs keep prodding them, she said. “Earlier, we used to vaccinate at primary health centres but now we have taken the drive to villages,” she said. A state official said gender disparity should be seen relatively. “Maharashtra has about 7-8% more men than women hence, more men are getting vaccinated. But the gap is wider in some districts no doubt,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-women-on-top-in-gondia-and-bhandara-vax-drives/articleshow/83588909.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: Hyderabad had positive rate of 0.78% last week, 47% PCR tests||HYDERABAD: Between June 9 and June 15, the city had a Covid-19 positivity rate of 0.78 per cent. What is also significant is that 47 per cent of the tests conducted during this period were RT-PCR tests. While the rate of RT-PCR testing is higher in Hyderabad and neighbouring districts than other districts of the state, the city’s testing capacity is still low compared to many other districts and major cities in other states. Given the scenario, experts have warned against over-reliance on any single method of testing. In other districts, antigen testing account for 70 to 90 per cent of tests while Medchal-Malkajgiri and Rangareddy districts have RT-PCR contribute 52 and 50 per cent of total tests respectively. Health experts said the state has to follow a mix-and-match formula for testing. Professor for operations management at Indian School of Business (ISB) Hyderabad Sarang Deo who is currently studying the testing patterns in several states, has observed that states have to follow the dual swab system method advised by World Health Organisation (WHO) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Under the dual swab system, two samples can be taken from the same person of which one can be sent for RT-PCR testing and the other for antigen. If the antigen test returns positive then there is no need for an RT-PCR. “Many states don’t follow this and simply adopt the formula of 70 per cent antigen and 30 per cent RT-PCR testing. There should not be too much dependence on either antigen or RT-PCR,” Professor Deo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-had-ve-rate-of-0-78-last-week-47-pcr-tests/articleshow/83586846.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He stated in the FIR that the girl was married to another person even after she was married to Soni. Soni stated that he was staying with his father after his mother passed away. He was unmarried, and his father asked Mukesh Agarwal to find a suitable match for his son. Mukesh introduced him to one Laxmi Sindhi who informed the family that she knew of a prospective bride who is from a poor family. Soni stated he was introduced to the bride-to-be, Sonal Panchal, and both the families visited each other’s homes. Sonal came to Alpesh’s house and Alpesh with his relative went to Sonal’s house near Dastan farm in Naroda area. Later the marriage was fixed and Alpesh was called on May 14 to the office of an advocate in Gomtipur area and after preparing the marriage documents a priest, Dashrath Arya, married Alpesh and Sonal according to Hindu rituals, stated the complainant. He said that Rs 2.5 lakh was paid in cash to one Lalita Panchal who was identified as relative of Sonal and another Rs 50,000 was paid through electronic transaction to Laxmi. Soni said that Sonal came to his residence and after eight days Lalita arrived and took Sonal away for religious rituals. He stated that he was called to take back Sonal after four days, but she never returned, and when he inquired at her residence he found she was missing and the house was locked. Later, he was contacted by one Rajnikanth Sukhadiya of Randheja and he informed Soni that Sonal had married his son before marrying Soni. Soni stated that later he learned that after his marriage Sonal had married another Prakash Rana who stays in Nava Vadaj.

Patel, who is facing some half a dozen criminal cases related to land grabbing, had sought regular bail after the police filed charge-sheet in these cases. He argued that the dispute was with regard to a Power of Attorney prepared in 1991, and the complainant had knowledge about the document since 2006, but the FIR was filed in 2020 with a view to extort money from him and his family. Opposing the pleas, public prosecutor Pravin Trivedi submitted that the accused is a land grabber and three similar offences have been registered against him in Vastrapur police stations and two other such offences in Sola police station. If he is released on bail, there is strong chance of him hampering and tampering with prosecution evidence and witnesses. After hearing the arguments, the court said that there is prima facie reason to believe that Patel is involved in the activity of grabbing the lands of poor citizens and farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/raman-patel-denied-bail-in-two-cases/articleshow/83586327.cms||---

The Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), the body leading the project in Dhannipur, got its Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) account opened. The account is in the main branch of the State Bank of India in New Delhi. Meanwhile, IICF also named the senior-most member of UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, Tajdar Alam, as its incumbent trustee until the new chief executive officer of the waqf board is not appointed by the government. The board CEO is the ex-officio member of the trust as per IICF trust deed. “We had applied for the FCRA account on June 14 and got the approval intimation letter on Wednesday,” said IICF spokesperson and secretary Athar Husain. “Now, IICF will formally move for approval from the ministry of home affairs for operational functioning of the FCRA account. We have identified donors for the project and since it is not going to be a crowdfunding campaign, the FCRA approval is an important step,” he said. The Dhannipur project focuses on developing a 300-bedded hospital, cultural centre with museum focusing on the first war of independence in 1857 and a community kitchen, in addition to the mosque. On Wednesday, an order signed by UP Sunni Waqf Board chairperson Zufar Faruqi said that since board CEO Syed Shoeb had been relieved from the post after having served his tenure, seniormost board member Tajdar Alam was being initiated into IICF in his place. “The government has to appoint a new CEO but in the absence of such an appointment, Tajdar Alam is the incumbent ex-officio trustee of IICF,” added Husain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-mosque-trust-opens-foreign-donation-a/c/articleshow/83588941.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: No agriculture fee on forest produce sold outside mandis||JAIPUR: Agriculture market fee and agricultural welfare fee will no longer be levied on all forest products including tendu leaves and other forest produce sold outside the Agricultural Produce Market premises. A decision to this effect has been taken at the competent level after talks between the forest department and the agriculture department. After this decision, the system which has been running for the last 40 years in the state will end. Principal chief conservator of forests (forest-force chief) Shruti Sharma informed that keeping in view the demand of the traders involved in the trade of tendu leaves, wood and other forest produce, these products are being sold outside the agri mandi premises of the agricultural market. The mandis used to charge mandi fees. A proposal was sent by the forest department to the agriculture department to exempt fees from the forest produce which was now accepted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-agriculture-fee-on-forest-produce-sold-outside-mandis/articleshow/83588964.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Garment production cost shoots up by 30% as inputs turn pricey||Coimbatore: Garment exporters in Tirupur said the production cost of garments had gone up by 30% since December 2019, because of the skyrocketing prices of raw materials, mainly that of yarn.Raja M Shanmugam, president, Tirupur Exporters’ Association, said the yarn price had shot up by more than 40% in the past six months. “We expected it to drop during the lockdown, but in vain. The price is still going upwards.”Pointing out that they had incurred losses because of the lockdown, he said they were forced to send the goods through air cargo rather than shipping them, as they were in a hurry to deliver the products to the buyers in scheduled time. “The change in mode of transportation alone has cost us dear. Given that our profit margin is as meagre as 5% to 7% of the export value, the loss is going to be huge.”Explaining that most of the industries were in the process of minimizing their losses, Kumar Duraisamy, an exporter, said they were now working with just 25% of the workforce and producing lesser percentage of goods. “But the basic expenses like the building rent and electricity charges remain the same. If we were producing about 2,000 pieces of garment with a basic expense of Rs 1 lakh earlier, now we are producing only 400 pieces while spending the same amount.”He said the lockdown was very different this time. “Last year, we were at the end of a season and most of the orders were dispatched. Importantly, the lockdown was imposed across the world. But now, we are in the middle of a season and orders are pending. And the lockdown is enforced only in India. We cannot compare both the lockdowns at all.”The garment sector has two main seasons - summer season (September to March) and winter between (April to August).G R Senthilvel, secretary, Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers’ Association, said the impact of the lockdown would be felt only after the industries start to function in a full-fledged manner. “The lockdown relaxation has instilled a sense of confidence among our buyers, who are happy to see us resuming work. This will help us retain our buyers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/garment-production-cost-shoots-up-by-30-as-inputs-turn-pricey/articleshow/83586484.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand hills see surge in bookings for the weekend; hoteliers happy, locals concerned||MUSSOORIE/NAINITAL: After a gap of months and at the fag end of the peak summer season, tourism is finally picking up in the hills. After the state government recently allowed tourists the option to carry negative rapid antigen tests to gain entry into Uttarakhand, apart from RT-PCR which was the only test method allowed earlier, hotel owners said weekend bookings had surged to 50% occupancy. They said they were expecting more bookings once further relaxations are allowed from the unlock process which will start on June 22. “We are getting a lot of enquiries for the coming weekend and hopefully, Mussoorie will see up to 50% hotel occupancy. The tariffs are low and nowhere compared to the usual peak season tariffs but at least tourist influx has begun,” said Sanjay Aggarwal, secretary of Mussoorie Hotels Association (MHA) “We are expecting that when the government allows further relaxations to the Covid curfew, tourist activity will get an impetus. We hope shops are allowed to open and curfew timings are relaxed,” said RN Mathur, president of MHA. Local residents, meanwhile, are apprehensive about the prospect of tourists flocking the hill town. “Increase in tourist footfall also increases the risk of spread of Covid-19, especially since it is difficult to ensure social distancing, wearing of masks and other Covid protocol when there are large crowds. We have seen it happen the last time the lockdown was lifted,” said a resident of Mussoorie who did not wish to be named. In Nainital, hoteliers said while they had received an increased number of queries for weekend bookings, many tourists cancelled when they learnt about the weekend curfew. Ved Sah, secretary of the Nainital Hotels and Restaurants Association, said that barely a few rooms in hotels of the Lake Town were booked for the upcoming weekend. “People are thinking that because Delhi and UP have completely opened up, there will be no curbs in Nainital either. But we have to inform them that they will be confined to their rooms if they visit on weekends, which has led to several cancellations,” Sah said. He added that the condition on the weekdays is no different either. “Not many people are willing to travel. Some hotels on the town’s outskirts have bookings but most hotels, which like ours are at prime locations, are empty,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hills-see-surge-in-bookings-for-the-weekend-hoteliers-happy-locals-concerned/articleshow/83584330.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Kedar priest protests with ‘shirshasana’ in front of shrine to press for demand to dissolve Char Dham Devasthanam Board; says will do it for 7 days||DEHRADUN: Santosh Trivedi, a priest, could be seen performing ‘shirshasana’ outside the Kedarnath shrine on Wednesday and said he will do it for the next seven days unless the government accepts the demand of Char Dham priests to dissolve the Char Dham Devasthanam Board. Trivedi said the government must dissolve the Devasthanam Board or protests will intensify. Trivedi is the same priest who performed puja outside Kedarnath bare-bodied last winter. In the past two days, Char Dham priests’ protest has gathered momentum. Priests of Gangotri and Yamunotri performed puja wearing black armbands a few days ago. “This government is not interested in fulfilling our demands. They simply make fake promises to pacify us. This time, we will not bow down in front of them until the Devasthanam Board is dissolved,” Trivedi said. Earlier, at the Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s (VHP) margdarshak mandal meet in Haridwar in early April, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had said the Uttarakhand government would denotify 51 temples from the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act, "giving control of the shrines back to priests from the hands of bureaucrats". Repeating his promises to ‘teerth purohits’ (priests of the shrines) who had been agitating against the Devasthanam Board Act introduced by the Trivendra Rawat government — which brought the shrines under the control of the state government — the CM said that his government would review the Act. However, two months after making the promise, when the government did nothing to dissolve the board, the priests of Char Dham shrines have launched an agitation which started on June 11, in the form of a symbolic demonstration outside the four shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamonotri. Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of Devbhoomi Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said that the government cannot play with the religious emotions of priests by making false promises. “If the government thinks that they can keep us waiting to claim our own rights, they are wrong. We won't give up the fight this time until the government denotifies the Devasthanam Act,” Sati added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kedar-priest-protests-with-shirshasana-in-front-of-shrine-to-press-for-demand-to-dissolve-char-dham-devasthanam-board-says-will-do-it-for-7-days/articleshow/83581988.cms||Ishita Mishra

Jeki Chavda, a housekeeping worker at the city airport, was cleaning the trays at the security check counter after they were used by passengers, when he found a bundle of foreign currency in a transparent zip-lock bag in one of the trays.  “While cleaning and restacking the trays, I found a bundle of cash in a plastic bag in one of them. I immediately knew that a passenger must have forgotten it. So I went and handed it over to the CISF personnel at the security check counter,” said Jeki. Airport sources said that the cash was in foreign currency worth a total of $750. The incident took place around 5pm on Wednesday. “CISF personnel immediately examined the CCTV footage and identified likely passengers who may have forgotten the cash. After narrowing down the search to a few passengers, CISF officials approached them, verified which one had forgotten the cash and handed it over to him. The passenger in question was just about to board a Mumbai-bound Indigo airlines flight at the time,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/housekeeping-staffer-returns-750-to-flier/articleshow/83586486.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC hears Sanjiv Bhatt’s plea||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday completed hearing on a revision application filed by ex-IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt challenging different orders passed by a special court in Palanpur in March in connection with drug peddling case registered against him and his subordinate officer I B Vyas. Bhatt had raised objections to the trial court’s decision with regard to arraignment of 15 persons as accused in the case, about granting of pardon to former DySP Vyas by accepting his request to turn an approver and for altering the charges framed against Bhatt by the trial court in 2019. The HC has completed hearing and reserved its order on Bhatt’s challenge to the trial court’s orders. Earlier also, Bhatt had approached the HC raising the issue of Vyas turning an approver, but the HC had said that as a co-accused, he has got “No Say” in the matter of Vyas’s application to turn an approver and to seek pardon from the court. The HC had also clarified that Bhatt would get an opportunity to cross-examine Vyas, if the prosecution relied on his statement. The matter of granting pardon is strictly between the court and the accused. Bhatt and Vyas were booked under NDPS Act on allegations of planting opium on a Rajasthan-based lawyer Sumersingh Rajpurohit in a bid to evict him from a commercial property in Pali town. The property belonged to a woman, who was sister to a sitting high court judge. Bhatt was Banaskantha district superintendent of police then. Rajpurohit was allegedly picked up from Pali by the Banaskantha police and was booked for bringing opium to Palanpur. This incident gave rise to two prosecutions, one in Rajasthan and the other in Palanpur. Bhatt and Vyas were arrested in 2018 on charges of planting opium in order to frame the lawyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-hears-sanjiv-bhatts-plea/articleshow/83586475.cms||---

All this happened in the wee hours of Wednesday when night curfew was still on and police were deployed across the city to prevent traffic movement. Tanmay Pancholi, a resident of Aanal Tower near Commerce Six Roads in Navrangpura, said that the incident took place when he was returning home on his scooter.

However, the men gave chase and rammed into his scooter near Andhjan Mandal in Vastrapur. Two of the three men came out of the car, held him, thrashed him and pushed him inside the car. Pancholi told police they were objecting to him having an affair with a girl about whom Pancholi had no clue. Despite telling them that he did not know the girl they were mentioning, the three men kept thrashing him. They also allegedly threatened him with a knife, asking him to back off from pursuing the girl whom their friend was interested in. Pancholi said in the FIR that the three men taped his mouth shut and tied his hands as well. They took him to SG Road, threatening him all along the way. Around 7 am, they pushed him out of the car and threatened him to keep quiet or face death. They also threw his cellphone and office bag into the bushes near Khodiyar village.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Probe launched against bungalow renovation inside Corbett||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand forest department has set up a probe against the renovation of a bungalow — in which reinforced cement concrete was used — in the Dhikala zone of Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), which is among the most-visited zones of the reserve. The bungalow belongs to the forest department. Its renovation — allegedly involving permanent construction material — was carried out recently. However, carrying out permanent construction work of any kind is prohibited in the tiger reserves, according to norms. Taking cognisance of the alleged violation, Rajeev Bhartari, head of forest force directed Vijay Kumar, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APPCF), to set up a probe in the matter. Thereafter, a letter in this regard was sent to CTR director Rahul by Kumar. The copy of the letter duly signed by Kumar is available with TOI. The letter, which asks nine crucial questions, directs CTR authorities to respond to the probe into the alleged permanent construction work and questions if necessary permissions were taken from the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Government of India before the renovation. The CTR director has also been asked to submit a report in the matter to the forest department by June 14. When contacted, Rahul told TOI, “The matter is being examined by the senior officers of the forest department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/probe-launched-against-bungalow-renovation-inside-corbett/articleshow/83584336.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi government to cut back on expenses||NEW DELHI: The second Covid-19 wave has dealt a body blow to Delhi government’s financial health. The pandemic and then the lockdown to curb its exponential growth has led to decline in Delhi government’s revenue collection while its expenditure has gone up by 80% compared with the previous financial year. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has ordered rationalisation of the government’s expenditure, without affecting essential work and welfare schemes that benefit Delhiites. In a statement on Thursday, Sisodia, who is also the finance minister, said an “Order on Expenditure Management and Rationalisation of Expenditure — Covid-19 outbreaks” had been issued to rationalise the government’s expenditure and keep it within the resources during the pandemic. “The tax collection has declined due to the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown, while the expenditure has increased in comparison with the previous years for implementation of various relief and other measures to check the virus’ spread,” he said. The expenditure of Delhi government, he added, has increased around 80% during the first two months of the financial year 2021-22 as against the corresponding period in the previous fiscal. Due to the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases in April and May, the first two months of a financial year, the expenditure has jumped to Rs 8,511.1 crore in the current fiscal. In comparison, the expenditure during the first two months of the last fiscal was Rs 4,965.6 crore and in the same period in the financial year 2019-20, it was Rs 4,705.1 crore. While the expenditure has increased, the revenue receipts have been Rs 5,273.3 crore during the first two months of the current fiscal, Sisodia said. Delhi has spent Rs 3,237.8 crore more than its receipts, he said, adding that this gap was met from the last financial year’s savings. The statement said the order had been issued to curtail the expenditure, beyond the same for essential and daily functions. All welfare schemes will, however, run unchanged, the government stated. With the government facing a crunch since the economy has been impacted, the finance department had last year issued an order mandating every department to seek a nod from the Delhi cabinet for any expenditure above Rs 1 crore. For expenditure up to Rs 1 crore, the departments were asked to take necessary relaxation from the finance department first. The order also aims to achieve better cash management. However, expenditures related to salaries and allowances, medical reimbursement, pension of senior citizens and widows etc won’t require any additional approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-to-cut-back-on-expenses/articleshow/83617800.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The drive will also promote Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) among community members.“These wards have been selected on the basis of the high number of Covid cases,” said UWM vice president (community impact) Ajay Govale. The wards chosen for the campaign are Ward D — Grant Road, Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill, Breach Candy to Haji Ali; Ward F/N — Matunga, Sion, Wadala, Hindu Colony; Ward H/W — Bandra West, Khar West, Santacruz West; Ward K/E — Andheri East, Jogeshwari East, and Vile Parle East; Ward K/W — Andheri West, Jogeshwari West, and Vile Parle West; Ward N — Ghatkopar, Vidyavihar and Pant Nagar; Ward P/N — Malad, Manori, Marve, Aksa, and Madh; Ward P/S — Goregaon; Ward R/C — Borivali; Ward R/S — Kandivali and Charkop; Ward S — Bhandup, Powai, Kanjurmarg, Vikhroli and Nahur and Ward T — Mulund.The aim will be to eliminate vaccine hesitancy by addressing any misconceptions, providing information about process of registration on CoWin app, ways to book an appointment, information on the vaccine centres in the ward and walk-in facilities, among others.On the other hand, the drive to promote CAB will include stressing on the importance of masks, handwash/sanitizer, social distance, how to deal with Covid cases reported in society and norms of home isolation. Citizens will also be urged not to believe in or forward un-verified social media forwards.“We will connect with the active citizens’ groups and housing societies that can participate in this awareness campaign,” Govale said, adding, “We will train 2,400 citizen volunteers from 1,200 societies on how to spread awareness. This will benefit over 1.2 lakh Mumbaikars.” Interested citizens from housing societies can register at: bit.ly/UWM_RWAtraining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ngo-ties-up-with-bmc-for-new-campaign-to-end-vax-hesitancy/articleshow/83589048.cms||Somit Sen
---||Dehradun||PIL seeking cancellation of the last leg of Delhi-Dehradun expressway: HC issues notices to Union ministry of environment & forest, NHAI and Uttarakhand govt||NAINITAL: Hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking quashing of the approval given to the last leg of the proposed Delhi-Dehradun Expressway, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday issued notices to the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, the national highways authority of India (NHAI), the state government and the state's principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF). The PIL has been filed by Doon-based environmental activist Reenu Paul and was heard by the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma. Though Paul’s counsel, Abhijay Negi, asked the court for a stay on the project till the responses are filed by the authorities; the bench refused the demand saying that it would like to know the position taken by the NHAI and the state government and hear their justification for constructing the highway. The proposed Delhi-Dehradun Expressway, according to the government, will be a 210-km-long six-lane economic corridor which will reduce the travel time between the national capital and Dehradun from five to two hours. On the other hand, the petition says that there is already a two-lane road in the area with wide pavements and apart from one bottleneck – an old bridge – the rest of the stretch is broad enough to handle the traffic. According to the petition, a 19.7-kilometre-long stretch of the highway between Ganeshpur and Dehradun falls under the eco-sensitive zone of the Shivalik hills. This acts as the watershed/drainage area of the Doon valley. The PIL claims that the construction of a four-lane road in the region — which falls in the vicinity of a reserve forest — can have a “catastrophic” impact on the water security of the region and the biodiversity of the Rajaji National Park. “Slaughtering of almost 9,500 trees, several of which are Sal trees and almost a century old, for the mere purpose of reduction of the time to reach a destination cannot by any means be considered a viable option. Road widening by cutting trees and hills for faster movement of vehicles in the vicinity of reserve forest does not fall under developmental priority,” read the petition. It further said that before the project was sanctioned, the authorities did not even obtain the mandatory opinion of the state biodiversity board regarding the long-term impact of the construction on the biodiversity of the region. “It is a realized fact that once the biodiversity is lost and gone, not much can be done to recover the loss,” read the petition. The court has now given all the respondents two weeks to file their responses and has listed the case for further hearing on July 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-seeking-cancellation-of-the-last-leg-of-delhi-dehradun-expressway-hc-issues-notices-to-union-ministry-of-environment-forest-nhai-and-ukhand-govt/articleshow/83584341.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC bars constructions within Ameenpur FTL, buffer zone||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday directed the state government, its revenue, and municipal administration wings not to allow any constructions within the full tank level (FTL) and buffer zone areas spread over 464 acres of Ameenpur lake in the outskirts of Hyderabad. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave this interim direction while hearing a PIL filed by Hyderabad Birding Pals, a society run by nature conservationists and bird watchers. The society sought protection to this lake from encroachers and steps from the state and the union to preserve its pristine beauty as per the true spirit of the Biological Diversity Act 2002 and also in tune with the judgments passed by Supreme Court and Telangana high court in the past. According to them, Ameenpur lake with its habitations for rare birds was recognized as a Biodiversity Heritage Site (BHS) under Section 37 of the Biodiversity Act 2002 on November 21, 2016, and this has got the rare distinction of being the first urban lake in the entire country. D Raghavendar Rao, the counsel for the petitioner, said that some confusion over the extent of FTL of this lake was created on account of certain official actions who wrongly stated that the FTL is only 94 acres. In fact, the actual FTL is more than 464 acres, he said. “What was issued by HMDA was only a preliminary notification and a final notification specifying the actual extent has not yet been issued,” he said. “Mere protection to the FTL areas may not be of much help,” he added, and sought protection for all the 464 acres till HMDA defines the total extent of FTL in its final notification.

This is unacceptable. The government should honour the sentiments of devotees,” said BJP state president K Surendran. NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair in a press note said that the government should give a serious thought about permitting the devotees in a controlled manner to visit places of worship. He also said that the daily rituals in these places should also be held as per its schedule. Nair pointed out that the government, while giving relaxation in the lockdown rules, has allowed the opening of Bevco outlets in areas where the Covid test positivity rate is low. However, the government has given direction that the places of worship in these areas should not be opened. The stand of the government is depriving the right of the devotees completely, he said. Meanwhile, Samastha Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema leaders said that it was unfortunate that the CM neglected the demand of various Muslim organizations who sought nod for reopening of places of worship. The meeting of Kerala Muslim Jamaat chaired by Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar demanded permission for at least 40 persons for Friday prayers. Jammat-e-Islami Kerala Amir M I Abdul Aziz said that denying relaxation to places of worship amounted to discrimination and was protestable. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-nss-muslim-outfits-urge-govt-to-open-places-of-worship/articleshow/83586562.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Police preparation hints at Rath Yatra in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Amid the speculations over holding of the 144th Rath Yatra, the cops have decided to prepare for taking stock of security and law and order situation on the traditional route of the annual event. The police preparations hint towards the probability that Lord Jagannath’s chariot may be rolling again, taking a tour of the city, after being cancelled last year due to Covid pandemic. Even this year, the second wave of Covid-19 cases has put a question over holding of the event but as the cases have decreased gradually in last two months, the government is monitoring the situation, “If the case count drops to single digit, then there is a strong possibility that the Rath Yatra will be held on July 12”, said a police officer. Cops of Dariapur police on Wednesday morning held a march in the Dariapur area. A senior officer of Ahmedabad police said, “We have been preparing for the Rath Yatra event because we should not be found napping if the government decides to hold the Yatra. We will be prepared for the event. But ultimately, the ball is in the court of the government, they will decide it and we will follow the orders.” He further said, “The government is closely monitoring the Covid situation and if the cases fall to single digit numbers, then it will be held. But there are no chances of a full-fledged Rath Yatra, as it was held in previous years.” Another cop said, “We had also done some preparation last year when the initial cases of Covid were reported. This time, the cases have decreased and we have decided to remain prepared.” Mahendra Jha, trustee of Jagannath Temple, said that the temple trust has moved a plea to hold the Yatra, which is still pending with the city police. “We will sit with police and government officers to talk about the Rath Yatra, but we are yet to finalize the date of that meeting,” Jha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-prep-hints-at-rath-yatra-in-city/articleshow/83586557.cms||---

Two residents of Gota learnt this the hard way when an empty spray bottle they threw landed on the head of a teenager, leading to a fracas and, subsequently, a police complaint. Dishant Desai, a 19-year-old resident of Gopal Park Society in Gota, told Sola police on Tuesday that two men who lived in the same locality had thrashed him when he objected to their throwing an empty spray bottle which fell on his head. Desai said he was walking towards his uncle’s house in Gota when accused Rohit Jhapda and Pankaj Jhapda — whom he knew — were taking part in birthday celebrations with others on the road on the night of June 11. Desai said that Rohit threw the empty bottle which landed on his head. “When I objected to it, Rohit and Pankaj abused and thrashed me,” said Desai who then went to Sola police station and filed an application to register a complaint against them. On Tuesday, Rohit called up Desai and threated him with dire consequences after which he again approached the police. Sola police finally registered a complaint against Rohit and Pankaj Jhapda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teen-gets-hit-by-flying-bottle-thrashed-for-raising-objection/articleshow/83586531.cms||---
---||Madurai||HC quashes proceedings against Kamal on Mahabharata remarks||Madurai: Criticism drawing analogies from the epics or literary works is not uncommon and is part and parcel of a free society, the Madras high court has observed while quashing the trial court proceedings against actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam leader Kamal Haasan for his remarks about portrayal of women in Mahabharata in an interview to a Tamil news channel in 2017.The court was hearing a petition filed by Haasan before the HC Madurai bench in 2017, seeking to quash the proceedings against him before the judicial magistrate court at Valliyoor in Tirunelveli district, based on a complaint preferred by a person named Aadhinatha Sundaram.When the anchor asked a specific question on the increasing violence against women in India, the actor-turned-politician stated that nothing is surprising about it in a country which reveres Mahabharata, which depicts a woman being used as a collateral during gambling. According to the complainant, the comment made by Haasan insulted not only the epic, but also hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.Justice G Ilangovan observed that there was no intention to insult while answering a query. If at all, it should be taken only as casual communication that took place between the anchor and the petitioner.The judge observed that criticism is not only a human right, but also democratic right upon which democracy thrives. “At no stretch of imagination, this court can come to the conclusion that the views expressed by the petitioner were intended to insult or harm the religious feelings of the respondent (private complainant). But the facts and circumstances of the case show that the petitioner has not exceeded the freedom of speech and expression, which was conferred upon him,” observed the judge.Hence, the judge observed that the complaint is clearly an abuse of process of court and is liable to be quashed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-quashes-proceedings-against-kamal-on-mahabharata-remarks/articleshow/83586571.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Land in Jaunsar-Bawar region being bought & leased by private parties from tribals with ‘exploitative’ terms, claims petition; high court directs DM to conduct probe||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the Dehradun district magistrate (DM) to conduct a probe and submit a report on the allegations that private people are buying land from tribals in the Jaunsar-Bawar region. The DM has also been asked to inform the court of the “substantive steps’ he will take against the offenders. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has also issued notices to the Uttarakhand government, the state's biodiversity board and the three private parties which are alleged to have signed the lease contracts with the tribals in the region. The development comes after a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed before the court highlighting the issue. The petition filed by Chetan Singh Chauhan, a social worker and activist from Chakrata, alleged that even though the sale of the tribal lands to private parties is prohibited in the law; several lease deeds have been signed by private parties with the people belonging to the SC/ST community. The PIL also adds that the agreements have ‘exploitative terms’ similar to those imposed by the British East India Company. In one such deed which was signed in February 2017, the private party has put in the clause that says that even after the expiry of the time period of the contract, the lessee (private party) will have the right to renew the agreement for the same time and the lessor (owner) or its heirs will have no right to object. The contract adds that “if after the expiry of the lease deed, none of the heirs of the lessor claim the leased property, the contract will be renewed for the same time period again”. In another case, the deed says that if the owner or his heirs do not claim the property, the private party will get the inheritance of the land, based on some of the terms and conditions. “Due to the aforesaid activities, the petitioner fears that the SC/ST population of the Chakrata region is being hoodwinked. Also, such activities can cause damage to the fragile ecology of the Chakrata region,” read the petition. The court has given the DM as well as other respondents two weeks to file their replies and has listed the case for further hearing on July 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/land-in-jaunsar-bawar-region-being-bought-leased-by-private-parties-from-tribals-with-exploitative-terms-claims-petition-hc-directs-dm-to-conduct-probe/articleshow/83584351.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Battling vaccine hesitancy with pictures, promises & snacks||LUCKNOW: In most villages of Uttar Pradesh, newly elected pradhans follow an unwritten ritual. Each panchayat member plants a sapling to mark the beginning of the new tenure. Last week, when the pradhan of Baudhiya Kalan village in Nighasan block of Lakhimpur Kheri began his first board meeting, he told the members that the ritual would be changed. “Instead of plantation I asked all members to convince10 people each to get vaccinated. As pradhan, I wanted to begin this work from the first day itself,” said Syed Maqsood Ali Guddu, who had taken oath on May 26. Ali’s initiative was fuelled by the fact that there had been 21 Covid-related deaths in a neighbouring over the past month. He also knew that vaccination is the only defence against Covid-19 but there is immense vaccine hesitancy in most villages. There were rumours that vaccine can lead to impotency, disease or even death. While registration had begun for the door-to-door vaccination drive in mid-May, people were not coming forward. “In some villages, health workers and panchayat members had been attacked. Recently, villagers jumped into the river to evade vaccination,” said Ali. To set an example, Ali wanted the panchayat members to first take the jab themselves. However, barring a few, even they posed a challenge. Ali then turned to his friend and guide Mohammed Haider, a lawyer and activist in Lucknow. Being a long-time wellwisher of Baudhiya Kalan, Haider enjoyed the trust of the villagers. In consultation with Haider, Ali decided to use experiences and pictures of those vaccinated already to encourage others. One such example was Ali’s 92-year-old mother, who had got vaccinated early last month. “I showed her picture to people telling them it was safe. I got other members of my family and myself vaccinated in camps in front of villagers, said Ali. Haider said, “I visited the village multiple times and spoke to the people about the benefits of vaccination and the dangers of Covid-19. It was a sustained effort but people started to come around.” To further “lure” people they arranged for snacks and sweets at vaccination camps. Ali also promised assistance in completing pending repair work, construction of toilets, electricity connection and other facilities in return for vaccination. Now, Ali is proud to report that 390 people in the 45+ age group have been vaccinated in the village in just a week. Overall, 515 have registered on the CoWin portal. Another 2,500 in the 18-45 age group have registered for vaccination but they will get it in the nearest community health centre as per rules. The numbers are no mean feat, considering how other villages are faring Lauding the effort, principal secretary, panchayati raj, Manoj Kumar Singh said, “Maqsood Ali has been proactive for vaccination since before taking oath. He himself approached me, requesting for a camp in his village. Very few village chiefs have done something like that. What’s remarkable is that he got himself and his family members vaccinated in front of the villagers, which worked well because in rural areas, people tend to follow local leadership.” Hesitancy though, is not the only obstacle in the vaccination drive. There is only one ANM at a time to administer the jab and on some days she has not been able to turn up because of duty changes. Shortage of vaccines has also been reported. If such these things are taken care of, Ali said he was sure of 100% vaccination in his village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/battling-vax-hesitancy-with-pictures-promises-snacks/articleshow/83589078.cms||Rashi Lal

---||Dehradun||Cold desert of Ladakh experienced monsoon and floods some 3,000 years ago: Study||DEHRADUN: Scientists and students of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) have found that the cold desert of Ladakh had once experienced large-scale floods that rose much above the present-day river level. The study concluded that in the scenario of global warming, when the higher Himalayas are expected to respond dramatically, flood frequency in Ladakh may increase, which may call for serious urban and rural planning. The WIHG team looked minutely into geological signatures of past floods in Ladakh region that date between 15-3 thousand years before present. This study was recently published online in the Geological Society of America Bulletin, says a communique from the press information bureau. In the study led by Pradeep Srivastava, senior scientist at the sedimentology department, it has been found that large floods that naturally occur in major rivers of India fed by melting snow and glaciers and rains significantly modify the landscape and impact lives and economy of all that encroached into its geomorphic domain. The chronology of the flood deposits pointed towards three phases of increased flooding that occurred in Ladakh after the period called Last Glacial Maximum -- the most recent time during the Last Glacial Period that ice sheets were at their greatest extent. These were times when due to warming the Indian summer monsoon was active in Ladakh as well. This analysis showed that the cold desert once experienced a large flood that rose to more than 30 metres above the present-day river level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cold-desert-of-ladakh-experienced-monsoon-and-floods-some-3000-years-ago-study/articleshow/83584350.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Police inspector among 3 accused of petrol pump con||AHMEDABAD: A resident of Bhavnagar on Wednesday filed a complaint at Ahmedabad’s Anandnagar police station against a police inspector, his son, and an aide accusing them of cheating him of Rs 30 lakh. The complainant said that the three offered to make him a partner in a petrol pump business and promised him a 33% share of the profits. In his complaint, Suresh Chauhan, 40, has named a Bhavnagar police inspector, Digvijaysinh Jhala; his son Pratikrajsinh Jhala, a resident of Bopal in Ahmedabad; and Uttam Sheth, a resident of Adalaj in Gandhinagar. Chauhan said the three duped him in 2018. Chauhan, who is in the petroleum trade, said that he knew Digvijaysinh through a common friend. The friend told Chauhan to meet Digvijaysinh at a coffee shop in Prahladnagar in Ahmedabad. When Chauhan met Digvijaysinh, Pratikrajsinh and Sheth, they told him about their plan to set up a petrol pump in Veraval. Digvijaysinh said that as a government servant, he could not directly become a partner in the business. Chauhan said that he was convinced with Digvijaysinh’s plan so he invested the money. But whenever he asked for his share, the three told him that they had not managed to get permission to start the petrol pump. Later, Chauhan came to know through his friends in Veraval that the petrol pump had already been set up but the three were not giving him his due profits. When Chauhan raised this issue with Digvijaysinh, he promised to return his money and gave a cheque. But the cheque bounced. Chauhan finally approached Anandnagar police and filed a complaint of breach of trust, cheating, and abetment against the three.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-inspector-among-3-accused-of-petrol-pump-con/articleshow/83586576.cms||---

A majority of night stay facilities in Corbett are at Dhikala, Bijrani and Jhirna zones. These core zones are considered the best and most picturesque in Corbett. Every year, the reserve is shut for tourists during the monsoon season as the fauna here is the most vulnerable during this period due to reasons like — excessive rains, breeding season and high movement of poachers, among others. However, this year, the national park was shut for tourists on May 1 after the Uttarakhand government imposed a Covid curfew. Meanwhile, the Bijrani, Durga Devi and Garzia zones — which are usually open for tourists around this time — are also shut at present. Besides, the Jhirna, Dhela and Garzia zones — which remain open for tourists throughout the year — are also closed for tourists due to the pandemic. Notably, the reserve was visited by more than 2 lakh tourists between October 2020 and March 2021, breaking all previous tourist footfall records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ctr-to-allow-night-stay-in-reserve-from-november-15/articleshow/83584349.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police are interrogating him now and sources said that bank details of the accused were also being collected as part of the investigation into his financial dealings and sources of income. He is likely to be taken to Thrissur, including to his native place, and locations under Peramangalam police station limits where he stayed in hiding, for evidence collection on Thursday. The accused was remanded in police custody for four days on Tuesday and must be produced in court by Friday evening. Meanwhile, sources said that Dhaneesh (29), one of the three persons taken in custody for harbouring the accused and facilitating his escape, turned Covid positive. The investigation team was reportedly planning to take the co-accused into custody and it seems the plan will have to be postponed considering the detection of the infection. Several policemen were also in contact with these accused. Martin was booked under IPC Sections 376 (rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 days or more), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means or weapons) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).

---||Kochi||Kerala: Over 14 lakh may acquire immunity before 3rd wave||KOCHI: Health officials in Ernakulam assume that 1,86,856 people are likely to acquire post-Covid immunity before the third wave, if it happens, hits the district, as per the next wave projection report submitted to the district administration. The report also states that 12,60,000 people will acquire immunity through Covid vaccination before the next wave. It calls for imparting training to paediatricians, nursing staff and paramedical staff in paediatric critical and ventilator care. The training, which is underway, would to be completed in one-and-a-half months. “Even though the district recorded more than three lakh Covid positive cases so far, the immunity acquired by each patient through the infection will last only for four to six months. We assume that 1,86,856 people are likely to acquire immunity through infection before the next wave, which we expect in September-October period, if it happens. The projected cases are between the second wave and the third wave. These are all assumptions,” admitted a district health official. The reports assumes that 19,200-24,000 children will get the infection in the next wave and of this 384-720 cases may require hospitalization and 160-360 may require oxygen support. The projected figure for children requiring ICU care is 38-48. Currently, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), which affects children post-Covid, was reported in two cases in the district and both were severe. The report calls for giving training to medical officers at peripheral facilities to identify MIS in children. In mild cases, MIS should be treated at peripheral institutions and follow up also should be done by them. Moderate and severe cases should be referred to tertiary care facilities — Ernakulam General Hospital and Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam. Meanwhile, Indian Medical Association, Kerala chapter, secretary Dr P Gopakumar said they anticipate a third wave as there are many susceptible factors still present in the state. “Immunity through infection is very less in Covid cases. Even in cases with high viral load, antibodies are not developed in the required level. Reinfection is seen in such cases and it will become severe in the third wave. The second wave witnessed variants of coronavirus and in future more virulent variants will emerge. The solution is immunization through vaccination. Currently, 20-30% of the population might have got immunity through infection and vaccination so far. The remaining 70% are susceptible to the infection. Opportunities for spread is also there,” said Dr Gopakumar. Meanwhile, 13,23,987 vaccine doses against Covid-19, including 10,65,435 first doses, have been administered to beneficiaries in the district till Monday this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/over-14l-may-acquire-immunity-before-3rd-wave/articleshow/83586626.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Ahmedabad||‘We are pushing for a central law to end violence against doctors’||On Friday, some 3.5 lakh members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) across India and others of the medical fraternity will be joining forces. On June 18, doctors will work with black badges/ribbons to push for their ‘Save the Saviours’ appeal and demand a definite legal recourse for violence against doctors. Dr Jayesh Lele, general secretary of IMA and senior medical practitioner from Maharashtra, spoke to TOI on the issues plaguing the medical fraternity and the need for stringent measures. “In 2020 alone, about 300 incidents of assault on doctors and medical practitioners were recorded in India. This is a huge number. The violence has increased in the second wave of Covid with complaints about the lack of proper treatment,” said Dr Lele. “I want to emphasize that some 750 of our members lost their lives in 2020, and 700 others this year. They were true Covid warriors who died while serving others. On one hand, we shower them (healthcare workers) with petals and light diyas in their honour, and on the other we beat them up. Such is the dichotomy.” Dr Lele said they are pushing for a central law to end violence against doctors. “Health is a concurrent subject for Central and state governments. Some state governments have passed laws but what we want is a strong central law with CrPC and IPC provisions for stringent punishment, which can work as a deterrent,” he said. “In several instances, doctors refrain from filing complaints. In one instance, the accused have not been caught after 11 years even as the doctor lost his life due to a head injury.” IMA officials said the purview of violence also needs to be expanded. The central government made an amendment to the Epidemic Diseases Act to cover doctors, but it’s applicability is limited to Covid, they added. Dr Lele said doctors are also facing mental harassment. Social media has opened up a new front where medical practitioners and their family members are targeted. “It should also be covered under the provisions,” he said. On the preparations for June 18, Dr Lele said that they are going to approach PM Narendra Modi with a memorandum. Teams will also approach all the ministers in Delhi, MPs and MLAs in various states. “In states like Gujarat, we have 35,000 members. They will be mobilizing to demand stringent laws. We will also be covering police officers this time, as they are also important stakeholders,” said Dr Lele. IMA officials said no medical work will be disturbed, but all members will display placards demanding justice and wear black clothes or ribbons/badges at work. Two medical student wings will be at the forefront of the protest, said IMA officials. “The role of IMA has become more important as an umbrella organization for about 3.5 lakh modern medicine practitioners in India during the pandemic. It’s like the threat has unified us against a common goal. We have been most active in creating awareness, disseminating information, and carrying out training workshops in the past one-and-a-half years,” said Dr Lele. “The work will continue with various specialized branches.” On the recent controversy over allopathy vs Ayurveda, Dr Lele said Baba Ramdev has apologized for his comments. “We need to strengthen our stand. Today it was Baba, tomorrow it could be someone else. We are not against any traditional medicine systems. It’s a patient’s prerogative to choose any method of treatment.

In fact, they suggested citizens to remain on high alert “as Covid-19 is still prevalent in the form of epidemic”. With relaxations in public movement, experts are anticipating a spurt in new cases in the next 15 days but it may not be the third wave, which is apprehended to hit in August-September. Between June 8 and 16, the district has reported 651 positive cases from 75,146 tests, at an average of 72 cases per day. The test positivity rate has slipped to 0.86% during this period with some labs now reporting ‘0’ positive cases quite often. The next surge, if it happens, will depend on how much precautions the public take and whether Covid norms are followed. “After reopening, there will be a surge but not a wave. The spurt in cases will depend on how many people are remaining to be vaccinated and whether they are moving freely on streets. In the next two or three weeks, suppose cases don’t increase, there is possibility of a new variant emerging,” said pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, who is part of different study groups on Covid management. Endocrinologist Dr Pramod Gandhi said it is extremely difficult to say if cases will come down to zero. “Till date, no infectious disease has come down to zero. UK and Japan have already seen the third wave. It is likely that India too will face it,” he said. According to infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde, zero Covid is epidemiologically not possible. “It is going to stay with us like flu and become endemic. To reach to that level is a big task as we need to build herd immunity,” said Dr Tayde. She added that to attain herd immunity, vaccination drive needs to be stronger. “We must also keep in mind that low-level transmission is possible and can add up to cause future implications related to third wave in the form of possible mutant strain,” she said. Dr Sarnaik said the epidemiological models and the prevalence of Covid vary region-to-region. “At some places it will go while at the same time it will be down at other places. Two months ago, cases in Amravati began to shoot up while situation in Nagpur was not so bad. The epidemiological models and formulas are based on factors like crowding, gatherings, adherence to government norms, public behaviour as well as weather conditions,” he said. The pulmonologist explained that in September 2020 it was predicted that India will see 2,200 deaths per day by May 2021 but this happened in April, a month in advance. “As per these models, there is a possibility of a third wave. We don’t know if the third wave will come in the next few weeks or next year. As per the model, it is likely to strike somewhere in August and September,” he said. Dr Sarnaik suggested that people must get vaccinated during this window.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drastic-fall-in-new-covid-cases-but-experts-rule-out-0-score/articleshow/83584380.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The directive came after senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the petitioners along with Charuhas Dharmadhikari, informed the bench that Mihan India Limited (MIL), state government agency operating Nagpur airport, has appointed Deloitte India as new consultant for the airport’s privatization. While listing the plea for likely final hearing on July 1, a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor asked the state to submit its reply in advance so that its copies could be supplied to the petitioners — GMR Airports Limited and GMR Nagpur International Airport Limited — along with other respondents. The petitioners have prayed for quashing MIL’s letter issued to them on March 19, 2020, annulling the airport bidding process without awarding the contract. Stressing on admitting the plea for final hearing, Singhvi cited TOI report of June 7 contending that the government has failed to file its reply to the HC notice for over a year, since the case was first heard on May 29, 2020. Arguing that the case should be heard on priority, as MIL has already appointed an agency for airport privatization process, he charged the government with delaying the hearing by seeking more time. The petitioners contended that after acceptance of their bid on March 7, 2019, the contract has already been effected. However, MIL asked them to increase revenue sharing percentage, which they were not legally required to do so. When they increased it by almost three times, the MIL arbitrarily cancelled the bid without assigning any reason, notice or opportunity. The petitioners pointed out that the cancellation of bidding process defeats the government’s objective of socio-economic development of Vidarbha and, therefore, MIL’s action was arbitrary, illegal and deserved to be quashed. “The petitioners were allotted space in the airport and also their bank guarantee was extended twice. Hence, MIL’s move is contrary to Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-govt-delaying-airport-privatization-case-singhvi/articleshow/83586620.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The Nagpur traffic police refused to accept the proposal. The decision has developed a tussle of sort between the NSSCDCL and the traffic department. The department feels that issuing challan is not a problem, recovery of fine is. “If the NSSCDCL, as it claims, starts issuing more challan than the traffic department, who will go to each and every houses to collect the fines,” said a traffic official. On an average, the Nagpur city traffic police issue around 150 e-challans per day with the help of CCTV footage. The NSSCDCL said it will deploy its manpower in the command control room to generate e-challans of traffic violators. Manually, the traffic police from 10 zones issue challans to 2,213 violators per day. “Collecting these fine itself has become a tedious work for the department. If the Smart City officials start issuing more challan, who will collect these fines,” asked an official. Sources said if the Smart City officials start issuing challan, it will further increase the work pressure on traffic police. “Already, motorists penalized through CCTV cameras were rarely paying the fine. In fact, the pending fines have mounted so much that DCP (traffic) Sarang Awad has launched a special operation to recover the pending fines,” the official said. NSSCDCL chief executive officer Buvneshwari S was not available for comment. She did not even respond to text messages. At present, the traffic police have deputed at least 20 personnel at City Operation Centre at NMC’s administrative building in Civil Lines who monitor footage of 3,698 CCTV cameras installed at 660 junctions and then generate e-challans to violators. These cops check each and every footage of the CCTV cameras for traffic violations such as jumping traffic signals, zebra line crossing, driving without seatbelt, riding without helmet etc from 9am to 6pm. Sources said despite having invested about Rs 520 crore in CCTV cameras installation at various junctions to catch traffic offenders, it has failed to ease the workload of Nagpur traffic police. The high-tech facility fails to differentiate between red light violation detection and stop line violations besides failing to generate e-challans automatically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/smart-city-offers-to-issue-traffic-challans-take-30-share-of-fine/articleshow/83584407.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The vaccination was given free of cost by the institute that has been serving children and also young adults affected by palsy for the past 47 years. Many of them have been through the school and are now in different stages of higher education or profession, who are still being handheld by the institute. The institute tied up with a private hospital for the day-long drive and a large number of palsy affected men and women, many of them wheelchair-bound, came in for their vaccinations to the institute. “Many of these people are wheelchair bound. As a result, they stay indoors without taking the risk of queuing up at hospitals. So, we organised the camp because this is a familiar and safe place for them,” said Sumita Roy, a spokesperson of the institute. Sixty autistic and mentally challenged people, supported by Mentaid, were brought in to the institute for vaccination too. They were sponsored by Calcutta Foundation, an NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/people-with-palsy-caregivers-get-vax-at-iicp/articleshow/83586585.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The court observed that in cases of such nature, the authorities must not stick to technicalities and the claim must be considered with humanness.Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed, “The entire world and particularly India, is facing an unprecedented situation due to the untimely attack of the Covid-19. It is the doctors and the frontline workers who in spite of knowing about the risk involved through exposure to this virus are selflessly and tirelessly working to save the lives of millions of citizens of this country. If not for the selfless services rendered by the doctors, a major population of this country would have been wiped out due to the deadly Covid-19.”The court was hearing the petition filed by B Varalakshmi from Trichy district, seeking to provide compensation of Rs 50 lakh under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package Insurance Scheme for health workers fighting Covid-19, on account of her husband’s death who had undertaken private practice during the pandemic period.The petitioner’s husband Baskar, after retiring from government service in 2016, was doing private practice. Baskar, who was also treating Covid-19 patients, started feeling the symptoms of the virus and suffered from breathing problems. On August 3, 2020, CT scan results showed that he was infected with Covid-19. The petitioner had submitted an application for insurance coverage under the scheme, however, the authorities had not processed her application since the RT PCR report was not submitted. The least that should be done for a doctor, who has lost his life due to Covid-19, which had spread to him while he was on duty, is to acknowledge the selfless service and provide with necessary compensation to his family, observed the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govts-directed-to-provide-relief-to-doctors-family/articleshow/83586606.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Sisodia said that the Centre has rejected a compensation committee formed by Delhi government on May 27. Nothing can be more misleading than this,” Kapoor said. The Supreme Court had on May 8 formed a committee for audit of supply, utilisation and distribution of oxygen supply in Delhi and it included AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, Max Hospital’s Dr Sandeep Budhiraja and IAS officers from the Centre and Delhi government as members. “This Supreme Court committee was working for 10 days, when Delhi government suddenly jumped in to form a separate committee on May 27. Because a high powered 4-member committee with Delhi government representation in it is already working, the Delhi government committee did not get approval,” said Kapoor.

The woman, a fashion designer, demanded the extortion amount in a letter sent through a courier company. The police traced the woman with the help of CCTV footage. The Beltarodi police led by senior PI Vijay Akot on Wednesday produced the woman before the judicial magistrate, who sent her to police custody till June 19. Following directives from senior officials, Beltarodi PI Akot refused to divulge the identity of the accused. Police said Dr Tushar Pande, 48, a resident of Somalwada, and his doctor wife own Utkarsh Maternity Home at Manish Nagar. On June 11, at around 5.30pm he received a letter through courier. Dr Pande found that the letter by an unknown sender had threatened to harm his family and demanded Rs1 crore. “The extortionist had threatened to kill his two children if he informed the police,” police said. The same day, Dr Pande approached Beltarodi police station and lodged a complaint against the unknown extortionist. Dr Pande had been asked to keep the money in a bag near a garbage point in Manish Nagar locality on June 17 at 4am. The police registered a case and started investigations under DCP Akshay Shinde and ACP Nilesh Palve with Akot and PSI Vikas Manpiya. First, the police checked the courier centre from where the letter was booked for delivery. It then crossed-checked CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity. It helped them identify the suspect as a middle-aged woman who visited the courier centre riding on a two-wheeler. The police then screened CCTV footage on all roads which the unidentified woman drover her two-wheeler. CCTV footage revealed that the unidentified woman entered Shipli Society near UCO Bank, Manish Nagar. The verification of the two-wheeler’s registration number revealed the exact address of the accused. The police picked up the woman, and during interrogation she spilled the beans. The police arrested her and also seized the two-wheeler used in the crime. Police said the woman and her husband were Dr Pande’s patients, and under his treatment after testing positive for Covid-19 a couple of months ago. Police said the husband of the accused works in a telecom company and they had taken a home loan of Rs60 lakh. This led to financial burden on the family and disruption in their married life. So, the woman hatched the plan to extort money from the doctor. “We are trying to ascertain if she had an accomplice in the crime,” said senior PI Akot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/woman-held-for-trying-to-extort-rs1cr-from-doctor-couple/articleshow/83584441.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Replying to NHAI’s allegations of “environmentalists misleading the citizens,” the release stressed that IMS was a multi- phase project and not restricted to just phase one. “Various documents procured through Right to Information (RTI) and credible sources have revealed that the IMS project in totality is spread over 446 acres. The master plan of development presentation acquired by some sections of media also clearly shows the total project is spread over 4 phases and nearly 490 acres including land where FCI godown exists. Why are the authorities hiding these related projects from citizens surrounding the IMS-phase-1 on 44 acres of land?” stated the release signed by environmentalist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani. The release cited that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Rail Land Development of Authority (RLDA) and NHAI clearly stated that the IMS project comprises passenger, commercial and institutional facilities (office complex, shopping complex and hotels). The release further pointed out that, NHAI initially misled the public by counting only 1,900 trees in 44 acres. “On insistence of environmentalists, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) conducted a joint survey with NHAI and counted 6,953 trees over the same area. So much for their expertise and purity of heart and intentions while executing a project of this magnitude,” it stated. While NHAI is denying that around 40,000 trees will be chopped off for the entire project, the activists stated, “If 44 acres of land is holding 6,953 trees, then how many trees would be located on 446 acres, nearly 10 times of 44 acres of green land. Therefore, time and again we have requested a public – authority based joint counting of the total number of trees spread over the whole project land of 446 acres,” they stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ims-a-multi-phase-project-authorities-hiding-info-greens/articleshow/83584434.cms||Manka Behl

So, we should also be fully prepared, keeping in mind the developments all over the world,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday. The nursing assistants will be deployed at hospitals and other healthcare facilities to support the existing staff, including doctors. Kejriwal said the online application process would begin on June 17 and Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University would start training of the selected candidates by the end of this month. All those who have passed Class XII are eligible to become community nursing assistants. They must be above 18 years and applications will be accepted on a first come, first serve basis. “In case a third wave emerges, we may also witness a shortage of medical and paramedical staff as we had seen during the first and second waves. Keeping that in mind, the government has devised a big plan of training 5,000 health assistants. In technical terms, they are called community nursing assistants,” the chief minister said while addressing a press conference on the planned manpower augmentation. They will be given basic training for two weeks. The training will start from June 28 in batches of 500, and each batch will be trained for two weeks. Later, they will be paid according to the number of days they work, the chief minister said. The community nursing assistants will be trained in basic nursing, paramedic work, lifesaving, first aid, home care, sample collection, and oxygen concentrator and cylinder operations, among others, Kejriwal said. “They will be trained for basic things such as how to measure oxygen and blood pressure, and how to administer vaccines. They will also be trained in patient care, diaper changing, use of catheter and bedpan, sample collection, and use of oxygen mask.” The government believes that better manpower support will boost efficiency of doctors. The community nursing assistants will work as assistants to doctors and nurses. They will be assigned task by doctors and nurses and will not take any decision on their own, the chief minister pointed out. For the past 10 days, Delhi government has been ramping up healthcare and oxygen infrastructure against a possible third Covid-19 wave. While Delhi government has added 22 oxygen plants, taking the total count of such facilities in the capital to 33, arrangements have also been made for storage facilities, and oxygen concentrators and cylinders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-to-train-5k-hands-to-assist-healthcare-workers/articleshow/83586753.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Kochi||Kerala: African snail menace gets severe in Ernakulam||KOCHI: Inadequate monsoon-related cleaning works owing to the Covid-induced lockdown has intensified the menace of giant African snail in Ernakulam. The snails have become a nuisance for residents in Thevara, Pachalam and other areas forcing them to approach agriculture officials seeking remedial measures to eradicate the pest. Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Ernakulam, had conducted an online session on the measures to be taken to fight the menace. “The snails are now attacking cash crops. It also poses threat to human beings. The snails enter houses through drains and the secretions of it causes itching and allergy. A nematode, which will cause eosinophilic meningitis, is carried by the African snails,” says Shoji Joy Edison, subject matter specialist of KVK, Ernakulam. Unutilized lands, like FACT compounds and various other places, have turned out to be the breeding grounds for the snails, which can survive for up to six to seven years in ideal condition. If no food is available, the snails survive on eating calcium from concrete particles on boundary walls. If moisture is not available on the atmosphere, it goes into hibernation until a favourable situation emerges. It can survive in hibernation for up to two years without food. Natural enemies for the giant African snail are less. Pigs and ducks are its predators.  Though people use salt to kill the snails, experts suggest to either use tobacco decoction or collect the snails together and pour salt over it at agricultural fields since the shell of snails are rich in calcium. “One should attract the snails first before using the tobacco decoction. First, land has to be dug in places where the menace is high. A gunny bag, soaked with fermented coconut water or beer or leaves of cabbage and papaya, should be placed in the pit. Since these snails are calcium-rich, they get attracted to it. When they come to eat it, tobacco decoction mixed with copper sulphate should be sprayed over the snails, and the pests will die in three to four minutes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/african-snail-menace-gets-severe-in-dist/articleshow/83586724.cms||T C Sreemol

Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the stock is still not enough to resume first dose of Covaxin for 18+ group. “But we are restarting Covaxin first dose for the 45+ group with some replenishment. Covishield stock is still not available for other groups than those currently getting it. From June 21, we are planning 30 to 40 new centres identified during the Vaccination In Your Locality drive. Right now, 96 centres are functioning,” he said. On Wednesday, many citizens complained that they were unable to book a slot on the Co-Win app for the 18+ group at private hospitals. As per NMC data, five private hospitals are carrying out vaccination drive for all age groups. However, two of them – Wockhardt and Orange City Hospital – are currently catering to corporates as per an exclusive tie-up. Kingsway Hospital is running low on vaccine stock and limited its slots to less than 30. HCG Cancer Hospital and New Era Hospital vaccinated 280 and 535 beneficiaries, respectively on Wedensday. The response from 18+ group for second dose of Covishield and Covaxin is good. Earlier, these beneficiaries had taken the first dose at government centres. The overwhelming response had forced the government to suspend the drive for them. On Wednesday, 177 took their second jab, including 35 of Covishield at private centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/18-jab-few-covishield-shots-at-pvt-centres-govt-starts-covaxin-2nd-dose/articleshow/83584466.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||HCA apex council issues show cause to Mohd Azharuddin||HYDERABAD: The apex council members of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) issued a showcause notice to president Mohd Azharuddin on Tuesday for acting against the interest of the apex council and thereby lowering its dignity and prestige before other state cricket associations and the BCCI. The former India captain has been given seven days to explain why further action should not be taken against him. In the five-page showcause notice, the five signatories said, “…pending inquiry... the apex council has suspended you until final adjudication and that includes termination of your membership in the HCA.” “The council in its meeting held on June 10 has decided after careful consideration of various complaints made by the members of the general body and also on its volition had duly deliberated about your various acts of commission and omission in its meeting held and has decided to issue the show cause notice to you according to Rule 41 (1) (b) and 15 (4) (c),” the notice stated. One of the main complaints against Azhar is that he is a mentor for Northern Warriors, a private club in Dubai and which took part in a tournament that is not recognised by BCCI. “The fact of you being a mentor has not been communicated to the HCA at any time. It is also apparent that you have not communicated the same to the BCCI. Therefore you being a mentor of an unrecognised tournament comes under the ambit of conflict of interest as envisaged under Rule 38 (1) (iii) of the Memorandum of Association and Rules and Regulations 2018 of HCA.” It also said that, “You (Azhar) have addressed a letter to the Secretary of HCA on December 14, 2019, requesting inter alia to inform the BCCI about your retirement from active cricket from March 6, 2000, when you had played your last one-day international match. It is evident from the said letter that you have not informed the BCCI or the HCA about your retirement from active cricket before that letter. As you (Azhar) are aware a period of five years should have lapsed for you to contest an election from the time of you informing the HCA and the BCCI about your retirement,” the notice stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-apex-council-issues-show-cause-to-azharuddin/articleshow/83586720.cms||Solomon S Kumar
---||Nagpur||Forest development corporation of Maharashtra’s megalithic burial sites project in a shambles||NAGPUR: The Indian subcontinent’s first in situ project to conserve over 3,000-year-old megalithic burial sites at Gorewada reserve forest is in a shambles. The first phase of the project was to be dedicated to the public in 2019, but even three years later only 40% of the work has been completed. The Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) had signed an MoU with Pune’s Deccan College of Post-graduate & Research Institute in June 2018, to complete the Rs8.5 crore project in two phases. The first phase included in situ conservation and protection of two megalithic burial sites near Aam Nullah in the Gorewada tourism safari route. During excavation in November 2018, numerous artifacts, ceramics, and metal objects, and a skeleton were recovered, depicting megalithic traditions. In the second phase, an archaeological theme park was to come up near Balasaheb Thackeray Zoological Park. Gorewada divisional manager Pramod Panchbhai admits work on the burial sites is shut for nearly two years. As a precaution both burial sites have been covered with polythene sheets. The sites will be conserved in the tourism zone and these will have huge glass tombs and pathways for tourists. This is the first project in the Indian subcontinent highlighting rich cultural heritage. Of the Rs8.5 crore project, FDCM has already released over Rs2.5 crore. The corporation has failed to take up the matter strongly with the Deccan College authorities. Moreover, it released money even though work was not completed. FDCM chief general manager (CGM) Rishikesh Ranjan says, “Both are government institutions and hence action was not taken. We have issued at least 3-4 reminders to the college to complete the project. The work was delayed due to Covid in 2020 and 2021. But it is also true that there was no Covid in 2019 when the first phase should have been completed.” The artifacts and objects are gathering dust at the Deccan College, awaiting scientific and dating analysis using various methods to find the exact age of this burial site. The skeleton that was discovered was to be conserved every six months but it has not been done, FDCM sources said. Deccan College’s Kantikumar Pawar, professor of archaeology, who is handling the Gorewada Archaeological Theme Park, was disappointed by non-completion of works but he refused to comment. Ex-VC Vasant Shinde, who had signed the MoU, did not respond to TOI calls. Deccan’s acting VC Dr Prasad Joshi told TOI, “The project is big and hence taking time. Apart from Covid-19, there were some administrative hurdles. We plan to remove the Pune-based contractor for not honouring the contract and some legal hurdles are in the way. In around four months, we will restart the project.” However, in June last, Joshi had made a similar promise to complete the project in 90 days, when then FDCM divisional manager had issued a show-cause to the authorities. But even after a year, work has not been completed. “The college could have removed the contractor two years ago but it is not taking a stand,” said sources. Archeologist Balaji Gajul, who was looking after the technical modalities of the project, retired from the college on May 31. This will further delay the project. “Though FDCM has released money, there are some functional problems and internal disputes which the college management needs to sort out. It is true that heavy rains will further damage the project site,” Gajul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fdcms-megalithic-burial-sites-project-in-a-shambles/articleshow/83586745.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Lucknow||‘Land acquisition for defence corridor over in Aligarh, focus now on Lucknow’||Despite a slowdown in activities due to Covid-19 pandemic, UP’s defence corridor project has recorded significant progress over the past few months. Land allotment is almost complete in Aligarh while acquisition has started in Lucknow. In an interview to Neha Lalchandani, CEO of UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority Awanish Awasthi said a seminar is also being planned in Lucknow after July to bring various stakeholders on one platform and promote defence manufacturing in the state. Q. What is the status of land procurement at various nodes? A. There was some delay due to the coronavirus pandemic but we have made good progress till now. In Aligarh, we have procured about 73.7 hectare land and allotted it to 15 companies. Allotments are being made to another five companies. In this node, we have commitments for Rs 1,000 crore. Construction work on projects should be completed by December. Kanpur is another node where work is in full swing. We have acquired about 175 hectare land and one investor has already been allocated land. Allotment to the second investor is in progress. We are expecting that 50% of work will be completed by December. In Jhansi, we have acquired about 1,035 hectare land and are in the process of acquiring 45 hectare more. The first unit has come up here and we are expecting another two to start work in another 3-4 months. So far, we have acquired about 100 acre land in Lucknow. Land is being identified in Agra and as soon as the district administration is ready with its proposal, we will establish a node there. In Chitrakoot, we have acquired about 100 hectares. Q: What will be the role of MSMEs in the development of the defence corridor? A: India has a domestic procurement budget of about Rs 70,000 crore. Foreign companies are eager to enter the Indian market and are on the lookout for local partners. Recently, India and Russia signed an MoU for production of arms and equipment in India. We have requested the Department of Defence Production to provide a list of items to us so that we can disseminate it to MSMEs and help them identify opportunities in manufacturing spare parts for Russian origin aircraft. We plan to set up a common facility centre (CFCs) in the corridor to support MSMEs with facilities for testing, designing and prototyping as well as providing skill development training to the youth. Plans are afoot to establish the first such facility in Lucknow. Q. Have foreign companies shown interest in the defence corridor? A. Several UK companies have shown interest. Our consultant, KPMG, is in touch with these companies. Our consultants are also in touch with Swedish companies. Land has been allotted in Aligarh to Milkor Defence, a South African company and its Indian partner company. They will manufacture multi barrel grenade launchers, speed boats and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). Q. Will the government assist companies in securing finances? A. The government is in the process of tying up with various financial institutions to ensure easy availability of finance to MSMEs willing to invest in defence corridor. We have also been approached by venture capital funds which are ready to support startups in Artificial Intelligence and 3D printing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/land-acquisition-for-defence-corridor-over-in-aligarh-focus-now-on-lucknow/articleshow/83589215.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Provide homeless shelter if you want intl level city’||Mumbai: If you want to raise Mumbai to international standards you cannot leave its homeless behind. This was Bombay HC’s message to the BMC on Wednesday. “You need to have shelters in every ward,” said a bench of Justices S P Deshmukh and Girish Kulkarni, who heard a public interest litigation by Brijesh Arya, a member of Homeless Collective —a forum of organisations working with the homeless in Mumbai —to continue the relief that BMC had provided the homeless during the last lockdown. His advocate Kranti LC said that the homeless were provided food, potable water and free access to public toilets. BMC’s advocate said since the second lockdown it had distributed six lakh food packets to the homeless in association with an NGO and it would continue to do so. The judges asked how many persons in the city had been identified as homeless. Kranti said the 2011 census puts the figure above 50,000. The judges enquired if there was any plan for their proper rehabilitation and then underlined the need for shelters in every ward. Kranti informed that in another PIL, the HC had directed setting up of 250 shelters, but “only 12 exist”. The judges said there was a need for shelters in each ward and asked the BMC about its efforts in this direction.  “It is not that Bombay (sic) Corporation is short of funds. Your fixed deposits earn Rs 1,800 crore interest. Why can’t you reach out to the homeless and provide shelter so that you don’t see poor people sleeping below bridges and on footpaths? If you want to raise the level of this city to international standards, you have to see this through,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges said BMC is appreciated for its efforts to curb Covid and the same is expected for the homeless of the city. The judges said they expect “all corporations” in Maharashtra to do the same. They directed BMC to reply stating “in what manner” it would make shelters available for the homeless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-provide-homeless-shelter-if-you-want-intl-level-city/articleshow/83591058.cms||Rosy Sequeira

But help has now come from Oorvanam, a youth forum that helps animals, which reached out to the bull owners with hay bundles. The decorated bulls, which are a source of livelihood for the tribe settled at Sakkimangalam, are usually taken from one place to another in order to receive help from people. However, this has not been possible due to the pandemic restrictions. There are around 50 bulls, of which 39 are in Sakkimangalam, while the rest are at Kattukaliamman Kovil near Thirumangalam. P R Vishawanth of Oorvanam, who realised the plight of the bull owners, started mobilizing help from sponsors through social media and his contacts with the assistance of volunteers. Within a short span, many came forward to help. “A software techie-cum-farmer from Vikaramangalam offered a few bundles of hay stack. The rest was purchased using the money collected from various good samaritans. We purchased around 100 bundles, each worth 170 and delivered it in Sakkimangalam and Thirumangalam,” he said. R Kaliappan, a leader of the tribal group in Sakkimangalam, said they did not have money to purchase fodder. “It was a thoughtful and timely help by the volunteers. However, this supply would last only for a few days. With normalcy not in sight, we would require more fodder to keep the animals in good health,” he added. “We mostly eat porridge since we can afford only rice. Nevertheless, we are concerned about the animals more than our own well-being. We cannot afford to let them go hungry since they are our only assets,” Kaliappan said. Youths from Oorvanam have been providing various social services during this lockdown. They provided free food for over 500 economically backward and covid-19 infected people each day throughout the 36 days. They also fed strays. The group reached out to 150 poor families with supplies of essential commodities in Anaiyur and Thiruparankundram. They helped in purchasing required things for Covid-19 infected peopl under home quarantine. They also adopted pets of those infected until they returned from hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/youth-forum-feeds-boom-boom-bulls-in-madurai/articleshow/83586684.cms||V Devanathan
---||Dehradun||Can’t repeat Kumbh mistakes, won’t allow Char Dham to become Covid ‘breeding ground’: Uttarakhand high court||NAINITAL: Citing the Kumbh Mela as a cautionary tale, the Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday observed that Covid-19 data shows pilgrims at the Kumbh Mela “took” the virus with them to the states they had come from, spurred a rise in cases and it was a “mistake” they would not want to repeat with the Char Dham Yatra. Unless there is a fool-proof system to prevent Covid-19 spread, it “wouldn’t be happy” to allow the state to hold the Yatra, the high court said. “I would hate to repeat the mistakes of Kumbh Mela. That can’t be. So, please bring everything on record,” Chief Justice RS Chauhan said during the online hearing on a bunch of PILs about the Covid-19 situation in the state. The division bench of Chief Justice Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma criticised the way the state had handled the Kumbh Mela. “If you look at the national data, it’s very apparent. It’s immediately after the Kumbh Mela that there was a sudden spike in all the states. Because, naturally, those pilgrims went back to their respective towns, villages and cities and took that strand with them. And then look at what devastation Maharashtra had to face, what devastation Rajasthan had to face, what devastation UP and Delhi had to face … We became the talk of the entire world,” the Chief Justice said, adding, “We should not create another such set of embarrassment.” The judges cited TOI’s report on the health department inquiry into one lakh fake Covid-19 tests during Kumbh and said the state must get to the bottom of the scam. “Even at that time, people had said that the fact that Haridwar is showing only 2.8% infection rate whereas other districts are showing 14.2% shows that something is wrong with findings in Haridwar. Somebody is not telling the truth about Haridwar. Now are we going to repeat the same sets of mistakes at Char Dham?” the court asked. In the last hearing, the court had said it was concerned about the government’s plans to hold the Char Dham Yatra in a phased manner and had asked state tourism secretary Dilip Jawalkar to be present at the next hearing. On Wednesday, Jawalkar said the state government had decided to not open the shrines till June 22 since Uttarakhand is under lockdown. Whether the shrines will be opened at all, he added, is still under consideration. “Even if the Yatra starts, it will be done in a phased manner,” he further said, reiterating what the state government had held earlier. But the court questioned the government’s preparedness. “Even during Kumbh, assurances were given by the chief secretary, mela officer and health secretary that there are appropriate arrangements to check the spread of the virus,” it said, adding that the Char Dham Yatra should not be allowed to turn into “another breeding ground” for Covid-19. “We cannot afford to go on sullying our reputation as a state.” The court added it was unhappy with the report filed by additional secretary (tourism) Ashish Chauhan, saying it is “devoid of any cogent and concrete supporting evidence.” The high court has now called for a fresh report informing it about the state government’s decision on Char Dham, the phases in which the government plans to open the Yatra, the arrangements made to ensure SOPs are followed and the people deployed at the shrines to implement guidelines. The court has also asked Jawalkar to explain how the 16-km trek to Kedarnath would be sanitised. Jawalkar has to file the report by June 21 and the next hearing is on June 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cant-repeat-kumbh-mistakes-wont-allow-char-dham-to-become-covid-breeding-ground-hc/articleshow/83582317.cms||Prashant Jha

Another 22 collectorate complexes are at different stages of completion, while work on three are yet to begin. The new integrated collectorate complexes, a flagship project of KCR, is estimated to cost over Rs 1,500 crore. The CM had announced this project to spare the people from running around various offices located at distant places in the district. He had announced that all district-level offices would be brought under one roof. It would be convenient for the people and also officials to save time from carrying files from one office to the other. Though the project was announced five years ago and even top construction firms in the country, including Shapoorji Pallonji, NCC Ltd among others, were selected through bidding process in July 2017 itself, the project was delayed for various reasons. Roads and buildings engineer-in-chief I Ganapathi Reddy told TOI each integrated collectorate complex would have 1.50 lakh sq ft of built up area. Each collectorate complex is estimated to cost between Rs 50 crore and Rs 60 crore. Of the 28 integrated collectorate complexes to be constructed, three would be inaugurated by the CM on Sunday and Monday. Another nine — Jangaon, Nizamabad, Sircilla, Jagtial, Peddapalli, Vikarabad, Mahbubnagar, Wanaparthy, and Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri districts — have also been completed and finishing touches were being given to them. Of the remaining 16, work started on 13. However, works were yet to begin on the construction of collectorate complexes in Karimnagar, Mulug and Narayanpet districts, which were sanctioned recently, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-to-inaugurate-3-new-integrated-collectorates/articleshow/83586770.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Hyderabad||Will Telangana govt appoint public prosecutors in 22nd century: HC||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday wondered whether the state and its home department would fill the vacant public prosecutor posts in trial courts in the 22nd century. The HC directed the state home department’s principal secretary Ravi Gupta to ensure filling of all the 200 additional public prosecutor posts in the criminal courts across the state in the next three weeks, or appear before it on July 7 for explaining the reasons for his failure. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said this while resuming the hearing in a PIL that questioned the inaction of the state in this regard. After coming to know through media reports about the crumbling criminal justice delivery system on account of nearly 300 posts of PPs lying vacant at trial courts, the HC earlier took up the issue as a public interest litigation petition. The state, despite regular and periodical directions from the high court, could fill only 70 posts till now and sought some more time to fill all the posts. The PIL was taken up in 2018 and more than 200 APP posts are lying vacant even now. Though the court has been granting time as was sought by the state, the task was never fully completed. On Wednesday, when the state counsel sought time, as usual, the bench lost its cool and asked the state counsel as to why they did not even furnish a timeline within which they propose to fill all the remaining posts. State home department’s counsel Srikanth Reddy had sought some more time. “You do not value time, why should we go on giving you time,” the bench asked him. Reddy apologised for the delay. “We do not attach any value to your submissions now”, the bench said while making it clear that his apologies too fail to engage them any more. When the state counsel said they want some breathing time, the bench was at its wit’s end and said: “It is two and half months since you took time last time. What did you in this time? Did you stop breathing? You frittered away this time and this amounts to obstructing the course of Justice. This procrastination is gross non-compliance,” the bench said ordering a contempt notice to the home secretary. “If he does his job in the next two weeks, then we will reconsider the contempt process against him,” the bench said. The state was earlier directed to recruit PPs and also set up offices for them in each trial court with modern amenities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-t-govt-appoint-public-prosecutors-in-22nd-century-hc/articleshow/83586731.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Kochi||Kerala: Forest officials rescue wild elephant from well in Ernakulam||KOCHI: A wild elephant, which fell into an open well at Pinavoorkudy tribal settlement in Kuttampuzha in Ernakulam, was rescued by the forest officials and local residents after strenuous efforts that lasted more than three hours on Wednesday. The cow elephant, aged around 18, accidentally fell into the 12-feet deep well located within a rubber plantation at Pinavoorkudy while wandering with its herd in the settlement. Though the accident occurred early on Wednesday, people noticed it only in the morning and alerted the forest officials. The residents could not reach the well as the herd stood in the area for long. Later on the herd moved to forest and waited there. In the meantime, the forest officials led by Valara forest station deputy ranger A Shyju dug out one side of the well using a bulldozer and created sloppy path through which the elephant managed to come out of the well by 11.45am. The severe rain in the area was also a challenge to the rescue operations. Forest officials said that the well has turned mushy due to the elephant’s struggle and rain. As the well was not that deep, the elephant did not suffer any injuries. The water level too was not high and the elephant could stand in it. However, due to the congested space in the well, the trapped elephant was panicky until it was rescued. “We reached the spot immediately after residents alerted us. The elephant had to stay trapped in the well for around eight hours. After the bulldozer arrived, it was only a matter of 25 minutes to level one side of the well and make a way for the elephant to climb out. After coming out, the elephant expressed its ire by rushing towards us but later it went into the forest and rejoined the herd,” Shyju said. The incidents involving elephants falling into well is frequent now in the eastern parts of Ernakulam and people are demanding a solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/forest-officials-rescue-wild-elephant-from-well/articleshow/83586786.cms||---
---||Pune||Service charge cap makes vax camps unviable: Hosps||Pune: Private hospitals in the city are redesigning off-site (outside of hospital premises) Covid vaccination programmes for corporate firms and housing societies after the Centre last week capped per-dose service charge at Rs 150. Most hospitals said except to fulfil commitments already made, they have now decided not to hold vaccination drives outside of their premises for corporates and citizen groups. They said current logistical overheads exceed the cap on service charges. Instead, administrators said they would create special time-slots for corporate staff on hospital premises while simultaneously focusing on the day's regular vaccination drive. The Centre had capped handling charges at Rs 150 per dose over and above procurement cost for private hospitals. This brought down the cost per Covishield dose to Rs 780. Before the cap, it was Rs 900 for on-site (in-hospital) vaccination and Rs 1,200 per dose during off-site programmes. Hospitals administrators said they will have to reduce the number of off-site camps for companies and housing societies as such drives need additional expenses, to transport medical teams and to have ambulances on standby for any adverse event. "We have been insisting on vaccination on our premises from the beginning. Currently, we are vaccinating corporate staff during special hours, between 5pm and 7pm after the day's regular drive gets over at 5pm," said Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said, "Off-site vaccination is not possible within the fixed service charge cap. It takes a lot of nursing staff and data entry operators to carry out drives on companies' premises. We are only fulfilling previous commitments as most of these companies have to tie up with us for medical care. So we cannot deny them. But we have decided to cut down on off-site vaccination drives." Noble, located in Hadapsar and near a special economic zone, is surrounded by many IT and construction firms. There has been a lot of demand for drives on the companies' premises. "We are catering to some of these firms because of previous commitments. But we have stopped taking new corporate clients as off-site drives are no longer viable," Sale said. Some hospitals said they will keep off-site programmes running. “We will continue to hold vaccination camps on companies' premises as they are in the interest of the country,” said Ketan Apte, head of Sahyadri Hospital, Deccan branch. Scores of private hospitals nationwide have asked the Centre to rethink the cap on service charges. Hospital administrators said a reasonable ceiling would let them take part in near-to-home and remote camps for housing societies and companies hoping to vaccinate staff. Public health experts too said vaccination camps for companies will play a key role during the unlock process, when scores of offices and factories open up. Private hospitals said off-site vaccination camps will need substantial rerouting of manpower and machinery, which otherwise can be used for core medical care. This rerouting, hospital administrators said, will need additional expenditure. And a service charge cap would mean hospitals may have to reach into their own pockets to set up up such infrastructure, administrators said. In earlier interviews, city private hospitals had also said the limit on service charges could impact procurement of the Sputnik V vaccine. The Centre has said private hospitals cannot charge more than Rs 1,145 for a dose of Sputnik V. Some hospitals said the price ceiling — given Sputnik V’s cold storage requirements — is financially unviable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/service-charge-cap-makes-vax-camps-unviable-hosps/articleshow/83586817.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh conducted 29% more vaccinations than Maharashtra since launch of Mission June||LUCKNOW: Intensified focus on Covid-19 vaccination is all set to make UP the number one state in the country. As on date, UP ranks number two with over 2.42 crore vaccinations since the launch of the programme on January 16. Data from the CoWin portal shows that Maharashtra leads the list with 2.67 crore vaccinations. However, considering the pace with which UP is moving since the launch of Mission June, the state is most likely to pip Maharashtra. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has already instructed health officials to increase vaccine capacity by three times over the next few weeks. Officials also said that vaccination is being carried out at 6,000-plus sites in UP and the plan is to increase the sites to 7,500 over the next few days. Explaining the math behind UP’s chance of overtaking Maharashtra, a senior officer in the health department said: “UP has undertaken over 29.2% more vaccinations than Maharashtra since the launch of Mission June. While Maharashtra extended 37.68 lakh jabs between June 1 and 15, UP has given 53.28 lakh vaccine shots in the same duration.” He added that UP’s performance over the past two weeks has been better than Maharashtra’s despite the fact that UP doesn’t conduct vaccination sessions on Sundays while Maharashtra does it. “We hope to overtake Maharashtra in the next 10-12 days,” he claimed. Officials also said that the CM has directed departments to facilitate industry players to undertake vaccination drive for employees and their families stating that eventually their effort will benefit the state. Insiders revealed that the state government has a stock of over 30 lakh doses while another hefty lot is under process. Meanwhile, the government had also floated a global tender to obtain the stock. Vaccine best defence against third Wave:The CM has been emphasizing on increasing the vaccine coverage in the state only to ensure that people suffer the least at the time of the anticipated third wave. In his visits to districts, the CM has shared how he is absolutely fine after taking the vaccine. “The state government has taken various measures to facilitate people’s vaccination. ‘Guardian Special’ and ‘Women Special’ booths and drive-in vaccination centres speak for the ease of getting vaccinated,” said Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary, information. He added that vaccination of drivers and vendors also began on Monday. Efforts have been initiated to facilitate private sector and corporates vaccinate their employees. Various studies have indicated that those vaccinated have not faced complications at the hands of the pandemic virus. One such internal assessment commissioned by the UP government showed that over 95% of the vaccinated Covid positive persons showed zero to mild symptoms and were managed at home. The remaining 3.5% had to go to a level-1 healthcare facility only because there was no facility to isolate the patient at home. A number of people, including Prof RK Dhiman, director of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, who contracted coronavirus infection despite having one or both doses of the vaccine, have noted that they did not suffer any problems unlike the non-vaccinated persons. “Being doctors, we are constantly at the risk of contracting the infection. However, the vaccine saved us from problems that pose a threat to life. In fact, very mild symptoms appeared in us and were resolved in a week. There is no doubt over vaccines and we are proof of it,” he said, urging people to shun their fears and get the jab without wasting time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-conducted-29-more-vaccinations-than-maharashtra-since-launch-of-mission-june/articleshow/83589299.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Pune||Schools start with poor attendance, hopes rest on next week||Pune: The new academic year that started on Tuesday across the schools in Maharashtra, except in Vidarbha region, had poor response. Only 25-30% of students attended schools virtually in the first two days. Problems such as poor connectivity, lack of devices and in some cases lack of interest were responsible for the poor response, teachers in government schools said. There are more than one crore students enrolled in schools in the state. Director of the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training Dinkar Temkar said,“We are confident the attendance will improve in the coming week. Since it is just the beginning and unlocking of restrictions also started now, the school attendance will see a positive impact. There are issues about connectivity and students not having the device to join classes. But the situation will improve and we are also employing other modes of teaching like telecasts on Sahyadri channel.” J K Patil, a teacher at Kenjal zilla parishad school in Bhor taluka, said, “We are implementing both online and offline modes of teaching.. We have been meeting parents and students in person and motivating them to join online classes and hoping that the attendance will improve. But, it looks like the parents and students wish for offline classes only.” According to school teachers, the issue was prominent in rural parts of the state. In Sangola taluka of Solapur district, school teacher Faruk Kazi, said, “The only solution will be a personal meeting with parents. This option will only be possible in rural and semi-urban areas and not so feasible in urban regions. There is no immediate solution other than waiting for students to join the class.” A teacher on condition of anonymity from Chalisgaon in Jalgaon district said that, “Students had not attended class in the last academic year too so many teachers have lost hope and have been sending them worksheets or some modules to solve on WhatsApp. The classes may have started elsewhere but in our region, they have not begun as yet.” Satish Bhong, another zilla parishad school teacher from Indapur taluka in Pune district, said online teaching is a big let down in rural parts. “Teaching is so incomplete through online mode. Offline classes are the only solution.” Slow Start To Academic YearThe situation is extremely poor for online schools in rural parts Schools said thousands of students had not joined at all A follow-up with those who failed to join in the first two days was required to boost attendance Students who have devices feel too lazy to join and those who do not have devices have no option Teachers have been employing various applications such as Google Meet, Microsoft Team to create a virtual classroom quote We need to do a state-wise survey on the attendance of students to online classes. in government schools wherever it is. We are not sure if attendance is low.

Delhi got 62,160 doses of Covaxin and 1,73,340 doses of Covishield on Tuesday and 2.55 lakh doses are now available for the 18-44 group, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atihsi said on Wednesday. The city has six days’ stock for Covaxin and 11 days of Covishield doses, she said. The AAP government had announced on Tuesday that the vaccination for the 18-44 group had been hit again in Delhi as half of the vaccine centres for this category had to be closed due to shortage of vaccines. Adequate stock is now available in Delhi for the above 45 years category — seven days of Covaxin and 42 days of Covishield doses. On Tuesday, 53,247 people were vaccinated, out of which 28,584 people got the first dose and 24,663 the second. So far, 62,04,209 people have been vaccinated, of which 14.88 lakh people have received both doses. Atishi said the only reason for the slowing down of the vaccination drive was the short supply of vaccine for the 18-44 years old. “More than half the vaccination centres were closed for the youth on Tuesday. If a regular supply of vaccines for the youth is not initiated, the hesitancy in those above 45 years will continue. When the youth go to get themselves vaccinated, they will also bring their family members along,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shot-in-arm-delhi-gets-fresh-supply-of-vaccines-for-those-in-18-44-age-group/articleshow/83586831.cms||---

So far, TRS governments have spent around Rs 1,200 crore on the scheme since its launch in 2017. Continuing the scheme this year, the state has already placed orders for one crore saris worth around Rs 350 crore with power looms in Sircilla and other districts. However, production of saris has been affected due to the second wave of the pandemic as many workers went back to their villages and states fearing infection. Textiles department officials informed that workers have started coming back as the number of Covid-19 cases are receding. Currently, 11,000 of the 16,000 power looms are functioning while the remaining are expected to become functional by the end of the month. “We are expecting one crore saris to be ready by September 15... Transportation of saris to districts and villages would be done in time to reach the beneficiaries before the festival,” said a Telangana State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-to-give-1-cr-bathukamma-saris-this-yr/articleshow/83586825.cms||Roushan Ali

While the state has allowed functioning of a range of industries, the lack of bus services has come as an impediment. This has also resulted in autorickshaws fleecing the public by hiking the charges as the people are forced to depend on them. The construction sector, which employs the highest number of people next to the agriculture sector, is finding it difficult to bring the workforce to the work sites due to unavailability of public mobility. The sector, which is already reeling under sharp price rise, finds this as another challenge even as it is limping back to normalcy. A Rajendran, president of the Madurai district construction workers association of CITU said share autos are providing connectivity only in the city areas. But, the drivers are collecting 30% higher fare than normal. They say that there is a restriction to carry only a limited number of passengers and hence it is not viable to operate by collecting the normal fare. “Construction labourers from rural areas are unable to reach the city due to the absence of bus transport system. The state government should immediately start bus services to facilitate connectivity. Until then only those who have a two-wheeler will be able to go out for work,” he said. R Vijaya, who works in a grocery store, said that she has to spend double the money to reach her work place in Anna Nagar from Kalmedu. G Kallanaia, a construction worker said that they get only limited work days in a week as the movement is restricted. They will get more days to work if the transport system is available. “Petrol price is about to touch Rs 100 a litre. One cannot imagine using a two-wheeler for long distance to reach the workplace.” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/lack-of-bus-services-fleecing-by-autos-hit-workers-livelihood/articleshow/83586792.cms||V Devanathan

C-DIT has submitted a proposal for creating a digital platform to integrate the secretariat file flow management system with the e-assembly system at a cost of Rs 25.68 lakh. The government has given administrative sanction for the creation of the digital platform. The legislative assembly switched over to e-assembly as part of making it paper-free. All members are provided with individual electronic screens, which offer documents including the budget speech, and other in-house documents in electronic format. However, a large number of paper documents are still under circulation in physical form, especially those from the secretariat, including the answers to questions raised by the members. Members have been complaining that many times the answers are provided several months after raising the questions, by when, the question itself would have become irrelevant. “The inordinate delay in receiving answers, on which there have been several rulings from the speaker, would make the questions irrelevant. Also, answers to only questions that are laid on the floor of the assembly are answered properly. A large number of other questions that do not reach the floor, but are placed in the library, are left unanswered. Of late, even MLAs have begun resorting to methods like RTI Act to seek answers, due to the delay in receiving answers from the assembly,” said IUML leader and Koduvally MLA M K Muneer. He said that the integration of assembly and secretariat would hopefully be a solution to the problem. Usually, the questions are accepted by the legislature secretariat from MLAs 10 days before the assembly session begins. These are then sent to the concerned administrative departments in the secretariat, which are then forwarded to the field departments for collecting the information. Since the information submitted as answers in the assembly have to be precise, in many instances, information will have to be collated from multiple departments which may take time, leading to an inordinate delay in returning the answers. “It has been insisted that the delayed answers should be filed along with a delay statement in the assembly in the same session, or on the first day of the next session. Even this timeframe is not met in some cases. Through the integration, the physical movement of files can be avoided and answers can be instantly uploaded on the portal, cutting down the delays significantly,” said sources in the secretariat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/efile-digital-platform-to-link-assembly-secretariat-soon/articleshow/83586822.cms||KP Saikiran

While no formal charges have been pressed, there are indications the group carried out similar drives in corporate houses and film production companies between Andheri and Borivli over the last fortnight. Times ViewThe police and civic probes will help book the criminals in the fraudulently organised vaccine drive, but the BMC needs to devise a foolproof system in which such crimes cannot be committed. Society residents in this case don’t know if a genuine vaccine was injected into them. This is a criminal act. People too need to be aware of rules, and tricksters can’t bend them so easily.Inquiries revealed the main organiser, Mahendra Singh, is a part of an event management company that had enlisted a marketing executive from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (KDAH) in Andheri to gain entry into the Hiranandani Heritage housing society in Kandivali. A third aide assisted with carrying out the vaccination drive. The KDAH employee, Rajesh Pandey, has admitted to helping the event management outfit organise small camps for employees of a few film production houses as well as a well-known travel company. At least one of these camps was held in a reputed school in Santa Cruz. Both were being questioned by the Kandivali police at the time of going to the press. There was no clarity over the vaccine itself; residents of Hiranandani Heritage written to the police on Tuesday about the possibility of a spurious vaccine being administered to 390 of its residents on May 30. “Our main concern is where were the vaccine vials obtained from and whether they were spurious,” said a senior officer attached to the investigation. The police will decide about registering an FIR on Thursday after questioning Singh. The alleged modus operandi was to send Pandey to make the initial call and then take cash payment running into lakhs to administer vaccines. There is no signed paperwork between the company and vaccinated entities, and the event management company provided Co-Win vaccine certificates from various hospitals. Singh had reportedly switched off his phone after Hiranandani Heritage residents approached the police on Tuesday. It is learnt Singh is also associated with the Malad Medical Association. On Wednesday, teams of officers from the Kandivali police station fanned out to different hospitals whose names had been mentioned on the certificates issued to Hiranandani residents. “We have so far recorded statements of three hospitals and five society residents,” the officer said. A spokesperson for Nanavati Hospital, Juhu, said the police team had visited the hospital and spoken to a number of employees. About 100 of the 150 certificates given to Hiranandani Heritage residents had Nanavati Hospital’s name and its nurse’s name as the main vaccinator. The police were questioning employees of Goregaon-based Lifeline Hospital (some residents got certificates with Lifeline’s name) in the hospital premises till late in the evening. Meanwhile, the Borivali police have initiated an inquiry into a similar vaccination drive carried out on a college campus at Borivali West earlier this month. The beneficiaries had not received any certificates. No FIR has been lodged by the Borivali police so far. KDAH issued a statement clarifying that it was not connected with the vaccination drive carried out at Hiranandani Heritage on May 30. CEO Dr Santosh Shetty said, "After a preliminary investigation, it has been discovered that Rajesh Pandey, an employee of our hospital, has illegally and without authorisation been involved in this fraudulent activity.''  Pandey "deceitfully misused'' the hospital name along with external individuals and institutions not connected with KDAH. He has been sacked. "The vaccination drives where Rajesh Pandey was involved in his personal capacity were done without the knowledge of KDAH and without the hospital’s trained medical personnel and resources,'' he said. The hospital said Pandey was not involved in its vaccination programme and had no access to the Co-Win platform and supplies being used for the vaccination program or any related data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-drive-case-hosp-staffer-2-others-quizzed/articleshow/83589313.cms||Nitasha Natu

A statement was filed before the high court on Wednesday by S Manu, the standing counsel for Lakshadweep administration, in response to Aisha’s plea for anticipatory bail in the case registered on June 9. As per the statement, the investigation in the case is at a preliminary stage and interrogation of the applicant is unavoidable for its progress. The alleged statement of the applicant in a news channel discussion, that central government relaxed Covid-19 quarantine restrictions for visitors to Lakshadweep so as to use Covid as a bioweapon against the islanders, is sufficient to arouse hatred or contempt among the people of Lakshadweep towards the Government of India. It can be prima facie considered as an attempt to excite disaffection among the people towards the Government of India, the statement said. Further, the administration has contended that her statement has a tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence. It also prima facie amounts to an assertion prejudicial to national integration, the statement said while explaining the reason for booking her for sedition and imputation prejudicial to national integration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/interrogation-of-aisha-sultana-unavoidable/articleshow/83586889.cms||---

Depending on the response, we shall extend the drive,” a civic official said. “The first day of the initiative saw a good response from travel aspirants. After a morning rush, the footfall continued throughout the day,” Gopal Ujwankar, a medical officer from the Kasba Vishrambaugwada ward office, said. PMC had conducted a similar drive in the first week of June only for foreign-bound students. At that time, as many as 1,550 students from Pune and neighbouring districts were vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tokyo-bound-aspirants-to-get-jabs-on-priority/articleshow/83586839.cms||---

A BMC statement said, “Citizens and housing organizations should contact the medical health officer in their ward regarding the registration of the private immunization centre before the drive.” Deputy municipal commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar, in charge of the zone who has been asked to inquire into the incident, said that the MoU clause has been in existence since the protocols for vaccination at housing societies/workplaces were drawn up. “In this case, a notice has been issued to the society,” he said. The notice was received by the housing association manager Sachin Vichare. A society office-bearer said a reply would be submitted after the letter is tabled before the managing committee. On the vaccination drive which was held in the same society on Wednesday, local MLA Yogesh Sagar said that on May 27, the society had written to him to initiate the drive, and Wednesday’s camp was pre-planned. “We tied up with Oscar Hospital, and all residents were given a vaccination certificate at the venue itself. The beneficiaries were those who were not a part of the earlier camp,” Sagar said. A spokesperson for Nanavati Hospital, Juhu, said the Kandivli police team visited the hospital on Wednesday and “spoke” to a number of employees. About 100 of 150 certificates given to Hiranandani Heritage residents had Nanavati Hospital’s name and its nurse’s name as main vaccinator. Police were questioning employees of Goregaon-based Lifeline Hospital (some residents got certificates with Lifeline’s name) in the hospital premises till late evening.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Sugar mills, private units roped in to set up oxygen plants in all districts||LUCKNOW: The departments of sugarcane development and excise have been roped in to play a major role in augmenting the supply of medical oxygen in the state. In a unique initiative, the departments have roped in sugar mills and distilleries to fund oxygen generators using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds which are now being set up in all districts of the state. Additional chief secretary (sugarcane development and excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that district magistrates, in consultation with the chief medical officer, have identified community health centres or district hospitals where oxygen plants have to be set up. “We have received funds for 47 oxygen plants from state sugar mills and other allied institutions like FMC Limited, HDFC Bank, etc, and for 33 oxygen plants from distilleries of the state excise department. In this way, we are setting up 80 oxygen production plants with CSR funds, with at least one in each district,” he said. These plants will ensure oxygen supply to 3,500-4,000 beds in CHCs and district hospitals, serving some of the most remote rural areas in the state, along with urban ones. They will be in place well before the last quarter of 2021 when the state is anticipating the third wave of Covid-19 to strike. Bhoosreddy said that oxygen generation plants are already functional in the districts of Hathras, Kasganj, Gorakhpur, Basti, Deoria and Amroha. Most of the remaining ones will be made available in June and the rest by the first week of July. “For the smooth operation of these oxygen generation plants, the department has made available engineering design related to installation and operating manuals of the respective machines, etc, to DMs in all districts. Apart from this, arrangements for the operation of these plants, such as installation of oxygen pipeline and setting up of generators to ensure continuous power supply, have been made in advance,” the ACS said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sugar-mills-institutions-roped-in-to-set-up-oxygen-plants-in-all-districts/articleshow/83589340.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Delhi||Covid vaccine protects against infection in 95% of cases: Study||NEW DELHI: Vaccine against Covid-19 is effective. It protects against infection, in 95% cases. This has been confirmed by a multi-centre study conducted by Apollo group of hospitals. It is based on an analysis of breakthrough infection – detection of Covid-19 in persons who had received either both doses or the first dose of Covishield or Covaxin – in over 31,000 healthcare workers working at 43 hospitals of the group. According to Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director and senior pediatric gastroenterologist, Apollo Hospitals Group, post-vaccination infection (PVI) occurred in only 4.28% (1,355 out of 31,621) of the vaccinated healthcare workers. “Only 90 healthcare workers or 0.28% of the study subjects required hospitalisation, with only three cases or 0.009% requiring ICU admission,” he claimed. The most important finding of the study was that there were “no deaths in case of Covid infection after vaccination,” Dr Sibal added. Studies conducted by AIIMS, Maulana Azad Medical College and Fortis hospitals have also shown similar results. Among the cohorts included in the Apollo study, officials said, Covishield was administered to 28,918 healthcare workers (91% HCWs), while 2,703 (9%) received Covaxin. Also, 25,907 or 82% of the HCWs were fully vaccinated, having received both doses of the vaccine, while 5,714 or 18.1% had received only the first dose, they added. Dr Raju Vaishya, one of the authors of the study, said the incidence of post-vaccination infection in HCWs who had been administered Covishield was 4.32% and in those who had received Covaxin was 3.85%. A hospital spokesperson said HCWs involved in the study included doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, as well as support and administrative staff, among others. The findings of the study are under consideration for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal, the hospital said in a statement. Commenting on the study, Dr Prathap C Reddy, founder chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group, said, “This study reiterates the fact that our mainstay against Covid-19 is mass vaccination. Vaccines are not only safe, but they also help prevent severe manifestations of Covid-19 and will help save lives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-protects-against-infection-in-95-of-cases-study/articleshow/83586908.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

According to police, more members of the racket involved in the smuggling of the drug were on the run in Tamil Nadu. A key-link in the racket, a Thiruvallur native, was arrested by the team from Chennai on Tuesday. “Abid, Sivaprasad and Ibrahimkutty, who were earlier arrested in the case, have been granted police custody and we are conducting evidence collection with them. Suresh, the Thiruvallur native arrested on Tuesday, maintained a close contact with the other three. The others used to deposit the money required for the drugs in Suresh’s account,” said police. Police said that the special team had to use reasonable force to arrest Suresh. “He was arrested from Ilayangudi near Madurai and we had to encircle the area to prevent him from escaping. Though there was resistance to arrest, we were able to overpower him and take him into custody,” said an officer. The accused had used a specially designed compartment in their pick-up truck to transport the drug into the district from Chennai. Rural police made the seizure at a location in Karukutty, Angamaly on the night of June 5. Police had found that the accused had brought the contraband for distribution in various locations in the state. The seizure was made by the local police and district anti-narcotic special action task force (Dansaf), based on a confidential alert received by District police chief, SP K Karthick. In the case of MDMA, also known as Molly or Ecstasy, possession of a quantity above 10gm is considered as a commercial quantity. As per NDPS Act, possession or transport of a commercial quantity of the substance can invite a punishment of rigorous imprisonment of 10 to 20 years and fine of Rs 1 to 2 lakh. Meanwhile, Suresh was remanded in judicial custody by a magistrate court in Angamaly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mdma-seizure-more-arrests-likely-in-chennai/articleshow/83586850.cms||---

The facility will also be available for all ex-servicemen at ECHS clinics across the state. As of now, ex-servicemen are getting vaccinated at military hospitals (MHs). However, those living in rural areas face problems in the absence of a facility in their area. The defence ministry has issued an order facilitating vaccination at ECHS clinics. The vaccine doses will be provided to these clinics by the district administration. There are 30 ECHS polyclinics in the state. Commander Ravindra Pathak (Retd) said, “Thousands of family members will get vaccine doses hassle-free. This would be a big relief. Many ex-servicemen in Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and other areas would benefit.” A senior army officer told TOI, “The respective district administration would verify required facilities that are necessary to start a Covid-19 vaccination centre and it will give permission accordingly.” Some polyclinics in western Maharashtra do not have adequate health staff and data entry operators to run the vaccination process smoothly, said a senior army official. “We will have to hire health staff on contract for at least two years. ECHS dispensaries look after daily essentials, such as giving medicines to ex-servicemen, processing medical bills, etc. It would be difficult for them to conduct the vaccination drive,” said another army officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-at-echs-polyclinics-soon/articleshow/83586862.cms||Sandip Dighe

Soman is a resident of an old-age home in Kothrud. “I feel protected now,” she said, during the special drive this week. About 50 residents of the Palash care home, where Soman has been a resident for two years, received their Covid-19 jabs during special drives supervised by the PMC’s health department. In the last 30 days, the PMC has vaccinated a total of 2,213 elderly and people with disabilities across 38 care homes in the city. Plans are on to expand the drives. “We plan to cover another 50 such centres in another month's time,” said PMC’s Covid immunisation chief Vaishali Jadhav. On Wednesday, a total of 29,200 beneficiaries, including 3,460 senior citizens over the age of 60, were vaccinated across the district's three administrative segments — the PMC, PCMC and Pune rural. Among other beneficiaries, a total of 460 healthcare workers and 1,383 frontline workers got their first and second shots on Wednesday. In the 18-44 age group, 18,913 beneficiaries got their first and second shots. “There are no plans currently for home-to-home vaccination. But we intend to cover all citizens dependent on assisted living at old age and homes for those with disabilities in the city,” Jadhav said. As for vaccination coverage on Thursday, citizens in PMC areas who got their first Covaxin dose on or before May 19 will be given their second dose of the vaccine at 15 PMC-run vaccination centres, civic officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-30-days-pmc-vaccinates-2213-care-home-residents/articleshow/83586853.cms||---

The Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP) has decided to write to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), requesting to hold special drives and make vaccines available at discounted price. According to the retailers’ association, its many members aged above 45 years managed to get at least one shot, but around 35,000 shopkeepers and their employees in the 18-44 age group are waiting for the jabs. Sachin Nivangune, the president of Pune District Retailers’ Association, said the government should provide vaccines for shopkeepers and their employees as they are exposed to the crowd. “Many shopkeepers are still waiting for at least one dose of vaccine. The government should give priority to traders and shopkeepers. We have approached the PMC with a proposal to conduct decentralised camps for shopkeepers,” he said. The traders also raised concerns over the non-availability and high price of vaccines. Ashok Satav, who runs a cloth shop in the Ravivar Peth area, said, “I have around 25 people working at my shop and most are 18 to 45 years old. It will be difficult for me to vaccinate all the employees when the business is down.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-groups-to-write-to-cm/articleshow/83586876.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||60% rapid antigen tests in Maharashtra to cover rural areas||PUNE: The rapid antigen tests now comprise nearly 60% of the Covid-19 tests for covering the rural areas more, while the share of the gold standard RT-PCR test has dropped to about 40%. Dr Pradeep Awate, the state surveillance expert, said the rapid antigen tests (RATs) had been increased to cover the hotspots in rural areas, where the reach of laboratories was limited. According to the recent Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, the aim is to spread the testing to interiors and rural areas during the second wave. On Wednesday, the state registered 42% RT-PCR tests and 58% RATs. Of the 2.22 lakh tests carried out, 1.28 lakh were antigen tests and 93,000 were RT-PCR tests. Over 80% tests are being carried out using RAT in several districts in the state, said a health official. Echoing him, Awate said, “Many districts have registered more antigen tests than RT-PCR tests.” According to a report, Amravati (84%), Bhandara (91%) and Gadchiroli (87%) have registered more RATs than RT-PCR tests. Reason: hotspots in these areas have been identified and antigen tests are being conducted of close contacts of Covid positive patients. “Our main aim is to conduct RATs and isolate high-risk and low-risk contacts to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” said one of the health officials monitoring the drive. RAT is a faster process than the RT-PCR, which has a turnaround time of 24 hours. The ICMR’s approval to home test kits helped enhance the antigen tests. In metros, RT-PCR test remains the key to detect Covid patients. In Pune district, more RT-PCR tests (56%) were conducted than (44%) RATs. Mumbai registered only 20% antigen tests and Nagpur about 21%. The ICMR officials said the way forward was to cover larger population and focus on early detection as they had cleared three home-based RAT kits. With the state carrying out district-wise unlock process through five levels, antigen tests have to be monitored thoroughly. The ICMR advocates antigen tests in hotspots to test and segregate early. If symptomatic patients test negative, they are referred for RT-PCR tests. Public health expert Dr Giridhara Babu told TOI while ICMR guidelines allowed for more RATs to enable more testing with faster turnaround, it should be limited to those having symptoms or those in the high-risk or low-risk categories of those testing positive. “In the presence of symptoms, RAT has high sensitivity. So only if symptomatic patients test negative on RAT, RT-PCR can be done. In the absence of symptoms, RT-PCR continues to be the gold standard. In the absence of symptoms, the use of RAT should be in check because there could be a possibility of states carrying out a lot of RATs to show more numbers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/60-rapid-antigen-tests-in-state-to-cover-rural-areas/articleshow/83586902.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kochi||‘Erratic rains due to Cyclone Yaas’||KOCHI: The distribution of rainfall in Kerala has been severely affected and there is an evident reduction in the amount of rainfall, said Roxy Mathew Koll, senior climate scientist at centre for climate change research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. Koll said that changes in southwest monsoon can be noted by its varied nature every year. “Public memory is short, but 2015 and 2016 saw severe drought. In 2015, state received 26% deficient rain while it was 34% deficient in 2016. In last three years, there were extremely heavy rainfall events leading to floods and landslides,” he said. Koll was speaking at monsoon series talks organized by KSDMA on ‘Kerala rainfall-What to expect’. Several climatic changes have been occurring in the region which is changing the monsoon dynamics. “This year, Kerala got good rain in May but the first fortnight of monsoon was deficient. The formation of cyclone Tauktae and Yaas affected monsoon as they took away the water vapour from monsoon winds,” he said. Kerala and other states along west coast received extremely heavy rainfall in May 2021 due to cyclone Tauktae. “These cyclones have huge energy, pull water vapour from the atmosphere and affect a radius of 100-300km in their path. We have seen these cyclones move deep into interior land,” Koll added. Cyclone Yaas affected and disturbed the rainfall pattern in Kerala, but states like Maharashtra received monsoon rain early. “One notable event during cyclone Tauktae was that INCOIS wave rider buoy (which gives alerts on tidal waves) noted tidal wave height of 4-5m on May 14 in Kollam. Cyclone Yaas, which was in the Bay of Bengal, led to 3m high tidal waves along Kerala’s coast. On June 3 (monsoon onset), tidal waves were around 2m high due to monsoon and winds caused by the depression that had formed. This indicates that cyclones, depressions forming anywhere in north Indian ocean in Indian waters affect Kerala, even if it is happening in the Bay of Bengal,” he said. Data showed a 50% increase in cyclones in the Arabian Sea from 2001-2019 and most were forming in western part that is warming fast. “The key thing is that these cyclones are bringing extremely heavy rain,” he said. “Our studies showed that while there is an overall reduction in rain from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod, large parts of central Kerala and places like Kannur are receiving heavy rain. This is leading to an overall balance in rainfall percent; but it is irregular,” Koll added. During such extreme rain events, it is important to have strong forest cover to curb landslides and mudslides that are becoming a regular phenomenon. Studies showed that Kerala’s forest cover has gone down by 50% from 1973 to 2016. Mining and cutting of trees are leading to imbalance in land patterns and it is impacting climate, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/erratic-rains-due-to-cyclone-yaas/articleshow/83587048.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Primary Health Centres (PHC) are being stocked with anti-venom to prevent casualties, usually reported in rural areas. While each year, the state records between 3,500-4,000 cases of snake bites, majority of the cases are of agricultural workers who fall prey to snake bites as they do not take any safety precautions. While the state health department is focusing on stocking anti-snake venom at the districts and village level, one of the key interventions — use of gumboots — utilised in many countries, is still not in the list of the government measures. “This is a preventive method used effectively to reduce snake bites in several countries,” said a critical care specialist from one of the tertiary centres in state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/phcs-stocked-with-anti-venom-to-prevent-snake-bite-casualties/articleshow/83586929.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Wife raises questions over trucker’s suicide||NAGPUR: The mystery over the alleged suicide of 48-year-old truck driver Ashok Nagotra deepened after it came to fore that he had used a bike’s wire to hang himself in the cabin of his truck parked outside Kondhali police station on Tuesday. It has come to fore that he had approached cops to lodge complaint of theft but a case of criminal breach of trust was registered against him after four days. On Wednesday, Nagotra’s post-mortem was performed at GMCH which was videographed too. His family members, who were at GMCH, were clueless why would the deceased carry a bike’s wire. On Monday, Kondhali police booked Nagotra for allegedly misappropriating 160 soyabean oil cans worth over Rs3.68 lakh on the way to Bhiwandi. It is learnt, Nagotra neither had any case against him nor was involved in any controversy in 25-30 years. His wife Maya said Nagotra had to stop at Bazargaon petrol pump overnight on June 9 as there was no stock of diesel. “My husband had tried to alert ‘100’ on June 10 after realizing that the consignment had been stolen but the control room cannot be contacted. He took efforts to get the number of Kondhali police station,” said Maya, mother of two. “The truck was parked at Bazargaon since last week. My husband took it to the police station on Monday evening. He had been repeatedly telling the cops about the theft. Police kept saying there cannot be any incident of theft and took no efforts to recover the materials,” she said claiming Nagotra was a teetotaller and a vegan. Maya also said her husband had approached Kondhali police station on Tuesday and informed the truck owner about the theft. “Even before investigating, police made my husband a scapegoat and booked him,” she alleged. “My husband was scared of death. He wouldn’t even step out of house fearing Covid,” she said. Senior inspector Vishwas Pullarwar said the matter will be investigated by a senior DySP. “The death is unfortunate but many questions about the theft are unanswered. The driver had taken around five hours to reach Bazargaon from Saoner,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wife-raises-questions-over-truckers-suicide/articleshow/83586885.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Localized pandemic control measures come into effect from today in Thiruvananthapuram||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Restrictions and exemptions as part of Covid-19 containment measures would be effective in a localized manner in the district from Thursday onwards. The city corporation and the four municipalities came under Category B where the test positivity rate (TPR) for the last one week has been between 8% and 20%. These areas were categorized as those with moderate spread of disease. A total of 31 local bodies, including four municipalities and city corporation, are included in Category B in the district. Weekly TPR of Thiruvananthapuram corporation stood at 13.7% whereas the TPR of four municipalities are in the range 11-20%. Six panchayats (Category D) — Kadinamkulam, Pothencode, Panavoor,Manamboor, Athiyanoor and Karode — came under stringent restrictions for a whole week in the district from Thursday. Kadinamkulam has recorded the highest positivity rate among Category D panchayats (36.93%). Thirty-eight local bodies in the district have recorded average TPR between 20% and 30% in the last week and they came under Category C. Mangalapuram and Azhoor top the Category C with an average weekly TPR of 29.6% and 29.19% respectively. Only three panchayats made it to Category A where the weekly TPR is below 8% (those with low spread). Nanniyode, Nagaroor and Kuttichal recorded 7.04%, 5.97% and 3.22% TPRs respectively. As per the proceedings issued by the district collector, there will be a complete lockdown on Saturday and Sunday across the entire district. In Category A, B and C areas, supermarkets selling essential items shall be allowed to function on Saturday and Sunday but only for home delivery. Shopowners have been directed to display the area of the shop, number of people allowed and number of people currently inside the shop at any point of time. For every 100 sqft, not more than five people shall be allowed at any point of time. Shops shall also maintain customer register, thermal screening at entrance and hand sanitizer facility at the entrance and exit points. Manickal panchayat, which was one of the first local bodies to bring down the TPR below 8%, suddenly found itself in Category B with 11% TPR. The panchayat did a random testing at Arackal and came across some positive test results which reflected in increased TPR. The restrictions and exemptions will be reviewed every Wednesday based on average weekly TPR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/localized-pandemic-control-measures-come-into-effect-from-today-in-tvm/articleshow/83586914.cms||---
---||Pune||India’s anaphylaxis rate lower than that of other countries: Top official||Pune: The incidence rate of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) in India after Covid vaccination is approximately one per million doses of either Covishield or Covaxin, said Dr NK Arora, advisor to the National Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) Committee. He said the number has been lower than that of other countries, adding that the UK and some other nations have had a rate of 15 per million doses. The AEFI committee this week confirmed that a 68-year-old man had died in March after vaccination. Dr Arora said anaphylaxis was seen during previous vaccination programmes as well. Usual rates are one to five events per million doses with most of the paediatric and adult vaccines, he said. The death assessment of 31 serious adverse events after immunisation was submitted by the government panel after the causality assessment was done for cases in February and March. The report was out on June 4. “Nearly 70-80% of AEFI events occur within 30 minutes of vaccination. Across states, programme personnel and vaccinators have been able to immediately identify, treat and arrest such events. All vaccination centres have AEFI kits and trained staff have been able to prevent any kind of untoward event,” Dr Arora said. He urged all states to ensure events of concern occurring even 28 days after vaccination are logged into the CoWIN database. Strict AEFI monitoring is also why the committee has been having reservations against door-to-door drives. Dr Arora said, “The issue is not about carrying out these drives, but more about medical and technical concerns. Any person who has been vaccinated has to be monitored for 30 minutes. The monitoring has to be diligent and is practically not feasible when it comes to door-to-door vaccination. This has been the reason for launching near-to-home Covid vaccination centres. Even drives at large housing societies have been permitted only with assistance from a medical team.” Experts have urged the Centre to release AEFI data regularly. Virologist Dr T Jacob John, a former professor at the Christian Medical College (Vellore), said the government has not replied to experts' requests for regular and transparent data. Dr John said there are two key issues regarding data. “One is availability of reasonably good data and second, willingness to share it transparently. When both are negative we have a big problem. The first is governance deficiency and second is honesty deficiency. Better data and transparency are possible only if the country establishes an agency that is responsible for data and data reporting,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indias-anaphylaxis-rate-lower-than-that-of-other-countries-top-official/articleshow/83586920.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Fishy vaccination drive under lens; show MoU, BMC tells CHS||MUMBAI: Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on Wednesday ordered a probe into the suspicious vaccine drive held at Hiranandani Heritage Cooperative Housing Society, Kandivli, on May 30. He has directed the local deputy municipal commissioner to submit a report within 48 hours. Earlier in the day, BMC’s R South ward office issued a notice to the chairman/secretary of the society, asking it to submit the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed with the Private Covid Vaccination Centre (PCVC) for the vaccination camp. The society has been asked to submit an explanation within three days or face legal action. Also, on Wednesday, a vaccination drive was conducted in the society with 346 residents getting vaccinated. BMC officials said an MoU is mandatory, and housing societies should carry out a thorough verification of the identity cards of the employees who come for immunization. The BMC has also said citizens should remember that each PCVC is given a registration number on CoWin. “Citizens and housing organizations should contact the medical health officer in their ward regarding the registration of the private immunization centre before the drive,” said the BMC statement. Deputy municipal commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar, in charge of the zone who has been asked to inquire into the incident, said the MoU clause has been in existence since protocols for vaccination at housing societies/workplaces was drawn up. “In this case, a notice has been issued to the society,” he said. The notice was received by the housing association manager Sachin Vichare. A society office-bearer said a reply would be submitted after the letter is tabled before the managing committee. On the vaccination drive held in the society on Wednesday, local MLA Yogesh Sagar said that on May 27, the society had written to him to initiate the drive, and Wednesday’s camp was pre-planned. “We tied up with Oscar Hospital, and all residents were given a vaccination certificate at the venue itself. The beneficiaries were those who were not a part of the earlier camp,” Sagar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fishy-vax-drive-under-lens-show-mou-bmc-tells-chs/articleshow/83591121.cms||Richa Pinto
---||World||Delta variant fuelled 50% rise in English Covid prevalence: Study||LONDON: The rapid spread of the Delta coronavirus variant has driven a 50% rise in infections in England since May, a large prevalence study led by Imperial College London found on Thursday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson delayed the end of restrictions. The government said the data supported Johnson's decision to push back the end of Covidrestrictions in England to July 19, citing the threat of the Delta variant first identified in India, and the need to vaccinate more people. The latest round of the REACT-1 prevalence survey, conducted between May 20 and June 7, found prevalence was 0.15%, compared to 0.10% in the last set of data from late April to early May. "Prevalence is increasing exponentially, driven by younger ages... and it appears to be doubling every 11 days. Clearly, that is bad news," Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics, Imperial College London, told reporters. The study is one of the largest prevalence surveys in Britain, with 109,000 volunteers tested in its latest round. Riley added that Britain's high vaccination levels made it hard to predict how long that exponential growth would last, saying the rapid rollout of vaccine doses to younger age groups should slow it down. Over half the adult population of Britain have received two vaccine doses, and more than three-quarters of adults have received at least one vaccine dose. Although the Delta variant is shown to substantially reduce the effectiveness of one dose of vaccine against mild infection, two doses still provide good protection against severe disease, early evidence has shown. "These findings highlight the stark context in which we took the difficult decision to delay Step 4 of the roadmap out of lockdown," health minister Matt Hancock said, referring to the lifting of the last remaining restrictions in England. "We all must hold our nerve that little bit longer as our vaccine rollout continues."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/delta-variant-fuelled-50-rise-in-english-covid-prevalence-study/articleshow/83592146.cms||---

---||Pune||Passport verification pleas decline in Pune due to travel curbs||PUNE: A prolonged pandemic resulting in air travel and tourism restrictions found reflection through a marked drop in the number of passport verification applications received by the city police this year and also in 2020. From January 1 to June 15, the police have received only 27,664 such pleas as against 57,695 pleas received in the entirety of 2020. In hindsight, 1.34 lakh applications were received in 2019, police said. Before 2020, long queues of people outside police stations was a normal sight but these days, people hardly visit police stations for verification purposes, said a constable involved in the passport verification process. With a majority of people staying back or working from home and many nations having imposed travel restrictions, the need to have a passport seems to have reduced, police said. The regional passport office moves all the passport applications to the Pune police’s special branch (SB) for verification purposes. The police verify them and return the pleas with their opinion, to the passport office. Deputy commissioner of police (SB) Mitesh Ghatte said, “Owing to Covid curbs, lack of flights to visit desired destinations, have ensured that people are confined to their homes. As such we have received very few passport verification applications.” Ghatte said, “The most important factor is that other countries too are fighting the war against Covid and many have suspended the flight operations. Owing to the current situation, there are very slim chances for citizens to visit foreign countries. Thus the number of passport applications is lower.” Police inspector (SB) Milind Gaikwad said, “There is also a fear of contracting Covid if someone travels within the country or to other countries. Majority of passport applicants want to travel to either European or North American countries. Many countries are cautious about the spread of infection and have suspended international flight operations for now.” Gaikwad added, “At the same time there are very few overseas job opportunities at present.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/passport-verification-pleas-decline-due-to-travel-curbs/articleshow/83586996.cms||---

The officials identified the accused as Francis of Panniyode near Kattakkada. He was taken into custody on Tuesday evening from his current dwelling place at Panavoor. The officials have seized two ganja plants that were nine-months old and over eight-feet tall. Vamanapuram excise range inspector G Mohankumar said that the accused was a bachelor who lived alone in a house owned by his relative at Panavoor. The house owner lived in another house located nearby. They received a tip-off that the accused was growing ganja plants inside the house compound following which officers in civil dress were dispatched to verify the information. They confirmed that the two tall plants that stood near the well on the compound were ganja. It was following that the arrest was made. “Cultivating ganja plants is a major offence that could fetch a maximum sentence of 10 years of imprisonment,” Mohankumar said. The accused told the excise officials that he had been smoking ganja for the past eight years. These plants were grown from the seeds that he got from a few guest labourers whom he met at a work site last year. The owner of the house told the officials that though he had enquired about the plants, Francis had replied that they were medicinal plants known as Shivamouli, the inspector said. The accused was produced before the court on Wednesday following which he was remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-held-for-growing-ganja-in-guise-of-medicinal-plant/articleshow/83586990.cms||---

A scroll of honour about their contribution will also be given to the families of the individuals who have passed away due to Covid,” said Vivek Menon, executive director & CEO of WTI. Of the six Covid victims, three are from Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), Chandrapur, and three from Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) in Gondia and Bhandara districts. The NGO has offered help to even the office staff of the PAs. From NNTR, families of Naresh Gahane, a clerk, Suresh Lanjewar and Moreshwar Walke, both daily wage labourers, have benefitted. From TATR, families of daily wage workers Pravin Akojwar (45) and Patru Kinnake (59), and forest guard Chandrakant Gajbhe (57) were provided the aid. “Last month, WTI released Rs1 lakh each to the kin of three forest labourers who were charred to death while extinguishing forest fires inside Nagzira in April. Besides, the family of a deceased daily wager from Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) was also paid an ex-gratia of Rs 1 lakh. He too had died while dousing forest fires adjoining Nagzira,” said Prafulla Bhamburkar, WTI advisor, Maharashtra. Bhamburkar said the NGO has released money to kin of over 50 Covid victims in the country.

In seven projects, the students have earned profits. One of them, Divine Creations, a project to sell Madhubhani paintings, earned a profit of Rs 3,100. Mobisite, another project of eight students, sold two refurbished mobile phones at a profit of Rs 570. In the pilot, Rs 1,000 as seed money had been given to 41 students of the School of Excellence, Khichripur, who were mentored by 11 MBA students of Delhi Technological University. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia reviewed the pilot project on Wednesday. Sisodia said, “We launched the Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum in 2019 with the aim of inculcating an entrepreneurial mindset in our students to help them become job providers instead of job seekers. The children who received this seed money have done a great job in conceiving of ideas. The mentors from DTU have also played a significant role in streamlining the student projects and building the confidence of the children. The team of mentors is guiding the students at two levels —conceive the project and implement the idea after its approval.” The deputy CM added, “I want every child to graduate from school and become an entrepreneur. Our students should leave schools in Rancho mode, not Chatur mode. As an education system, we should take responsibility to see every child leaving our school able to apply skills they have learned and equipped with an entrepreneurial mindset for setting up their own business or in a career.” He said in the coming months, DTU and Directorate of Education would organise a one-day exhibition of the projects and advise the students on their concepts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/boost-for-budding-entrepreneurs/articleshow/83587054.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Riots case: Trial will settle scope and use of UAPA||New Delhi: While Delhi High Court has raised several questions on the scope and applicability of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against Delhi riots accused Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Tanha while granting them bail, senior police officers feel the relevance of the law and its provisions will be fully settled only in the course of the trial. “The three accused have only been granted bail and the Delhi High Court’s observations in their bail orders shall not have any bearing on the trial. Whether or not charges are made out against them under Section 15, 17 and 18 of UAPA is something that shall be decided during the trial, based on the evidence presented by the prosecution,” said a senior IPS officer who did not want to be named.The officer said UAPA can be invoked in cases where an act intending to strike terror among the people by use of bombs and inflammable substances, results in death or injury to any person or persons. Section 18 of the Act covers not only those committing the actual act but all who were part of the conspiracy to commit it. “Incidentally, the maximum penalty is the same if UAPA was invoked and where the accused has been charged under IPC sections like Section 302. Even in terms of evidentiary value there is not much of a difference,” said an intelligence officer. The court in its ruling has said there is a need to confine the application of UAPA narrowly given its severe penalties. UAPA, though, provides for a longer police remand (30 days instead of 15 as per Section 167 of CrPC), which may facilitate investigation. Also, the trial can be conducted by a special court where UAPA is invoked, which makes disposal faster. “Delhi High Court observations do not impact the charges invoked under UAPA against the three accused granted bail on Tuesday. Only the trial court will decide whether UAPA charges against them will stand or not, based on evidence on record,” an officer told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riots-case-trial-will-settle-scope-and-use-of-uapa/articleshow/83587084.cms||---

Most of the work like laying of water pipelines is being done by the water department for the 24x7 water supply project. The civic administration claimed that lack of manpower for road work created obstacles. Officially, an extension for completion was given till June 10, but road work continued even on Wednesday in Erandwane, Wanowrie, Kothrud and Vimannagar areas. “The PMC has decided to continue with the water supply work. Special engineers have been told to ensure that the digging is carried out without causing any problems to commuters,” said Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner, PMC. “The civic body’s claim that they are doing emergency work seems to be an eye wash,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/digging-of-roads-for-water-supply-project-to-continue/articleshow/83587063.cms||---

A team of the Wakad police, led by senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar, rescued the 53-year-old pharmacist within three hours and arrested the six suspects. An officer from the Wakad police said the suspects went to the pharmacist’s store in Wakad on Tuesday and introduced themselves as policemen. “They searched the shop, forcibly took a few kits used for medical termination of pregnancy and some files,” the officer said. He said the six men then started threatening the pharmacist claiming that the government had banned the sale of these kits. “They later forced the pharmacist into a car with them. They drove in the Wakad area for about an hour and contacted a medical practitioner the pharmacist knew,” he said. The suspects demanded Rs5 lakh from the medical practitioner and threatened to kill him and the pharmacist if the money was not arranged in an hour. “The medical practitioner immediately contacted senior inspector Mugalikar and asked if any police team was sent to the pharmacy. The senior inspector immediately sent a police team to Dange Chowk, where the medical practitioner was told to come with the money,” the officer said. He said the suspects fled when they saw the police. The pharmacist was thus rescued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-held-on-charge-of-abducting-pharmacist/articleshow/83587021.cms||---

The action has come after 10 days since the alleged incident happened. As per the order issued, sub-inspector Aneesh T, grade sub-inspector Suresh Kumar P and civil police officers Binu and V S Anurag will face a departmental inquiry as lapses were found in the actions of these officers following a preliminary inquiry. The officers were found to be at fault while using force in ensuring the custody of the minor boys. DIG Kori Sanjay Kumar Gurudin said that the oral inquiry will be conducted by Kattakkada DSP S Shaji. The preliminary inquiry was also conducted by the same DSP. “The officers will continue to be on duty during the inquiry and if the allegations against them are proven right, they will face appropriate action prescribed by relevant laws,” the DIG said. Meanwhile, the police are yet to register FIRs based on the complaints filed by the parents of the four teens. Responding to this, the DIG said that the FIRs were not registered because the incident happened while the officers were discharging their duty as part of ensuring lockdown protocols. The version of the local people at Kattakkada on the incident is that the policemen had rounded up the teens responding to a complaint received on phone at Kattakada police station regarding miscreant activity near Anchuthenginmood temple. When the policemen reached the spot, they found the four boys sitting there and their attempt to take them to the police station resulted in the alleged atrocity. The alleged incident took place at Anchuthenginmood on June 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/assault-on-teens-disciplinary-action-against-four-policemen/articleshow/83587070.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Online classes to be telecast through T-SAT in Telangana from July 1||HYDERABAD: As schools in Telangana are set to reopen online for the second year in a row, the school education department is finding ways to make e-learning more effective. Online classes are set to be transmitted through T-SAT from July 1 apart from its YouTube channel and dedicated app. To begin with, authorities have decided to commence bridge courses for class 6-10 students for the initial 30 days. “The bridge courses are planned at four levels — class 1-4, class 5-7, class 8-9 and class 10 separately. Before students commence online classes for the next year, they would be taught all important topics from the previous year so that they attain the necessary learning level,” said Radha Reddy, director, SCERT. Simultaneously, students will also be expected to complete worksheets during their bridge course. In addition to this, the SCERT has also embedded QR codes on all the textbooks from class 6-10. “Until last year, a pilot project was in progress on embedding QR codes on the textbooks. This year, we have prepared all the necessary e-content and have printed the QR codes on textbooks for class 6-10 students. They can now scan these QR codes and have access to resources on particular subjects,” said Reddy. Authorities are going the extra mile to bridge the digital gap, especially in the rural areas. The school education department has instructed all district and mandal education officers to give a daily status report on TSAT app on students’/parents’ mobile.“Of the 40,000 students in Warangal (urban), more than 18,000 have already downloaded T-SAT app. We have been asked to keep an eye out for students who don’t have access to smartphones and television sets. We have conducted a local survey to understand their learning levels as well,” said K Narayana Reddy, DEO, Warangal (urban).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/online-classes-to-be-telecast-through-t-sat-from-july-1/articleshow/83587073.cms||Preeti Biswas

Ashok Hadoti collapsed in the police station where he had gone along with wife Urmila to lodge a complaint against son Ashish who abused and threatened him. It’s learnt that Hadoti was narrating his plight to the station diary officer when he started drooping in the chair digging his chin in the chest. As the officer and Urmila raised an alarm, other cops rushed and offered him water. He, however, collapsed to the ground when some constables tried to make him comfortable. One of the cops administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but there was no response. Senior inspector Vijay Malache said as patrolling vehicle was out in the field, an autorickshaw was called sensing a medical emergency. “Cops rushed Hadoti to the hospital, but he was declared dead. We have CCTV footage of the entire incident,” he said. Zonal DCP Neelotpal said in the CCTV footage, the man can be seen repeatedly touching his chest from the time he stepped into the police station. “Even while speaking to the officer, the senior citizen can be seen touching his chest. Our cops tried level best to salvage him,” he said. Hadoti and his wife Urmila, who too had retired as a sanitation worker, had walked around one km to reach the police station from their residence in Valmiki Nagar. They had approached the cops to lodge complaint against their son Ashish, who, they claimed, had been pressuring them for nominating him and his wife for the job of sanitary worker with the Kamptee civic body. Ashish and his wife reside in Gittikhadan. Hadoti wanted Ashish to return and stay with him as a precondition to help him get the job. Hadoti also wanted Urmila to nominate someone else for the replacement job and not Ashish’s wife. This had led to a rift between the parents and the son, leading to frequent quarrels. Police said on the fateful day, Ashish had visited his parents and started abusing his father. Urmila, who was not at home then, rushed back to support her husband. Later, the couple decided to approach the police. PI Malache said Ashish has been booked for trespassing and creating ruckus targeting his father. A case of accidental death has been registered at New Kamptee police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/senior-citizen-dies-in-ps-while-lodging-plaint-against-son/articleshow/83587042.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Third wave could hit as early as in 2-4 weeks, says Maharashtra Covid-19 task force||MUMBAI: In a grim augury for citizens, the state task force on Covid-19 has warned that the third wave could hit Maharashtra—or Mumbai— within the next two to four weeks if crowding in the last three days is an indication. However, it said children would not be affected as much as those in lower middle-class clusters that haven’t been exposed to the virus so far. Read AlsoWhat is the new Delta+ variant?The Delta variant blamed at least in part for India's devastating second wave has now mutated further into what's being called the Delta+ or AY strain. Here is what we know about the mutation so farThese predictions were part of the meeting chaired by CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday to review preparedness for the projected third wave. It included task force members, the state health minister and senior bureaucrats.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); According to data presented in the meeting, the total number of cases in the third wave is projected to double over those in the second wave, with active cases reaching 8 lakh (active cases as of Wednesday were 1.4 lakh). The meeting was also told that in the first wave, 19 lakh cases were reported, which soared to 40 lakh in the second wave. However, it is expected that 10% of the total cases will come from children or young adults, the same as in the first two waves. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the task force, said, “The UK is facing a third wave within four weeks of ebbing of the second wave. We could be in the same situation if we don’t stay vigilant and practise Covid-appropriate behaviour.” On a conservative estimate, epidemiologists expect up to 100 days between the peaks of two waves or eight weeks from the decline of one wave to the next peak. “We believe children won’t be the target of the next wave. They may not make up for more than 3.5% of the patient pool—like it happened in the first two waves,” he said. Since the last two weeks, the state government has gone in for a five-level unlock model based on Covid indicators like weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds. Under the current model, there are over 15 districts and some cities like Nagpur and Pune which are enjoying considerable relaxations. “Uncontrolled crowds and disregard for Covid norms like wearing of masks and avoiding non-essential movement are worrisome. Even in Mumbai, with certain time restrictions in place, there is free movement throughout the day,” said a senior official who was part of the meeting. The official also said that opening up and the receding second wave have also resulted in reduction in the number of tests being conducted, which may leave many cases undetected. The task force believes that the population segment that escaped Covid in the first two waves are most vulnerable. “It will not be the middle- or upper-middle-classes but the lower middle class who either missed the virus in the first two waves or have highly depleted levels of antibodies that will be hit hard,” he said. The key to handling the third wave is to increase testing, and prepare infrastructure and vaccination. The task force members also said that vaccination should be conducted aggressively, to which Thackeray said that as per information, the country would be receiving 42 crore vaccine doses by August-September and the state too would also benefit from that. He also directed the administration to ensure adequate scaling-up of infrastructure and streamline supplies of medicines, testing kits and oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/third-wave-could-hit-as-early-as-in-2-4-wks-says-state-task-force/articleshow/83591132.cms||Bhavika Jain

The cybercrime cell has found out that this material was shared during the period of friendship, while the actual cases of morphing are only 20%. On Tuesday, police arrested a 35-year-old man for shooting an obscene video of his brother’s wife and uploading it on social media because of a grudge. In many similar cases, friends, fiancés, husbands, and other people in family and relations have harassed women. Assistant commissioner of police (cybercrime) Vaibhav Sehgal said: “Friends, boyfriends, fiancés, or husbands use pictures shared before the breakup to blackmail women. Doctored material (where a face is superimposed over a different body) is rarer in comparison.” The ACP said that now even minors were involved in social-media crimes such as creating fake Facebook profiles and sending out vulgar messages. Recalling a case from a few months ago, he said: “We had received a complaint that someone had put morphed pictures of a minor girl on her fake Instagram page and sent vulgar and abusive text with her doctored profile. The accused was a boy, who had got the original images by befriending the girl and morphed those. He used a fake email ID to make that Instagram account.”Police have found that the youngsters aren’t even aware that duplicating an email ID or social media account was a crime. They created it for fun or to harass their targets without realising the seriousness of the matter. They didn’t know they could be booked or arrested for this.

---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: Trio stays in jail despite HC order, cops in SC to keep them there||NEW DELHI: Within 24 hours of Delhi High Court granting bail to riots case accused Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha, Delhi Police moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing of the HC’s order and called it “perverse” and marked by a “misunderstanding of UAPA provisions”. Claiming that the HC’s perception appeared influenced by social media narratives rather than evidence in the chargesheets against the accused, the police said the HC’s observations that the present cases were registered to suppress dissent were nothing but “insinuations, albeit unfounded and perverse”. The cops sought a stay on the HC orders granting bail to the three accused. Three voluminous appeals, each running into nearly 300 pages, were prepared overnight by a team of lawyers led by advocate Rajat Nair under the supervision of solicitor general Tushar Mehta to challenge the three judgments by a HC bench of Justices Sidharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambani. The police said the HC sidestepped the fact that in the riots in north-east Delhi in February 2020, as many as 53 people were killed and many citizens and police officials suffered injuries. “The said riots did not occur on the spur of the moment or due to a fit of communal anger but were pre-planned in multi-layered, multi-organisational fashion,” it said. The special leave petitions minced no words in criticising the HC judges’ “poor understanding” of UAPA provisions, its play and legislative intent behind the enactment to prevent acts of terror to destabilise the country. “The judgments are perverse, against well-settled principles of law and contrary to legislative intent behind enactment of UAPA,” the cops said. The police said the judgments failed to take into account cogent evidence about a well-planned conspiracy to unleash violence and cause communal discord and the overt and covert acts of all three in giving the conspiracy a shape on the ground. “Unfortunately, contrary to the evidence on record and the detailed oral and written submission filed, the HC decided the cases on a preconceived and a completely erroneous illusion, as if the present case was a simpliciter case of protest by students... HC completely lost sight of the evidence and statements which were produced before it and rendered judgments discarding the evidence which clearly made out a sinister plot of mass-scale riots being hatched by the respondents along with other co-conspirators.” "There was a cause and evidence of terrorist activity against the respondent; there was corroborative evidence, however, while applying the legislative mandate, the HC misdirected itself and gave perverse findings to arrive at a conclusion that no case of UAPA was made out. The misdirection of the HC is writ large on its observations in the impugned judgment, wherein, HC has held that the present case was foisted in anxiety to suppress dissent," they added. The police said the HC held that provisions of UAPA could only be applied to deal with matters of profound impact on the ‘defence of India’. "This will have far reaching consequences for cases investigated by the NIA and other investigating agencies. The impugned order is thus unsustainable in law and deserves to be stayed," the police argued. The HC failed to appreciate that the protests planned by the accused were not like ones which reflected political culture or democracy but represented evil, and were geared towards extremely grave consequences as was apparent from the statements of protected witnesses, the police said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Civic body plans to hike property tax rates by 14%||MUMBAI: The BMC has proposed to increase property tax rates in Mumbai by 14% based on the new ready reckoner (RR) rate, but the plan is expected to face stiff opposition as municipal elections are barely a few months away. The civic standing committee on Wednesday deferred discussion on the proposal till next week.  Civic sources said with the municipal elections just over six months away, the proposal could turn into a political hot potato, especially for the Shiv Sena, the ruling party in the BMC. The party also heads the MVA government.  The current property tax rates are calculated on the RR rates of 2015. But the BMC wants to revise the calculations based on the current RR rates, which are much higher. BMC officials said that the revision in property tax rates last took place in 2015. According to the amendment in the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act, the revision in property tax rates is carried out once in five years and this is usually done at the end of the fifth year. The fresh revision was scheduled for 2020-2025. The BMC has decided not to increase the rate of tax, but officials said that if the tax is calculated on the new RR rates, it will lead to an increase in property tax for residents.  The BMC has also proposed to allow hotels and restaurants to pay property tax as industrial units instead of as commercial units. Officials said that this will help hotels and restaurants since property tax rates for industrial units are less than commercial units.  Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who opposed the move, said the proposal to revise the tax was deferred to the next standing committee meeting. “We are against any hike in property tax even if it’s by way of calculations based on the new RR rates. The BMC can’t hike rates for home owners when they are giving doles to hotel and restaurant owners. There should be no hike in property tax as people have lost income due to the pandemic and the lockdown. We will oppose this move,” Raja said. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh also opposed the move.  Last year, in a relief to lakhs of residents, the BMC had proposed a total waiver in increase in property tax rates for a year. BMC officials said if the rates were revised as scheduled in 2020, residents would have faced a hike of up to 40%. According to BMC officials, there are 4.2 lakh property owners in Mumbai, of which 1.4 lakh have houses that are less than 500 sq ft and they are eligible for a property tax waiver.  “Property tax is calculated on capital value of property based on RR rates. The RR rate is multiplied with various factors like year of construction, floor rise, carpet area of the property, nature of construction, ward in which it is located to determine capital value of the property, among others,” explained an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-civic-body-plans-to-hike-property-tax-rates-by-14/articleshow/83589504.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Seized remdesivir found to be fake||JAIPUR: A lab examination has confirmed that remdesivir vials delivered by a gang to several Covid-19patients in Jaipur were spurious, as per the findings sent to the city police on Wednesday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North), Paris Deshmukh told TOI that the police had sent samples of the vials for the examination. The lab report on Wednesday confirmed the suspicion that the gang led by a Gurugram based doctor, Dr. Jitesh Arora, had supplied fake remdesivirs to desperate family members. “The vials did not have any standard markings on them. Neither there was any information pertaining to the place and date of manufacturing. The lab report has now finally confirmed that fake vials were black-marketed by the gang,” Deshmukh told TOI. The case unfolded when the city police had arrested Dr. Jitesh Arora, the alleged kingpin of a sprawling remdesivir black-marketing racket, on May 28 from Faridabad. He was an MBBS doctor working at a hospital in Gurugram. During the second spell of the vicious Covid-19, the Remdesivir remained short in supply for several days. During which Dr. Arora and his gang members including pharmaceutical dealers, embarked on Remdedivir racketing. They suspected to have delivered these fake vials to several of the patients across the city, and possibly other parts of the state too. The police had first on April 21 arrested Ram Avtar, a medical drug supplier based in Jaipur. He was found to be selling remdesivir at very high prices. Two days later, another accused, Shankar Dayal and Vikram Singh were also arrested in the same black-marketing case. During the interrogation, the accused claimed they worked for Dr. Arora who lived in Delhi-NCR. Arora quickly switched off his phone and changed his locations to evade cops but was finally nabbed near Faridabad. “This is a serious case because such fake medicines can put the lives of patients at risk. We have sent multiple teams to other places across the country. We suspect that. Arora was part of some major gang,” Deshmukh said, adding efforts were made to find the people who delivered these vials to the gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/seized-remdesivir-found-to-be-fake/articleshow/83587055.cms||---

The women are Keerthi Mohan and Karthika AK, a technical faculty and clerk respectively at the MSME Skill Development Technology Process and Product Development Centre, Akhila Babu, a JDC student and Sandra Murali, a journalism student. “They had informed us that they were willing to involve in the cremation process of Covid victims, which is usually done by men. They have been part of all Covid-related voluntary activities in the region. As they were found to be confident about doing the cremation, we informed them about the cremation of Madhavan Nair,” said M Pradeep, former chairman of Attingal municipality. Volunteers in the region had been providing food to Nair who was staying alone after the death of his wife and daughter. His only son is working abroad. On the day of his death, the volunteers found that the lunch kept outside his house was not taken in. They sensed something wrong and broke open the door and found him dead. Knowing that Nair’s body was taken to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital, the women went there in an ambulance and received it after autopsy and other procedures. They then cremated the mortal remains in a gas crematorium set up on the premises of his house in Attingal. “We have been thinking for a while why women should not be involved in cremation. It was our collective decision to take up the task,” said Karthika. All the four had received Covid jabs and three of them are mothers too. After the cremation, they stayed away from their children. “We will do the Covid test after a week, till then we will remain isolated,” said Akhila. “There’s a stigma… people are afraid to help infected people. So, we thought we should be an inspiration to society,” she added. Though many tried to dissuade them, it did not deter them. After the cremation, Sandra, a final year journalism student, resumed her volunteering work at a first-line treatment centre (CFLTC). “I feel so proud to take care of the Covid patients. In between that, I find time to attend my online classes. I haven’t gone home after the cremation. Now I am staying in a hostel arranged for the volunteers,” she said. The women are all members of the DYFI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/these-women-helped-cremate-a-covid-victim/articleshow/83587107.cms||---

More than 500 people visited monuments and museums in the city after the state government on Tuesday allowed their opening. For Lokesh Chaudhury (18), who had come from Sikar and visited Amber fort the first time in his life, it was a memorable day. The state archaeology department is depending on domestic visitors like Chaudhury to keep the tourism industry running in the absence of foreign tourists. “There are lot of people who have not seen the historical wonders of their own place. They are going to be the bulk of visitors for some time till the international travel starts,” said P C Sharma, director of state archaeology and museology department. He said footfall will be less initially but will pick up like last time. “We have issued detailed Covid SOPs to our officials at the monuments and museums for their implementation. So that it increases hygiene and confidence of the visitors,” added Sharma. Amber fort received the maximum number of visitors at 130, followed by Nahargarh (117), Albert Hall (110), Hawamahal (96) and Jantar-Mantar (63). While there were no visitors at Vidhyadhar Bagh and Isarlat, Sisodia Bagh received two tourists. Amber fort superintendent Pankaj Dhirendra said, “It was a good response from visitors. The numbers will increase in coming days as people gain confidence. We have taken care of all the Covid protocols to create confidence among visitors.” At Hawamal, the authorities made rangoli at the entrance to welcome the visitors. “The enthusiasm was palpable on the faces of the visitors,” said Sarojini Chanchlani, superintendent of Hawa Mahal. Besides Jaipur, 254 tourists visited the monuments and museums in the state with Chittorgarh receiving the highest at 103. Last year, when the monuments were reopened on June 2, the Pink city’s tourist landmarks had received 214 visitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-500-visit-monuments-museums-in-jaipur/articleshow/83587102.cms||---

Police said the girl wanted to continue her higher education. M Rajinikanth and R Thamaraiselvi from J J Nagar near Pandikovil had arranged the marriage of their elder daughter studying in class XII with their relative. The couple run a fast food centre at Pandikovil and they have a younger daughter aged 13. After the betrothal ceremony was over, the girl sent a message to Madurai district police seeking help. Since the girl hails from the city limits, the district police forwarded the alert to the city police. The social welfare department and Anna Nagar police summoned the girl and her parents on Saturday and conducted inquiries. After the police explained the consequences of holding child marriage, the parents apologized for their act which they gave in writing. They also promised not to conduct the marriage until she became a major. The girl chose to live with her parents but went to Peraiyur to stay with her grandmother that day. Police said she returned to her parents’ house the next day. Her parents were at the fast food centre when she locked herself up in the house leaving her younger sister outside before taking the extreme step. The couple rushed to the house and shifted her to a private hospital where doctors declared her brought dead. Based on a complaint from Thamaraiselvi, a case was registered with Anna Nagar police station under CrPC section 174(suspicious death) and an inquiry was conducted. “We are not in a position to say what drove her to do this,”the officer said. Child rights experts feel that children rescued from child marriages should be provided counselling and sent to a children’s home for a few days before being sent with parents. The district social welfare department said it had provided her the required counselling. “We gave the girl the option of staying at a home, but she was very keen to go with her parents. We had given her mobile numbers of officials just in case she wanted to raise any issues. But she did not make any calls,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/days-after-she-got-police-to-stopmarriage-girl-17-dies-by-suicide/articleshow/83587111.cms||V Devanathan

The cops filed an FIR against five men after a video of the incident went viral among the locals. The police are searching for the other two accused.

Amid predictions over third wave of Covid-19, the university is also exploring the option of granting online affiliation to colleges for the academic year 2021-22. Generally, the affiliation process for all colleges commences by May and the affiliations are granted by June-July. Following this, colleges get to participate in the centralised online admission counselling which begins after the results for all the common entrance tests are declared. However, this is second year in a row that colleges will be running without any physical inspections. “We intend to commence the affiliation process by July-end. So far, we have not yet decided on whether to go for online affiliation process or the conventional process. If the existing Covid-19 situation prevails, we may have to look for alternatives. But if the situation improves, we intend to conduct physical inspections latest by August-end,” said Manzoor Hussain, registrar, JNTUH. Last year, the university granted affiliation to 233 private professional colleges, of which 153 were engineering institutions, 70 pharmacy colleges and 10 MBA and MCA colleges without holding any inspections owing to the pandemic. For this year, the university will issue a notification for the online affiliation process shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jntuh-to-begin-affiliation-by-july-end/articleshow/83587104.cms||---

They have also argued that earlier, the land was for Rs 2 crore in this agreement but now, it has become expensive. It was all a lie,” Singh said in a press conference and claimed that the agreement was cancelled on March 18, 2018. Earlier, AAP claimed that the trust bought the land from Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari in the presence of two members of the trust. The same land was sold to Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari five minutes earlier by Harish Pathak and Kusum Pathak for Rs 2 crore. “Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak did not have any agreement with Ravi Mohan Tiwari. There was an agreement with only one man, Sultan Ansari. Name of Ravi Mohan Tiwari was included later,” claimed Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-alleging-scam-aap-mp-slams-bjp-on-ram-temple-land/articleshow/83587152.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Twitter failed to remove fake tweets, Delhi lawyer claims in complaint to cops||NEW DELHI: A Delhi lawyer on Wednesday filed a criminal complaint against Twitter, including its India head, Manish Maheshwari, for allegedly spreading fake news. The complaint, filed in Tilak Marg police station, also names actor Swara Bhaskar, journalist Arfa Khanum and one Asif Khan, seeking their prosecution under IPC provisions relating to communal discord, provoking with intent to cause riot, outraging religious feelings of a group etc in connection with the video of an old man in Ghaziabad’s Loni, which was circulated. The complaint by advocate Amit Acharya says these users have lakhs of followers and official accounts on Twitter. “Knowing the fact that their tweets have an impact in the society, they gave communal colours to the incident without fact checking the truthfulness of the incident. The concerned tweets were floated across the social media with the motive of hampering peace and harmony amongst the religious groups,” it alleges, targeting Twitter for its failure to remove these false tweets. Acharya incidentally has also filed a petition in Delhi High Court seeking directions to Twitter to comply with new IT rules in the country governing intermediaries. Last month, the high court had made it clear that Twitter has to comply with the new information technology rules for digital media unless these have been stayed. On the plea, the court had issued notice to the Centre and Twitter seeking their stand on compliance of the rules by the social media platform. The court is likely to examine the issue in July. While Twitter claimed before the court that it had complied with the rules and appointed a resident grievance officer, the central government had disputed the claim. The plea said while the new IT rules had taken effect from February 25, the Centre had given three months to every social media intermediary, including Twitter, to comply. It contended that the three-month period got over on May 25, but no resident grievance officer had been appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform. Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, Acharya referred to the Ghaziabad incident and said, “As far as my knowledge is concerned, Twitter has not complied with IT Rules 2021 in true letter and spirit. It has appointed an independent lawyer, not its employee, as the resident grievance officer.” He added, “Rule 7 of the IT rules says that there will be no immunity under Section 79 if intermediary does not comply with the rules or guidelines. Therefore, for the time being, this FIR seems to be maintainable, which is registered by Ghaziabad Police, even if Twitter claims to have appointed an officer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/twitter-failed-to-remove-fake-tweets-city-lawyer-claims-in-complaint-to-cops/articleshow/83587151.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Despite curbs, Kerala government nod to buy vehicles||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the government talks of cutting its expenses, except in emergencies, it has cleared purchase of vehicles for vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB) spending Rs 67 lakh. The administrative clearance for vehicle purchase was given by the government despite a ban on vehicle purchase till the end of this year. This includes two new Toyota Innova Crysta vehicles, four Mahindra Bolero jeeps and 10 Honda Shine bikes. The government cleared the proposal after the vigilance director wrote to the government that 18 vehicles of the department that were used for investigation have been condemned due to wear and tear and this has affected the investigation of cases. The finance department issued a detailed order on November 5 last year, listing a series of measures for fiscal consolidation in the wake of the state’s critical financial situation, especially due to Covid-19 pandemic. As per the order for austerity, “adorning government buildings, purchasing furniture in government offices or organizations and purchase of vehicles will not be allowed for the next one year”. However, the order was flouted in some of the cases, especially in vehicle purchase. In March this year, the government sanctioned purchase of 293 vehicles for the police department, that includes 255 for police stations and 38 for control rooms. In the case of the latest sanction of vehicles for the vigilance, some senior officials in the department expressed concerns. “Though the jeeps and bikes are usually used by officials in investigation, vehicles like Innova Crysta are usually used for conveyance of higher-ranking officials only. Half of the funds sanctioned in this case will be used for the purchase of the two high-end vehicles,” said a VACB official, on conditions of anonymity. VACB is the next major investigating agency after the police, with a statewide well-established network. It has 14 district units functioning under one deputy superintendent under the state headquarters. Each of the 14 are classified and grouped into four ranges —southern, eastern, central and northern— under an SP. Besides, it has special cells, special investigation units, etc, to deal with various types of cases, warranting befitting infrastructure that would ensure smooth operational efficiency to probe the cases it deals with. Law enforcement agencies like the police had come under serious criticism for the manner in which the force purchased vehicles, in the audit report of the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) submitted in the assembly last year. The CAG report had vehemently criticized the police department for procuring luxury vehicles for its top officers, instead of vehicles for operational purposes, thereby affecting the operational efficiency of the force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/despite-curbs-govt-nod-to-buy-vehicles/articleshow/83587192.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Udaipur||Government school principal issues TCs to 71 tribal kids in Udaipur||UDAIPUR: Parents of many students of the government senior secondary school at Gorana of Jhadol block in Udaipur district alleged that the principal issued transfer certificates to weak students, depriving them of their fundamental right to education amid the pandemic. Some of the parents and students met the collector on Wednesday and gave a complaint in this connection, claiming that the students have no way to study as they have not taken admission elsewhere. The delegation said that 71 tribal students reading in class IX and X were forced to leave the school and were sent transfer certificates at home during past two academic sessions. Particularly, in October, 28 students of class IX were given TCs on a single day. The reason cited in the record for leaving school states ‘study elsewhere’ which is false. This has been done to maintain 100 per cent results by the school, the protesters claimed. Meanwhile, the District Education Officer Pushpendra Sharma said an inquiry has been called on the complaint and the chief block education officer has been asked to give a factual report. He also said that the number of enrolled students at Gorana school has continuously increased in the past few years. “Many times, students of class IX prefer the state open board system where they can clear the subjects in many attempts. We will find the truth and take needful action,” Sharma told TOI. Human rights activist Gaurav Nagda, who accompanied the parents and students, said that none of the students or parents had put up any application for the TC, however, the principal Gautam Gupta issued the certificates to attain 100 per cent results and gain applauds. Nagda said the principal by this act has not only deprived the children of their right to education, but also forged government records, as transfer certificates cannot be issued without application from the students or parents. The delegation said if an action is not taken in three days, the affected students and their families would sit on a dharna. Meanwhile, the principal Gautam Gupta claimed all the allegations as being baseless. “In 2016, total enrolment was 425 and at present 591 students are there. We cannot issue transfer certificates without anyone applying for it. We have Arts faculty here and after X class, students who wish to opt for science, leave the school. Similarly, class IX students prefer state open board examination and hence leave the school,” Gupta said. The principal also said that on regular absence for 15 days, the student's name can be striked off. “Ever since the pandemic, examinations have not been held and there is no question of my issuing forced TC to keep the school results high,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/govt-school-principal-issues-tcs-to-71-weak-tribal-students-in-udaipur/articleshow/83587147.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Footfalls at malls, restaurants low, but hopes for revival return||Jaipur: After the unlocking guidelines on Tuesday, malls and restaurants on Wednesday opened to limited crowds as the truncated business hours and government’s condition to allow 50% outlets failed to cheer up people who are still reluctant to chances with the virus.More than the footfalls and business, for many outlet owners and restaurants it was day of hope for overcoming the hardships and living to fight another day.Senior officials managing the malls said that they were unprepared for a reopening at a short notice.“Even though we were allowed to open 50% capacity, only about 35% outlets could reopen. Outlets need time to clean, rearrange and restock, put their IT systems in order and prepare for Covid appropriate movement of people. Some of their employees have also gone home and they need times to come back. The outlets need at least 5-7 days to operate normally,” said Vikas Joshi, general manager of a popular mall in the city.He said there were visitors, though in small numbers and many of them visited mobile and gadget stores for buying new phones or accessories.For the restaurants also, it was also too short a time to mobilise all their resources, including staff, to start their normal operations though many reopened thinking that things will be in place on the go.But they said that restaurants get about 70-80% of their business from the dinner services and the current restrictions will prolong their return to normalcy.Varun Behl, promoter of a leading restaurant chain in the city, said, “It’s very important to reopen. The restaurant industry has gone through very difficult times. Some may never reopen or see light of the day. All were desperate to restart and many did that today. But lunch services only make up for 20-30% of business. As we make progress, the restrictions on time should be relaxed for dinner services as well.”Behl said that because people cannot go out for dinner, some are coming over for lunch. “However, the evening business cannot be replaced by the lunch services,” he added.Ashish Sharma, another restaurateur, said that he did not expect the number of visitors he received on the first day of the reopening. “It was a bit surprise, but then people are a little desperate to go out and have food. This is reassuring and I can only hope for better days from now onwards,” said Sharma, who runs a new-age restaurant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/footfalls-at-malls-restaurants-low-but-hopes-for-revival-return/articleshow/83587127.cms||---

Ludhiana has also witnessed the highest number of deaths, eight, to date.Bathinda followed Ludhiana with 45 black fungus cases and Amritsar was third with 43, while Ropar was at the bottom of the chart with one case.In fatalities, Bathinda and Jalandhar shared the second position with six deaths each due to the disease and Amritsar and Barnala reported four and shared the third spot. Moga, Ropar, SAS Nagar and Mansa reported no fatality.The report said Ludhiana district had the highest number of mucormycosis patients (48) undergoing treatment, while Amritsar had 38 and Bathinda 25. Ropar had only one patient under treatment for the deadly fungus.The number of mucormycosis cases in Ludhiana was 60 on June 8, which was the highest then. The June 3 report had put the number in the district at 58, again the highest in the state.The health department officials said the high numbers were due to more tertiary care centres in the district. State epidemiologist Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the number of mucormycosis cases in Ludhiana was more as the district and Jalandhar have more tertiary care centres, catering to many patients. Asserting that the disease was not severe in the state, he said, “There are around 400 cases in the state till now.”Health experts said mucormycosis cases were directly proportional to Covid cases. “Ludhiana being a district with largest population saw high number of both Covid and mucormycosis cases as compared with the other districts,” said former senior medical officer Dr Rajinder Gulati. He said besides Covid-appropriate behaviour, patients should take maximum care after recovering as chances of mucormycosis become high due to weakened immunity and overuse of steroids.Health expert said the patients should not take excessive steam or use wet masks as fungus thrives in humid environment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/after-covid-dist-tops-in-black-fungus-cases-too/articleshow/83584833.cms||Shariq Majeed

Doctors are observing a few patients of intestinal gangrene at SMS Hospital and its attached hospitals.According to doctors, patients who suffered from Covid or have recovered from it run the risk of developing intestinal gangrene. “This is due to multiple clots or thrombus in intestinal arteries due to Covid. We are also observing few intestinal gangrene patients in SMS and attached hospitals,” said Dr Sudhir Maharishi, associate professor (gastroenterology), SMS Hospital.Patients with intestinal gangrene complain of severe and persistent pain, vomiting and gradually develops abdominal distension, constipation and obstipation. “If it is not treated at proper time, the intestine gets perforated and patient will develop peritonitis, which has high mortality. Such patients should be diagnosed early with the help of CT scan,” said Dr Maharishi.The blood clots that may be produced during Covid and post-Covid may cause heart attack and stroke. “In Covid, we have seen thromboembolic phenomenon. The clots cause blockage in the arteries. If clots block ischemic artery supplying blood to intestines, it causes gangrene. If the blood is not supplied, the portion of the organ becomes dead and in intestines it causes gangrene. Here, not much cases have been documented, but there is always a risk due to thromboembolic phenomenon of Covid,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital.The doctors are alert on intestinal gangrene and if a patient after Covid recovery complained of stomach pain, the doctors advise tests to rule out gangrene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/docs-alert-on-covid-induced-clots-causing-gangrene/articleshow/83587156.cms||---

The airport operator, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), said all private vehicles would be allowed a free period of three hours to pick-up passengers from the MLCP area, however, all the commercial vehicles would still be charged according to the current parking rates. All vehicles looking to pick-up passengers will be moved to level-1 of the MCLP area, while passengers and their family reaching the airport wil be guided through signages and barriers at the entry to Lane 3, DIAL said. “In addition to traffic authorities, DIAL will also deploy Raxa Guards to direct these vehicles to reach the MLCP area. Additionally, passengers can also get updates through airport’s social media handles,” said a DIAL spokesperson. The official said that, during the maintenance work, there would be limited space in the forecourt area and, therefore, a sufficient space has been provided in the MLCP to help passengers commuting further from the airport. The space is equipped with several services, such as F&B counters, ATMs, washrooms, babycare room, waiting lounge and mobile charging stations, among other amenities. Currently, with only Terminal 3 in operation, Delhi airport is operating at a reduced capacity and is handling around 40,000 passengers each day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-pick-drop-slot-at-t3-for-3-days-due-to-maintenance-work/articleshow/83587194.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Aspiring actor dupes over 80 of Rs 2 crore with film, TV offers, held||MUMBAI: The cyber police at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) has arrested a 47-year-old aspiring actor for allegedly impersonating as a casting director and duping over 80 people of around Rs 2 crore by promising to give a break to their minor children in the entertainment industry since 2017. The accused, Apurva Ashwin Dowda, who has an MBA degree from a US university and is registered with CINTAA and Writer’s Association, was a repeat offender. He ran fake websites with promotions on casting for films, television and ads, said the police. Dowda has featured in a few ads. Cyber police apprehended Dowda when he arrived at Khallapur Toll on the Mumbai-Pune Expessway on June 10. He was living in a 3,500 sq ft rental flat in Pune, said the police. Dowda allegedly told cops that he duped people to release his movie ‘Trance’ for which he has already spent Rs 25 lakh on launch advertisements. He was arrested based on a complaint of Borivli resident Mahesh Gupta (47), who runs an aircraft spare parts business. Gupta said he saw a casting offer for children for a film ‘Bacho Ki Duniya’ on social media and decided to sign up his daughter. Gupta said, “I transferred around Rs 33 lakh through different bank accounts.” However, he got suspicious when Dowaa kept demanding more money and so lodged a complaint. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe supervised said DCP (cyber) Rashmi Karandikar who led the team—inspectors Mangesh Majgar, Pramod Khoppikar and cyber detection staff—who chased Dowda across the country before nabbing him on Mumbai-Pune Expressway, with the help of state traffic police. “Though Dowda is highly qualified, he took up crime to earn fast money,” said Karandikar. “Our team had been searching for him for the last six months. He would live on rent in luxury flats for hardly a month or two so that no one will track him. We recovered nine mobiles with 40 SIMS (some international SIMs), nine bank accounts, multiple passports, and an international driving licence.” The police have recovered most of Gupta’s money. The police said Dowda was arrested a few years ago for a similar offence and spent time in Arthur Road jail in 2010. He has previous similar cases against him at police stations in Sakinaka, Oshiwara, Amboli, NM Joshi Marg and Dadar. He also has an office ‘Zenia Star’ in Dubai and uses the same modus operandi there, said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aspiring-actor-dupes-over-80-of-rs-2cr-with-film-tv-offers-held/articleshow/83591153.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: ‘5% kids with Covid may develop severe symptoms’||JAIPUR: SMS Medical College, which sent its report on third wave to the health department, said it might infect children as well. In the report, it is mentioned that considering that 1,000 children are infected, 750 children are likely to have mild symptoms, 200 moderate while 50 might become severely ill. On the basis of the report, the health department is now preparing for the third wave and developing facilities including availability of medicines, ICUs, critical care facilities in each district. An SMS Medical College official said they have made a team for research development and planning of the projected third wave. The team is preparing a detailed need of medicines, consumables and infrastructure for every 1,000 pediatric patients. On the basis of the recommendation made by SMS Medical College, the health department has issued directions to all chief medical health officers to ensure stock of the medicines, keeping in mind the proportion of projected mild, moderate and severe cases per 1,000 pediatric Covid cases, said a health department official. In view of the threat of third wave which might hit in September-October, the state government is taking measures to make the medicines available in stock well in advance. SMS Medical College has suggested the state to procure remdesivir and liposomal amphotericin B for children as well. Liposomal amphotericin B is for treatment of mucormycosis, in case children contract the fungus in the third wave. The health department is also planning to increase number of beds in government hospitals and for procuring medical equipment and medicines to treat children affected by Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/third-wave-sms-report-says-of-1000-pediatric-covid-cases-5-may-develop-severe-symptoms/articleshow/83587180.cms||---

Ashok Gavhankar, principal of Marathi medium Raosaheb Thawre High School and Junior College, said senior students will be the worst hit. “Junior college is a make-or-break time for students coming from poor economic background. If they cannot do well academically in these two years, then they will drop out and end up doing some menial work,” said Gavhankar. He added that very few students can afford online learning platforms. “The learning gap between the haves and have-nots is on the brink of breaching a dangerous level. And once that happens, it’s almost impossible to bring such students back to the education circle because their priorities change from learning to earning,” said Gavhankar. Anil Sole, former MLC from graduates’ constituency and a veteran academic, says innovative steps need to be taken by the government immediately. “The online learning gap between rich and poor is definitely there now, and the government must involve other stakeholders to stem it. NGOs that are into the field of education must be roped in to help,” said Sole. The former professor said reaching out to the lowest economic strata of the society is the key. “There are many citizens who are teaching kids in slums, with some running computer training institutes etc. Their human resource and infrastructure can be used by the government to reach out to kids in slums who do not have access to online teaching at home,” said Sole. Nago Ganar, MLC from teachers’ constituency, said he’s worried about the growing disparity. “Lower and middle class kids have fallen way behind those from upper and elite society. Access to digital learning platforms has become the key to academic success and that’s a very bad thing,” said Ganar. He added, “Our Constitution guarantees compulsory elementary education and hence there is need to think out-of-the-box during this Covid-19 era. Be it distributing free mobiles or laptops or any other method of providing free education must be initiated. Else, it’s scary to even think how wide the learning gap will be if this continues.” Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh) said currently the onus is on schools to ensure their students are not left behind. “I agree that lack of digital access or inadequacy of it must not deprive students of education. One inadequacy happens in homes with schoolgoing siblings where both can’t use the phone at the same time for online classes. So, we have to innovate and keep class timings for primary, middle and high school separate or think about some other such methods,” said Tiwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/digital-learning-gap-to-widen-along-economic-lines-this-year-feel-experts/articleshow/83587201.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Their livelihood having been affected by the lockdowns, they sought Rs 10,000 a month from April to October to tide over debts and meet expenses. They stayed in rented house and borrowed money from usurers at high interest rates. The state government fixed the wage of domestic workers at Rs 30 an hour in 2010, Rs 36 in 2019 and Rs 37 from 2019. They want it to be fixed at Rs 75 an hour. “A special act should be enacted for domestic workers as they face lot of insecurities including sexual harassment at work place,” Clarammal said.The association urged the government to set aside one per cent of house tax and commercial building tax for domestic workers welfare board. Pointing out that houses of domestic helps have been relocated to the outskirts of cities like Chennai under the pretext of slum clearance, the association said this has forced them to travel for hours every day for work. Such relocations should be avoided in other places by providing them house site patta and houses where their temporary settlements are located.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/domestic-workers-seek-monthly-dole-and-law-to-protect-them/articleshow/83587221.cms||---

A crypto currency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Bitcoin is one of these. On specific intelligence, an NCB team led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede raided a place in Marve Road and arrested Makarand Pradeep Adivirkar, also known as Crypto king among peddlers for his modus operandi. The agency has also recovered 20 LSD blots from his possession. The seized psychotropic substance was purchased from Europe using bitcoin. Officials said that the accused has a Bitcoin wallet through which he accepts money from those who want drugs and makes payment through his Bitcoin wallets abroad. —||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-who-dealt-in-drugs-via-bitcoin-wallet-held-in-malad/articleshow/83589671.cms||S Ahmed Ali
---||Ludhiana||First day no show at cinema halls, low footfall at city malls||Ludhiana: A day after chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh announced relaxations in the lockdown restrictions, the district administration issued an order on Wednesday, according to which the night curfew will be from 8pm to 5am and shops and offices can remain open till 7.30pm. Eateries, cinema halls and gyms too have been allowed to open but subject to 50% capacity. On the first day of the relaxations, only a handful of people came to malls, cafes and restaurants. Nitika, a resident of Barewal, said, “It is almost after two months that we have come to a shopping mall. It is a very different experience as there are hardly any people at the food court and other areas unlike previous times when there were huge crowds.”Though some people were following Covid-appropriate behaviour, many showed carelessness. Most of the business establishments had put in place measures like sanitisation, thermal scanning and social distancing. Despite cinema halls being allowed to open with 50% capacity, these were found to be closed and online booking had also not started. Varinder Singh, a multiplex owner, said, “We have not opened our multiplex as the government order to allow us to operate came only a day before. It is not possible for multiplexes and cinema halls to open in a day as a lot of time is needed to get ready. Moreover, we are yet to take a call on whether to resume operations, as not many movies are releasing and it is hard to say if people will return to cinema halls after the second wave of coronavirus.”However, shopkeepers and traders were not happy with the relaxations, as they wanted Sunday lockdown to be lifted. Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, said, “Lifting Saturday lockdown and allowing shops to operate till 7.30pm is partial relief. Until Sunday lockdown is ended, shopkeepers and traders will not get any benefit. When other cities like Jalandhar have lifted the ban on Sunday shopping, it should be done here as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/first-day-no-show-at-cinema-halls-low-footfall-at-city-malls/articleshow/83584899.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Pune||Six held on charge of providing bogus sureties to aid bail for suspects||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Tuesday arrested six people, including two women, on the charge of providing fake documents in courts to facilitate bail for suspects in criminal cases. The arrested people used to provide fake Aadhar cards, ration cards and took recourse to fictitious names to appear as sureties before the court, police said. The Pimpri police have registered two FIRs in this connection. Senior inspector Milind Waghmare told TOI, “Our probe has so far revealed that the suspects used to submit bogus documents like Aadhaar cards, ration cards, 7/12 revenue extracts, property documents and photographs, among others, as a part of the procedure to stand surety/guarantor for the accused who had been granted bail by the court. Offences of cheating and forgery have been registered against them.” Waghmare said that the police received information about some people involved in preparing forged documents for securing bail for the accused in serious crimes like dacoity, robbery, theft and even under the POCSO Act. “These arrested persons were used as surety for the accused, who would never appear before the court once out on bail or those who found it difficult to get surety,” the officer said. He said that the police laid a trap on the road heading towards Pimpri court. “We took six suspects, including two women, into custody. Three of them are from Alandi and the rest from Dapodi,” Waghmare said. Asked since when the suspects have been operating, inspector Badesab Naikwade told TOI, “Our probe is at the primary stage. The suspects have been remanded in police custody for four days. We will interrogate them.” Regarding involvement of lawyers or court staffers in the racket, the officer said, “We will establish their links during custodial interrogation. We are also probing how much they were charging for standing as surety before the court.” Recent action In December last year, the Pune police had arrested 37 people, including six women, who furnished fake sureties in at least 70 to 80 cases. They used to charge between Rs12,000 and Rs20,000 for standing as sureties for accused involved in criminal cases pending before magisterial and sessions courts. Role of surety When an accused seeks bail in court, the court may ask him/ her for a surety from other person. The reason for the surety is to make the person responsible for the act of the accused after release on bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/six-held-on-charge-of-providing-bogus-sureties-to-aid-bail-for-suspects/articleshow/83587234.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The pioneering factory was set up by C Balakrishnan, former private secretary of VK Krishna Menon, who didn’t have experience in beverages or business ventures. During a visit to Russia, he was stranded there for a couple of days due to heavy snowfall and while going on a walk from his hotel, he noticed a factory with heaps of potatoes in its yard and upon enquiry, it turned out to be a distillery that produces vodka from potatoes. On his return, he sent tapioca to the distillery for tests and they gave a positive recommendation, which prompted him to set up a factory in Kerala. “Balakrishnan thought about the possibility of getting a licence for a non-molasses distillery in India. In the 80s, sugar and molasses were brought under essential commodities and Planning Board had decided that new licence will only be given to non-molasses distilleries,” said leading investor KV Viswamohan, also chairman of the distillery, which is currently known as SDF Industries Ltd. “KSIDC was one such recipient of a licence and Balakrishnan thought why can’t we start one using tapioca, because in those days it was available in plenty here. Balakrishnan, a friend of my father, contacted me in the UK where I was planning to shift from banking to restaurant business,” said Viswamohan, describing how he became a leading investor in the project. The distillery plant of the factory was shut down later as it was unviable to produce alcohol from the edible variety of tapioca that is widely cultivated in state, which is rich in fibres but low in starch content. Also, the availability of tapioca went down drastically in the 90s when farmers opted for more lucrative rubber planting. Prices of tapioca shot up during the construction of distillery, up from 50 paise to Rs 6/kg, adding to financial woes of the company. Tapioca, in dry chips form, was used for production only during the initial years (1996-97). Hence, decision was taken to shut the distillery plant and SDF Industries now survives as a blending and bottling plant for own brands as well as other liquor brands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/earlier-bid-to-make-tapioca-alcohol-in-state-had-failed/articleshow/83587280.cms||Shenoy Karun

A city-based expert, Colonel Jasjit Singh Gill (retired), had proposed this idea to chairman of NHAI, Sukhbir Singh Sandhu. Col Gill (retd), who is also the founder member of ‘Let’s Clean Ludhiana’, an NGO, and a member of state task force on Buddha Dariya Rejuvenation, said on the directions of chairman of NHAI, DGM (technical) A K Sharma issued an order for the implementation of the proposal by him.The order suggests that the performance of rubber vis-à-vis conventional mulching may be monitored and reported. The letter suggests that proposal has been approved by the competent authority for an amount of Rs 9,70,400. In his proposal, Col Gill (retd) had said rubber mulch will not let the weeds grow if laid densely. It will also retain soil moisture for a longer period, as it will provide cover from sunshine. This in turn will reduce irrigation requirements for saplings being grown in the median. Since the rubber does not deteriorate or decay with time, there is no replacement cost. Col Gill (retd) also suggested deployment of collecting hoppers for used plastic bottles and other plastic waste at car window level so that people can be encouraged to dispose their plastic waste while they travel without really stopping. Later, these hoppers can be converted plastic shredders on solar power so that they can be shred daily when they get full.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/rs-9-7-lakh-for-rubber-mulching-of-median-as-nhai-makes-way-for-city-mans-idea/articleshow/83584874.cms||Shariq Majeed

Hence, JDA has cancelled the allotment on June 10 and on Wednesday went to inspect the place.Kuntal Bishnoi, zone 1 deputy commissioner of JDA, said, “We have cancelled the land allotment to the stock exchange. We went to the office to make people including some brokers aware about the fact and take a look at our building. We have served them the notice of cancellation and now further proceedings will be done as per rules to take possession of the building.”JDA had given this land in 1992 at a concessional rate (Rs 2,400 per square metre). On this, 12,460sqm land, a five-storey building was built for the operation of the stock exchange. More than 300 offices were built, of which over 50% are lying vacant. The company’s management even sold some of these offices through the registry, which was against the allotment conditions of the JDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-alerts-brokers-about-jaipur-stock-exchange-land-usage/articleshow/83587215.cms||---

While BJP said the state had adopted a callous attitude towards protesting teachers, AAP leader Harpal Singh Cheema said teachers who had been working in Punjab government schools for almost a decade and a half on meagre salaries, should be regularised immediately. AAP also alleged irregularities in procurement of Covid kits. Holding Amarinder responsible for creating circumstances wherein teachers resort to suicide, BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh said the state government had ignored their grievances. The BJP leader said when Punjab ranked first in school education rankings in the country, it was deplorable that teachers had been holding demonstrations across state for jobs and remuneration. Be it government employees, teachers or entrepreneurs, all have been holding demonstrations against the government as it has failed to deliver to any section of the government, he said. “It reflects complete collapse and failure of the Congress government in Punjab,” Chugh added. Expressing concern over the agitation by temporary teachers, climbing on a government building during a protest in Mohali, Cheema said education providers like AIEs, EGS, STRs and other temporary teachers had devoted most of their lives to government schools and worked for a salary of only Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-bjp-back-protests-by-teachers-slam-cong-govt/articleshow/83587270.cms||---

---||Pune||MNGL warns of pulling plug on PMPML supply||PUNE: The Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited has asked the city transport utility to clear the Rs49.26-crore dues within two days, or it would stop supplying CNG to the latter. In a fresh letter to the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML), the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) asked it to be ready for partial suspension of CNG supply from June 18 if the dues were not cleared. Senior MNGL officials claimed that they would not completely stop the supply of CNG because services of the PMPML were essential, but the idea was to cut down the supply gradually in case of non-payment. TimesViewBus commuters should in no way suffer in these hard times because of differences between two government bodies over non-payment of dues. The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) should amicably resolve the payment issue, continuing for too long. The civic bodies should regularise their contributions to the PMPML, helping it to meet its payment commitments.There are 800 PMPML-owned CNG buses and 750 rented CNG buses in the transport utility’s fleet. The CNG buses assume more significance now because a litre of diesel currently costs Rs93.05 in Pune. CNG is priced at Rs56.60 a litre. The issue of PMPML’s dues had cropped up last month also with the MNGL threatening to stop the CNG supply. The PMPML had then paid Rs5 crore to the MNGL. “We cannot compare the current situation with that in May. The market has opened. More than 500 buses are on the road, carrying over one lakh passengers each day. If the CNG supply stops even partially, we shall be in the soup,” a PMPML official said. Rajendra Jagtap, the chairman and managing director of the PMPML, told TOI that the bus services would be affected if the CNG supply was stopped or curtailed. “With just 450 diesel-run buses, we shall not be able to function if the CNG supply stops. The PMPML suffered revenue loss of Rs75 crore in the last two months. From April, we received Rs690 crore from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and most of it was used for payment of wages. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has paid us just Rs12 crore and there is a shortfall of Rs30 crore on their part,” Jagtap said, adding that he had requested the PMC for additional funds in advance. “The last big payment we made to the MNGL was in February — Rs30 crore — and the outstanding was brought down to Rs17 crore. Since then, we have run into major losses,” Jagtap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/clear-all-dues-or-face-partial-suspension-of-cng-supply-mngl-to-transport-utility/articleshow/83587282.cms||Joy Sengupta

A few hundred — 18 to 126 students a day — missed the exam after testing positive for Covid-19. The exams, conducted by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) across the state from June 10 following a directive of the Bombay high court, saw over 95% attendance in a week. It is the first exam to be conducted physically at centres after the second wave of Covid-19 in the state. Over 40,000 students are appearing for these exams from across courses, which comprise MBBS, ayurveda, homeopathy and other health science courses. Refusing to stay the conduct of physical exams, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court had directed that the examinees must test negative in RT-PCR or RAT before appearing for the exam. The MUHS issued a directive based on the order. Students were expected to get the RT-PCR done before June 15. Dr Ajit Pathak, exam controller of MUHS, said that the exams are being conducted as per the directive of the court. He said that the university had been offering Covid Suraksha Yojana — an insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh — to all students, staff and faculty members to cover treatment charges if infected. Exams have been conducted in two sessions since June 10. From 200 to 490 students have remained absent in each of the sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-60-skip-cov-19-test-miss-muhs-exams/articleshow/83589994.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Giloy rush takes tribal youth’s business idea to new heights||The pandemic gave Katkari youth Sunil Pawar (28) from Thane a right turn in life. When the demand for immunity-boosting plants like tinospora cordifolia (giloy, guduchi) and withania somnifera (ashwagandha) shot up from individual users and pharma companies, Pawar set up a business gathering and selling these. He now employs 1,800 people from his community. Till two years ago, Pawar, a Std XII dropout, foraged in the forest for wood needed for rituals. A lecture in Nashik on medicinal plants by Digambar Mokat of the regional and facilitation centre (western region) of the National Medicinal Plants Board turned him to cultivating and selling giloy. The board under the Ayush ministry is located at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). The Katkari community is one of the 75 particularly vulnerable tribal groups. “I couldn’t go to college after Std XII because we were too poor. I started working at a telecommunication company but was laid off, and came back to Shahapur, my hamlet,” he said. Around this time, the district administration had organised a camp for the Katkaris to get Aadhaar, PAN and ration cards. “Around 10-12 of us present on this day decided to form a trust,” Pawar said. They registered as Adivasi Ekatmik Samajik Sanstha when he found there is a demand for a particular wood for rituals. “Our first order was for Rs 400 where the priest wanted 100 bundles of a particular wood. We started foraging in the forest to find the seven types of samidha (wood) used in homa. The orders continued to be small. At this point, we were told to provide giloy. We didn’t know what it looked like. Ignorance was so high that my community used giloy as firewood,” Pawar said. Soon, he and his friends started collecting giloy, drying it and selling it. “For about six months, we sold it for Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg. We needed an office and a local person, Arun Pansare, offered his land for free. Now, we had a place to store the wood. But Mokat, also a professor at SPPU on medicinal plants, guided us about planting, growing, cutting and storing giloy,” Pawar added. In September 2019, they got approval under the Pradhan Mantri Van Dhan Vikas Yojna and set up a centre in Shahapur. They began collecting giloy, jamun seeds and reetha. “We do not farm them as yet, but we plant saplings in the jungle,” Pawar added. Last year, they did business worth Rs 50 lakh. “We have orders from pharma companies Himalaya and Dabur for Rs 1.5 crore for giloy. It has to be sent in a fortnight. We started with one Van Dhan Vikas Kendra and now have 11 in Shahapur. We are able to pay Rs 300 and a commission on the produce we gather,” Pawar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-giloy-rush-takes-tribal-youths-business-idea-to-new-heights/articleshow/83589725.cms||Ardhra Nair

The man has also been found previously involved in a case of attempt to murder, police said. He has been identified as 34-year-old Sonu Panwar alias Baba Khan, a resident of district Baghpat in UP.

M A Patil, a leader from ASHA workers’ action committee who was part of the talks held at the state secretariat, told TOI that public health minister Rajesh Tope refused to increase the honorarium of ASHA workers and did not offer any assurance on the demands. “He did not even offer any proposal to us and refused our demands saying the state is facing a cash crunch amid the Covid crisis,” Patil said. “We will continue the strike till the demands are fulfilled.” The over 70,000 ASHA workers have struck work demanding that monthly honorarium be revised from Rs 5,000 to Rs 18,000 as they work 8-9 hours a day, instead of 2-3 hours as mandated. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-talks-fail-70k-asha-workers-to-continue-stir/articleshow/83590657.cms||---

Stat3 commission chairperson Tejinder Kaur said they had received a complaint from SAD’s Adampur MLA Pawan Kumar Tinnu against the viral video and news published in various newspapers in which Bittu made ‘unparliamenty comments’. Tinu had complained to the commission demanding an FIR against Bittu under the SC/ST Act for his remarks against SAD offering two ‘pious seats’ — Anandpur Sahib and Chamkaur Sahib — to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). “This amounts to saying that scheduled castes as well as the BSP are unholy. Our community cannot tolerate this insult. The Guru Sahiban preached equality between all castes and this equality is also assured to us under the constitution,” said Tinu.

But the rule is yet to be implemented by the authorities. The price of N95 mask was capped at Rs 22 and that of surgical mask at Rs 3 and Rs 4 for two ply and three ply respectively. The price of hand sanitizer cannot exceed Rs 110 for 200 ml while that of PPE kit was fixed at Rs 273. Sterile glove was priced at Rs 15 per unit and examination gloves Rs 5.75. However, there has not been much change in the price at which the products are being sold at the retail outlets, say buyers. N95 mask is being sold for not less than Rs 75 in most of the medical shops in the city while a two ply mask is being sold at Rs 5 apiece. PPE kits are not available for anything less than Rs 400 apiece, they say. Although officials are yet to crack the whip on the violation, some medical shops have stopped selling masks fearing action. “We have stopped selling masks ever since the rule came into effect as it is not feasible to sell at the price specified by the government,” said a medical shop owner in Goripalayam. Medical shop owners say the rule will not do any good unless the cost is brought down by the manufacturer. If the rule is implemented strictly, it might result in scarcity. An officer bearer of the Madurai medical shop owners association said, “The manufacturers of N95 mask are selling a piece at Rs 50. The supplier is fixing 10% commission on it, whereas we have to fix Rs 20% profit margin. We will not be able to sell the mask at Rs 22 apiece unless the manufacturer brings down the cost,” he said. Officials from drugs control department said revenue and local body officials too can act on the issue. They said they will take action if there is a specific complaint against a particular medical shop or store. However, crackdown on a large scale will only lead to disruption of supplies, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/medical-stores-ignore-govt-cap-on-prices-of-masks-sanitizer/articleshow/83587341.cms||V Devanathan
---||Delhi||Delhi LG orders probe, purchase of 1,000 buses put on hold||NEW DELHI: The procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has been put on hold following an inquiry set up by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal after Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Vijender Gupta alleged irregularities in the process. The transport department has asked DTC to keep in abeyance the procurement process and their annual maintenance contract (AMC) till further orders. Gupta had written to the LG for an inquiry, saying that in January 2021, Delhi government had placed a work order for 1,000 low-floor buses costing Rs 890 crore, out of which the contract for 700 buses was given to one manufacturer. He said that along with the purchase order, the tender for AMC was also handed over to the same supplier. Gupta had said that the AMC order had been fixed at Rs 350 crore annually and the contract for maintenance would come into effect on the very first day of the purchase despite a three-year warranty period. “This implies that maintenance of the buses would cost the taxpayer nearly Rs 1,000 crore within the three-year warranty period,” he had alleged. “BJP has complained to the LG, who has set up an inquiry on their complaint. We have stopped the process of procuring buses until the report on the inquiry committee comes. BJP should get its investigation done, we are ready to investigate in every way,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said. “The truth will come out in front of everyone in the investigation. BJP leaders have already checked 400 files, they found nothing. The Kejriwal government is the most honest government in the country,” Gahlot said. Gupta said the opposition had raised the issue of financial misconduct in the bus contract to the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in March 2021, which took immediate notice. “A request was sent to Delhi government to allow ACB to look into the charges. However, here too, Delhi government tried to derail the process by sitting on the file,” he alleged. He said a three-member fact finding committee had been constituted by the LG to verify the entire matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-orders-probe-purchase-of-1000-buses-put-on-hold/articleshow/83587391.cms||---

While admissions are almost over in the school at the entry level, he is unsure if he should pay the fee and get admission or wait for RTE admission and try his luck. There are chances that he may not get a seat under RTE due to tough competition, but he is worried about spending his savings now. “It would have been better if RTE admission happened simultaneously with the usual admission. There are many deserving candidates like my daughter who may miss out admission over delay in filling RTE seats, he said. While private schools are conducting online classes unlike the government schools, more parents are showing interest in getting their students admitted to private schools under the right to education (RTE) act as the government will bear the tuition fee of students.But the school education department has been silent so far on RTE seats when admissions are under way in almost schools across the state. Under the RTE act, private schools should reserve 25% seats at the entry level for children from marginalised sections. “Private schools are conducting online classes which will help in learning unlike the government schools where children are made to rely on textbooks and Kalvi Tholaikatchi,” said S Shanmugam of Kajahmalai who got a seat for his child in a private school but is unsure if he should pay the fee or wait for RTE admission.Every year, the school education department asks for the total number of RTE seats in each district during May. So far, there has not been any such instruction from the department. However, parents are approaching schools and the chief education office to know about the admission notification. Applications were called to fill RTE seat in August last year because of the pandemic. But it was started with the school admissions unlike this year when there has been no instructions from the school education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parents-confused-as-rte-admissions-yet-to-be-notified/articleshow/83587386.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Delhi||Key Chandni Chowk stretches out of bounds for motorists||NEW DELHI: Starting tomorrow, traffic movement will be regulated on the Chandni Chowk road from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Mosque and the surrounding areas for the next month. In an order on Wednesday, Delhi government’s transport department said that no motor vehicle would be allowed for 12 hours on the road to Chandni Chowk Road from Red Fort and on the roads leading to Chandni Chowk, barring a few stretches like Shanti Desai Marg, Rai Kedarnath Marg, Netaji Subhash Marg and Chawri Bazar road. With traffic restricted from 9am to 9pm on all days, the road-owning agencies have been advised to put up signboards to caution motorists about the new restrictions. Apart from this, Wednesday’s order also restricts traffic from moving on the north side of the main Chandni Chowk road between 9am and 9pm, However, these restrictions shall not apply to a few roads such HC Sen Marg up to Jubilee Cinema cut (opposite Gandhi Maidan Parking), Rai Kedarnath Marg towards main Chandni Chowk road up to T-point on Rai Kedarnath Marg, Kachha Bagh Road, including Chandni Chowk metro station and Ramjas Senior Secondary School No.3, Shanti Desai Marg towards main Chandni Chowk road up to T-point on Shanti Desai Marg and the road leading to Bagh Diwar Park up to main Chandni Chowk road. Likewise, there are restrictions on the south side of the Chandni Chowk road. No cars will be allowed between 9pm and 9am expect on Netaji Subhash Marg, the Jama Masjid road up to Chawri Bazar road crossing, Chawri Bazar road up to Hauz Qazi Chowk, Lal Kuan Road up to T-point on Katra Bariyan road and Katra Bariyan road up to Fatehpuri Mosque T-point. However, these restrictions will not be applicable to emergency vehicles such as fire tenders, ambulances, hearses and vehicles ferrying pregnant women or patients for medical treatment. Enforcement vehicles of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and Delhi Police and the maintenance vehicles of the civic body, BSES Yamuna Power Ltd., Public Works Department, CPWD, Delhi Jal Board, Indraprastha Gas Ltd. and ATM service vans will also be allowed. The traffic restrictions come in the face of resistance to the plan. On November 11 last year, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) had written to Delhi High Court about Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib being located in the heart of Chandni Chowk. The letter claimed that Delhi Police had restricted the movement of the vehicles of pilgrims to the iconic gurdwara by declaring the area as a car-free zone. Claiming that this amounted to restricting the pilgrims from offering prayers at the Sisganj Gurdwara, DSGMC had sought impleadment. However, the court declined the request and dismissed the case, stating that if as a matter of policy, the authorities had decided to declare the area a car-free zone, then the same should have to apply across the board to all concerned, including pilgrims and visitors to the Gurdwara Sahib, and no exception could be made in that regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/key-chandni-chowk-stretches-out-of-bounds-for-motorists/articleshow/83587379.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

The operator found violating the orders will be booked under the non-bailable Indian Penal Code sections for waging war against the Government of India and will be punished to death or imprisonment for life. A Navy official said all the defence installations currently present in South Mumbai are already under the red zone and were prohibited from flying any non-conventional aerial objects. “It is a no-fly zone where INS Hamla is located. It comes under the red zone of the digital sky platform,” said the official, adding that the red zone includes airspace near international borders, close to airports and other strategic locations. The other two zones are: yellow (restricted zone) and requires an Air Defence Clearance while green zone is unrestricted for flight. Indian Navy (chief PRO) Commander Mehul Karnik said that if drone flying is deemed necessary, the operator or the agency should obtain approval from the Director-General Civil Aviation (DGCA) through the Digi Sky website and a copy of the approval letter is to be submitted to INS Hamla at least a week before the scheduled flying operation. “The prohibition order is for all high-security zones and vital installations including the defence installations,” said Karnik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-destroy-drones-around-ins-hamla/articleshow/83589798.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

---||Trichy||Pvt schools want TC made mandatory for admission||Trichy/Madurai: Worried over a large number of students migrating to government schools due to the financial implications of the pandemic, private schools want the government to make transfer certificates mandatory for admission. Since the pandemic has affected livelihoods, parents who are unable to pay fees in private schools have been taking their wards to government schools where students get free education along with free textbooks, notebooks, uniforms, school bags and footwear. Admission to Class XI and other classes had started in 27 districts on Monday. The school education department instructed government schools not to ask for transfer certificates if parents and students wanted to migrate from private schools. Government schools have been receiving many queries from parents of students studying in private schools in the past few days. “Around 10% to 20% of students from matriculation schools and 30% to 40% from primary schools switched to government schools in the last one year alone,” said Arumugam, president of Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA) in Tamil Nadu. The federation wants the government to make Transfer Certificate (TC) mandatory to enrol students till Class VIII from another school. “Under the right to education (RTE) act, schools can admit any child up to Class VIII without any documents including TC from the previous school. While the particular rule was aimed at bringing down dropout rate in schools, it has brought pushed private schools to the verge of closure,” said D C Elangovan, secretary, Federation of Associations of Private Schools in Tamil Nadu (FAPSIT). Elangovan said popular private schools, which constitute less than 10% of schools across the state, could manage to retain students and collect fees from parents. But the majority of the schools are struggling to pay their teachers. According to the RTE Act, students need not produce a TC for admission if they are unable to get it from the previous school. They can get enrolled with age proof and Aadhar number. Schools also can download TC from EMIS (Education Management Information System) portal after entering the number allotted to each student.  According to data from the school education department, admissions to government schools increased by 1.3lakh in 2020-21. While Class I witnessed 11,000 more admissions, 33,000 more students enrolled in Class IV, which was the highest for any standard during last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pvt-schools-want-tc-made-mandatory-for-admission/articleshow/83587447.cms||K Sambath Kumar
---||Delhi||Zero fatality corridor model to make 8 ‘blackspots’ safer||New Delhi: Over the next two years, eight traffic “blackspots” and five accident-prone zones across the city will be made safer, thanks to the Delhi government’s Bhalswa Chowk ‘Zero Fatality Corridor’ model.The zero fatality corridor is a result of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Delhi government and the SaveLIFE Foundation and on Wednesday, the transport department of the Delhi government signed an addendum agreement with the foundation on road safety, extending the MoU for four more years. The agreement was signed by the special commissioner (road safety) and founder & CEO of SaveLIFE Foundation in presence of Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot.Speaking at the virtual event, Gahlot said that Delhi witnessed 1,463 people die in road crashes during 2019. “Even in the pre-Covid scenario, there was a decrease of 13.5% in the number of fatal accidents in Delhi as compared to the previous year i.e., 2018 and the fatality rate has decreased by 13.43%. Through this initiative, our aim is to continue making Delhi roads among the safest in the country,” he said.Earlier in 2018, blackspots on Outer Ring Road were identified after the MoU was signed and a trial was conducted at Bhalswa Chowk to undertake necessary interventions to reduce road crashes on the deadly intersection. The Delhi government said in a statement that the redesign at Bhalswa Chowk was found to successfully create an improved scenario of safe mobility, which was visible throughout the junction.The government said that the project recorded 100 % reduction in road crash deaths through a 70% reduction in pedestrian exposure distance, reducing pedestrian vulnerability to conflict, crashes and near-crashes. It said 12,000 people, including school children from the vicinity, were engaged during the trials.SaveLIFE Foundation’s ‘Zero Fatality Corridor’ model attempts at reducing the number of road accident deaths through a 360-degree intervention, the statement said.“Delhi has demonstrated sensitive leadership in taking up the issue of road crashes that drastically affect people from all backgrounds but especially those from vulnerable economic backgrounds,” Piyush Tewari, founder and CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/zero-fatality-corridor-model-to-make-8-blackspots-safer/articleshow/83587443.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Maintenance work of the house, which has been declared as a protected monument by the archaeology department, was delayed for more than one-and-a-half years, according to the admirers of Pathiri. John Kalliath, who has been persistently campaigning for the conservation of the monuments related to Pathiri, said the wooden roofs and beams on the veranda have been damaged badly in the mite attack. Velur Forane Church vicar Fr Davis Cherayath has been in touch with the archaeology department officials to persuade them to launch the maintenance work on the house. However, the contractors are known to be reluctant to undertake the maintenance work in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic. But the building could suffer irreparable damage if the maintenance work was delayed further, Fr Cherayath said. Pathiri had come to Kerala as a Jesuit missionary in 1700 and was one of the first foreign missionaries to study Sanskrit bypassing the taboo against its study by non-Brahmins. He was also well-versed in Malayalam and had composed many poems in the language, including the popular ‘Puthen Pana’ (the new ballad). Pathiri was the first to compile a Malayalam dictionary in which he describes Malayalam words in both Sanskrit and Portuguese. He also wrote a short grammar for Malayalam language. Pathiri was the first European to write a Sanskrit grammar ‘Grammatica Grandonica’ and also the first European to compose Sanskrit verse. He was known to have stayed at this house for about two decades. The government had declared the house of Pathiri and the nearby church established by him as protected monuments in 1995. The local parish authorities had planned to demolish the church and the house in the early 1970s. However, it was the intervention of the late chief minister C Achutha Menon which averted such a possibility. He had sanctioned funds for the conservation of the house of Pathiri and the church set up by him, after his visit there on December 10, 1972, said Kalliath. He said the mite attack could be arrested through scientific methods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/arnos-pathiri-memorial-under-mite-attack-risks-collapse/articleshow/83587479.cms||T Ramavarman

If a regular student had studied only two languages in Class IX, then while calculating the results, the average of the two languages should be considered as marks for third language in Class X as performance of Class IX, the board has said. “For mathematics level 1 and mathematics level 2, the marks of both levels have to be added and compared with level 1 reference average,” Goa Board has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hold-practical-exams-online-if-student-didnt-answer-board/articleshow/83589860.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Disappearing sand dunes in western Rajasthan worry experts||JAIPUR: The fast disappearance of sand dunes in western Rajasthan or losing of their natural path to human activities have prompted the experts to study its implication on the local ecosystem. Sand dunes have declined by 16% between 1970 and 2013, said PC Moharana, principal scientist in natural resource division, Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), who has extensively studied the changing environmental conditions in the desert regions. He clarified that the area under the habitat has turned the barren land into a cropped area with stabilisation of sand dunes as old as 10,000 years old while it will create to have an adverse impact on the unhabituated area — flora and fauna. “Indiscriminate plantation of trees in various geometrical shapes — checkerboard and horizontal — to regulate the movement of winds are deterring the formation of sand dunes in areas away from human habitats. Overgrazing by livestock is creating an impact on flora and fauna,” said Moharana. He said sand dunes harbour vegetation, which is required for fauna and further maintains the food chain established thousands of years ago. “It acted like a protective cover by stabilising the impact of strong winds and sandstorms. In the absence of sand dunes, winds directly hit the urban space. Also, studies are underway to find out if the rate at which the irrigated land is eating away the desert space would lead to expansion of sand in new urban spaces,” said Rakesh Goyal, principal scientist in soil and water conservation department, CAZRI. The CAZRI has introduced several steps to restore the sand dunes by introducing fencing, planting grass slips, micro windbreaks in 4 lakh hectares in districts such as Barmer, Bikaner, Churu, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur. “These measures have reduced the wind velocity and helped in minimising the impact of sand storms in the human habitat,” said Moharana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/stabilization-of-sand-dunes-concerns-experts/articleshow/83587456.cms||---
---||Pune||Current O2 allocation not enough: industries||Pune: Industries and oxygen manufacturers in the Pune district on Wednesday said that the current government allocation of 20% of all oxygen produced is not enough for all stakeholders, hampering large parts of the industry in servicing existing orders and taking up new ones. The oxygen demand by hospitals has dropped as the second Covid-19 wave continues to wane. “At the peak of the second wave, the oxygen consumption in the district was at 363 metric tonnes per day. The consumption has dropped down by more than 50% to just 125 metric tonnes per day. Most of the public hospitals run by the state, municipality and the rural administration as well as private hospitals have beefed up their oxygen production facilities, drastically reducing their dependence on commercial oxygen producers,” a state Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official told TOI. The occupancy of oxygen-supported beds and ICU beds has also gone down in recent weeks. Thus, oxygen manufacturers and bottlers find themselves in a tricky position — they can neither sell enough gas to their previously predominant industrial customers nor can they rely on strong demand from the health sector. Industry representatives alleged that some companies, especially MSMEs, are resorting to the black market to procure the oxygen to fulfil urgent or pending orders due to manufacturers’ inability to supply. Some added that the administration can increase the oxygen quota of the health sector if needed.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Fruits and two crops in midst of Thar desert||JAIPUR: Short date palm trees, which act as a green cover on Gadra Road in Barmer, comes as surprise for many. The area in Thar desert, which had no habitations until 2009, is producing two crops with recharge of groundwater table, modern farming techniques and sheer determination of farmers. It has not only provided a sustainable means of livelihood, but also checks the desert from spreading. Shiv Pratap Singh (28), a farmer at Choutan village in Barmer with 90 bighas, could grow only one crop – barley — which was sufficient for his extended family for decades. Most of his uncles and cousins have migrated to bigger cities for livelihood due to inhospitable conditions where temperature touches 50°C in the peak of summer. “I have never imagined that wells in our area will recharge to a level that even after meeting the drinking needs, we can think of using it for irrigating the area. We dared to think of growing fruits and cash crops in the past 3-4 years after surplus water in our wells,” said Singh, who has planted 600 plants of Anjeer which fetches Rs 400 to Rs 500 per kilogram in the wholesale market. Following the success model, almost every second villager has found to be lucky to have his/her soil quality complemented with the water to raise crops. Rajesh Goyal, soil and water conservation engineer, CAZRI, said, “The soil cover in desert areas are unexploited. It contains high-value minerals and nutrients which would form a great combination with moderate salty water is converting the barren land into farming land. As per our scientific studies, the fertility of the soil will continue for some years.” He cleared that such an experiment is possible in some areas and duplication could backfire villagers financially. Born and brought up playing around Sand Dunes, Mahendra Singh (43) of Bhata Village surrounded with desert has never imagined in the wildest of his dreams to see pomegranate, anjeer and berry trees. “I am cultivating date in 24 bighas since 2019 other than maize and barley. The profit has shot up many times,” Singh said. Goyal explained that in desert areas several areas have water aquifers with freshwater stored for thousands of years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fruits-and-two-crops-in-midst-of-thar-desert/articleshow/83587487.cms||Shoeb Khan

The water flowed into Cauvery river, Vennaru, Kollidam and Grand Anicut (GA) canal systems. Cauvery and Vennaru carried 2,000 cusecs of water each while the two other canals got 500 cusecs of water each from the dam. The water will irrigate over 3 lakh acres of paddy cultivation in the delta districts — 1 lakh acres in Thanjavur, 0.9 lakh acres in Tiruvarur, 0.05 lakh acres in Nagappattinam, 0.96 lakh acres in Mayiladuthurai and 0.16 lakh acres in Cuddalore. Chief minister M K Stalin had opened Stanley reservoir in Mettur on June 12 with 10,000 cusecs being discharged from the dam to Cauvery river. The water touched Upper Anicut (Mukkombu) in Trichy on Tuesday morning and Grand Anicut in the evening. Ministers K N Nehru (municipal administration), M R K Panneerselvam (agriculture), S Regupathy (law), Ma Subramanian (health), S S Sivasankar (backward class welfare), Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi (school education) and Siva V Meyyanathan (environment), Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi N Siva and MLAs offered flowers as the dam’s sluices were opened to release water. PWD officials said the water could take ten days to reach the tail end areas after which the due share of the water to Karaikkal district in Puducherry will be given. Trichy collector S Sivarasu, Thanjavur collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver and PWD secretary of Puducherry A Vikranth Rajah were also present. Ministers Nehru and Panneerselvam said the desilting work would be completed before the water reaches the end point.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/grand-anicut-opens-for-kuruvai-cultivation/articleshow/83587481.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: After sewage flows into Fatorda fields, PWD fined Rs 1.2 crore||MARGAO: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) on Wednesday imposed a penalty of nearly Rs 1.2 crore on works division XXI of the PWD for having failed to stop raw sewage being released into the fields at Fatorda. In a letter issued to the PWD by the member secretary of GSPCB Shamila Monteiro, the principal chief engineer of the PWD has been directed to pay the amount as a “polluter pays” penalty “towards the cost for carrying out a remediation exercise in the affected area”, failing which the Board has warned of initiating immediate action under provisions of the Water Act and Air Act. The Board’s action against the PWD is with regards to the complaint lodged by Fatorda resident Dr Aashish Kamat in January 2020 pointing out that raw sewage was being released into the fields at Fatorda by PWD/sewerage corporation behind KTC bus stand, Margao, along the road leading from the bus stand to the stadium. Subsequent to several directions to the PWD and site inspections, the GSPCB had on March 30 issued a notice to the PWD asking it to show cause within 15 days why the “polluter pays” fine amounting to nearly Rs 1.2 crore should not be imposed on it “on account of the failure of the department to stop the discharge of untreated sewage into the fields of river Sal”. The Board said that the reply submitted by the PWD was found to be unsatisfactory. Following a site inspection by the Board in January 31, 2020, the Board observed that raw sewage was flowing into the fields through a pipe from underneath a sewerage chamber by the side of the road. “The sewage flows towards the SGPDA market from where it gets diverted into the storm water drain along the main highway, old marker circle, Colva road, and finally it meets the River Sal,” the Board observed, and asked the PWD to take immediate action in that regard. However, several directions to the PWD later, during a subsequent inspection held in February 2021, the Board observed that “the discharge of sewage has not yet been stopped and it continues to overflow through the fields as it was at the time of the last inspection held on January 31 2020.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-sewage-flows-into-fatorda-fields-pwd-fined-rs-1-2cr/articleshow/83589826.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: After 5 years of difficulty in even standing, dog walks around post-bariatric surgery||MUMBAI: Deepika’s finally getting back into shape. The 50kg 7-year-old Indie cross breed, pet to a family in Pune, underwent weight-reduction surgery last week. According to doctors, the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was the first such operation done on an animal in India, reports Alex Fernandes. Over the last few years, Deepika’s ebullience had been waning. She had put on weight, had difficulty walking, could barely stand, panted excessively. Further, she had been diagnosed with a host of ailments such as liver, kidney, cardiac and high BP besides cataract, thyroid and hernia, said Dr Narendra Pardeshi, veterinary laparoscopic surgeon from Pune. Thanks to the surgery, she is now 45kg. Despite a controlled diet, exercise and medicines, Deepika’s condition had worsened, her owner said. After 5 yrs of difficulty in even standing, dog walks around post-bariatric surgeryDeepika had become lethargic… At one point, she was popping more tablets than the food she ate,” says her owner Daisy Daruwala. As Deepika’s condition continued to worsen, Dr Shashank Shah, a bariatric surgeon attached to Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, proposed that the bariatric surgery would work on the dog. “Excess of grelin, a hormone, reduces metabolism. This, in turn, affects the liver, the viscera and other organs,” said Dr Shah. “In Deepika’s case, the curvature of the stomach was detached to reduce the size of the stomach by 70%, and sutured. So, the patient consumes lesser food and yet feels satiated.” Having shed 5kg, Deepika now stands, even walks around the house. Her panting has reduced, the high blood pressure is now in better control and the ECG is normalising, Dr Pardeshi said, “Had it not been for the bariatric surgery, Deepika would have been bed-ridden in a the next couple of years… This surgery will give her a better quality of life and a longer lifespan too.” For the last few days since the operation was done , Deepika has been feeding on diluted chicken stock and water. The family is of the firm belief that every creature on this earth has the right to live and it has to be respected. Just a week into the surgery, the canine is already looking slimmer and even feeling better, said Daruwala whose family had to avail of a loan for the surgery. “She is back to walking around the house for now although we do ensure that she does not have stress too much,” said Daruwala. “We can’t wait for Deepika to bounce back completely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-rare-surgery-docs-staple-50kg-dogs-tummy/articleshow/83592195.cms||Alex Fernandes

Every UPHC has an unofficial sample collection target, but at times they fail to achieve the target as people hesitate to undergo the test. As people gradually began to turn up for vaccination setting aside the reservations, the move to make them undergo the RT-PCR test was termed as a bad idea.At the UPHC, a section of residents who were given tokens for taking the jab were made to stand in a queue to give their nasal and throat swabs. While vaccination was supposed to commence at 10 am, the UPHC exhausted the tokens by 9.30am, people said. Residents were told to check with other UPHCs. As the other centres also completed their allotments, desperate residents including senior people returned to Kattur UPHC for a final try. They were surprised to see that the staff issuing tokens for the vaccine at the UPHC. “After getting the tokens, we were told to stand in a queue for giving the swab. Nobody asked us for our consent. As it turned out to be a long wait, we protested the move to test the people waiting for vaccination,” R Jawahar, a resident of Kattur, said. The local people also complained that the staff claimed that testing was mandatory before vaccination. After the protest, the UPHC staff started collecting samples from those who are willing for the test.There were earlier instances that swabs were collected from senior citizens accidentally by PHC staff, while they were waiting for the vaccine. Doctors with the civic body claimed that people are hesitant to test owing to which the visitors to the UPHCs were tested to meet the target. “We have not made testing mandatory for those who visit a PHC to vaccinate. Will conduct an inquiry,” Dr Amutha, the city health officer (in charge)’ told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/uphc-staff-in-trichy-draw-flak-for-bid-to-collect-swabs-from-people-waiting-for-jabs/articleshow/83587542.cms||Deepak Karthik

Pilot was expected to hold talks with the party central leadership over demands of cabinet expansion and state-level political developments, but he returned after having discussions with state’s AICC general secretary in-charge Ajay Maken during his five-day stay there. Just as chief minister Ashok Gehlot indicated that a cabinet rejig was unlikely soon despite the pressure tactics from the disgruntled lawmakers, former state assembly speaker and sitting legislator Deependra Singh Shekhawat issued a statement on Wednesday saying that Pilot was never seeking a post for himself or his supporters. “These reports of a bargain going on for the number of positions in the cabinet, boards and corporations are absolutely false. Pilot and all of us have been striving to seek honour and self-respect for the grassroots Congress workers in Rajasthan,” Shekhawat said. The former minister, who was among the 18 MLAs who rebelled against Gehlot last July, said, “Those individuals who valiantly took on the wrath of BJP governments of Vasundhara Raje and Narendra Modi from 2014 onwards, who gave their sweat and blood to revive Congress after its worst ever defeat in 2013—of getting just 21 of the 200 seats—need to get adequate recognition and respect now that the party is in power.” Shekhawat targeted Gehlot on the recent political appointments doled out to former bureaucrats and non-political kin of influential people. “Political appointments should be given to those who carried the burden of making Congress win at polling booths and not to cherry picked retired bureaucrats and officers whose loyalties are temporary, at best.” The Srimadhopur (Sikar) MLA expressed hope that the AICC committee, of which Maken is a member, would address the grievances raised before it. Shekhawat said, “We have full faith in the commitment made by the party high command to address all such issues that we have raised.” MLAs Ved Prakash Solanki and Indraj Gurjar, among others, met Pilot soon after he returned to Jaipur. “The party high command should listen to us. If not today, may be tomorrow. If two members fight, the family head must listen to them,” Solanki said. He added, “Our colleagues are expressing themselves on Twitter or before the media. If the seniors tell us not to go before the media, they should tell us to whom we should speak, and we will do that. It’s already getting late; party workers are suffering.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-returns-to-state-loyalists-say-high-command-should-listen-to-him/articleshow/83587491.cms||---

Other leaders who met the CM said there was a general discussion on the preparedness for the next assembly elections due in 2022.

The KUHS had earlier deferred the examinations due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown. According to the KUHS vice-chancellor Dr Mohanan Kunnummal the asymptomatic students should undergo rapid antigen tests before appearing for the examinations. In the case of students who are symptomatic, they should undergo RT-PCR tests even if they test negative for antigen tests. The students who test positive for Covid-19 will be permitted to appear for the theory examinations in separate halls, following the Covid protocol, till they test negative. However, they will not be allowed to attend practical examinations. They will be given another chance to write the examinations, once they recover from the disease and after the mandatory quarantine period, said the vice-chancellor. Dr Mohan said the controller of examinations (CE) S Anilkumar has already communicated these details to affiliated colleges. Candidates appearing for the examinations should be checked for Covid-19 symptoms before entering the examination hall. The students, who are hostellers and are now staying at their houses due to the lockdown, should be summoned back to hostels sufficiently earlier than the start of the examinations. They must be advised to bring an antigen test negative certificate, and should be examined for Covid symptoms before entering the hostel, according to the communication sent by the CE. Anilkumar said that all students must comply with the standard protocol like wearing masks and maintaining social distances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kuhs-asks-students-to-undergo-covid-tests-before-exams/articleshow/83587527.cms||T Ramavarman

Her trainers in the NCC as well the commanding officers have asked her to not lose the focus on shooting acknowledging her talent. However, after completing the graduation at Bharat Mata College, Thrikkakara, in Ernakulam in 2018, the poor financial situation of the family forced her to set aside her dreams because pursuing a career in shooting involves a lot of money. But even then she tried to not lose the touch and joined the shooting club run by the District Rifle Association of Idukki under student membership and kept trying for sponsorships. And after much effort seeking support from the government, the State Scheduled Caste Development department (SCDD) has allotted Rs 1 Lakh to her last month so that she could register as a lifelong member at the shooting club and begin professional training. “The passion for shooting began after I joined NCC in Class VIII. I was in the NCC for eight years until completing graduation. During the firing sessions, I performed well and the officers selected me for various camps. It was during the graduation, I could attend the TSC where I secured gold medals in shooting in all qualifying stages to TSC. But, after that I could not continue training due to financial issues. My father is a daily wage labourer and mother is homemaker. Though they supported my dreams, I did not want to trouble them. It was difficult to forget dreams, but I am so happy that I got the government’s support now so that I could continue training,” Aparna said. The fund was allotted by the SCDD after much efforts put in by former MLA John Fernandez and SCDD senior clerk S Sreenath. District Rifle Association of Idukki secretary James and his son Milan James now train Aparna, who earlier secured student membership after the association was impressed of her talent. Aparna is training in 10-meter peep sight air rifle category and she intends to participate in state and national level competitions. But she does not have her own weapon, which affects her training, and is looking for a sponsor. “In NCC I used to shoot with .22 long rifle. But while training with the 10-meter peep sight air rifle, I realized that I have so much to learn. Without my own gun it would be very difficult. It will cost around Rs 3 lakh to buy a gun and other shooting accessories, which is quite not affordable to me now. Now, I am practicing with the training gun available at the club,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/shooter-looks-for-sponsors-to-hit-target/articleshow/83587581.cms||---

The ban on new hirings for permanent government positions was brought in during the tenure of former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar in 2016. The ban was put in place following the financial burden of implementation of recommendations of the seventh pay commission. Last year, CM Pramod Sawant had announced that the ban on recruitments would be lifted in January 2021. On Wednesday, he said that interviews for posts already advertised by the government earlier would be held once Covid is under control. The government had imposed a ban on recruitment processes in government departments/ grant-in-aid institutions/autonomous bodies/corporations/PSU’s, etc, in view of implementation of the recommendation of the seventh central pay commission, in respect of pay and allowances to employees of the government and government-aided institutions,” states the circular. Even though some recruitments were taken up during this ban period with the approval of a high-level committee, the process failed to pick up pace due to various political, administrative and financial reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ahead-of-elections-state-lifts-2016-ban-on-govt-recruitment/articleshow/83589901.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Pimpri Chinchwad couple raises Rs 16 crore to save 11-month-old baby girl||PUNE: A Pimpri Chinchwad couple has raised Rs 16 crore with the help of a crowdfunding platform to buy a single-dose gene replacement therapy injection for the treatment of their 11-month-old daughter suffering from a rare genetic disorder. Vedika, who is just seven days short to turn a year old, suffers from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA-type 1) and was administered the world’s costliest injection (zolgensma) intravenously at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital on Tuesday. The gene therapy is expected to improve the girl’s breathing and feeding movements within a month and address other developmental delays within a year. With this, she has become the third baby in Pune who has been administered the costliest drug in the last 12 months. The first baby from Kharadi was given the same drug in June last year. After the therapy, the baby’s breathing and feeding movements have improved significantly and she has also started sitting and standing on her own, the hospital’s treating doctors confirmed. Swiss pharma firm Novartis that manufactures zolgensma had provided the injection to earlier two Pune babies for free on humanitarian grounds. The medicine, imported from the company’s headquarters in the US, landed in Pune in a cryogenic metal chamber (box) through a world courier service on June 14 after the Centre waived the import duty and even exempted Goods and Services Tax (GST), both to the extent of Rs 5.5 crore. “It took us two hours to administer the drug to the girl through a drip on Tuesday. She was discharged home on Wednesday morning. It is a single-dose one-time therapy, which is expected to improve her breathing and feeding (swallowing) movements within a month and other related developmental issues over a period of next few months,” said paediatric neurologist Sandip Patil, Vedika’s treating doctor. Vedika is likely to be the 17th baby to have received the costliest drug in India ever since the drug has been made available two years ago. “Kharadi baby was the first to have received the drug along with another kid at Delhi’s AIIMS hospital in June last year,” Patil said. Vedika’s father Sourabh Shinde, a mechanical engineer, told TOI, “About 1.5 lakh donors from India and abroad helped us to raise Rs 16 crore in 75 days. About 300 people were involved to keep the internet posts active and in circulation all the time to save Vedika’s life.” Shinde runs a family workshop on metal sheets in Talawade. His wife, Sneha, is a homemaker and helps him in his work. Vedika’s life went off smoothly till she turned eight-month-old. “She could not hold her neck. For last one month, she has been on nasal feed as she could not even swallow milk and often gets choked,” the father said. In addition to doctors at DMH, medical staff at Oyster and Pearl hospital also helped the family as Vedika needed multiple hospitalizations in the last five months. DMH’s chief paediatrician Rajan Joshi said, “Earlier babies with this genetic condition would succumb within a year or two of their birth. The drug has really turned things around.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pimpri-couple-raises-rs-16cr-to-save-11-month-old-baby-girl/articleshow/83587551.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The civic council has made arrangements for providing testing free of charge to this targeted group at the Baramati sub-district hospital. “We still have active Covid cases in all our nine civic wards,” Baramati municipal council’s deputy chief officer Padmashree Daigade said. Baramati has recorded a total of 25,062 Covid-19 cases since the outbreak of the pandemic. Of which, 24,044 patients have been discharged after recovery, 627 succumbed to the virus, and 391 are active cases. Kiran Yadav, chief officer of the council, said that those, who have received two doses of the vaccine, won’t need to go for testing, but they will have to adhere to all Covid-19 restrictions. There are about 5,000 commercial shops of all types and over 10,000 employees are associated with them, said Narendra Gujrathi, president, traders’ association, Baramati. “The RT-PCR testing is required as it will enhance confidence of the customers as well as contain the spread of the virus. If an employee is Covid asymptomatic, he might not face any issue, but other employees may get into trouble. This mandatory testing will prevent this kind of situation here,” Gujrathi told TOI on Wednesday. Other traders have also responded affirmatively to the move. Surendra Mutha, president, grocery association, Baramati, said, “Thousands of people come to the grocery shops daily across the tehsil. As a result, regular testing of employees working in these shops is necessary to contain the virus spread.” Sushil Somne, president, clothes traders’ association, said, “The council has made available testing free. We have told all our members to get their employees tested as per the order to avoid further complications. Baramati has faced the worst situation in the second wave. Thus, all traders have agreed to the move.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/baramati-makes-fortnightly-rt-pcr-test-a-must-for-shopkeepers-traders/articleshow/83587577.cms||---

Based on the applications received from the aspirants, training would resume as per traditions, he said. “Everyone who applies will be given archaka training. We are prepared to renovate the institutes and relaunch them for addressing the purpose,” Babu said in Trichy. In 2007, the then Tamil Nadu government had opened the training centres in six locations for Vaishnavite and Saivite traditions in Palani, Tiruvannamalai, Madurai, Tiruchendur, Triplicane and Srirangam. The admissions were on caste-based reservation. The aspirants were trained in agama (traditions) in Tamil and Sanskrit, of which some of them are employed in private and rural temples. The beneficiaries said that the institutes helped them gather the qualification to serve as priests in temples where their families were serving for generations. Some of them are into conducting rituals at houses. “The training was easy since the tradition was taught in Tamil as well. People calling us to host rituals at home insist to read slokas in Tamil instead of Sanskrit,” M Velu, a Trichy-based priest trained in the institute at Madurai, said. Non-brahmin priests said the 1.5 years training course had given recognition to them since a certificate was provided by the government. The centres are expected to witness demand as the government had earlier said that those who had completed the course will get appointment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/archaka-training-centres-to-be-renovated/articleshow/83587564.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Now, an app to track primary kids’ learning||PANAJI: Online teaching during the pandemic has created physical distance between the teacher and the student. In such circumstances, to help teachers better gauge learning outcomes, a tracking app is being introduced on a pilot basis in 29 government and aided primary schools across three talukas in Goa. Once the ‘Learning Navigator’ app is appropriately vetted to adapt it to the needs of local schools through its use during the academic year 2021-22, the state council for educational research and training (SCERT) plans to introduce the software to teachers in all the 1,000-odd government and aided schools from 2022. SCERT project director Nagraj Honnekeri said that the pilot study is presently being carried out in 16 government schools and 13 government-aided schools in Bicholim, Tiswadi and Quepem. This programme is implemented by the educational organisation Adhyayan Foundation, with technical support from the Gyaan Prakash foundation, and the app has been developed by Gooru, he said. The app is already in use in states like Maharashtra and Rajasthan. “The pilot will be conducted for mathematics classrooms from Classes I to V. In the 29 pilot schools, the progress of the students will be tracked for this academic year. Learning Navigator is an app used by teachers and enables them to understand where each student is in terms of their knowledge and skills in a particular subject and how they can improve,” Honnekeri said. The app is used at the teacher’s end to review the progress of each child in foundational literacy and numeracy, and its use will not be affected if the student does not have access to a device. “The Learning Navigator app provides a personalised route based on each learner’s current proficiency, portfolio, preferences and mindsets. It is intended to be used with the existing curriculum itself,” Honnekeri said. Kavita Anand, co-founder at Adhyayan quality education services, said that the app will help teachers to figure out the learning loss in students. “Some children will have help at home, some will not have help from parents, some will be first generation learners. Teachers will be using the app and it is being tried out to see how easy it is to use for the teachers. We also have to learn how to help them learn it,” said Anand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-pilot-project-app-to-track-primary-kids-learning/articleshow/83589929.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Pune||Pune police look for husband in woman, child’s murder case||PUNE: The city police have launched a search for a manager (38) with a private insurance company who, they claim, is the prime suspect in the murder of his wife (35) and their son (7), whose bodies were found 35km apart at Khalad near Veer dam and Jambhulwadi off the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, respectively. The crime occurred on Monday and came to light on Tuesday. The Bharati Vidyapeeth police found the boy’s body at Jambhulwadi off the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass on Tuesday evening, while the Saswad police found his mother murdered on Tuesday afternoon at Khalad village. “The man has emerged as a prime suspect on the basis of our investigation and the circumstances leading to the incident,” assistant commissioner of police Sushma Chavan told TOI on Wednesday. “There was no fourth person in the self-driven hired SUV in which the family had left their home for an outing on Monday morning. The couple had told their relatives that they would return the same night,” senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said. “CCTV footage show the husband abandoning the SUV at Market Yard off Satara road and walking towards Swargate. He may have taken a private transport bus to leave the city,” Kalaskar said. Seven police teams have been deployed for tracing and bringing the man back to the investigators. A lookout circular has been issued to all airports and the man’s passport suspended to ensure he does not fly out of India. The family’s relatives had approached the police with the couple and their son’s photographs after the three did not return home on Monday night. The crime first came to light when the boy’s body was spotted by some people at Jambhulwadi on Tuesday evening. The police had circulated the family’s photographs among all their units. Based on the photographs, the Saswad police in rural Pune confirmed that the body of the woman found murdered at Khalad was that of the boy’s mother. “Samples of blood stains collected by forensic experts from the SUV and that of the woman have matched. The police have recovered an iron bar, which is suspected to have been used for hitting ther in the head. The boy was stangulated to death. Preliminary postmortem reports received by the Saswad and Bharati Vidyapeeth police stated death ‘due to hemorrhage and multiple injuries” (in the case of the woman) and ‘strangulation’ (in the case of the boy),” Kalasakar said. Based on the GPS tracking system fitted in the hired SUV and the CCTV footage collected from various locations, the police established the route taken by the family on Monday. “They reached Vighneshwar via Hadapsar, Saswad and Kapurhole before turning to Saswad via Bopdeo Ghat. They reached Khalad around 8.30pm. We suspect the man killed his wife and son along the route and dumped her body at Khalad before reaching Jambhulwadi where he dumped the boy’s body,” said Kalaskar. “Around 1.10am on Tuesday, the man abandoned the SUV at Market Yard and walked towards Swargate,” the officer said, adding that he was from the family of a retired district planning officer at Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh. His brother is settled in Canada. The woman’s maternal home is in Bhopal. The couple had moved to Pune in 2007 and later shifted to a flat at Charholi in Lohegaon. “The woman was working with a private company but left her job two-and-ahalf years ago after the couple realised that their son was suffering from autism,” said Kalaskar. He said the man had hired the SUV on June 11 and the family was going for outings each morning and would return the same night. The police have found some toys and food items in the car. “The woman’s relatives are on their way to Pune,” an officer said. The Saswad police and the Bharati Vidyapeeth police have registered separate cases of murder and other charges relating to the woman and her son’s death and are conducting parallel investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/husband-prime-suspect-in-murder-of-lohegaon-woman-son-police/articleshow/83587606.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) minister P K Sekar Babu, who inspected the complex on Wednesday, said that the department will make use of the case studies and advancements made in technologies to overcome the challenges in implementing the project. He also added that rope car infrastructure is proposed for hill temples in Thiruthani, Sholingur, Thiruneermalai and Thiruchengode. The proposal for a rope car in Rockfort came up for discussions since 1997. But, the presence of houses and commercial establishments very close to the hillock was cited as the reason for the delay in facilitating any infrastructure. “The shelved rope car proposal is revived, feasibility studies jointly with the experts will continue. Existing models in use in other countries will be studied. We are confident of facilitating hassle-free access to the aged devotees,” the minister said. HR&CE sources said a proposal to install multiple elevators was considered too. An international firm has even visited the Arulmigu Thayumanava Swamy and Arulmigu Uchchi Pillaiyar temple complex recently to study the area. Babu also said the his department will revive the application to avail the Unesco world heritage site tag for Srirangam Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple, which is pending for more than seven years. The minister later inspected the working of rope car facility in Ayyarmalai in Karur district. On encroachments within temple complexes across the state, the minister said that HR&CE will streamline the entry and exit points after overcoming litigations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/study-for-rope-car-at-rockfort-temple-begins/articleshow/83587614.cms||---
---||Patna||Anti-Dalit JD(U) behind dissension in LJP: Chirag Paswan||PATNA: Facing a ‘do or die’ situation, Chirag Paswan on Wednesday wrote a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, requesting him to reconsider his decision of making his ‘estranged’ uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras the LJP parliamentary party leader in the Lower House and reinstate him on the post. The Lok Sabha Speaker on Monday accepted the plea of five of the six LJP MPs and recognised Paras as the party’s leader in the Lower House. Except Jamui MP Chirag, his cousin Prince Raj, Mehboob Ali Qaiser, Veena Devi and Chandan Singh had signed the letter to the Speaker in favour of Paras. In his letter to Birla, Chirag wrote: “Since Article 26 of the LJP constitution empowers central parliamentary board of the party to decide who would be the party leader in the Lok Sabha, the decision of announcing Paras as leader is contrary to that provision.” He also mentioned that five MPs, including Paras, have already been removed by the LJP national executive committee and suspended for anti-party activities. “In view of the above facts and submission, it is requested to review the decision taken on June 13 and to issue new circular in favour of Chirag Paswan MP as the LJP leader in the Lok Sabha,” Chirag wrote. The Paras group is to meet at Patna on Thursday to elect him as the party’s national president. Paras reached Patna on Wednesday and visited the LJP office. “There is an election for party president tomorrow (Thursday),” Paras told reporters at Patna airport. Talking to mediapersons in Delhi for the first time after the coup in LJP by Paras and other 4 party MPs on Sunday, Chirag blamed JD(U) for creating a rift in the party as “it never wants Dalits to progress”. He held Paras more responsible for the divide in the party as well as the family. “I was probably not orphaned the day when my father passed away. I feel orphaned today when chacha (Paras) also left me,” the 38-year-old Chirag said on an emotional note. When asked if the ‘Hanuman’ (Chirag) would seek the help of his ‘Ram’ (PM Modi), Chirag quipped, “If Hanuman has to seek help from Ram, then what good is Hanuman and what good is Ram?”. Chirag said JD(U) was trying to break his party even when his papa (Ram Vilas Paswan) was in hospital. “Several people in the party, including chacha (Paras) did not show much interest in electioneering for the party during the assembly elections... I am saddened that the conspiracy was hatched behind my back while I was ill,” he said. Describing himself as “sher ka beta” (lion’s son), Chirag asserted that he will fight the “long battle” for the party founded by his father. Later in the evening, Chirag appointed Raju Tiwari as the party’s Bihar unit president. Earlier, Chirag’s cousin and Samastipur MP Prince Raj held the post. Meanwhile, Paras said the four MPs and Lok Sabha secretariat had already declared him as the parliamentary party leader. “The meeting of the national executive was held on Tuesday and the incumbent national party president (Chirag) was removed from the post. The election of new LJP national president will be held at the house of Surajbhan Singh Ji. The election will be held as per the party’s constitution,” Paras said. Surajbhan, a former MP and the elder brother of Nawada MP Chandan Singh, was appointed the party’s working president by the Paras group on Tuesday. “I will save the party as well as the family,” Surajbhan said. Paras accused Chirag of ‘one-upmanship’. “The party constitution says one man, one post. However, Chirag was president of the party, parliamentary party leader as well as president of the parliamentary board. This doesn’t happen in any party. Hence, we decided to free him from the post of national president,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/anti-dalit-jdu-behind-dissension-in-ljp-chirag/articleshow/83585324.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 60 skip Cov-19 test, miss MUHS exams||Mumbai: Over 60 students from health science courses were turned away from their examination centres over a period of seven days for not having an RT-PCR or RAT report. A few hundred — 18 to 126 students a day — missed the exam after testing positive for Covid-19. The exams, conducted by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) across the state from June 10 following a directive of the Bombay high court, saw over 95% attendance in a week. It is the first exam to be conducted physically at centres after the second wave of Covid-19 in the state. Over 40,000 students are appearing for these exams from across courses, which comprise MBBS, ayurveda, homeopathy and other health science courses. Refusing to stay the conduct of physical exams, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court had directed that the examinees must test negative in RT-PCR or RAT before appearing for the exam. The MUHS issued a directive based on the order. Students were expected to get the RT-PCR done before June 15. Dr Ajit Pathak, exam controller of MUHS, said that the exams are being conducted as per the directive of the court. He said that the university had been offering Covid Suraksha Yojana — an insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh — to all students, staff and faculty members to cover treatment charges if infected. Exams have been conducted in two sessions since June 10. From 200 to 490 students have remained absent in each of the sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-60-skip-cov-19-test-miss-muhs-exams/articleshow/83589997.cms||Yogita Rao

Ranchi Expressway Limited directors K Srinivasa Rao, N Seetaiah, and Nama Prithvi Teja, son of the TRS MP, were also summoned. The ED had seized Rs 1 crore in cash and gold jewellery and “incriminating” documents related to the case from the office and residences of the accused. The agency alleged that despite Rs 1,029 crore being released by the banks, there was no progress in the project. Investigations revealed that Rs 264 crore was diverted because of round-tripping in equity, subordinated debt infusion and diversion of mobilisation advances, the ED claimed. Nama Nageswara Rao is a bank guarantor for the loan.

Absconding since the case of sexual exploitation was lodged against five trust officials on June 6, four of the accused were nabbed by police from Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday and were brought to the city on transit remand in the early hours of Wednesday. City SP Subhash Chandra Jat has said detailed interrogation of the accused will be done in connection with the case. The four accused, Harpal Singh Thapar, who is the head of the trust, Pushpa Rani Tirkey, who is Thapar's wife and chairman of the district child welfare committee, Geeta Kaur, warden at the CCI, Aditya Singh, Geeta's son and staff at the centre, were caught from Mala in Singrauli, on the basis of their mobile phone location. The fifth accused, Toni Singh, is at large. All five accused are facing charges under sections 354, 354(D), 323, 334 of IPC and under relevant sections of Pocso Act. Notably, two girls, both 15 years of age, had fled from the CCI on June 5 but were caught hiding at their common friend's house in Birsanagar the next day. When police questioned the girls for fleeing the centre, they alleged that they ran off to save themselves from sexual exploitation at the centre. The girls charged Harpal Singh of sexual exploitation and accused others of aiding him. They also alleged that children were not being taken care of properly at the centre. After the matter came to light, the district administration shifted the 40-odd children to a government-run CCI and sealed the care centre. In the preliminary investigation, police found that funds meant for the welfare of the children were misused by care centre officials. The accused have been forwarded to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/four-officials-of-shelter-home-held-for-sexual-exploitation/articleshow/83584645.cms||---

Suresh Paswan, the executive engineer of the special division of the state rural development department which is building the bridge, said, “The 22-meter-long deck slab has collapsed and the girder was demolished in the rain. The quality of the construction was poor and substandard. The deck slab must not have been cast in the rains and we had warned the construction agency not to do it but it but it did pay heed.” Sources said that the Rs 8.33-crore project is being built by Sildilya Construction, which is owned by former Congress MLA Bittu Singh. Paswan accused the construction company of bullying and claimed that out of the former MLA’s fear, the junior engineer and sub-divisional engineer avoided regular inspection of the construction site. He said that he is going to report the matter to the state government. Local BJP MLA Shashibhushan Mehta, who visited the site on Wednesday, demanded a high-level inquiry into the collapse. “It could not withstand the rush of the first rains of the monsoon. The construction agency is notorious for flouting norms and no official ever dares to speak against the substandard work done by it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/portion-of-under-construction-bridge-collapses-in-palamu-dist/articleshow/83584581.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM seeks audience with Modi to discuss state’s Covid scenario||RANCHI: Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, who is in New Delhi currently, has sought a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for discussions concerning the state which is gradually coming out of the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Soren had called on Modi in January last year, less than a month after he assumed the office of the chief minister. In the brief meeting, Soren had requested special care for Jharkhand, citing the backwardness of the state. “There is no confirmation from the PM’s office about the meeting yet,” said a source aware of the developments. The meeting, if it happens, will be significant in the current backdrop of the Jharkhand government’s differences with the Centre over the Covid-19 vaccination policy and the Centre’s reluctance to disburse the state’s GST dues along with Jharkhand’s demands for a payout of outstanding mining royalties owed by the Coal India Limited. Soren, who had flown to the national capital on Tuesday on a three-day visit, is also scheduled to meet UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and discuss matters of the Mahagathbandhan government in the state, which comprises JMM, Congress and RJD. In the political circles, speculations are also abuzz about Soren discussing a possible reshuffle in the state cabinet with the central Congress leaders. The speculations gained momentum after Jharkhand Congress president Rameshwar Oraon also travelled to New Delhi on Tuesday and met AICC general secretary K C Venugopal. Sources in the state Congress camp said Oraon, who is also the state finance minister, will be asked to step down from one of his two responsibilities, which in turn can open up a berth in the cabinet. Congress currently has four ministers in the cabinet while JMM has six and RJD one. One cabinet berth is lying vacant. While Oraon could not be reached for comments, state Congress working president Rajesh Thakur, however, rubbished the speculations. “There are no discussions about a cabinet reshuffle at present. The state president is in the national capital on a personal visit,” Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-seeks-audience-with-modi-to-discuss-states-cov-scenario/articleshow/83584695.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||IMD issues lightning alert for places bordering Bihar||RANCHI: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday issued lighting alerts at isolated places in regions bordering Bihar during the next three days. Moderate thunderstorm and lightning are also expected to be accompanied by heavy to very heavy rain, it said. According to its bulletin, the IMD said dense cumulonimbus (a type of cloud with very high mass, high-speed low-level) cloud movement along with highly charged ions is expected to move from the Himalayan foothills in the west/ south-west direction into North Bihar, further moving south and entering Jharkhand. Issuing an orange category warning, the IMD said, “The probability of intense to moderate lightning is very high during the next three days till Friday (June 18). It is very likely to be associated with light to moderate rain at most places while heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places may occur as the cloud moves.” Since Jharkhand has a history of damage to life and property in lightning strikes, the IMD has also issued a preventive advisory. “In cloud overcast areas, farmers should not be in the open field. Moreover, cattle grazers and animals should not be in the open while fishing or boat movement should be restricted and special care should be taken that children do not venture out in mango and litchi orchards,” the advisory said. So far, the state has received abundant rainfall since the onset of the monsoon on June 12. Even before the onset of the monsoon, the entire state had received a good quantum of rainfall because of Cyclone Yaas. As per IMD records, 19 out of 24 districts have received excess rainfall in the current monsoon season, which is considered to have begun from June 1. The five districts that have received normal rainfall include Godda and Pakur in the northeastern part and Gumla, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan in the southern part. Five districts — Chatra, Giridih, Deoghar, Sahibganj and Khunti — have received excess rainfall where the deviation is more than 19% of the normal rainfall for the districts. The remaining 14 districts have received a large excess quantum of rainfall of which Palamu, which is considered a rain shadow district, has also received 283% more rainfall corresponding to 140.2 mm as against a normal of 36.6mm in the first fortnight of June. Lohardaga with 226.5mm and Garhwa with 131.2mm rainfall are next in the list which recorded a deviation of 247% and 227% respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/imd-issues-lightning-alert-for-places-bordering-bihar/articleshow/83584734.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Black fungus declared epidemic in Jharkhand, no new case in 48 hrs||RANCHI: A day after chief minister Hemant Soren gave his nod to declare Mucormycosis (black fungus) infection epidemic, the infection tally remained unchanged with no fresh cases being detected in Jharkhand in the last 48 hours. Healthcare experts also suggested that the fungal infection threat will not last for a very long time. Talking to TOI, officer on special duty to state health department Sidharth Tripathi said, “A total of 131 patients have been reported with black fungal infection, of which 52 are suspected to have developed the infection while 79 cases have been confirmed. A total of 25 patients have succumbed to the infection while 37 have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. It is a good sign that we haven’t reported any fresh cases in the last two days.” As per state health department records, Ranchi has the maximum number of black fungus patients with a total of 46 cases. East Singhbhum has reported 21 while Hazaribag has total of 10 cases. On being contacted, doctors treating Mucormycosis patients said cases have decreased significantly in state and there are rare chances that fresh cases will increase. However, they said they are getting complicated cases which have been detected and attended to. “Fresh cases of Mucormycosis have gone down as it is directly connected with the infection rate of Covid-19 cases. As fungal infection is detected after three weeks of recovery from Covid-19 and four weeks have passed since Covid-19 cases have gone down in Jharkhand. Awareness about post Covid-19 complications has also led to an early detection of fungal infections which had also resulted in recovery of patients,” said senior ophthalmologist of Shree Bhagwan Mahaveer Medica hospital Dr Anindya Anuradha. Talking about one such case, Dr Anindya Anuradha said that a 55-year-old patient who was detected with the fungal infection had to undergo six debridement sessions as they had to remove the fungal infected areas from behind the eyes which helped in improving the patient’s vision. The patient’s daughter Khushbu Agarwal said,“My mother had contracted Covid-19 in April and although she was not diabetic, her blood sugar levels had shot up after recovery as she had developed black fungus. However, due to tireless efforts of Dr Abhishek Ramadhin and Anindya Anuradha, my mother recovered and I am indebted to them,” said Agarawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/black-fungus-declared-epidemic-in-jharkhand-no-new-case-in-48-hrs/articleshow/83586297.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The operatives were planning to commit a bank robbery in Simdega district. Three firearms and two motorcycles were seized from them. The arrested were identified as Sonu Ansari, Vikas Oraon, Bharat Baitha and Prakash Chaubey, all from Ranchi district. Lohardaga SP Priyanka Meena said, “We got a tip-off that some suspicious persons with firearms were spotted near a dhaba on the Lohardaga-Ranchi road. A police team led by Lohardaga SDPO Vashisht Narayan Singh was set up to nab them.” Meena said they seized a 9mm pistol with two bullets, two country-made pistols, five .315 bore live cartridges, two motorcycles and one mobile phone from their possession. “All of them were jailed in the past on charges of murder, loot, extortion and under sections of the Arms Act.

---||Vadodara||Vadodara Covid cases ebb to 2020 levels, 38 new infections||VADODARA: If Covid-19 gripped the Vadodara city much faster in the second wave, it seems to have spared it equally briskly. For the first time, the number of cases in the city and district dropped below after June 2020. On Wednesday, the city and district recorded 38 new cases. Before this, the city and district had recorded 37 cases in a single day on June 12, 2020. Even 37 new cases had raised a lot of concern in June last year. But as the pandemic progressed, this is being seen as a figure on the lower side. Another major difference between the situation then and now is that the 37 cases on June 12, 2020 were detected only from 181 tests. Against this, it took 2,231 tests to identify the new cases on Wednesday. While the total number of cases now maybe around 50 times what it was on June 12, 2020, a major respite has been the high recovery rate. Against a recovery rate of 65.2% then, the rate today stands at 96.7%. The reduction in the daily caseload has been very drastic in the second wave as compared to the first wave. Sources said that this could be because Diwali festivities had led to a minor spike in the first wave and then local body elections had ensured that the downfall was arrested. Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that the graph went down sharply in the second wave as a large number of people had been infected in both the waves. “In the first wave, there were many who had not been infected. Now, we have many who were infected and many others who are vaccinated,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-corona-cases-ebb-to-2020-levels-38-new-infections/articleshow/83582950.cms||Sachin Sharma

---||Nagpur||Liquor licence renewal process starts in Chandrapur||CHANDRAPUR: Even as state excise department began the process of renewal of suspended liquor licences from Wednesday, no application could be filed on the first day. Officials claimed although over 150 people had come up with the renewal applications, all were rejected for enclosing flawed and insufficient documents. State government had revoked the six-year-long liquor ban in Chandrapur wide a GR dated June 8. However, the process of renewal of liquor licences, suspended since April 1, 2015 when prohibition was enforced in Chandrapur, was withheld for additional directives from commissioner of excise department. Detailed guidelines were received on Tuesday, following which the renewal process was formally started from Wednesday. There were 561 types of excise licences in Chandrapur when the prohibition was promulgated. These include 110 country liquor retail licences (CL3), 24 wine shop (FL2), 318 beer bar (FL3), 25 beer shoppe (FLBR2) and other liquor licences. After the ban, 18 FL2 licencees and eight CL3 holders opted to transfer their permits out of Chandrapur, while rest remained suspended. “We have started renewal process at three division offices in Chandrapur, Rajura and Warora and have offered single window scheme. Over 150 licence holders had flocked all the three offices, but their applications could not be processed for want of sufficient documents,” said a senior excise officer. He, however, maintained that all applicants were explained about the necessary documents, NOCs and procedure to be followed at every excise office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/liquor-licence-renewal-process-starts-in-chanda/articleshow/83588221.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Goa||Gusty winds, heavy rain cause landslide in Goa, uproot trees damaging many houses||PANAJI: Heavy rains accompanied by strong winds, reaching up to 60kmph, lashed the state on Wednesday, uprooting trees across the state and even causing a minor landslide at Curca, authorities said. While no injuries or fatalities were reported, crashing trees damaged many houses and vehicles. Strong winds caused a freak accident at Ponda after metal roofing sheets of a building got dislodged and crashed into a car on the road. At Orlim, the heavy rain caused a recently constructed walkway to collapse. The tiled walkway is being built by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation. The heavy rains have washed away already damaged roads across the states, slowing down traffic and leading to snarls in some parts. IMD has said that heavy to very heavy rainfall occurred at most places in Goa. Further, it has predicted that heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to continue on Thursday and Friday at isolated places. The department of fire and emergency services was kept on its toes responding to calls for assistance across the state. According to officials at the headquarters at Panaji, they received 47 calls throughout the day. “Most of the calls were regarding uprooted trees. At some places there was waterlogging and flooding on the roads,” an official from the department of fire and emergency services said. Severe waterlogging was reported at Nagoa–Verna and Curchorem which affected vehicular traffic and local residents. Crashing trees at damaged homes at Khobrawaddo in Calangute, Margao, Benaulim, Bicholim and other places. Fortunately the residents did not suffer major injuries. The fire department has yet to estimate the losses incurred due to the damaged homes. Valpoi recorded the highest rainfall at 82mm followed by Pernem with 69mm between 8:30am and 5:30pm. Panaji received 47mm of rainfall. Winds of speed around 40-50kmph were seen throughout the day with short but intense spells of rainfall. The IMD has said that with increased rainfall activity will continue, with the likelihood of landslides and flooding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gusty-winds-heavy-rain-cause-landslide-uproot-trees-damaging-many-houses/articleshow/83588425.cms||---

He said the water level of the Bicholim river was at 2.7m while that of the Valvanti at Sakhali was at 2.1m till Wednesday morning. The danger line of both rivers is 6 meters. Pandit assured locals that there was no need to panic as the disaster management cell was monitoring the situation round-the clock. Currently, while total losses ascertained by the fire and emergency officials stood at nearly Rs 6.5 lakh, there are many houses which are destroyed and the final figure will be known after all these losses are reported. On Wednesday, most cases of trees crashing on houses were reported in Pilgao and Bordem, causing a loss of around Rs 1.3 lakh in these areas itself. Fire services’ officials said they were receiving calls reporting tree falls even as they are yet clearing debris reported on Sunday. There were also reports of damage in Mayem, Virdi, Sankhali, Kudnem, Dhumasem and Menkurem. Till Wednesday evening, many low-lying areas like Bandarwada and Gauthan village experienced waterlogging.

---||Faridabad||Aravalis: Man ends life after demolition order||FARIDABAD: A 70-year-old man allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree near his house in Khori village, where about 10,000 homes built on Aravali land are set to be razed in line with a Supreme court order. The man's family said he was in distress for the past few days and had been looking at news reports about the demolition order. Ganeshi Lal was found hanging from a tree around 5 am on Wednesday. Later, his son Shyam Lal, filed a police complaint and Surajkund police filed a case against the property dealer who had sold land to the family 15 years ago. Earlier, Lal used to stay in a hutment. He renovated his house recently and hardly 15 days after the work got over, the SC issued the order. Aravali suicide: Man used up all his savings to build houseThe family, originally from Meerut, has been here for 15-20 years. Ganeshi Lal built a permanent house recently and he was very upset when the news of the demolition order came in. He used all his savings and also borrowed money from friends and family to construct the house. On Tuesday evening, while holding a newspaper in his hand, he was looking for someone who could read out the latest report on the court order to him,” said Dinesh Kumar, a neighbour. Lal stayed with his two sons and their families in Khori and ran a small shop outside their home. While Shyam works as a guard, his other son knits cots. According to the police complaint, Lal had spent Rs 3 lakh on the house and committed suicide late on Tuesday night. When TOI visited the village on Wednesday, the family’s house was locked. After Lal’s body was found, many villagers gathered outside the family’s house and started protesting against the demolition drive. About 100 people from Khori have been booked for hurling stones, police said. After the court order on June 7, Section 144 has been imposed in the area and a police force deployed. The authorities were supposed to start the demolition drive on Tuesday. But it has been put on hold now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/aravalis-man-ends-life-after-demolition-order/articleshow/83592299.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan meets PM Narendra Modi, says mega vaccination drive from June 21||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday afternoon amid speculations of a cabinet rejig at the Centre and political activities over appointments in boards and corporations in Madhya Pradesh. Chouhan made it clear that his meeting with the PM was on state issues, Covid management and the vaccination drive to be launched from June 21. By the end of December, 70% of the state would be vaccinated, the CM said. Chouhan’s one-on-one with the Prime Minister came a few days after chief ministers of three BJP-ruled states — Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam — held closed door meetings with PM Modi. During the meeting, which lasted around 80 minutes, Chouhan is learnt to have discussed issues related to party politics, as Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia is likely to be elevated to the post of Union minister in the proposed cabinet expansion this month-end or in July.After the meeting, Chouhan announced that Madhya Pradesh will launch a mega vaccination drive from June 21 instead of July 1. “Today, I met Prime Minister Narendra Modiji in New Delhi and apprised him of the Covid situation in Madhya Pradesh and the state government’s efforts to control Covid, and discussed preparations to deal with the third wave,” Chouhan said in a video statement. PM Narendra Modi & CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan during their meet in New Delhi Allow states to draw loans up to 5.5% of GDP: Chouhan to PM Today, 160 positive cases were reported in Madhya Pradesh and the positivity rate is 0.2%. The state government is prepared with full strength to control the third wave of Covid. Maximum testing, isolating persons found positive, contract tracing, continuing the ‘kill Corona campaign’, keeping Covid-care centres running, and getting the public to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour will continue,” he said. "On June 21, all the ministers, including me, MPs, MLAs, crisis management committees and eminent personalities from different walks of life will come together for the mega vaccination drive. I have received the PM's guidance to complete the vaccination programme within the fixed timeframe,” he added. Raising the issue of financial crisis amid the Covid pandemic, Chouhan urged the PM to allow states to draw loans from the market up to 5.5% of GDP against 4.5% at present to speed up economic activities. “PM Modi’s guidance is always available for the development of MP and welfare of people. The PM is a man of ideas and under his guidance, development works in Madhya Pradesh are being carried forward with great pace,” said the chief minister. Chouhan also urged to raise the target of purchase of moong dal and other crops before monsoon and said MP is committed to increasing production of tuar dal to reduce import. The chief minister also met Union minister for chemicals and fertilizers DV Sadanand Gowda and requested higher allocation of DAP and urea for kharif crop. He met Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Union minister for social justice and empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot and railways minister Piyush Goyal.

---||Goa||Under-construction retaining wall, footpath fall at Orlim||Colva: An over 50m-long retaining wall, along with a footpath, collapsed from heavy rainfall in Orlim on Wednesday morning. The ongoing construction was to help reinforce a traditional pathway used by villagers and was part of beautification and developmental works undertaken by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) across Benaulim. The constituency-wide projects covered widening of junctions, roundabouts, re-surfacing roads, de-silting nallahs, construction of retaining walls, footpaths and cross-culverts across Benaulim, Seraulim, Varca, Orlim and Cavelossim. These works were kicked off in December 2018 at a cost of Rs 25 crore. With this collapse, criticism is being levelled at the authorities. GSIDC general manager Jude Carvalho said the government has not lost anything as it was an under-construction project and had not been handed over yet. He said the contractor will have to bear the expenses of re-construction of the collapsed portion. Villagers had demanded that authorities concerned repair the ancestral pathway ‘vaat mear’ (bandh) as it was being used to cross ovr from the main road to St Michael’s church since generations. The path was also used for the annual “lantern procession” in the evenings and covered 780m of walking distance with water catchment areas on either side. Referring to the technicalities of the construction Carvalho said, “Prima facie it appears that the retaining wall has tilted due to hydrostatic pressure exerted on the under-construction wall from incessant rains. In the absence of adequate number of weep holes, the wall has tilted.” A weep hole is a small opening provided in the retaining wall to drain off rain or other accumulating water. He added that by not providing adequate number of weep holes, it amounted to a lapse on the part of the consultants and contractor. “A simple exercise of providing weep holes as per Indian Standard (IS) code for civil engineering would have prevented the incident and loss to the contractor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/under-construction-retaining-wall-footpath-fall-at-orlim/articleshow/83588827.cms||Nisser Dias
---||Business||Direct tax kitty swells 57%, govt gets relief||NEW DELHI: Direct tax collections have shot up 57% to Rs 2.16 lakh crore during the financial year so far on the back of a low base in the previous year due to a national lockdown as well as collections through the dispute resolution scheme. After netting out refunds — which have slowed down over the last few weeks on account of glitches in the income tax portal — the mop-up has more than doubled to Rs 1.85 lakh crore between April and June 15, latest data released by the finance ministry on Wednesday showed. Refunds have dropped by almost a third to Rs 30,731 crore during the first 10 weeks of the year. The department expects the number to improve once the tax portal is fully operational. The growth, particularly the first instalment of advance tax, will provide some much-needed comfort to policy makers and experts who fear that the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic will slow down economic recovery. The government has budgeted for an over 22% increase in direct tax collections during the current financial year. Even on the GST front, the government appeared satisfied with the collections in May, which were estimated at Rs 1,02,709 lakh crore despite lockdowns across several states. On the direct tax front, advance tax collections — seen as an advance indicator for economic activity during a quarter — are estimated to have jumped almost twoand-a-half times to Rs 28,780 crore. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said the numbers came “despite extremely challenging initial months of the new fiscal” and expected that the data would improve further as more information is received from banks. Every quarter, businesses, professionals and even salaried with income beyond salary need to pay advance tax if their annual liability exceeds Rs 10,000. Within this, corporation tax collections were estimated at Rs 18,358 crore, with Rs 10,422 coming under the personal income tax (PIT) head. Experts said the numbers point to healthy GDP growth in the first quarter. “The jump in the direct tax collections in the first quarter of FY22 relative to the first quarter of FY21 reflects healthy exports and a continuation of various industrial and construction activities, given the lower stringency of the staggered regional lockdowns in 2021 versus the nationwide lockdown in 2020. This supports our expectation that GDP will record a double-digit expansion in the first quarter of FY22,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. At the gross level, however, collections up to June 15 showed PIT, including securities transaction tax to have accounted for just under Rs 1.2 lakh crore, while the corporation tax kitty stood at Rs 96,923 crore. During 2020-21, for the first time in over a decade, PIT was higher than corporation tax collections, a trend that the government expects to persist during the current financial year. Officials said that the change in the collection pattern was on account of lowering of corporation tax a couple of years ago. “The direct tax collections have risen substantially, and it appears that the primary reason for the significant increase can be attributed to the success of government’s Vivad se Vishwas scheme. Taxpayers have taken advantage of the Vivad se Vishwas scheme and have settled their old disputes and litigations with the income tax department along with depositing their tax dues. This seems to be the main reason we are noticing a boost in the direct tax collections,” said Neeru Ahuja, a partner at consulting firm Deloitte India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/direct-tax-kitty-swells-57-govt-gets-relief/articleshow/83592319.cms||---
---||Business||2nd Covid wave may leave Rs 2 lakh crore dent on eco output: RBI||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has estimated that the second wave may result in a Rs 2-lakh-crore loss in output during the current fiscal, in what is the first such exercise conducted by the central bank or the government. A loss of economic output may not have a direct corelation with the GDP, but points to some loss in the value-addition across the economy. Already, several agencies, including the RBI, have lowered growth projections for the year. The RBI’s output loss is factored into its revised GDP forecast in the latest monetary policy estimates, where it slashed growth projections from 10.5% to 9.5%. The state of the economy report released on Wednesday said the projection was on the assumption that real GDP will grow by 18.5% in the first quarter, which is on a much lower base given the contraction last year. Providing more details on the economic impact of the second wave, the RBI said the rate of decline in deposits has been higher, indicating that household savings have dropped in sharp contrast to the first wave. “Additionally, currency holding with the public has also decelerated significantly to 1.7% during April 2021 in comparison to the growth of 3.5% a year ago, implying heavy outgo towards Covid-induced medical expenditure.” It said the second wave’s toll is higher due to the impact on domestic demand as several aspects of aggregate supply, such as agriculture and contactless services, are holding, while industrial production and exports have surged amid pandemic protocols. “Going forward, the speed and scale of vaccination will shape the path of recovery,” the report said. As for life beyond the pandemic, the report highlights the advantages of repurposing and reprioritising revenue and expenditures to extract “bang for the buck”. The report said that the public sector can lead the private sector in unlocking growth opportunities. In addition, it can partner the private sector, and step back to allow the private sector to take the lead in sunrise areas. “While Covid has tested the limits of flexibility in fiscal policy frameworks in India as in the rest of the world, it has offered a unique opportunity to redefine fiscal policy in a manner that emphasises ‘how’ over ‘how much,” the report said. The report, authored by RBI deputy governor M D Patra highlights the finance ministry estimates that to achieve herd immunity and regain recovery momentum, the target population to be vaccinated is 70 crore by September 2021 and around 113 crore more doses are needed. Accordingly, around 93 lakh vaccinations are required per day to achieve the herd immunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/2nd-covid-wave-may-leave-rs-2-lakh-crore-dent-on-eco-output-rbi/articleshow/83592295.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt set to ask SC to review ban on old petrol, diesel vehicles in city||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is going to approach the Supreme Court with a request to review its 2018 order prohibiting the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in Delhi NCR in line with the Centre's new voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, which looks at the vehicle's fitness as the criteria for scrapping and not age. TOI had reported on Wednesday that Delhi transport department has warned owners of 'end of life vehicles' of appropriate penal action, which can range from a fine of up to Rs 10,000 or seizure and scrapping of the vehicle, if such a vehicle is found plying on roads. According to sources, the department has been getting many queries from owners of vehicles that are nearing the end of their life. Delhi's transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI that now there are specific regulations that allow vehicles that have proper fitness to ply even if these are older but it can't be implemented in Delhi because of the court ruling. ‘Flooded with queries on vehicle scrapping order’We will approach the court and we will apprise the court that there has been this development and this is the specific law and if it could please review the order,” Gahlot said. “We have been getting a lot of public queries on this,” he said. The Supreme Court had on October 29, 2018 prohibited the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the national capital region and directed the transport department to announce such vehicles will be impounded if found plying. Describing the pollution situation in Delhi-NCR as ‘very critical’, the apex court had also said that a list of such vehicles should be published on the website of the transport department. As per the amended Motor Vehicles Act, plying of old vehicles can invite a fine of Rs. 10,000, which is compoundable to Rs. 5,000. However, as per directions of the Supreme Court, if such a vehicle is found plying on the road, it can be impounded and scrapped by the transport department. The central government’s policy, which has not been notified yet, allows 20-yearold private vehicles and 15-year-old commercial vehicles to ply after re-registration if the vehicles clear fitness tests. As per the central government’s policy, vehicle owners who fail to get a fitness certificate or fail to renew the registration certificate after 20 years will have to scrap the vehicle. Keeping an old car, however, would become very costly due to the higher cost of getting a fitness certificate for a 20-year-old vehicle. The Union road transport ministry had also been planning to get legal opinion on whether it should seek a review of the ban on 10 and 15 years old diesel and petrol vehicles and in Delhi-NCR, once the voluntary vehicle scrapping policy is rolled out, TOI had earlier reported. The national policy is based on the principle of and not driven by enforced age criteria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-set-to-ask-sc-to-review-ban-on-15-year-petrol-10-year-diesel-vehicles-in-city/articleshow/83592321.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The big cat, a male named Pathbanathan, is the second lion to die due to the infection at the zoo. The first was a nine-yearold lioness named Neela which died in the evening on June 3. Officials at the zoo said Pathbanathan tested positive for SARS Cov-2 as per the report of the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal received on June 3. Samples were collected from Pathbanathan after five lions in the zoo showed symptoms such as coughing and loss of appetite. The animal, housed in the lion safari area, was under intensive treatment since then and died around 10.15am on Wednesday, said an official release from AAZP. At present, the zoo houses 10 more infected lions, being treated by an in-house veterinary team in coordination with an expert team from Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences (Tanuvas) University. “Two lionesses — 19-year old Bhuavana and 23-year-old Kavitha — which were critical last week have started to respond to treatment and are taking food properly now. All other infected lions too are under close observation to ensure they recover soon,” said an AAZP official. Zoo authorities said they were taking all precautionary measures to protect the infected lions and to prevent further spread of the virus to other animals. The zoo had introduced thermal scanning and ultra violet irradiation of the beef that was fed to the big cats. Zoo workers were administered vaccines for the infection. Periodic sanitisation of the animal enclosures had been taken up and the workers were provided with PPE kits while entering the enclosures. The zoo is also taking the help of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, run by Union government’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Hyderabad, to sequence the virus variant to understand zoonotic transmission better. Besides Covid-19, one lion has been tested positive for a more contagious Canine Distemper Virus (CDV). Zoo sources said the 19-year-old lion named Ragave was kept in isolation and is healthy now. Efforts were underway to keep stray dogs and cats out of the zoo premises as they had the potential to transmit diseases to the zoo inhabitants. The zoo has been closed for visitors from April due to the Covid second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/another-lion-dies-of-sars-covid-2-at-chennai-zoo/articleshow/83592322.cms||P Oppili

---||Business||Fed holds rates at zero, sees 2 hikes by 2023-end||WASHINGTON: Federal Reserve officials held interest rates near zero but signalled they expect two increases by the end of 2023, pulling forward the date of liftoff as the economy recovers. “Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of Covid in the US,” the Federal Open Market Committee said on Wednesday following the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. “Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.” The central bank held the target range for its benchmark policy rate unchanged at zero to 0.25% — where it’s been since March 2020 — and pledged to continue asset purchases at a $120-billion monthly pace until “substantial further progress” had been made on employment and inflation. The quarterly projections showed13 of 18 officials favoured at least one rate increase by the end of 2023, versus seven in March. Eleven officials saw at least two hikes by the end of that year. In addition, seven of them saw a move as early as 2022, up from four. The dollar rose, stocks declined and yields on 10-year Treasuries jumped. The FOMC vote was unanimous. The US economic recovery is gathering strength as restrictions lift and social activity increases. Robust demand from consumers and businesses alike has outstripped capacity, leading to bottlenecks in the supply chain, longer lead times and higher prices. At the same time, employment growth has disappointed over the past couple of months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/fed-holds-rates-at-zero-sees-2-hikes-by-2023-end/articleshow/83592323.cms||---

---||Bhopal||MP: Transfer-tired Lokesh Kumar Jangid officer vents anguish, gets showcaused||BHOPAL: After nine transfers in 54 months, IAS officer Lokesh Kumar Jangid of 2014-batch expressed his anguish at the ‘system’ in a closed messaging group of Madhya Pradesh IAS officers Association (MPIASOA). He was promptly removed from the group, and has since been showcaused by the government over an unrelated charge. On Wednesday evening, the general administration department showcaused the 35-year-old officer for allegedly recording a telephone call from the principal secretary-GAD regarding his transfer and making it public. It amounts to breach of trust and privacy and is a violation of Civil Services Rules, says the notice, asking Jangid to reply within seven days. BJP minister Vishwas Sarang also reacted to Jangid’s leaked conversations and said such action will not be tolerated, no matter who the officer is. In leaked screenshots of his posts and conversations on the messaging group, Jangid alleges corruption and suggests he was repeatedly transferred for being honest. Jangid has written to chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains seeking inter-cadre deputation to Maharashtra, citing personal reasons. Jangid’s first posting was as SDM-Vijaypur in Sheopur district on November 1, 2016. TRANSFER-TIREDDon’t know why IAS officer has been shifted, says BJP MPHe was attached to the secretariat a few months later. His most recent transfer was as additional MD, Rajya Siksha Kendra, within 41 days of being made additional collector of Barwani district. On Monday Jangid posted: “Interestingly, while those who mint money from all kinds of mafia, get transfer from field to field. And those with Impeccable Integrity get thrown to secretariat on transfer… Stability of tenure in Madhya Pradesh and the joke of an institution called Civil Services Board… I will come out with a book post-retirement and hopefully bring the facts before everyone to see. Right now, my hands are tied by conduct rules.” In another of his posts, he alleges he was removed as SDM from a district because he called the collector ‘weak’. MPIASOA president ICP Keshari objects to his posts and writes: “Lokesh, it’s not a question of fear or absence of that. You have lost basic decency – not only accusing your colleagues but also the family. Please delete all yours posts soon. That’s my sincere advice and desist from such things in future.” Jangid refuses, and writes: “I will not delete. You may remove me from the group. I know you are president of association and have all powers to remove me. Good luck-…waise bhi dissent to kuchla ja raha hai nizam mein. Aap bhi kuchal do.” He was then removed from the group by MPIASOA secretary Vishesh Garhpale. Congress attacked the government on this, with Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha saying: “The MP administration is at its lowest ebb. Corruption and nepotism at its peak. It’s an anti-thesis of the new world order which young India wants. Bureaucratic sycophancy the new national norm is at its best in MP. Honest officers have no place in MP.” BJP Rajya Sabha member from Barwani, Sumer Singh Solanki, said, “I don’t know why he has been shifted. He was working very hard and had developed a good relationship with locals in the region.” BJP Lok Sabha MP Gajendra Patel, whose constituency straddles Barwani and Khargone, told TOI: “He was posted here to tackle the (Covid) crisis and he performed well, taking along locals and public representatives. He must have been transferred over some administrative reason.” In the last four and a half years, Jangid has been SDMShahdol, deputy secretary-urban development, CEO-zilla panchayat in Harda, additional collector-Guna, additional managing director Rajya Siksha Kendra, additional collector-Barwani and is back at Rajya Siksha Kendra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-transfer-tired-lokesh-kumar-jangid-officer-vents-anguish-gets-showcaused/articleshow/83592340.cms||P Naveen

The Kancheepuram district child welfare committee, meanwhile, has requested the state education department to close the school and hostel and move 1,400 students to government shelters. Baba, who was on a pilgrimage to Uttarakhand, was admitted to a private hospital in Dehradun soon after a case was registered against him by the Mamallapuram allwomen police on June 12. A team led by DSP Gunavarman and inspector of police Jaisankar reached Dehradun on Tuesday to nab him, but the godman escaped from the city. The team then tracked him down by using the mobile tower locations of his associates and devotees as the godman doesn’t use a personal mobile phone. He was nabbed from Chittaranjan Park in Delhi on Wednesday and was produced before a magistrate court in Saket which issued a transit warrant. He will be brought to Chennai by flight on Thursday morning. CBCID superintendent of police Vijayakumar and cybercrime wing assisted the team in nabbing him. The Mamallapuram all woman police had registered cases against Sri Siva Sankar Baba under Pocso Act and Women Harassment Ac based on complaints from current students and former students on June 12. DGP JK Tripathy transferred the cases to the CB-CID on June 13. Cases were also registered against school staff Bharathi and Deepa under nine sections of the IPC and Pocso Act. Meanwhile, the Kancheepuram district child welfare committee has written a letter to the state education department on Wednesday requesting it to shut down the school and its hostel in Kelambakkam and move the students to safe government recognized shelters. N Ramachandran, chairperson of the committee, said that there are over 100 students still residing in the school hostel. At least six children have left the school with TCs in the past two days. “The students are aware of the happenings and are worried. Many of their parents live in other states and districts and are unable to come. We also contacted their parents, and many want them to be moved out. They are all very concerned about the allegations,” the chairperson said. Around dozen teaching staff of the school too have quit following allegations that the school management was part of the harassment racket. The committee members said that they are also flooded with calls from concerned parents and relatives of students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pocso-case-siva-sankar-baba-arrested-in-delhi-panel-wants-school-shut/articleshow/83592360.cms||---

GCCI president Manoj Caculo said the government should not to support such a move as it will increase the cost of medications during the pandemic. The GCCI’s appeal comes in the backdrop of the 43rd GST Council meeting where the government of Sikkim introduced a proposal for imposing a 1% cess on the pharmaceutical sector’s turnover for the current financial year as well as for 2022-23. The Goa government is also contemplating levying a similar cess the pharmaceutical sector. Caculo has written to chief minister Pramod Sawant asking him to consider the GCCI’s appeal and to also convince Goa’s representative on the GST council, Mauvin Godinho about the disadvantages of the additional cess. “Such levies actually contradict the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi towards improving the ease of living of the citizens of the country and the ease of doing business,” the GCCI president said. He said that the pharmaceutical sector was probably the only industry which operated at 90% capacity despite the adverse environment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Caculo said that despite supply chain logistics issues, the pharma sector did not “hesitate to walk the extra mile” and support the government through CSR and other ways. “The recent 44th council meeting has in fact reduced the prices of medicines related to Covid-19, On the consumer side, additional cess will add to the cost of medication for the public who are already reeling under the immense pressure during this pandemic thereby increasing the common man’s burden,” Caculo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-support-plans-for-cess-on-pharma-gcci-urges-govt/articleshow/83589122.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Bengaluru||Non-essential retail shops, Bengaluru transport may get nod next week||BENGALURU: The state government is mulling over more relaxations from next week as the Covid second wave ebbs across most districts with a pronounced decline in Bengaluru. Unlock 2.0 may see reopening of non-essential retail shops and rolling out of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation buses with limited occupancy. According to central guidelines of ministry of home affairs, lockdowns can be lifted in districts where Test Positivity Rate (TPR) is below 10%. However, the state Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee, choosing to be conservative, fixed the unlock criteria of TPR below 5%, oxygenated bed occupancy below 50% and case fatality rate below 1%. Hearteningly, 27 of 31 districts recorded TPR below 10% in the past seven days, while only four districts have seen positivity rate beween11% and 14.3%. While in18 districts, it is between 5% and 10%, it’s less than 5% in nine districts. The overall state average was 3.8% on Tuesday that went up to 4.3% on Wednesday. Govt may let malls open for limited hrsAs part of the staggered unlock plan, the government on June 14 lifted the first level of curbs and allowed industries to resume production with 50% staff. However, the general opinion is that industrial activities will kickstart only when the supply chain is reactivated by opening up the trade sector and resuming public transport. “Economic recovery needs reactivation of the entire ecosystem of production and markets simultaneously. We received requests from traders, especially small traders, to allow shops to reopen. We’ll decide after looking at the positivity rate over the next few days,” said health minister K Sudhakar. Sources said the government favours reopening shopping malls with limited hours and dine-in restaurants with minimum occupancy. While night curfew may continue, further relaxation will come in subsequent phases. Of 48,241 oxygenated beds in the state, only 17,960 are occupied (37%), easing the demand for oxygen and high dependency unit (HDU) beds. “In Bengaluru, non-essential shops may be reopened for limited hours. Resumption of public transport with restrictions is needed,” said BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. However, a cause of concern is the case fatality rate, which is still high both at the state level (2.2%) and in Bengaluru (1.8%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/non-essential-retail-shops-bengaluru-transport-may-get-nod-next-week/articleshow/83592364.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

---||Chennai||ONGC seeks Tamil Nadu nod to drill 10 oil exploration wells||TRICHY: Days after chief minister M K Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging the Union government not to allow oil and gas exploration in Cauvery delta districts, ONGC has approached the state environmental impact assessment authority (SEIAA) seeking clearance to drill 10 exploration wells in Ariyalur district. The ONGC letter circulated widely on Wednesday attracted sharp criticisms from political parties and farmers who have been up against oil exploration in the agrarian region which had been designated a protected special agriculture zone by the previous government. According to the application dated June 15 submitted to the state government, the oil major plans to drill 10 exploratory wells in Ariyalur district where there is the likelihood of hydrocarbon reserve. ONGC sources said an environmental clearance application and pre-feasibility report have been submitted for Cauvery Basin. If any oil or gas reserve is found, plans will be afoot to establish development wells by the Cauvery asset section of ONGC in Karaikal that oversees exploration in the delta districts. “Only with the exploration wells can we identify natural oil and gas reserve. Perhaps the application was submitted because the proposed area falls outside the protected zone,” an official source in ONGC said under the condition of anonymity. The development comes close on the heels of a similar oil exploration proposal at Vadatheru in Pudukottai district sparking protests. “Already Ariyalur district is facing the bad consequences of excessive limestone quarrying and cement industries. Our groundwater level is depleting and oil exploration will make our livelihood worse,” Varanavasi K Rajendran, state secretary, Consortium of Indian Farmers Association, told TOI. Last year, the AIADMK government had declared Cauvery delta districts a protected zone for agriculture covering a part of Ariyalur and banned oil exploration activities. Farmers said the state government should not allow such exploration. “We will convey the concern of farmers to the chief minister. We will not allow any project that harms farmers,” K Chinnappa, Ariyalur MLA, said. Meanwhile, PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss and Tamil Maanila Congress leader G K Vasan have appealed to the state government not to allow the proposed exploration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ongc-seeks-tamil-nadu-nod-to-drill-10-oil-exploration-wells/articleshow/83592396.cms||---
