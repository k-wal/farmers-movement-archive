The instruction to disburse the payments pending complete paperwork has come in the light of Covid-19 claiming several government servants. The circular issued this week said, “It may be ensured that the pension payment order (PPO) for family pension is issued and disbursement of regular family pension is commenced by the bank not later than one month of the receipt of the claim for family pension.” Each ministry and department has been asked to submit monthly statements to the secretary of the administrative department. It has also shared the details of the entitlements of the family on the death of a government servant for quick reference. The personnel department has said quite a few government employees have lost lives in the recent surge of the Covid-19 pandemic and in many cases, the deceased employees were the “sole bread-winners” of the family. Their untimely death has left families devastated and they are in urgent need of funds in the midst of a pandemic and the government needs to release pensions and other entitlements expeditiously. The circular said on the completion of the process of sanction of family pension and its disbursement through the bank may take some time, as it involves reference to pay and accounts office (PAO) and CPAO. The personnel department in July 2020 had issued instructions for sanction of provisional family pension by the head of the office immediately on receipt of a claim for family pension along with death certificate from the eligible member, without waiting for forwarding the family pension case to PAO. The rule also provides for payment of provisional death gratuity by the head of the office once the family pension and death gratuity case have been forwarded to PAO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/disburse-provisional-family-pension-dues-quickly-to-employees-killed-during-pandemic-government-asks-departments/articleshow/83267273.cms||Dipak K Dash

Ramban SSP P D Nitya said the accident happened around 9.30pm when the taxi, on its way towards Jammu, plunged into Bisleri Nallah near Digdol. “Out of six passengers, three were found dead and two seriously injured were rescued and shifted to hospital where one was declared brought dead. Body of the sixth person was found entangled in the wreckage of the vehicle later,” said the SSP. Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said that troops from the Territorial Army stationed at Digdaul rushed to the spot and had to rappel down a rock face at 90 degrees to reach the victims. Ramban deputy commissioner Mussrat Islam said that directions have been issued to provide all possible help to the injured. Expressing grief over the incident, J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Saturday directed the departments concerned to carry out road safety audit and rectification measures within a week. Sinha also directed authorities to launch a road safety awareness campaign at accident-prone stretches of roads to check accidents caused due to human error.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/five-dead-as-vehicle-falls-into-river-in-jk/articleshow/83267752.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

In an interview published in the British Vogue magazine, Malala responded to a question on the institution of marriage by wondering why a relationship could not be just a "partnership". "Thinking about relationships, you know, on social media, everyone’s sharing their relationship stories, and you get worried…if you can trust someone or not, and how can you be sure," she said. "I still don’t understand why people have to get married. If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers; why can’t it just be a partnership?" she said. The remarks immediately landed her in hot waters in Pakistan, with lawmakers, clerics, academicians as well a section of the citizenry accusing her of peddling a western narrative. Most viewed her statements as suggestive of negating the concept of having a family with a "legitimate partner". On Friday, the controversy surrounding Malala’s views echoed in the provincial assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with members of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam urging her family to clarify their daughter’s position on the subject of marriage "Malala’s interview with the British Vogue magazine has been circulating on the mainstream and social media for some days. The government needs to probe whether the education activist really made those marriage remarks or not," said PPP lawmaker Sahibzada Sanaullah, who raised the issue on a point of order in the House. "Life partnership was not allowed in any religion, and if Malala favoured it, then the stand was condemnable." However, lawmakers from the opposition Awami National Party and PM Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf defended Malala and her family’s position on the issue, besides requesting their colleagues not to turn the matter into a controversy. Soon after Malala’s statement went viral on social media, a prominent cleric from Peshawar, Mufti Shahabuddin Popalzai, had taken to Twitter to ask her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, to provide a clarification for his daughter’s remarks on marriage. "A news report has been making the rounds on social media since yesterday that your daughter Malala Yousafzai has categorically rejected the institution of marriage and said that 'partnership' is better than getting married. We are all deeply disturbed by this statement. Please explain," Popalzai tweeted. Malala’s father responded soon after, "Respected Mufti Popalzai Sahib, there is no truth in it. The media and social media have taken an excerpt of her interview out of context and shared it with their own interpretations. And that's it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/malala-faces-pak-backlash-for-questioning-need-to-marry/articleshow/83267776.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||India, Pakistan to clear long-pending visas for diplomats, others||NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan seem close to resolving the thorny issue of assignment visas that has plagued bilateral ties for well over 2 years. TOI has learnt the 2 countries have arrived at an agreement that, on June 16, they will approve all pending assignment visas for diplomats and other staff members. As per the understanding, both countries will approve the pending visas at the same time on the aforementioned day. As reported by TOI on May 25, India had last month pulled out a few officials from its mission in Islamabad without waiting for Pakistan to approve visas for their replacements. Despite having completed their tenure, these officials had been forced to stay put in Islamabad for a very long period of time. With decisions on visas, and indeed all other issues in India-Pakistan relations, based on reciprocity, or lack thereof, Pakistan too has been waiting for India to approve visas for diplomats and other staff members. In the case of India, it's learnt that close to 30 staff members, including several diplomats, are awaiting visa. Timely clearance of assignment visas, or visas meant for diplomats and foreign government officials to allow them to carry out their duties on behalf of their national governments, is essential for smooth functioning of foreign missions. More so in the case of India and Pakistan with both countries having already halved the strength of their respective missions after India's decision to downgrade ties last year. Even before that, Pakistan had recalled its high commissioner after India's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, forcing India to the same. The visa concurrence, if it plays out the way it's intended to on June 16, will be a significant and welcome development allowing both sides to carry out normal diplomatic activities. However, as sources said, it'd be premature to see it as a sign of thaw in relations. The talk about a possible rapprochement after the February ceasefire agreement has fizzled out in the past couple of months despite reported attempts, apparently at the behest of UAE, to bring the 2 countries closer and ensure that they restore full diplomatic ties. Approval of official visas will allow them to maintain the status quo though. During his recent visit to the US, foreign minister S Jaishankar had said while it was important if there was a thinking that Pakistan needed to have better relation with India, there was a "clarity of thinking" on the Indian side "that we cannot accept terrorism, or we cannot accept that it is in any way legitimate as diplomacy or as any other aspect of statecraft". Pakistan responded to Jaishankar by alleging that peace and security in the region was threatened on account of India’s "brutalization of Kashmiri people and refusal to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions".

---||Business||'Was told not to talk about Barbara': Mehul Choksi's 'abduction' plot thickens||MUMBAI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi's story has been told extensively ever since he was captured in Dominica. However, there is a lot left untold. Several mysteries still remain - about the woman he was spotted with, his lavish lifestyle in the island nation, and the alleged abduction plot. According to eyewitnesses and local media, Choksi led a lavish life in Antigua and Barbuda. The Jolly Harbour area – where the diamantaire was residing - is one of the most elegant expanses of the island. It's full of post-card perfect private beaches. A mansion costs millions of dollars. Prime Minister Geston Browne himself resides here. Thus, it was not a surprise that Choksi — who is wanted for fraud in India — chose to reside in a place with a water tight-security system. The fact that the mystery woman, Barbara Jabarika, also chose to live there is indicative of the deep pockets of her alleged sponsors. She stayed in the area for three months. A landlord there would charge $2,000 (Rs 1.5 lakh) a night for a room. She initially stayed opposite to Choksi’s residential complex. Later, she moved to the Coco Bay hotel. It costs approximately Rs 70,000 per night there. Choksi has been staying in his "permanent and only residence" since 2018, after having obtained Antigua and Barbuda citizenship in 2013. He lives there "with his wife and his Antigua staff". His children visit him regularly. He also has an office in Woods Mall, one of the biggest malls in the island city. He was often seen walking there with a bodyguard, whom locals described as a robust man with a scary look. But what's mysterious is that the guard was nowhere to be seen on May 23, the day of Choksi’s alleged abduction. According to Choksi's deposition before the Dominica high court, Barbara, who became familiar with his routine and interacted with him almost daily, had allegedly suggested a new route that day. 'Barbara part of abduction conspiracy'In his statement to the court, Choksi named Barbara as a conspirator in his kidnapping. “On the day of abduction, Barbara suggested we deviate from our and visit a new place for our evening walk, Palm Point on the North Beach. She was instrumental in tricking/luring me away from my usual schedule and brought me to her house where people whom I believe to be Antiguan and Indians overpowered and kidnapped me. To the best of my information she was part of the conspiracy hatched to kidnap me,” Choksi told the court. “Almost immediately upon entering I was pounced upon by about seven to eight individuals. They were all dressed in blue and spoke with Indian and Antiguan accent,” he added. According to him, they kept beating him, gave electric shocks to his arms, face and hands and tied him to a wheelchair. He said the Indian was taken to a boat and cash worth $1,500, a Rolex watch, a mobile phone and bank cards were allegedly taken away too. Generally, the boat ride from Antigua to Dominica is about 90 minutes long and during the voyage, Choksi was allegedly asked where he had parked his money and details of the bank accounts. The boat arrived there on Monday (May 24) but he was kept in the yacht throughout the day as it was a holiday in Dominica. Choksi said that in the yacht, he was allegedly made to speak on phone to an individual named Naranja Singh from the Punjab Cader who blackmailed him about Barbara. “He told me when I am interrogated at the police station, I should tell the police that I came to Dominica to cooperate with the Indian investigators. He said that I should not mention Barbara's name because my wife will be upset with me. He told me several lies, including that he spoke to my wife,” Choksi said. That night he was handed over to police who took him by a bus to the Roseau Police Station. “The chief of police introduced himself to me and told me that I was wanted by Interpol and that there was a ed notice. I was told I will be sent to India,” he claimed. 'Barbara no longer in Antigua'Choksi's lawyers said he had no idea if Barbara accompanied him in the boat ride since he was blindfolded. However, it is believed that she is no longer in Antigua and Barbuda. “One thing is certain, she is no longer in Antigua. I have never seen her. All I know is she was here for three months, came from England and the information I have is that she has Indian features. I am aware that Barbara Jabarika is not an Indian name,” Justin Simon, Choksi’s counsel in Antigua, who activated his Dominican counterparts to file to a Habeas Corpus petition, told TOI. However, Choksi's version of events leave a trail of questions and no answers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/was-told-not-to-talk-about-barbara-mehul-choksis-abduction-plot-thickens/articleshow/83268458.cms||Vijay Tagore

He is also an architect, a filmmaker and a former science teacher -- and he revels in anonymity. The Seeker as he is known to the world answered TOI’s questions through an encrypted email and said that he prefers to remain unknown as he is not “looking for fame or glory” and because he doesn’t want to “trade off” his “safety and privacy.” “My insatiable curiosity drew me into this,” The Seeker says when asked why he started researching the origins of the deadly coronavirus. “It’s been over a year now, and I’ve devoted much of my waking hours to it,” he adds.

Though members of DRASTIC interact through direct messages on Twitter, she says that The Seeker comes across as a very intelligent person. “He has some knowledge of Chinese language and open-source intelligence. He is actually a seeker of information,” she adds. Read AlsoCovid origins: Why many clues point to a ‘modified’ close relativeIn June 2020 Monali Rahalkar and husband Rahul Bahulikar started investigating clues to the origin of SARS-CoV-2 virus theorising a link between Covid-19 and a pneumonia-like illness that killed 3 miners in China. Rahalkar has hypothesised that the miners’ illness was not transmissible at the timeLast year he found out a master’s thesis from China that spoke about how in 2012 six miners who went into a bat-infested mine in Mojiang took ill from a mysterious respiratory illness very similar to Covid and three of them later died. Revelations made by The Seeker’s data-mining abilities have gained him worldwide attention. It is partly due to DRASTIC that the widely-accepted natural origin of SARS-CoV2 is now being challenged and even US President Joe Biden has sought a foolproof investigation. “I have seen an overwhelming amount of facts and data that points towards a lab-leak scenario,” says The Seeker. “Well, we took a theory from the realm of “no, it’s a conspiracy”, to “hey, we need to investigate it further,” he adds. But why doesn’t he want to reveal himself despite his celebrity-like status? “I’ve already said there [to Newsweek, CNET and Unherd] as far as I could without revealing my real identity,” he adds. The Seeker tells TOI that team DRASTIC “took shape like a giant jigsaw puzzle, piece by piece.” Whatever has been achieved, he says is because of teamwork, “and the whole crew did some amazing research.” It was The Seeker who saw the research of Rahalkar and Bahulikar and brought them into DRASTIC’s fold. The duo had established that RaTG13, a coronavirus very similar to SARS-CoV2 was collected from the mine in Mojiang. They also found the Wuhan Institute of Virology was experimenting with RaTG13. “For data mining, my OSINT skills (like advanced google tricks, Boolean search operators etc) came handy,” The Seeker tells TOI. He says he is very hopeful that we will be able to find out the origins of the deadly coronavirus as “calls for in-depth investigations have multiplied.” And what mission will The Seeker be on next? “It’s a question I keep asking myself, but honestly I have no idea. I just keep going from one day to the next.” On the worldwide response, The Seeker said, “I’m amazed myself… wasn’t expecting this to blow up all of a sudden.” Watch Covid-19 may have originated in Wuhan lab: Indian scientist couple||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/toi-finds-the-seeker-who-made-the-world-rethink-covids-origins/articleshow/83268958.cms||Yudhajit Shankar Das

Peeved at the company’s refusal to comply with the provisions of the IT rules for intermediaries that were announced on February 25 this year and had to be complied with by May 26, the government told Twitter that this is the last time it is being warned. “… in view of Twitter Inc’s non-compliance with the Rules… consequences follow. However, as a gesture of goodwill, Twitter is hereby given one last notice to immediately comply with the Rules, failing which the exemption from liability available under section 79 of the IT Act, 2000, shall stand withdrawn and Twitter shall be liable for consequences as per the IT Act and other penal laws of India,” the notice, sent by the IT Ministry, says.

The PM unveiled a roadmap prepared jointly by the oil ministry and government think-tank Niti Ayog for developing an ethanol economy in the country. The roadmap reckons 20% blending of petrol with ethanol will result in an annual saving of $5 billion, or Rs 30,000 crore, in India’s oil import bill. India’s net petroleum import bill stood at $551 billion in 2020-21. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol – also referred as ‘drinking alcohol’ – made from molasses, grains and farm waste. The pandemic has made ethanol a part of our everyday life as one of the alcohol options for hand sanitisers. It is less polluting, and offers equivalent efficiency at a lower cost than petrol by raising the octane level. In 2014, the country had 1.5% ethanol blending, which has now gone up to 8.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ethanol-petrol-blending-deadline-advanced-to-2025/articleshow/83270169.cms||---

Government and private offices too have been allowed to open with riders. And Delhi Metro will resume its services at 50% capacity, improving mobility in the city. All shops selling essential goods, including educational books and stationery, and those selling fans in markets and malls, besides neighbourhood shops, have been allowed to open on all days without any restriction on timings. However, gyms, restaurants, cinema halls, salons, spas, bars, educational institutions, weekly markets and parks and gardens will not open and the bar on weddings at public places will continue. Takeaways at restaurants have been be allowed. "Delhi’s Covid-19 situation appears to be improving, and keeping that in mind, we began the unlock process last week," said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a digital address on Saturday. "It is necessary to bring the economy back on track if the Covid situation begins to get better. Last week, operations of manufacturing and production units within closed premises in approved industrial areas and construction activities within work sites were permitted." He said under the odd-even scheme, half the shops will be allowed to open on one day and the rest the next day. This has been done to prevent crowding at markets, he said. In all government offices, officials belonging to Group A will have to report for work though only 50% of other manpower is permitted to attend office. Those engaged in essential services will work on a 100% capacity and the head of the department will decide who will be a part of essential services. All private offices can open with a maximum of 50% of the staff but they have been advised to ensure that more people work from home. "The private offices should try to stagger their work hours so that not everyone comes out at the same time," said the CM. Though traders welcomed the order to open markets and malls from Monday, they expressed displeasure over the operation of shops on an odd-even basis. Leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said the odd-even formula was unlikely to work in the markets and implementing it would be a nightmare. Bidhuri urged the LG to allow all shops in the markets to open with regulated timings and also permit banquet halls and restaurants to operate with Covid norms. Delhi had started easing restrictions from last Monday after remaining under a stringent lockdown for about six weeks, which resulted in the rampaging coronavirus being reined in. Covid positivity rate fell to 0.5% on Saturday amid fast declining deaths. Only 414 fresh cases were reported. The CM said the Covid-19 situation appears to be under control. Owners and employees of shops will be allowed to move around in the city on production of valid identity cards issued by the employer or a valid e-pass issued by the government. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority, which issued the formal order, reiterated that all Covid-19 guidelines must be followed in offices, markets, shops and all public places. It said that if Covid-appropriate behaviour was not followed, the establishment would have to be closed down besides the owner becoming liable for criminal prosecution. Market associations and resident welfare associations will be responsible for ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour — wearing of masks; maintaining social distancing; regular hand washing and use of sanitiser; no spitting or consumption of liquor, pan, gutka and tobacco — by all shopkeepers, offices and residents within the premises of malls, markets, shopping complexes, offices and societies. All district magistrates and police officials have been directed to take strict action against defaulters. Kejriwal said more restrictions will be lifted after June 14 if the situation remains under control.

---||India||Covid origins: Why many clues point to a ‘modified’ close relative||In the summer of last year, two Pune scientists, Monali Rahalkar and husband Rahul Bahulikar, wrote a paper titled ‘Lethal Pneumonia Cases in Mojiang Miners (2012) and the Mineshaft Could Provide Important Clues to the Origin of SARS-CoV-2’. The research, first reported by TOI on June 16, 2020, theorised a link between Covid-19 and a pneumonia-like illness that claimed the lives of three miners in China’s Yunnan province. Their probe into the deaths and the bat coronavirus RaTG13, discovered in 2013 and currently the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2, soon became a key part of investigations by DRASTIC, a group of scientists and analysts looking into the origins of Covid-19. The couple’s work gained momentum after a member of this group — known as ‘The Seeker’ — found other vital information that boosted the ‘lab leak theory’. Rahalkar has hypothesised that the miners’ illness was not transmissible at the time because friends and relatives and others near the mine were not sickened. But after their samples reached the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), reports emerged of a fast-moving infection. Excerpts from an interview with Swati Shinde GoleWhat made you so curious about SARS-CoV-2 origins? Its exact origin is still unknown. It’s said bats are the source of this beta coronavirus, mainly because the next relative, named RaTG13, comes from bat faeces. RaTG13 is a virus sequenced from bat fecal swab collected in 2013. Not many details have been given about this interesting relative, though we know that SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share 96.2% genome similarities. SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV was first described in a Nature paper (Zhou et al 2020), but the authors did not provide details on RaTG13, only mentioning that it came from China’s Yunnan province. The paper’s lead author is Zheng-li Shi, from the WIV. We later found out that RaTG13 was discovered by Zheng-li Shi’s group in 2012-13 during surveillance of an abandoned mineshaft. After going through several online sources, we found the exact location of this mine — TongGuan, Mojiang county, Yunnan. Why is the Mojiang mineshaft link so special? In April 2012, six miners at the site who may have been exposed to guano for four to 14 days, were hospitalised with severe pneumonia and fever. A Master’s student (Li Xu) detailed their symptoms and treatment. Three of the six miners would eventually succumb. The student’s thesis (translated from Chinese) mentions interstitial pneumonia, ground-glass opacities in lungs and some pulmonary thromboembolism. All patients had fever, cough and severe pneumonia. Prognosis was better and hospital stay shorter in younger miners and those who had spent a shorter duration in the mine. Two miners with comorbidities (tumor and hepatitis) died within a short span. Treatment included use of antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal antibiotics, along with corticosteroids and antithrombotic drugs (in a few patients). The patients were remotely seen by Zhong Nanshan, the lead specialist during SARS in 2003. Nanshan said the patients had interstitial pneumonia (primarily of viral origin) and invasive aspergillosis (secondary). He also ordered SARS antibody testing for the latter of the four cases (as two patients had died). The miners had IgG antibodies. What do you think happened at the Wuhan lab? The Wuhan Institute of Virology was studying bat faeces drawn from mineshafts. They found a SARS-like beta coronavirus — Ra4991 (perhaps the ‘ra’ later in RaTG13) — from the same mineshaft where the miners had been sickened after sampling in 2013. The lab has denied any work on SARS-CoV-2 before 2019. But there are high chances of modification of the virus inside the lab. Based on facts in our paper, there is a strong likelihood the modified virus leaked from the lab and that has been our point of investigation from day one. How did the outbreak happen in Wuhan and not at the mineshaft where six miners were infected with symptoms similar to Covid-19? Do you think WIV's admission that the Mojiang miners had severe respiratory illness was a breakthrough? In an addendum to the 2020 paper explaining SARS-CoV-2 and its effects, the WIV states the Mojiang miners had severe respiratory disease. The lab also admits it collected a sample, which they renamed RaTG13, from the same mineshaft. This is the first written evidence in which WIV admits it collected a virus or a sample — till now the closest neighbour of SARS-CoV-2 — from a mineshaft in China. And that the same mineshaft was the reason why the miners, or the people working to clean the mine, took ill. This revelation came after the publication of our research. How did you get in touch with ‘The Seeker’, currently among anonymous analysts investigating Covid origins? ‘The Seeker’ got in touch with us the same day our preprint appeared online. This internet user said we had some interesting findings. ‘The Seeker’ then asked us to join a small band of four to five scientists who had been investigating the origins of the virus. And this is how we went on to become a part of DRASTIC, a global collaboration that's trying to determine where SARS-CoV-2 may have come from. What are key questions DRASTIC now has? The miners’ samples were sent for SARS testing to WIV, the same institute that conducted surveillance of bat coronaviruses in the Mojiang mineshaft. The link with SARS-like CoV (4991/RaTG13) from the mine site that reported lethal pneumonia cases was not discussed in papers by the WIV before February last year. We want to know what kind of samples the WIV received from the Mojiang miners and if these samples are still stored there. If the samples are there, are they available for study by other researchers? They have avoided sharing any details of the miners’ illness, which were documented only by later papers and these references could have been cited in Zhou’s 2020 paper. What steps do you recommend the WHO probe take?  The ‘Covid-19 origins investigation’ must follow the highest standards of data-driven, peer-reviewed science.

---||Delhi||Delhi: No nod from Centre, so LG ‘stops’ ration doorstep delivery||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government’s scheme for doorstep delivery of ration has triggered another confrontation between the Centre and the AAP government after the lieutenant governor once again “stopped” the scheme, which was ready for an immediate rollout. The scheme would have benefited more than 72 lakh people (17 lakh ration card holders). Delhi’s food minister Imran Hussain said the LG raised two concerns – the scheme hasn’t been approved by the central government and that it’s the subject of an ongoing court case — to reject it. “No approval for launching such a scheme is required as per existing law,” Hussain said in a statement. Sources in the LG’s office, however, said the “LG has not rejected the scheme as is being portrayed” and has advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit with the sole aim of ensuring smooth decisions and seamless benefits to people. The file for issuing a notification on home delivery of processed and packaged ration, proposed to be implemented through a private agency, has been returned for reconsideration to the CM by the LG, said the sources.  “It has been advised again, like earlier on March 20, 2018 that since the proposal seeks to change the method of distribution, it would mandatorily require prior approval of the central government as per Section 12 (2) (h) of the National Food Security Act 2013,” said the sources. The LG has also brought to the notice of the AAP government that a writ petition has been filed by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh in the high court challenging the scheme. In March, the Centre had objected to the name of the scheme, ‘Mukhymantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna’. After accepting all suggestions of the central government, the Delhi government sent the file for final approval and immediate rollout of the scheme to the LG on May 24. On June 2, the LG returned the file, saying the scheme cannot be implemented. According to sources, since March 2018, when the scheme was conceived, the AAP government has written at least six letters to the Centre informing it about the scheme. “The Centre had never objected to the revolutionary scheme. It had made just one observation on the nomenclature of the scheme, saying that the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana” could not be used since the ration was being distributed under the existing NFS Act.  In order to prevent any controversy, the Delhi cabinet passed a decision to remove the name and implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFS Act, 2013. After addressing all the queries raised by the central government, it was decided to launch the modified scheme soon,” said AAP government sources. This scheme, which seeks to deliver packed ration at the doorstep of the beneficiaries, has been a subject of multiple confrontations between the AAP government and the LG. In June 2018, it was one of the reasons behind CM Arvind Kejriwal and his ministers sitting on a dharna for nine days inside the LG’s office but the issue remained unresolved. The AAP government continued making efforts to launch the scheme but to no avail. The Delhi govt floated a tender in January this year to engage flour mills for processing of wheat for distribution under the scheme and in February, the Centre raised objections on the nomenclature. The food minister rejected the argument of an ongoing court case made by the LG’s office. “There have already been two hearings in this case and no stay has been ordered by the court. Moreover, the central government is a party to the same case, and in their affidavit too, they haven’t objected to a rollout of the scheme. The fact that the LG is citing this case to stop rollout of this revolutionary scheme makes it clear that the decision is politically motivated,” said Hussain. The AAP government says doorstep delivery of ration can address the problems that mar distribution, including corruption, poor quality of foodgrains, black marketing of food articles, etc. The Delhi government had officially communicated to the central government that it will be rolling out the scheme along with biometrics and Aadhaar verification of the ration card users. AAP government sources said the scheme would have been a boon for the poor during Covid as it would do away with the need to travel to fair price shops. The AAP government said Andhra Pradesh, too, had adopted a last-mile delivery system in both urban and rural segments and Haryana has also started a similar scheme through mobile vans. A pilot of this project has been started in Faridabad and the Haryana government is also distributing fortified wheat in Ambala and Karnal.

---||India||Ecology & economy can go together: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Saturday said both economy and ecology can go together and this is the path India has chosen to set an example to the world through its multiple actions. Speaking on the occasion of World Environment Day, the PM said it is not necessary to stop development for protecting the environment and that India had adopted both "hard and soft" approaches to protect environment and face the challenges of climate change. During the virtual address to Union ministers, Modi also recalled how the country took lead in setting up global bodies such as International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure (CDRI) as part of its efforts to fight the menace of climate change. Underlining that India is a strong proponent of climate justice and is moving ahead with a goal for realising the vision of "One Sun, One World, One Grid", he said India is among the top 10 countries of the world in the Climate Change Performance Index, and the country is fully aware of the challenges that were being faced due to climate change. Referring to the "hard approach" being adopted by India to fight climate change, the PM flagged that the country's capacity for renewable energy has increased by more than 250% in the last 6-7 years. He said India is currently among the top five countries of the world in terms of installed renewable energy capacity, especially the capacity of solar energy which has increased by about 15 times in the last 6 years. On "soft approach", he referred to steps taken by common man who have joined and been leading the pro-environment campaign like avoiding single use plastic, beach cleaning and 'Swachh Bharat' (clean India).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ecology-economy-can-go-together-pm-modi/articleshow/83271570.cms||---

Simultaneous surprise raids were conducted on seven out of the eight central jails across the state. It was again the Beur central jail in Patna from where all the cellphones and chargers besides a sim card, a memory card, five cigarettes, chewing tobacco and four grams of ganja were recovered. Apart from Beur jail, 125 packets of chewing tobacco were recovered from Shahid Khudiram Bose Central jail in Muzaffarpur, one pen drive from central jail in Motihari and one pipe (chilam) from central jail in Gaya. IG (prisons and correctional services) Mithilesh Mishra, in a statement, said action was being taken against those prisons staff who were responsible for the entry of these prohibited items inside the prisons’ premises. "FIRs are being lodged against those inmates from whom the prohibited items were recovered during the raids," he said. “Warder Arjun Kumar Malakar has been suspended for dereliction of duty and negligence for the recoveries," an officer said. Meanwhile, prison sources said two cellphones and a charger were recovered from a bag kept abandoned in the balcony of Godawari block of the Beur jail. “Later, more cellphones and chargers were recovered from the Yamuna block. Warder Neeraj Kumar Singh has been suspended after the recoveries," he said, adding that shift in-charge Uday Singh has been served show-cause notice. At least four coordinated raids have been conducted on prisons across the state since March this year. Three cellphones and chargers were dug out from the soil inside Beur jail premises on April 8. Altogether 88 cellphones, 46 chargers, nine batteries, three sim cards, two memory cards, one pen drive and other prohibited items were recovered from 29 out of 59 prisons across the state from April 7 to 9. Deep search metal detectors were used during the raids that time to recover anything buried in the soil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cellphones-found-in-beur-jail/articleshow/83266286.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Former minister and SAD spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said it was shocking that the government had failed to release the SC post matric scholarship to private institutions since the last three financial years due to which there was a huge backlog. “Now the very future of SC students has been threatened, with the Joint Association of Colleges(JAC) stating it will withhold the roll numbers of SC students in protest against the non-disbursal of the scholarship to the institutions,” he said. The Akali leader said that the Congress government in Punjab has failed to release one rupee from the Rs 2,440 crore budgetary provisions made for the SC scholarship scheme for the last three years. “This is not all. There has been large scale bungling in the SC scholarship disbursal with former social welfare department principal secretary accusing its minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot of misappropriating Rs 64 crore. Chief minister Amarinder Singh shielded the corrupt minister which has led to the present situation he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-slams-pb-govt-for-not-releasing-rs-1549cr-scholarship/articleshow/83268076.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Visakhapatnam||Covid-19: East Godavari posts highest positivity, lowest mortality rates in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has accumulated 17.38 lakh Covid-19 cases as of June 4, Friday. The average case positivity rate of the state stood at 8.86%. With 2.35 lakh cumulative infections, East Godavari continues to top the charts. The south-coastal district does not only top the state in terms of aggregate caseload, but also for case positivity rate. The Godavari district recorded a 13.3% positivity rate, the highest among all districts. Yet the same district has the lowest case mortality rate (0.42%) compared to other districts of the state. Another major disease cluster, Chittoor, reported a case positivity rate of 11.2%. Kadapa has the lowest case positivity rate of 7.2%. When it comes to mortality rate, Krishna (1.09%) is the only district to have a more than 1% fatality rate. Srikakulam recorded 0.54% deaths among all positive cases. East Godavari was the first district in the state to cross the one lakh Covid-19 case mark in October last year, and it consequently became the only district to reach the grim two-lakh case milestone on May 22. East Godavari, the most populous district of the state, registered its first Covid-19 case on March 21 last year when a youth who returned from London was diagnosed with the disease. The south-coastal Andhra Pradesh district reported an around 1,800% increase in Covid-19 cases in July last year, topping the country in terms of percentage of increase in cases. Even during the ongoing second wave, it was one of the 10 districts in the country showing an exponential growth in terms of daily cases for several days in May. In the initial weeks of the outbreak, both in the first and second waves, Kakinada and Rajahmundry rural and urban mandals used to contribute as much as between 80-90% cases. But rural parts of the district have been adding more cases to the table in the recent weeks. Andhra Pradesh conducted 1,96,19,590 Covid-19 tests as of May 4. Tests per million population in Andhra Pradesh number at 3,67,408 as against the all-India average of 2,57,703. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal said that Andhra Pradesh is showing a consistent improvement in daily infections and positivity rate. “More than 9,800 oxygen and ICU beds are available for patients in the state as of Saturday afternoon. As the daily infections are reducing, the Covid care centres currently have only 12,247 patients,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/eg-posts-highest-positivity-lowest-mortality-rates-in-ap/articleshow/83266984.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Patna||Intensity of third Covid wave to depend on rate of vaccination, say Bihar experts||PATNA: Will the much-talked-about third Covid-19 wave be stronger than the second one or will it be milder than the previous two waves? Health experts of the state have varying opinions on the issue. Though the experts agreed that the third wave would certainly hit the state in November or December, they differed on its severity. While some felt that it is likely to be more intense, others observed that it would be a milder one as compared to the deadly second wave. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said the intensity of the third wave would depend on the rate of vaccination. “With less than 3% of the country’s population having been fully vaccinated till date, the danger of the third wave would persist unless the vaccination drive is implemented aggressively both in rural and urban areas. The regulations on import of effective vaccines available in the international market must be made simpler and the job of vaccination should be handed over to both the private and public sectors,” he said. Dr Shah added lockdowns can minimise the spread of infections for a while only. “As a large section of adults and children are still to be vaccinated, they are non-immune and can easily contract infections in the third wave. The third wave may bring more miseries and deaths if people are attacked with mutant variants with greater infectivity and higher virulence,” he added. Former superintendent of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said it is good that necessary preparations for protection against the third wave have already started, but people need not panic over its consequences. “Some countries like Japan have already witnessed three to four waves. However, nowhere it has been found that only children have been hit,” he added. Dr Prasad said mostly every fresh wave is supposed to be weaker than the previous one (except in case of the second wave in India). “The virus, when it emerges, has a relatively free run, considering that the entire population is susceptible. During its subsequent runs, there would be a far lower number of susceptible people because some of them would have gained immunity. Moreover, more and more people are getting vaccinated and search for a vaccine for children is already on,” he added. Principal of Govt Ayurvedic College-Patna, Dr Dineshwar Prasad, said the third wave would have weaker intensity as compared to the second wave. “Children have got a relatively higher immunity level and, hence, they have lower chances of serious infection. But, as they have remained confined to their homes for more than a year, their immunity level has somehow weakened. A nationwide campaign should be launched to boost children’s immunity and save them from any kind of infection,” he said. Patna University biotechnology teacher Birendra Prasad said as the virus needs some hosts, children would be the most easily found hosts in the third wave. “Children would be more susceptible if they are not vaccinated properly during the next six to eight months. A lot would, however, depend on how people heed the warnings being made by health experts. The second wave has taught us that it is far better to remain cautious and alert for the imminent third wave and get all family members, particularly the youths, vaccinated at the earliest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/intensity-of-3rd-covid-wave-to-depend-on-rate-of-vaccination/articleshow/83266459.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Patna doctors caution against unwise use of antibiotics||PATNA: Even as the Covid cases are declining with every passing day, doctors and health experts in the city have cautioned people against prolonged intake of antibiotics. They claimed that such practice can lead to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance occurs upon prolonged and injudicious use of antibiotics, which makes patients vulnerable to even simple infections. With quacks blindly prescribing antibiotics, unverified suggestions on WhatsApp and distribution of drugs without genuine prescription, the danger of antibiotic resistance is serious amid the pandemic. Acting president of Bihar chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr Ajay Kumar, said antibiotics, being scheduled drugs, should be strictly prohibited for over the counter sales. “Most patients, who come to us with Covid-related complaints, had already taken some antibiotics. They do it as a precautionary measure without knowing its consequences,” he said. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, AIIMS-Patna nodal officer in-charge for Covid-19, said prolonged, unnecessary or even sub-optimal (less than required) dosage can lead to antibiotic resistance against the specific pathogen. “Last year, we came across the ‘DelhiBug’ or ‘SuperBug’ gene (clinical name blaNDM-1), which makes bacteria resistant to carbapenems, which are highest grade antibiotics or the last resort,” he said. “Such highly resistant genes develop especially in pathogens which are inside the ICU patients who are given high dosage of multiple antibiotics. In prolonged cases, patients get immuno-compromised and succumb to the decease. Similar cases have been noted with abuse of antifungal drugs,” he said. Dr Vivek Kumar, ENT specialist at PMCH, said: “Antibiotic, as the name suggests, is ‘against the biology of the body’. In most cases, simpler diseases can be treated without antibiotics. Diseases like flu, cold and sore throat are all viral. Even Covid-19 is a viral decease, theoretically and practically. Antibiotics have no role in its management. Antibiotics should be indicated as treatment for secondary infections only and not as a safety blanket.” Dr Chandan Choudhary, a gastromedicine resident doctor at IGIMS, said one should only take advice from qualified medical professionals and not self-proclaimed ones. “It can worsen the disease and even make it fatal. Leaving gaps in the full course of a medicine should also be avoided,” he advised. He clarifies what common people get wrong. “It’s actually the microbe which gets resistant to the drug and not our body itself,” he added. In case of antibiotic resistance, doctors go for antibiotic sensitivity test, that shows which group of antibiotics is resistant and which is sensitive to the particular pathogen that has caused the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-caution-against-unwise-use-of-antibiotics/articleshow/83266487.cms||---

Samir Baran Basu is now fighting for his life at SSKM Hospital with severe clotting of blood on the left side of his brain. The man’s son has lodged a complaint with the police alleging that the civic volunteer demanded Rs 500 from his father for letting him go and, when denied, slapped and beat him up with a baton. Cops have arrested Surajit Dey on charges of attempt to murder, grievous assault and extortion. “We have arrested the accused and taken statements from the victim and locals who witnessed the incident. We are also checking the CCTV footage from the area,” said Md Sana Akhtar, deputy commissioner (central), Howrah City Police. According to family members, Basu was prescribed regular morning or evening walks by his doctor. “He avoided morning walks since there were many others on the road. Instead, he went out in the evenings and maintained all Covid precautions,” said Prasenjit Sarkar, Basu’s nephew. Locals and shopkeepers said Dey (28) was notorious for extorting money against “lockdown violation”. An officer said Basu was not at fault and promised action against Dey if the allegations were proved. Dey has denied the allegation of extortion, saying Basu abused him and he lost his cool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/68-yr-old-howrah-man-out-on-evening-walk-assaulted-by-civic-volunteer/articleshow/83267318.cms||Rupak Banerjee

They also talked about the importance of protecting the wetlands or areas that are inundated with water permanently or seasonally. Environment, forest and climate change minister, Neeraj Kumar Singh, who was the chief guest of the webinar, said the state government had taken several strict measures for conservation of the environment. “Bihar will be successful in reducing its carbon footprint in the next 20 years,” he claimed. Noted environmentalist, Anil Prakash Joshi, urged the people of Bihar to “adopt old-age traditions that were helpful in conserving the environment”. “Festivals like Chhath, Sarhul and Karma celebrated in different parts of the country are closely associated with nature,” he said. Joshi also called the people living in nearly 6 lakh villages of the country “true soldiers protecting nature”. Dr R K Sinha, the vice-chancellor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University in Jammu and Kashmir, pointed out that every drop of water was part of the ecosystem. Lamenting that many wetlands had vanished during the last four decades, he laid emphasis on growing specific varieties of plants in the state. Echoing similar views, the vice-president of Wetlands International, Ajit Patnayak, said, “The world has lost nearly 50% of its wetlands. Hence, the need of the hour is to take steps for their conservation.” Deepak Kumar Singh, the principal secretary of the department of environment, forest and climate change, pointed out that damage to the ecosystem was irreparable. Earlier, the chairman of the BSPCB, A K Ghosh, welcomed the participants and its member secretary, S Chandrasekhar, addressed them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-lay-emphasis-on-ecosystem-conservation/articleshow/83266554.cms||VK Tripathi

The New Town Kolkata Development authority has invited applications, according to which it will provide space to co-operatives facing space crunch. The NKDA can provide space at New Town Business Club, community markets or offices. “The RWAs and co-operatives can email us and the space will be provided on first-come-first-served basis depending on compliance with government norms,” said an NKDA official. Earlier this week, New Town Forum and News, an NGO, vaccinated 1,000 residents in a two-day camp. Several housing complexes, like Elita Garden Vista and DLF, which have their own space, have also held vaccination camps for their residents. “But there are several smaller societies which do not have space to ensure social distancing. They can approach us if they want to organize vaccination camps,” the official said. However, NKDA will only provide the space. RWAs will have to get the vaccines and arrange logistics themselves. “In the coming days, we will be vaccinating more than 10,000 people,” said Samaresh Das, chairman of New Town Forum and News.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-to-help-complexes-with-vax-space/articleshow/83267315.cms||Zeeshan Javed

On an average, said Lalbazar sources, 15-20 personnel still remain in hospitals daily. What has surprised officers at Lalbazar is the fact that among those needing hospitalization is a section which have been vaccinated twice, along with those who have been vaccinated once. There are a few who could be vaccinated due to several illnesses including allergies. The latest worry is a senior officer at Lalbazar who heads an important unit of Kolkata police. Sources said he has been detected with Covid for the second time now. He has been vaccinated twice. The senior officer had been interacting with a lot of stakeholders since May 24 in a crucial bank fraud case besides investigating a kidnapping-cum-extortion case. “He is stable and recovering,” said an officer of the welfare cell which is handling all Covid-related issues within the force. Recently, an 82-year-old, who had received both his vaccination doses, died of Covid. “There have been a few such cases, though rare, of people dying even after the second dose. This could happen due to a variety of reasons. We must remember that a vaccine takes time to turn effective. The reasons are being investigated even in Kolkata,” said an internal medicine consultant. The cops, though, said that doctors have told them not to worry, reinstating that none of those admitted at the hospital is serious. “They have explained that if one contracts Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated, it is known as a breakthrough infection. This indicates that an individual has had a lower immune response from the vaccine. However, such infections are mostly mild or asymptomatic,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cases-needing-hosp-care-keep-cops-worried/articleshow/83266592.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

While reviewing the implementation of both the pro-people laws, Nitish asked the officials to disseminate information about the two laws among the maximum number of people through ‘Lok Chaupal’ and other mediums of publicity, so that they could take benefit of these legislations. The RTPGR Act was launched by Nitish in Bihar on June 5, 2016. "Our main aim is to redress the grievances of maximum number of people and minimize tension and disputes in the society. Peace will prevail in the society if the number of disputes get reduced," Nitish told the officers. The CM further asked the officers to ensure that peoples’ grievances were redressed within stipulated time frame and subsequent appeals were also disposed of on time. While reviewing the implementation of the RTPS Act, which was implemented on August 15, 2011, the CM said hundreds of service centres were opened at district, subdivision and block levels to issue different types of certificates within the stipulated period. "Earlier, people had to spend more time and money in getting documents like income and caste certificates. With the implementation of the RTPS Act, these works became easier," he said. The CM also said property and land disputes are the prime reasons behind more than 80% cases of crime in the state. "Issues related to land, electricity bill, maintenance of roads and bridges and certain other matters have been brought under the purview of the RTPGR Act.

A study carried out across 16 centres in India, including four hospitals of Gujarat, during the Diwali surge between September and December 2020 recorded a high mortality of 46% by three months of treatment. The study titled ‘Multicentre Epidemiologic Study of Coronavirus Disease-Associated Mucormycosis, India’ was published recently in the prestigious Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) journal. The study of 287 MM patients was carried out across 16 centres in India, including three hospitals in Ahmedabad and one in Surat. AIIMS New Delhi and Bhopal, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi, Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon and KDAH in Mumbai were among other centres. Read AlsoMaharashtra to treat ‘black fungus’ cases free, may cap med costWith a spurt in mucormycosis or the deadly ‘black fungus’ among patients recovering from Covid, public health minister Rajesh Tope said it will be treated for free under the state’s medical insurance scheme, and offered hope about capping the price of the expensive antifungal medicines. A singleOut of 287 patients, 187 (65%) were identified as having Covid-associated MM (CAM). Prevalence was found to be 0.3% among the total Covid-19 patients at these centres. Study pegged MM cases recorded a two-fold rise compared to the same period in 2019 – from 112 to 231. Mean age of the patients was found to be 53 years; men accounted for 75% of the patients. Diabetes was found to be one of the most common comorbidities in 33% or one-third of patients. Moreover, 21% of the patients reported newly-acquired diabetes after Covid infection. Read AlsoBlack fungus complication adds to India's Covid woes: All you need to knowThe government has told doctors to look out for signs of mucormycosis or 'black fungus' in Covid-19 patients as hospitals report a rise in cases of the rare but potentially fatal infection.“Fatality rate among the patients was found to be 38% in six weeks, which increased to 46% by 12 weeks or three months of treatment. It was found to be the same in non-CAM and CAM patients. Major factors for mortality are found to be age, rhino-orbital cerebral involvement and prolonged ICU stay,” said Dr Atul Patel, infectious diseases specialist and a co-author of the study. He said that another study on MM in Covid-19 patients is under way at more centres across India to study black fungus epidemic during the second wave. “We aim to find out how much steroids could trigger MM in patients. More importantly, we want to understand the role of Covid-19 severity in MM,” said Dr Patel. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Surabhi Madan, another co-authors of the study, underscored three differences between the existing wave and the study period spanning pre and post Diwali surge. “During the current wave, the number of cases is much higher. More significantly, we saw many young patients who had no existing diabetes or comorbidities, and only a history of home-based steroid treatment,” she said. “Unlike the last surge when Ahmedabad and Mumbai had relatively higher cases, there is no geographic limitation as almost all centres in India have reported MM.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mucormycosis-recorded-46-mortality-in-post-diwali-surge-study/articleshow/83267910.cms||Parth Shastri

A first information report (FIR) under stringent sections was filed the same day and the prime accused was arrested. The incident has been reported from Nathupura village under Kotwali police station jurisdiction, where a 25-year-old SC woman, Savita Devi Ahirwar, was elected as gram pradhan in the recently concluded panchayat polls. According to reports, she was holding a meeting with officials in the Panchayat Bhawan on Wednesday in the presence of assistant development officer (ADO) Panchayat and block development officer (BDO) when a few influential persons of the village, including one Ramu Rajpoot, reached there and started abusing her. Talking to TOI on Saturday, Savita alleged, “I was having my first meeting with the officials when Ramu, Rupendra, Arjun, Ravindra and six unknown persons entered the room. Moments before the accused entered the room, I was engaged in an online conversation with DM Mahoba, Satyendra Kumar.” “Ramu soon started bullying me and asked me to follow his instructions instead of raising the problems of the villagers. When I refused to oblige, Ramu grabbed me by my hand and started using a casteist slur against me. He then forced me to leave the chair and sit on the floor,” Savita alleged. However, in the FIR lodged by Savita, it is only mentioned that she was forced to leave her chair by the accused, who grabbed her by her hand and hurled casteist abuses. As per additional SP Mahoba, RK Gautam, a case has been lodged against Ramu Rajpoot and his associates under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of IPC and section 3 of SC/ST Act. “We have arrested the key accused, Ramu, and sent him to jail. Police are trying to arrest the other accused. I have asked the CO City to investigate the matter in detail and submit a report,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/woman-sc-pradhan-in-mahoba-alleges-harassment-at-meet-prime-accused-held/articleshow/83266473.cms||---

Railways has already announced to ensure ‘zero carbon emission’ by 2030, creating one of the largest green railways in the world. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, four out of the five divisions have been completely electrified while efforts are on to complete pending electrification work in Samastipur division. “In fact, 87% electrification work has been completed in the ECR zone so far. A total of 3640 route km tracks out of 4220 km in the ECR have been electrified,” he said. Besides, railways has introduced HOG operations in about 58 LHB hauled mail and express trains in the ECR to save energy consumption. Rajendra Nagar Terminal-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, Rajendra Nagar Terminal-New Delhi Sampoorna Kranti Express, Saharsa-New Delhi Vaishali Express, Saharsa-Patna Janhit Express, Gaya-New Delhi Mahabodhi Express and several other long-distance passenger trains have been provided with the HOG facilities to save energy. “Rajendra Nagar Terminal has been declared ‘green station’ of the Railways while Rajendra Nagar Coaching Complex has been given ISO certificate 9001-14001 for its environment-friendly approach. Danapur, Bettiah, Sugauli, Raxaul, Narkatiaganj and Bapudham Motihari are the other stations under the ECR have been declared ‘green’ for maintaining eco-friendly services to passengers,” he said.

---||Patna||JD(U) again raises demand for special status to Bihar||PATNA: JD(U), an ally of BJP, on Saturday once again raised the issue of according special status to Bihar and urged the Centre to deliver justice to the people of the state by fulfilling their long-pending demand. JD(U) parliamentary board chairperson and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha said the state’s ranking in the SDG India Index report released by Niti Aayog recently is a case in point. He said the state’s performance was not on par with many other states. “Nitish Kumar is maintaining the pace of development despite natural calamity faced by the people and a lion’s share of natural resources going to Jharkhand after partition of Bihar,” Kushwaha said. Reacting to ruling JD(U)’s demand, state Congress media cell in-charge Rajesh Rathore said, “I would like to know from CM Nitish Kumar as to when he is going to give ultimatum to the central government on the special status issue.” Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav also trained guns at the Nitish-led NDA government and accused it of failing to address the rising problem of unemployment in the state. Citing media reports, Tejashwi tweeted, “Bihar has become the main centre of unemployment. Moreover, 78% of them are graduates and postgraduates. The NDA government has been working on one-point agenda, i.e adding more unemployed in the last 16 years.” Maintaining that the situation has worsened due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the former deputy CM said around 1.35 lakh people were rendered jobless in May alone. In addition, Bihar recorded 13.8% unemployment rate compared to the national 11.9%, he claimed. Recalling the promises made by BJP before the state assembly polls to generate 19 lakh jobs, Tejashwi alleged that the issue had been thrown into the dustbin. The RJD leader also shared a few newspaper clippings on his Twitter handle to substantiate his statement. JD(U), however, rubbished the allegations. JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Tejashwi has virtually no issues to attack the NDA government. “That’s why he is making baseless and frivolous allegations,” he added. The JD(U) MLC said the government was serious about generating jobs. “Not only vacancies in different government departments have been advertised, but the recruitment process has also been started,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-again-raises-demand-for-special-status-to-bihar/articleshow/83267057.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Realtors & landlords in Bihar hail new tenancy Act||PATNA: The real estate associations, housing societies and residents hailed the Centre’s Model Tenancy Act (MTA), which was approved recently. The Act aims at overhauling the legal framework for rental properties in the country to address a massive housing shortage. Sachin Chandra, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI)-Bihar, said the most important point in the MTA was that no person can let out or take on rent any premises without the agreement. “So, everything will be in black and white. The advance payment is pre-defined in this Act and tenants will have to submit a security deposit of maximum two months’ rent for residential premises and six months’ rent for commercial property,” he said. “Now the rent court will define the relationship between landowner and tenant and resolve the issues in time-bound manner,” he said. CREDAI’s national vice-president Narendra Kumar said once the Act is enforced, rent will become cheaper because more people will start letting out their houses and property. “Earlier, people were scared of renting out their property due to litigations. The investment in this sector will also increase,” he said. Manish Kumar, chairman of Builders Association of India (Patna centre), said the predefined Act will help both the landlord and the tenants. “The rent court would resolve or dispose of the cases in short time as there are many pending cases in civil court of dispute over the rental issues,” he said. Ragini Kumari (34), who owns a property in Ashiana Colony, said she never rented out her house fearing that any unruly tenant would never evict. “Earlier, I had rented out my home but the tenant failed to pay the rent on time. It would be good if the state enforces the new Act as it may bring transparency in the whole rental process,” she said. Prince Raj, who is preparing for UPSC civil services examinations, said he had changed four flats in the last two and a half years due to insecurities. The new Act would create a vibrant, sustainable and inclusive rental housing market, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/realtors-landlords-hail-new-tenancy-law/articleshow/83267035.cms||Faryal Rumi

The lockdown is likely to end on June 8. When contacted, he said the people were fed up with the NDA rule in the state. “Several MLAs of the ruling coalition were in a mood to switch sides,” he asserted. The internal conflict in the two main coalition partners -- BJP and JD(U) -- has added fuel to the fire, the Maner MLA said, adding that people have lost faith in the government. He further said that RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari recently quoted former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s statement, which was an indication towards “bechaini” among the NDA partners in the state. The ruling coalition, however, dismissed the RJD’s claim. JD(U) spokesperson Nikhil Mandal said the dreams of the opposition leaders would not be fulfilled by spreading canards against the government. “They should stop daydreaming,” he said. JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar took a dig at the RJD leaders, who predicted turmoil in state politics after Lalu’s visit to the state. “Lalu’s oxgen level dipped during virtual meeting with RJD functionaries, but his Twitter level has increased after being granted bail in the fodder scam case,” he added. BJP's OBC cell national general secretary Nikhil Anand also dismissed the RJD’s claim. “The opposition is trying to create confusion among the ruling coalition partners, but they will not succeed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-to-visit-bihar-after-end-of-lockdown-rjd-mla/articleshow/83267067.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Bihar: Ganja worth Rs 1.2 crore seized from oil tanker in Begusarai||PATNA: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) intercepted a petroleum oil tanker at Bachhawara in Begusarai on Saturday and recovered more than 1.2 tonnes of ganja, worth around Rs 1.2 crore in the domestic market. The consignment was hidden inside the storage compartment. Tanker driver Rajkumar Yadav and co-driver Kallu Sahni were arrested. Yadav belongs to Jagdishpur under Raghopur police station area in Vaishali and Sahni hails from Karmalichak Devisthan under Bypass police station area in Patna. NCB authorities in Lucknow had received input about the consignment and shared it with their Patna counterparts. NCB suspects a big smuggling racket as they had procured a private oil tanker plying for a government oil firm. The tanker has a GPS device to monitor its movement. This is the second major seizure by NCB in the state in the last 36 hours. Earlier, it seized 710 grams of brown sugar and arrested three drug smugglers in Patna on Friday. Two pistols and four live cartridges were recovered from their possession. NCB zonal director (Bihar-Jharkhand) Kumar Manish said the ganja consignment was loaded in Tripura. It was to be unloaded in the riverine belt between Patna and Vaishali. “The driver had a new cellphone with a fresh sim card with very specific and limited information for transporting the contraband. Hardly four to five calls were made on it. He was promised a hefty amount after consignment delivery,” Manish said, adding further investigation is on to trace the suppliers and receivers. “To avoid suspicion, he was directed to reach Begusarai first via Barauni where an oil refinery is there. He was to be given further direction. Incidentally, when the NCB intercepted the tanker, the driver was talking to one of the drug smugglers. The vehicle movement was probably tracked by drug smugglers via the GPS device. Such devices are generally fitted in all oil and gas tankers,” he said. Manish said the ganja packets were inserted inside the tank using hatches meant for filling petroleum oil. “During interrogation, the driver said it was for the first time that he was involved in drug smuggling. He also said the vehicle owner did not know about ganja smuggling,” he said. The director also said the tanker was bearing Assam’s registration number but it was taken to Tripura for picking up the consignment. “It needs to be ascertained if the registration number is fake or original,” he said. Manish said around six tonne ganja was seized last year in Bihar and Jharkhand together while 4.5 tonne ganja has been seized in Bihar alone in the last six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganja-worth-rs-1-2-crore-seized-from-oil-tanker-in-begusarai/articleshow/83266315.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Axed BJP MLC Tunna Ji Pandey invited to join the grand alliance||PATNA: A day after BJP suspended its MLC Tunna Ji Pandey for his controversial statement against chief minister Nitish Kumar, opposition Congress backed him saying he was speaking the truth. Congress Legislature Party leader Ajit Sharma not only criticised BJP for trying to suppress those who were raising their voice for the right cause, but also invited Pandey to join the grand alliance (GA) and work together for the benefit of Bihar. “What wrong has respected MLC Tunna Ji said. He called Nitish as the chief minister of circumstances and what is wrong in that,” asked Sharma, adding that Nitish’s JD (U) got less votes in the election and because of his opportunistic behaviour and circumstances he became the CM. Sharma said BJP was under pressure and accused PM Narendra Modi of uprooting all those who speak the truth in public interest. There is a speculation that Pandey may join RJD as his term as MLC ends this month. His younger brother Bachcha Pandey is an RJD MLA from Barhariya in Siwan. A day before his suspension, Pandey had met Osama Shahab, the son of former RJD MP and muscleman late Mohammad Shahabuddin, in Siwan. In fact, the very same day Pandey was served a show-cause notice after he held a press conference with RJD’s poll symbol lantern in the background. However, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan refused to speak on Pandey’s cosy relation with the party and his future plans. But Gagan appreciated Pandey for speaking the truth. "He has rightly pointed towards CM Nitish’s true nature and his greed for power. Everyone knows that Nitish is intolerant towards all those who speak against him, even if they speak the truth," he said. Congress demands ECMO machines: Congress Legislature Party Leader Ajit Sharma on Saturday wrote a letter to CM Nitish Kumar demanding ECMO machines in all the Sadar hospitals and government medical college and hospitals. Sharma said this machine is used for patients with severe lung damages casused by Covid-19, but Bihar hospitals lacked it. A day before, state Congress leaders had submitted a memorandum addressed to the President at the Raj Bhavan demanding one crore vaccination in a day across the country and universal free vaccines to all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-invites-suspended-bjp-mlc-to-join-ga/articleshow/83266327.cms||Sheezan Nezami

As a major part of the former MP’s stint was overshadowed by the Covid-19 pandemic which took a toll on the temple’s revenue and pilgrim footfall, he is likely to get an extension, sources say. Reddy took over as the temple body’s chairman on June 22, 2019 — a few days after Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy was sworn in as the chief minister. Three months later, the state government formed a 37-member trust board, including nominated trustees and special invitees, to manage the affairs of the TTD. During the first wave of the pandemic last year, the Lord Venkateswara temple was closed down for pilgrim worship for nearly three months starting March 20 owing to the nationwide lockdown. Nearly 60 odd temples run by the TTD across the country were also closed down, and gradually reopened June 2020 onwards as the lockdown norms were eased. With its expenditure running into thousands of crores and revenues hitting rock bottom due to the prolonged Covid-19 restrictions in place, the current trust board, whose tenure ends in a fortnight’s time, has had to weather perhaps the worst phase in the ancient temple’s history. And any normalcy in the pandemic situation still seems a long way off. Sources said the chief minister will take a call on extending the trust board’s tenure within the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/will-ttd-trust-board-get-a-tenure-extension/articleshow/83267021.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Theatres, water parks stare at uncertain future as second wave dashes hopes||PRAYAGRAJ: The Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the economy, which was showing signs of recovery before the devastating second wave of the novel coronavirus. One of the industries among many to face the brunt of this pandemic is the entertainment industry. Given the near-complete shutdown of the cinema halls for months together, multiplexes or for that matter amenities like the water parks of the city have suffered enormous losses because of which many are contemplating closing down their businesses permanently. If the cinema owners of the city including single screen and multiplexes are to be believed, the income generated from this industry in the district alone is in crores. Along with the income of the cinema owners, the tax revenue to the government from this industry, in the form of entertainment tax, is also in crores. According to a rough estimate, the loss to the government exchequer in terms of the tax that could have been collected by the entertainment department in the last 14 months is around Rs 25 crores. The highest-earning month by the cinema halls and the other entertainment facilities like water park is considered to be from the last week of March to June. This is the time that people flock to theatres because of children’s holidays because of the summer vacations. Last year too, because of the first wave of the novel coronavirus, people had to stay indoors after the countrywide lockdown, thereby resulting in loss to the industry. Even though the different phases of unlocking began from June 2020, theatres remained closed. Those in the entertainment industry are facing a similar situation this year too as the country continues to fight the second wave of the pandemic, which has caused a huge loss of lives and livelihoods. “Even if cinema halls are opened in the coming time, say by the end of this month, it will be opened only under certain restrictions like the last year. In such a situation, there is still no possibility of making up for the losses”, said the secretary of the Indian Cinema Exhibitors Federation, Ashutosh Aggarwal. This year, during March beginning, there was some relief when around 25-30 per cent of the income had started coming back. It was expected that more relief would come by April and May, but given the weekly closure in April due to the deadly second wave, following which more restrictions were put in place to check the surge in cases, theatres remained closed and now the problem remains, he added. Likewise, there are two water parks in and around the district, one at Sahason and another a few kilometres away from the civil enclave in Bamrauli. April, May and June are the months when most people visit these entertainment parks. However, because of the restrictions, these parks were not functional for even a single day in almost two years. At the same time, the swimming pools of the city were also completely closed. “The entertainment market has suffered a lot and the government is at loss too as because of the pandemic, the cinema halls are closed and hence the collection of tax is affected," said Assistant Entertainment Tax Commissioner, Arvind Verma. More importantly, many employees are directly or indirectly associated with this business of entertainment and they suffered a lot financially because of the pandemic, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/theatres-water-parks-stare-at-uncertain-future-as-2nd-wave-dashes-hopes/articleshow/83267257.cms||---

After inaugurating an Ayush garden in the coaching depot at Manduadih on the occasion of World Environment Day on Saturday, Panjiyar said, “All work including energy and water conservation in the division is being done for environment conservation in the division.” He added, “So far, 12 railway stations selected in the division are being developed as green stations, by seeking consent to operate from UP and Bihar pollution control boards, in order to check the water and air pollution as per the prescribed standards of National Green Tribunal.” Manduadih railway station has already been developed to the same standard and it has received 5S certification from Quality Circle Forum of India. Measures like water recycling plants and automatic coach washing plants installation at Manduadih and Chhapra coaching depots and bio-toilets in coaches are not only helping in checking wastage of water and disposal of 2.74 lakh liters of bio-waste between tracks but also improving sanitary conditions, he said. A total of 6,000 saplings had been planted in the last financial year and this practice will continue in the current financial year also. “The railway establishments and residential colonies show how the railway employees conserve the greenery by taking care of plants and trees after plantation,” he said adding, “green nurseries are also being developed on land strips available along railway tracks in Chhapra, Ballia, Mau and Ghazipur City stations. Pump automation is being done in division for water conservation.” Fast replacement of diesel locomotives by electric locos with the completion of electrification work, is also bringing down the pollution caused by diesel, goods shades are also being developed as per NGT norms. He also highlighted other measures like production of 33,441 units of solar power, rain water harvesting systems, digitalisation of offices and complete check on single use plastic initiated in the division. The division will hold a series of events for ecosystem restoration round the year. An Ayush garden with medicinal plants has also been set up, said additional DRM Praveen Kumar. The division also held on-line painting competitions while plantation events were also organised at Ghazipur, Mau, Sivan and other railway stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/12-stations-to-go-green-in-varanasi-div-of-ner/articleshow/83266844.cms||---

A committee headed by school education secretary will decide on the evaluation criteria to award marks to Class XII students and college admissions will be done based on those marks, the CM said. The decision comes three days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi cancelled CBSE Class XII board exams. Stalin also wrote a letter to the PM on Saturday urging him to cancel national-level entrance exams such as NEET as the “reasons stated for cancelling Class XII exams are applicable for entrance exams too”. “I am of the strong view that conducting national-level exams would be immensely detrimental to the health of students,” the CM said in his letter. “Our state may be allowed to fill all professional seats, including MBBS seats, on the basis of Class XII marks alone as we have always emphasized. I am sure that you would appreciate the fairness of my request and will act upon it favourably,” the CM said. The state government held discussions with parents, teachers, educationists, health experts and political parties over the past three days on conducting Class XII exams. During the legislature parties meeting held on Saturday, except five parties including the BJP, the PMK, the CPI and the CPM, other parties wanted board exams to be held. “Though there were mixed opinions on conducting the exam from various quarters, all of them wanted to ensure the safety of children. Covid-19 second wave was still raging in the state and health experts also predicted a third wave. However, the state government cannot vaccinate Class XII students as they are below 18 years,” Stalin said in his statement. Medical experts advised that If students who have not got vaccinated were asked to come at one place to write exams, it may lead to spreading of Covid-19, “the CM said. “Though the state government was still firm on its policy of conducting college admissions based on Class XII exam marks, doctors say postponing the exam further will affect the students mentally. Based on the medical advice and recommendations by others, the state government is cancelling Class XII state board exams,” Stalin said. The state government has formed a committee headed by school education secretary to decide on the evaluation criteria and award of marks for students. The committee will also include higher education secretary, Madras University vice-chancellor, and school headmasters. Based on the committee’s report, marks would be awarded and admissions to higher educational institutions would be based on these marks, Stalin said. “Though the decision to cancel the exams has been taken in view of students’ health and safety, the Tamil Nadu government will ensure that admissions to higher educational institutions are not affected,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-cancels-class-xii-exam-cm-asks-pm-to-scrap-neet/articleshow/83267331.cms||---

---||Patna||Two held for stealing drugs for black fungus treatment in Bihar||PATNA: Two pharmacists posted at Sadar hopistal in Madhubani were arrested late Friday night for allegedly stealing 20 vials of antifungal injection Liposomal Amphotericin-B meant for treatment of black fungus (mucormycosis) and selling them on the black market. A nurse is evading arrest in the case. The injection vials were donated to central government by World Health Organisation (WHO). They were kept in a refrigerator inside the drugstore of the hospital pharmacy. The vials were found missing on Friday after monthly reconciliation of the drugs left in storage. Town police station SHO Amit Kumar said pharmacists Jaiprakash Kumar and Bhrigunath Prasad were arrested and nurse Chandrakala Devi was absconding. Kumar said an FIR has been lodged against the trio by Sadar hospital deputy superintendent Devshankar Mishra. “He has mentioned that these vials were for treatment of patients suffering from kala-azar. However, police have come to know that the drug is also used for treatment of black fungus," Kumar said. Madhubani civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar Jha said each vial costs around Rs 7,000 in the open market. "The Centre supplied the vials to the state government after which altogether 230 vials were given to Madhubani in April last year. This drug was supplied for treatment of kala-azar, but is used for treatment of mucormycosis, which has been declared epidemic by the state government," he said. Jha said soon after the news flashed, 20 empty vials of the drug were found inside the refrigerator, instead of the sealed vials. “Both pharmacists have been suspended. The district health society has recommended action against data operator Mohan Kumar Jha, who used to work inside the pharmacy storeroom along with the two pharmacists and the nurse," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-held-for-stealing-drugs-for-black-fungus-treatment/articleshow/83266528.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Rise of robot cleaners amid virus fears — threefold surge in sales||AHMEDABAD: Dr Bharat Ghodadara, a senior doctor, got home a cleaning robot recently. Having divided the household cleaning responsibility between himself and his family, Ghodadara was determined not to hire his domestic help back to limit exposure to the deadly virus. “We were managing fine with help till the pandemic struck last year. The five months during and after the lockdown were taxing as we had to manage all the chores,” he said. “We had to do it in the interest of our safety. We don’t intend to employ anyone at home and increase our exposure. So we decided to bring home a cleaning robot, which does the job well.” The fear of contracting Covid-19 was perhaps more intense during the sinister second wave that clearly governed people’s purchase decisions. If dishwasher sales ruled the charts last year, cleaning robots are the stars this year. An increasing number of Amdavadis have bought cleaning robots that can sweep and mop homes squeaky clean. Three companies supplying cleaning robots saw an estimated three-fold surge in their monthly volumes in April and May, compared to last year driven by demand in Ahmedabad. “Inquiries have grown significantly since August last year. However, especially during and after the recent second wave, demand has increased three-fold,” Prathmesh Sharma, an Ahmedabad-based distributor of high-end electronics and home appliances said. “Against an estimated five units sold in a month, we have gone up to retailing some 15-20 units every month and more inquiries are coming in.” Sharma mentioned that increased awareness about availability and effectiveness of these products has made a lot of people buy them. With a surge in sales, dealers too are being flooded with inquiries. “We already have 10 inquiries as of now for cleaning robots and we’ve placed orders for procuring more stock,” said Bhavesh Waria, president, Ahmedabad Electronics Dealers’ Association (AEDA). “Last year, dishwashers sold like hot cakes. This year, the demand for cleaning robots has gone up,” Waria said. “That is because people now are concerned about their safety and are reluctant to encounter anyone not known to them.” The demand for wet vacuum cleaners has also gone up. “Earlier, people had to be persuaded to buy such products. However, the demand since the second wave has grown big time,” said a source. “Against 50 units retailed in a year before the pandemic, we clocked sales of at least 700 units in 2020-21. The momentum has grown during the second wave.” With the risk being high, people are more inclined to choose robots and devices over humans, if they can afford to do so. “In times of Covid, turning to technology is a wise thing. I am a retired professional and my wife is a senior citizen too,” said Vijay Shah, a Navrangpura resident. “When I learnt about this product, the decision to buy was almost instantaneous to avoid any risk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rise-of-robot-cleaners-amid-virus-fears-3-fold-surge-in-sales/articleshow/83267887.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: ‘Teens explore porn during online classes’||VADODARA: A panicking 15-year-old made his parents worried, but their world was left asunder with his shocking revealtions. The boy revealed he was being blackmailed for money by a woman who had his semi-nude photos! And how? He had downloaded a porn site while attending online classes and had got addicted to the adult site. “The parents brought the boy for counselling as he got addicted to porn while attending online classes over the last few months. Some time ago, he downloaded a site and began to chat with a woman who also got a few indecent photos of his. He even paid her a few thousand rupees online,” said Dr Bakulesh Chauhan, paediatrician and adolescent expert. It’s just the tip of an iceberg, says Dr Chauhan who has counselled several such adolescents plagued with the same affliction in the past few months. “Students attend online classes behind closed doors for privacy. Parents usually can’t monitor their activities all the time which gives them the chance to surf such websites,” Dr Chauhan told TOI. Paediatrician Dr Tushar Shah said that what is more alarming is that many parents are blissfully ignorant of their children’s porn addiction. “A mother had brought her child to me a few months ago as she found a lot of porn material in his smartphone. Adolescents tend to explore many things on the internet as they are spending a lot of time online. And parents are mostly helpless,” Dr Shah said. “Consumption of adult content is on the rise as adolescents are getting lot of access to internet all day,” said Dr Jalnidhi Nanavaty, child and adolescent psychiatrist. She further said that unmonitored, ignorant children often invite online hazards from such adult websites, get exposed to virtual strangers and often even manipulated which affects their mental health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/online-classes-make-teens-stray-into-porn-websites/articleshow/83266380.cms||Tushar Tere

The PMC’s 22nd board meeting was chaired by mayor Sita Sahu in the presence of municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma. It was decided that petrol pump outlets would pay Rs 1,500 annually for trash collection while the malls with cinema halls will be charged Rs5,000 and those without theatres will pay Rs 3,000. The amount for the supermarket has been fixed at Rs 2,000 and showrooms, workshops and gyms will have to shell out Rs 1,000 each. The rates were revised based on the size of periphery. Shops spread over 200 sq feet or less will have to pay Rs 75 per year while those having more than 200 sq feet area will be charged Rs 100. Commercial offices will be charged Rs 500 and those spread over 200sq feet or less will pay Rs 300. For godowns, the rate has been fixed at Rs 1,000. It will be Rs 750 if the area is over 500 square feet or less. The hospitals will have to pay Rs 500 and Rs 200 if the number of beds is 20 or below. Sahu said no ‘kaccha’ houses in slum areas will be charged for garbage collection while pucca houses in slum areas will have to pay Rs 50 instead of Rs 30. The PMC has approved 12 decimal of land at landfill site in Ramachak Bariya to Central Institute of Petrochemicals Engineering and Technology (CIPET), an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, for setting up a plastic waste processing unit, for which the Centre will provide Rs 6 crore. It was also decided to amend the definition of ‘bulk waste generator’ in the Solid Waste Management Bylaws 2020. Those institutions, establishments located in the municipal area and generating an average of 100kg of waste per day will be kept in the category of bulk waste generator. “Under the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, it is mandatory for the institutions, which come under the category of solid waste producer, to make arrangements for processing of wet waste on the premises itself. PMC will take only domestic harmful waste, sanitary waste, e-waste and dry waste from such establishments,” an official said. Earlier, those producing average 20kg of waste per day were classified as solid waste generators. The board also approved Rs 4,500 as bonus to all sanitation workers while Rs 10 lakh ex gratia amount to the families of those who died of Covid-19. The board approved nine proposals, including installation of water pumps or tube-wells, nali-gali yojana, internet connectivity at PMC headquarters and all circle offices, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/civic-body-fixes-garbage-collection-rates-for-commercial-establisments/articleshow/83267070.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Ahmedabad||Year after Bhuj strip test, Gujarat seeks to stop period stigma||AHMEDABAD: More than a year after some girls in a Bhuj educational institute were forced to undergo a ‘menstruation check’, the state education department has recently issued a directive to ensure that girls are not subjected to such outrageous discrimination again. A list of dos and don’ts for all schools also urges to propagate science behind periods. In February last year, 68 girls of Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute (SSGI) in Bhuj were summoned from class and made to take off their undergarments for the authorities to check if they were menstruating. The incident had shocked the nation and invited action by the state and national commission for women against the blatant expression of ‘period-phobia’. Ironically, it took a national uproar over the incident to prompt the state into action and release a list of dos and don’ts to protect schoolgirls from such intrusive humiliation. In a letter dated June 4, Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), citing recommendation by the Gujarat State Commission for Women, has attempted to address the problem. The letter states that schools, religious organizations, or any other body that gives accommodation to girls and women should not look at menstruation from outdated perspectives. Instead, the letter says, menstruation must be considered from the scientific standpoint. Schools should, as part of education, teach that menstruation is a natural and biological process, the letter says. “While schools should make students aware about menstruation from the primary level itself, schools and colleges should have machines for the disposal of sanitary napkins,” the letter adds. The government’s recent move is aimed to prevent the recurrence of the disgrace perpetrated by the Bhuj based Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute (SSGI), a self-financed college, with its own girls’ hostel and is run by a trust of the Swaminarayan Temple, Bhuj. The college is affiliated to the Krantiguru Shyamji Krishna Verma Kachchh University. The school had suspended its principal, hostel rector, and peon after police registered an FIR against them. The National Commission for Women had formed a team to investigate the matter. The team visited the school on February 15, 2020, and shared its findings with police and the university. “On January 20, 2021, the Gujarat State Commission for Women sent its recommendations to the state education department based on which Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) has asked the district education officers to follow these directives,” said sources in the education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/yr-after-bhuj-strip-test-guj-seeks-to-stop-period-stigma/articleshow/83290671.cms||Bharat Yagnik

As the purported video went viral on social media, the Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police (SSP) later claimed it was just an advisory and not an order."People of 45 years and above who did not get their vaccination done will not be allowed to open their shops," a cop can be heard saying through the loudspeaker.Commenting on the incident, Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar dismissed it as "overzealous action on the part of the policemen seen in the video"."There is no such order. It was just an advisory and should not have come across as an order. It was an overzealous effort on the part of the policeman," SSP Kumar said. While refraining from commenting on the video, Bulandshahr district magistrate (DM) Ravindra Kumar said people involved in public dealing should get vaccinated on priority so that they do not infect others."In my opinion, if people who venture in public space for work like e-rickshaw drivers, shopkeepers and vendors remain protected then it brings down chances of others being infected," the DM said.As of now, an average of 9,000 to 10,000 people are getting vaccinated on a daily basis in the district. Senior officials claim they have been working on a two-pronged strategy of vaccination as per the demand and tackling of rumours."There are 98 Covid vaccination centres in the district. More than 136 teams of health workers have been going to localities and villages for the vaccination drive. In a bid to counter rumours, we have taken steps, including appeals from religious heads, to encourage people to come forward for vaccination," the DM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/traders-above-45-years-told-over-loudspeakers-bycops-to-get-vaccinated-else-they-cant-open-shops/articleshow/83266665.cms||---

On the World Environment Day on Saturday intensive afforestation was started at the international border adjoining Rajasthan and Gujarat. BSF will build a ‘green wall’ in Rajasthan and Gujarat. On the directions of Rajasthan frontier IG Pankaj Ghumar, around 2.5 lakh plants will be planted in the entire border area and at various battalion headquarters while in Barmer and border adjoining Gujarat frontier around 3 lakh plants will be planted within a month. Plantation was done at various border outposts on a wide scale on Saturday on the directions of Jaisalmer sector north DIG Arun Kumar Singh. Similarly, in sector South, medicinal and fruit-bearing trees were planted at Dabla headquarters and other border outposts. In Barmer sector DIG Vineet Kumar started plantation drive at sector headquarters. Around 600 plants were planted at Jaisalmer police line on the directions of SP. Sector north DIG Arun Kumar Singh said that more than 3,000 plants were planted at many border outposts, sector headquarters and battalion headquarters. Jawans and officers enthusiastically took part. Next month, thousands of plants will be planted in sector north headquarters area. On the World Environment Day on Saturday, more than 5,000 fruit-bearing and medicinal plants were planted at various border outposts and battalion headquarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bsf-plants-5k-trees-as-part-of-green-wall-at-intl-border/articleshow/83267380.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Start shifting Ajni trees, orders Gadkari; greens want hearing||Nagpur: While a public hearing on the issue of felling thousands of age-old trees at Ajni is yet to be held, Union minister Nitin Gadkari has directed officials to start transplantation and compensatory plantation from July end. Environment activists have strongly slammed the move, calling it a “mockery of environmental norms and public sentiments”. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is accepting objections till June 30. Two days back, TOI reported about Gadkari’s announcement to transplant about 5,000 trees from Ajni where the inter-modal station is proposed to come up. This decision too was disapproved by environmentalists who stated that seeing past records, transplantation is a big failure in the city. As per information, a meeting was held at Gadkari’s residence in which officials of the NMC, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, some other officials and few activists were present. After discussions, the minister issued directives. According to a release from Gadkari’s office, 25,000 plantations will be carried out and 5,000 existing trees will be translocated on the sides of roads in and around the city. A committee under former director of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) Satish Wate has also been formed to monitor the transplantation process and their subsequent maintenance. The NMC has been asked to prepare a plan for implementing the transplantation process. Environment feel the decision is “injustice for the citizens”. “This is a complete mockery of environmental norms and policies. The government can’t behave in this dictatorial way. The tree act clearly states that a decision has to be taken after calling out objections and conducting a public hearing,” said activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani. After the NMC extended the deadline for submitting objections, “people are coming forward in large numbers”. “The opinion of taxpayers is not being taken into account at all,” added Chhabrani. According to reports in media and a local activist, the NHAI, which had carried out large-scale transplantation of trees on Dwarka Expressway in New Delhi, turned out to be a failure. Delhi’s V Selvarajan, founder of NGO Green Circle and a Dwarka resident, said that transplantation is not being done in a scientific manner in the country. “Other countries also do transplantation but not for so many trees. It is just an eyewash, the agencies doing it have no technical skill. Among many reasons for failure of transplantation, soil compatibility is a major one. Even if you are translocating a tree to the nearest spot, the soil texture might be different,” said Selvarajan. Environmentalist and plantation expert Prachi Mahurkar, who had carried out a survey of tree species at Ajni, said that survival of transplanted trees will be almost negligible. “The authorities are by-passing all laws and giving fake assurances of transplantation, which is nothing but slow death of the trees. The government should first come out with a detailed plan on how they plan to transplant such large number of trees, what technology will be used and other information. Only then we will know the real picture,” said Mahurkar. Young activists Wasudev Mishra and Kunal Mourya questioned the need for seeking objection letters when “authorities have already made up their mind”. “Not a single transplanted tree has survived in the city. This is a scam happening in the name of development,” they said. “Nagpur climate is not suitable for transplantation of all type of species,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of NGO Green Vigil. “Invasive species like subabul should not be transplanted as they are not environment friendly. Instead indigenous species like neem, peepal banyan, tamarind etc should replace subabul in compensatory plantation plan,” added Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/start-shifting-ajni-trees-orders-gadkari-greens-want-hearing/articleshow/83268109.cms||Manka Behl
---||Chandigarh||Covid stops many from attending Bluestar events||Amritsar: For the second consecutive year, the number of devotees coming to Amritsar from other areas to observe the anniversary of Operation Bluestar and stay overnight in the Golden Temple complex has reduced sharply in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sakkatar Singh , a shopkeeper in the vicinity of Golden Temple said he would often make arrangements for the stay of devotees in the verandah of his shop but not many devotees have arrived so far. “The number of devotees arriving from several villages or even from other cities of Punjab or Delhi is much lower than last year’s arrival of devotees,” he said. TOI talked to Gurmukh Singh, a resident of Tilak Nagar, Delhi, who makes it a point to be in Amritsar on the occasion. Last year, he said he drove to Amritsar from Delhi with his wife but had decided against it this year due to spurt in Covid cases. “It’s my commitment to myself to stay in the Golden Temple complex and reach Akal Takht early morning on June 6 but this year, I will not be coming as I would not only put myself at risk of acquiring Covid but also endanger my family in Delhi,” he said. Sources said elaborate security arrangements have been made around the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee complex to prevent untoward incidents. A large number of police personnel in plainclothes have also been deployed in the complex to keep an eye on trouble-makers. Confirming the details, Amritsar police commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill said police was on high alert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-stops-many-from-attending-bluestar-events/articleshow/83268117.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Sree Narayanaguru Open University in a bind over UGC approval||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The recently-constituted Sree Narayanaguru Open University is unlikely to start offering courses anytime soon. Even as the university has prepared the courseware of 20 distance education courses for the UGC approval, the commission is yet to open the course registration portal this year. The university authorities said that they were not in a position to say when the varsity would start offering courses. “The registration is a prerequisite and we are ready to complete the procedure. But the UGC has not reopened the registration portal after last November or so. Ours being a new university, the UGC would give clearance for the courses only after visiting the university and evaluating the facilities we have arranged,” they said. Consequent to the formation of the new open university, the state government had taken away the right of other state universities to offer distance education courses and also private registration. There were allegations that the first Pinarayi Vijayan government had hurriedly set up the university, causing hardships to thousands of students seeking higher education in distance education mode. Save Education Campaign Committee has submitted a memorandum to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and higher education minister R Bindhu to intervene immediately so that a large section of students are not deprived of a chance to pursue higher education. “Among those who pass Plus Two examination in the state, around one lakh students opt for distance education mode of higher education. Since the government has taken away from the state universities the right to offer distance education courses, they are most likely to join courses offered by universities in other states. Since no other states with open universities has stripped their state universities from offering parallel education facilities, the state government should immediately issue an order to rescind the exclusive right given to Sree Narayanaguru Open University for offering distance education courses in the state,” the campaign committee’s memorandum said. Following a similar imbroglio, last year the state government had given special permission to Kerala and Calicut universities to offer distance education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/open-university-in-a-bind-over-ugc-approval/articleshow/83267382.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Top babus met many times to craft plan||MUMBAI: The state government’s five-level unlock plan, which considers local parameters like weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy and is finding praise from experts, was put together by a team of senior bureaucrats led by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. The need for a real-time, evidence-based system was felt after it was realised by the administration that nearly 50 orders had been issued to slow down the spread of the coronavirus but the implementation of these in letter and spirit had remained difficult. “These orders were met with resistance at many levels. This five-level plan is based on well-defined parameters and districts will be upgraded or downgraded based on their infection levels and hospital bed occupancy trends,” Kunte said. He said such a system also put some amount of responsibility on the people of the district to keep the rate of infection low. Issued late on Friday night, the order for the five-level unlock plan was drafted after several rounds of meetings held by Kunte in which additional chief secretary (home) Manukumar Srivastava, relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta and DGP Sanjay Pandey were directly involved in drafting the policy. “We considered the policies adopted by the developed countries, particularly the European countries, wherein they are not promulgating orders on a weekly or fortnightly basis. Our view was that there should no ad hoc policies, and instead we should come out with such a draft wh-ich could be implemented easily,” a senior bureaucrat said. The bureaucrat said that as the officials of the public health and medical education departments were seized of the gravity of the situation, under such circumstances it was felt that the new policy could be in the form of a standard operating procedure. “We prepared the draft and placed it before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. In fact, we had four rounds of discussion on the draft and he gave the final touches to the policy. We expect it to be a model for the entire country,” he said. Another official said that such a policy reduces the reaction time and districts which breach the defined parameters can be locked down early. "The second wave in the state began from a small taluka in Amravati and by the time we reacted to it, it had spread to other parts of Vidarbha,” the official said. Bengaluru-based epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu said Maharashtra's break-the-chain criteria is a “good and objective” mechanism. “Instead of a one-size-fits-all rule, here is a mechanism that can be used by district authorities in a transparent manner,” he said, adding that other states could learn from it. He said the World Health Organisation (WHO) too advises a points system on whether the outbreak is in control, whether the health system can cater to a surge in cases, the testing capacity, the bed capacity, and education of the community on following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Another senior official said that the state may also make percentage of the population that is vaccinated as the third parameter to give relaxations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-top-babus-met-many-times-to-craft-plan/articleshow/83270414.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Pune||Monsoon may arrive in Pune within 48 hours: IMD||PUNE: Monsoon could make an onset over Pune and Mumbai on Sunday or Monday, but its arrival at these cities could occur only after a week if rain dies out in the next couple of days. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division, IMD (India Meteorological Department), Pune, told TOI, “The monsoon onset criteria seem to be present in Pune with rain during the last couple of days, along with predominantly westerly winds and typical rainy clouds. Monsoon seems to be knocking on Pune and Mumbai, but rain should continue 24-48 hours for an onset to be declared.” He said, “If Mumbai gets adequate rainfall on Sunday/Monday, the onset could occur simultaneously over Mumbai. But if it does not make an onset over Pune and Mumbai in the next 48 hours, then it may only happen six to seven days later, as the rainfall activity over the state may reduce from June 7, till June 11.” IMD officials said the rainfall activity over south Konkan continued on Saturday, right up to Ratnagiri and Raigad, while Mumbai received traces of rainfall till 5.30pm. The normal monsoon onset date for Pune is June 10, while it is June 11 for Mumbai. Making fast progress over the west coast, monsoon made an onset over south Maharashtra, including Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Satara, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur, on Saturday -- one to two days before the normal date. Shivajinagar received 3mm rainfall from 8.30am till 5.30pm on Saturday, while Lohegaon received 34.1mm. “All features of monsoon are present over Pune for declaration of its arrival in the city on Sunday. However, adjacent areas of Marathwada, areas of north interior Karnataka, Telangana and coastal Andhra Pradesh should also receive rain for the NLM (Northern Limit of Monsoon) line of continuity to run smoothly. Clearer picture on the onset over Pune and Mumbai will emerge on Sunday,” he said. Pune has a lightning and thunder, along with light to moderate rain, forecast for Sunday, followed by very light rain chances on Monday. Mumbai has a possibility of light to moderate rain or thundershowers during the next 48 hours. Kashyapi said monsoon had been quite active over west coast, particularly because of the off-shore trough at mean sea-level from south Maharashtra coast to south Kerala coast as well as the cyclonic circulation over east-central Arabian Sea, off Karnataka-Goa coasts. “These systems have caused it to progress faster than usual over parts of south Maharashtra. The southern part of Konkan and south Madhya Maharashtra have been receiving rainfall continuously for the last 48 hours till Saturday,” he said. Rainfall activity in Maharashtra is likely to reduce significantly from June 7 till 11, during which the progress of monsoon in the state would be restricted for around seven days. IMD on Saturday night said southwest monsoon was very likely to advance further into more central Arabian Sea, some more parts of Maharashtra, remaining parts of Karnataka, more parts of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, remaining parts of Tamil Nadu, more parts of central and northeast Bay of Bengal, some parts of north east Bay of Bengal and northeast India during the next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-may-arrive-in-city-within-48-hrs-imd/articleshow/83269323.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Nagpur||Covid negative test must for MBBS exam, HC gives no relief||Nagpur: Rejecting interim relief, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Saturday refused to stay the MBBS examinations to be conducted by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) from June 10. Justice Avinash Gharote has directed that the 40,000 examinees must test negative on RT-PCR or rapid antigen test before appearing for the exams. The petition was filed by NGO Herd Foundation and a physiotherapy student through counsel Rahul Bhangde and Dhruv Sharma. “The MUHS therefore is directed to issue an advisory to the principals of the various colleges and also to publish it on website, indicating that it would be desirable that each examinee should get tested for Covid-19 and produce the negative report to examiner along with his/her hall ticket on June 10,” the judge said. Those undergoing rapid antigen test are advised to get an RT-PCR test done before June 15. “If the RT-PCR report is found positive, such an examinee would not be in a position to undertake the examination. This is all, however, subject to the directives and instructions in the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the state government, as prevailing on June 7 or thereafter,” the HC added. With directives to list the case before the regular division bench on June 14, justice Gharote kept the issue of maintainability of the petition open. The Nashik university had questioned the locus standi of petitioners, stating that not a single MBBS student had approached HC for staying the exams. The judge said the Covid-19 situation appeared to be normalizing, considering the decreasing number of patients across the state. “The plea of the threat of mucormycosis doesn’t appeal to me, for the reason that it’s a fallout of the reduced immunity of a person due to administration of steroids during the treatment of Covid-19, and is not a disease akin to Covid-19.” Adding that it’s not as if the entire lot of 40,661 examinees would congregate at one place, justice Gharote said the papers would be conducted at 173 centres across the state, which means there wouldn’t be more than 250 students at one college. He said, “It’s a different scenario in CBSE/HSC and SSC examinations, which lakhs of students undertake, and it is in this context that the statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi must be construed.” The judge added, “The students are undertaking the examinations in various medical courses. Upon completing the courses, they would be handling patients with various infections — some of which may be communicable. It doesn’t augur well for medical professionals to harbour such insecurities.” Noting that the examinees are given the choice to skip the exams as per the April 19 advisory, the court said no prejudice would be caused to them as their absenteeism wouldn’t be counted as an additional attempt. “All the preparations are in place for conducting the examinations, which will begin in five days. The petitioners and all the students were aware since October 6 that the exams would be held offline. The first two phases were conducted offline in January-February and March-April. Staying the exams is not justifiable, even on the plea that they should be conducted online, as such conduct may not be advisable in view of the preparations involved for such a course,” the HC said. Pointing out that there’s nothing on record to indicate that majority of the examinees were not willing to take the exam on the grounds stated in the petition, justice Gharote said any postponement at the petitioners’ behest is clearly not possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-negative-test-must-for-mbbs-exam-hc-gives-no-relief/articleshow/83268144.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Hyderabad||No public grievance system in Telangana, says former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir||HYDERABAD: Former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir has charged the TRS government of dismantling the mechanism of public grievances and redressal in the state. “In the absence of a permanent peshi, all ministers and departments are functioning without an address. People have no clue where they can lodge their complaints and grievances, seeking their redressal. This is entirely against the spirit of democracy and the Constitution,” Congress leader Shabbir Ali said on Saturday. “Some of the ministers, mainly KT Rama Rao, are giving an impression that they are resolving the problems being faced by the people through social media platform Twitter. But not all the complaints and grievances tagged to him are being attended to. A majority of people sharing their problems through social media platforms are either being blocked by the minister’s office or there is no response to their queries,” Shabbir Ali said. The Congress leader alleged that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has mostly remained inaccessible to the people in the last seven years. The TRS ministers were emulating the CM in evading common people. “With no proper platform to lodge their complaints and grievances, people are now approaching the high court seeking solutions to their problems. Public interest litigations (PILs) are being filed,” he said. Shabbir Ali demanded that the state government take immediate measures to restore the grievances mechanism and enable people to lodge complaints about their specific problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-public-grievance-system-in-t-cong/articleshow/83267429.cms||---
---||Jaipur||JDA colonies lack basic amenities even after years||JAIPUR: In the absence of demarcation and facilities, many people who have purchased the plots in colonies either developed or approved by Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) are unable to construct their houses. According to JDA records, there are 134 colonies approved or developed by it after 2013. In these colonies , nearly 38,000 plots have been developed including Economic Weaker Section (EWS) and Lower Income Group (LIG). However, even after 7 years, most of the colonies wear a deserted look in the absence of facilities. Waqim Khan, who purchased a plot in Deendayal Nagar zone-12, feels cheated as even after eight years, the JDA has not even demarcated the roads after receiving the entire amount. He said, “There is no demarcation on the ground. It is difficult to identify the location of my own plots. In such a scenario, the buyers can neither sell or construct houses on the plots. After lottery was drawn, successful allottees deposited the money on time. However, on the ground, there is zero development.” Sudha Kumawat, who is facing a similar plight after purchasing a plot in same colony said, “We have submitted several applications at JDA for carrying out demarcation and constructing the roads at least to reach our plots. But, our plea remain unheard till date.” Due to absence of electricity and water, habitation in these colonies appears to be a distant dream. In the past, the JDA launched many housing schemes to fill its coffers. However, this money has not been spent on developing these colonies. Since these schemes were promoted by the JDA, many bought land even though the reserve price of some bigger plots was higher in comparison to the market price. Many also ignored the fact that these colonies were situated places faraway from the city. An official source said the JDA can only start colonies in far-flung areas after seeking no-objection certificates (NOCs) from the water and electricity departments. “Both these departments have locked horns with JDA over the development charge issue. Also, these departments claim the colonies are faraway and it is not feasible to provide water or electricity as huge capital is required to develop infrastructure,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-colonies-lack-basic-amenities-even-after-yrs/articleshow/83268196.cms||---
---||Meerut||No slots in city, Delhiites drive to UP districts for shot, fill '80%' of quota||MEERUT: Finding vaccine slots on CoWin has been a grind in Delhi, which has been facing an acute shortage. Right next door in UP, however, several vaccine slots remain untouched in many areas. The answer to their problems, desperate vaccine-seekers in Delhi figured, was to find those areas on CoWin. So now, residents of Delhi-NCR are driving down to Meerut, Shamli and even faraway Mathura for their shots, filling "80% of the slots". “I tried for days but couldn’t find an opening for my second shot of Covaxin,” Vikas Mathur, 33, an engineer from east Delhi, told TOI. “A friend suggested that I try a few cities in UP. The Delhi-Meerut Expressway has made it easier to get there. So, I chose Meerut,” he said. There were a number of open slots on CoWin. He booked his within minutes and on the day he had been assigned, drove down 80km to his centre at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Agricultural University on the outskirts of Meerut, and got his second shot in time. “It was simple.” The primary reason for this rush is that while the prescribed gap between two Covishield doses is 84 days, that for Covaxin is four to six weeks. Those who got the first shot are scrounging for the second. Like Vijay Dhankad from Sonipat, in his mid-20s, who had received the first shot of Covaxin and had to take the second. Time was running out. After incessant efforts to get a slot for his second dose of Covaxin failed, he looked around and found openings in Shamli, about 80km away. “The vaccine drive is a national exercise. There should not be any problem about who is getting the vaccine where,” he said. On Twitter, too, there are accounts of Delhiites on a hunt for cities and towns with vaccine slots. “I found and booked a slot for 2nd dose of Covaxin at Meerut ... I have 36 hours to decide should I drive so far or wait for vaccine to be available in Delhi before 16th of June which is the last date I can book a slot on Cowin for my second dose,” tweeted a Delhi-based user JS Duggal. The trend has picked up but there is uncertainty about this workaround among UP officials. “At least 70-80% slots here are being booked by residents of Delhi and Haryana between the ages of 18 and 44 for the second dose,” Meerut district immunisation officer Dr Praveen Gautam said. Delhiites are also trying their luck in Mathura, 180km away. “At least 60-70 people from Delhi and Rajasthan are visiting the district for vaccination every day,” additional chief medical officer of Mathura Dr Rajiv Gupta. “We are trying not to vaccinate outsiders. The state government has bought vaccines and our priority is those from our own state.” Meerut district surveillance officer Dr Ashok Taliyan pointed to the rural-urban divide and said, “They (Delhi residents) have access to high-speed internet. Rural areas don’t, and are struggling with vaccine hesitancy.” Bulandshahr chief medical officer Dr Avtosh further said, “A large number of slots remain unbooked in rural areas also because many don’t know how to use CoWin and several don’t have smartphones.” These empty slots are quickly snapped up. Taliyan added, “Delhi residents are also Indian citizens. They have booked their slots using a national app. How can we say no to them?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/no-slots-in-city-delhi-ites-drive-to-up-dists-for-shot-fill-80-of-quota/articleshow/83266698.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kochi||Gas crematoriums remain as rusty eyesores in Ernakulam||KOCHI: Lakhs have been spent on setting up gas-operated crematoriums in the city but many of them have been sitting idle. The reason? Most people still prefer firewood-based cremations for their departed ones. Coupled with the conservative approach to death rites, the huge maintenance costs involved in running gas-operated crematoriums have also led to their under-utilization. “There is a gas chamber in Kochi Corporation’s crematorium at Ravipuram, which has become defunct. People prefer to cremate bodies using fire woods instead of incinerating them. After incineration, all the bones are collected together. But if the body is cremated using woods, relatives of the dead can collect the bones for performing rituals,” said Sathyan, who runs the crematorium. The gas-operated facility at Pachalam crematorium was installed around 20 years ago. But it got damaged and the plans to revive it has remained on paper as no one seemed eager to operate it. “We had sent a notice to the local body long time back, urging it to repair it. But it is a costly affair,” said Ramdas, who runs the Pachalam crematorium. “If a local body is ready to provide gas and meet other expenses, we would operate such crematoriums. We can cremate a body in one and half hours without causing any pollution and we don’t need to worry about woods and other materials. But if contractors who manage the crematoriums are told to fend for themselves, they will incur high operational costs since the price of LPG gas is rising day by day. Puthencruz – Vadavukode panchayat is running a gas crematorium in Brahmapuram. The panchayat meets the expenses,” said Ramdas. The gas crematorium at Changampuzha in Edapally was set up a few months ago. But it has not yet been opened to cremation though all arrangements are in place. “The building has been built and the gas chamber has been installed. But its inauguration got delayed owing to the assembly elections and the pandemic. Now, we burn the bodies using woods,” said Vasudevan, the caretaker. The gas crematoriums are sitting idle and turning rusty not just in the city limits alone. Crematoriums in other local bodies too, including Tripunithura and Maradu, share the same fate. “The gas crematorium in Tripunithura has not been used for more than 15 years, thanks to the preference of people to burn bodies using woods. Though we live in an educated society, there are many who prefer to use woods for cremation. The conservative mindset of people can be changed only by awareness programmes, which the local bodies should take up,” said Murali, who manages the crematorium at Tripunithura. Officials at the pollution control board point out that cremations using woods causes serious environmental issues. “Carbon footprint is huge. Our point of view is that we should encourage authorities to set up modern crematoriums,” said M A Baiju, chief environmental engineer, Ernakulam region of the PCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gas-crematoriums-remain-as-rusty-eyesores/articleshow/83267436.cms||T C Sreemol

India Meteorological Department, though, has said in case it does not arrive in these cities in a day or two, it may make an appearance after six- seven days. The normal monsoon onset date for Mumbai is June 11 and Pune June 10. Anupam Kashyapi of IMD, Pune, told TOI: “Monsoon onset criteria seem to be present in Pune with rain, along with predominantly westerly winds and typical rainy clouds. Monsoon seems to be knocking on Pune and Mumbai, but rain should continue for 24-48 hours for an onset to be declared.” He said if it does not make an onset in the next 48 hours, it may only happen six-seven days later, as rainfall activity may reduce from June 7 to 11. Making fast progress over the western coast, monsoon made an onset over south Maharashtra, including Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Satara, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur on Saturday—a day or two before the normal date. IMD on Saturday said southwest monsoon was very likely to advance further into more central Arabian Sea, some more parts of Maharashtra and the remaining parts of Karnataka, among other areas, in the next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/monsoon-may-advance-date-with-mumbai-city-could-arrive-in-48-hrs/articleshow/83268244.cms||Neha Madaan

Witnesses said two persons in the SUV were also injured but fled leaving the vehicle behind. The consignment is suspected to belong to a wanted drug smuggler, Taimur, police said. Additional SP (rural) Raj Kumar Agarwal told TOI, “An accident was reported on the Lucknow-Delhi national highway in which four persons in a Santro car were injured and they were admitted to Bareilly district hospital. But the occupants of the SUV, which had no registration plate, abandoned the vehicle and fled.” While searching the SUV to ascertain the identity of its occupants, the team found 4 kg of highly refined smack hidden under the seat, along with two Aadhaar cards, a driving licence and the documents of the vehicle, the ASP said. The documents suggested that the car was recently purchased by a resident of Shahjahanpur district. The address on the Aadhaar cards was of Behta village in Bareilly’s Faridpur tehsil. Behta is the native village of notorious gangster and drug smuggler Taimur who is wanted by police in Delhi and UP. Delhi Police has announced a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh while UP Police has offered a bounty of Rs 25,000 on Taimur’s head. Earlier, residents of Taimur’s village have been caught smuggling drugs for him, police said. “Initial investigation indicates that the men in the vehicle were smuggling the drug from Shahjahanpur to Bareilly. From Bareilly, the drugs would have been smuggled to various parts of the country, including Delhi and Punjab,” the ASP (rural) said. “We have registered an FIR under the sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and are searching for three other persons – the two occupants of the SUV and its owner. We may take the support of special teams to nab the kingpin of the racket,” said the ASP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/cops-probing-car-crash-find-4-kg-of-highly-refined-smack-valued-at-rs-4-cr/articleshow/83266704.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

While, local Congress leaders and sanitation workers came in his support, police inspected the headquarters. Sanitation workers announced a strike and boycotted garbage collection. However, after the intervention of the CEO, work resumed post lunch. The local Congress leaders also demanded suspension of councillors who were involved in alleged manhandling of the CEO. Giraj Khandelwal, former chief whip of Congress councillors said, “BJP mayor Somya Gurjjar has set has wrong precedent. Senior party members should intervene and expel councilors who allegedly manhandled the officer. The mayor acted immaturely.”On Friday, the issue was sparked after commissioner alleged that he was attacked by BJP councillors inside Gurjar’s office when he went to discuss the issue of payment with the garbage collecting company that has been on a strike for the last two days. He alleged that pressure was exerted on him by 10 BJP councillors inside the mayor’s office to give order for alternate arrangements.Following this, he registered a complaint with police against three councilors. On Saturday, police reached the JMC headquarters to record the statements and inspect the location where the incident occurred. A police officer said, “Acting on the complaint, the investigation has been initiated. We will follow the course of action.”It was alleged that the meeting was held in the inner room of mayor’s office on her invitation. The issue sparked after CEO refused to clear the payment of the sanitation firm, while BJP mayor and councilors were desperate to release the payment and exerted pressure on the officer. An official said, “The court had already given order not to take any action against the company for 8 weeks. The mayor and councillors, however, demanded to pay them the amount for diesel.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-row-continues-no-garbage-collected-in-city/articleshow/83268223.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No Level 1 & 2 if over 35,000 oxygen beds are taken in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The state government, which has finalised a plan to provide five levels of lockdown restrictions based on how well a district or municipal corporation has kept Covid-19 at bay, has also added an overriding catch: if the demand for oxygen beds in the state crosses certain thresholds, then even places that have the most liberal levels of lockdown will have to implement the rules meant for the stricter levels. The order says that if the oxygen bed occupancy in the state crosses 35,000, it will trigger a rollback of relaxations for districts and municipal corporations that are at Level 1 and Level 2, the most liberal levels, despite these places meeting the criteria for these levels. If oxygen bed occupancy rises further to cross the 45,000 mark, the state will do away with Level 3 as well, and the entire state will be at Level 4 or Level 5. This is being done to ensure that crucial health infrastructure like availability of oxygen beds is carefully monitored. “It is a quantifiable fact that in critical settings 20MT of oxygen can support 1,000 patients and Maharashtra, with a production of 1,200MT, can support a maximum of 60,000 patients. And from the difficulties we faced in sourcing oxygen from outside the state, it was important for an overarching indicator to be included in the unlock parameters,” said chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. As of June 3, the state had 1.2 lakh oxygen beds, of which 31,224 were occupied. “There is a downward trend in the requirement of oxygen beds in the state,” an official said. The public health department will declare the number of oxygen beds occupied in the state and the weekly district-wise parameters every Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-level-1-2-if-over-35000-o2-beds-are-taken-in-maharashtra-state/articleshow/83270484.cms||Bhavika Jain

Fifteen of them are in Palakkad division. ISO:14001 is a globally accepted international standard for environmental management systems. Among the factors that obtained the certifications is the Southern Railway initiative to install plastic bottle crushing machines (PBCMs) at stations. A comprehensive policy on installation of PBCMs at stations was introduced in 2019. As part of this, 34 PBCMs have been installed at 30 railway stations. In addition to this, a PBCM is being developed in-house at the Southern Railway central workshop. Another factor is the automatic organic waste composting plant installed at the Thiruvananthapuram central railway station. Besides this, composting pits are available at Palakkad and composting bins at Shoranur. Together that can handle 1,750kg of waste per day. The Southern Railway also has provisions to carry out mechanised cleaning of coaches in around 160 of its coaching depots. Machines like high pressure jet cleaners, floor-scrubbers, wet and dry vacuum cleaners, handheld buffing machines, etc. are deployed for the purpose. Effluent recycling plants with a total capacity of 4,320 kilo litres/day have also been installed at 10 locations. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/iso-certification-for-17-railway-stations/articleshow/83267508.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No space in housing societies? ALMs tie up with local hospitals for vax drive||MUMBAI: Coming to the aid of housing societies that don’t have enough space to hold a vaccination drive on their premises, Advanced Locality Managements (ALMs) are joining hands with neighbourhood hospitals and encouraging residents to go there and get inoculated against Covid-19. The Breach Candy ALM has tied up with Parsi General Hospital, and is sending people in batches of 30 to get vaccinated. ALM member Nandini Chabria said senior citizens had been struggling to book appointments for their caretakers. “They were also afraid to send them to a crowded or distant vaccination centre. This is when we thought of starting a neighbourhood vaccination drive,” she said. Mamta Mangaldas, another member, said, “Many buildings in the area do not have space to hold a vaccination camp. We thank the neighbourhood hospital for allowing locals to get the jab there.” Locals are paying Rs 850 per dose. At Bandra’s Mount Mary area, Maria D’Souza, chairperson of the Mount Mary Kane Road ALM, said they have tied up with Holy Family Hospital to vaccinate 50 persons each day from June 7-12. She, along with Harshal Morde, another local, circulated a Google form for residents to sign up for the camp. D’Souza said that they initially thought of having the vaccination drive in a local garden, but fearing pre-monsoon showers dumped the plan. At Cuffe Parade, corporator Harshita Narwekar said they have tied up with Khubchandani Hospital at Cooperage. “Many of those in the 18-44 age bracket, who are unable to get the jab at the civic centres, are finding this arrangement with the nearby hospital convenient,” she said. Sheena Kataria of Oval Cooperage Residents’ Association said the hospital is within walking distance for most residents, and hence was selected. Haresh Hathiramani, a local resident, said: “Apart from beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group, there were also those waiting for their second dose who can come to the hospital.” Residents are paying Rs 900 for each Covishield dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-space-in-hsg-societies-alms-tie-up-with-local-hospitals-for-vax-drive-in-mumbai/articleshow/83269409.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Gangrape survivors’ eldest sister among 6 held||JAIPUR: Pratap Nagar police station has solved the gangrape case of two sisters by arresting six persons, including the survivors’ eldest sister, for conspiring with the four rape accused, on Saturday. The incident happened on June 1 after four youths abducted two sisters living together with their eldest sister in a rented accommodation at Pratap Nagar. They accused took the sisters to a house in Luniyawas village and raped them. Police says that the three sisters came from Karauli to Jaipur for work a couple of years ago. Of the three, the eldest and youngest were preparing for competitive exams, while the younger one was working in a private company. “The eldest sister is in love with another arrested accused, who would come frequently to their rented place in Pratap Nagar. Both the victims disliked their eldest sister’s relationship with the accused. The victims scolded the accused some time ago and asked him not to visit their rented place,” said the police. The ill-treatment of the accused angered the eldest sister who was looking for a chance to teach them a lesson. Meanwhile, the victims were being stalked by two boys, who got their numbers from the social media. “The victims had once threatened the youths of police action. Later, the accused (their sister’s lover) got to know about these two youths who were after the victims. He convinced the eldest sister that this is the right time to take revenge and hatched the conspiracy of abduction with the other two accused,” said the police. He took the help of his another friend and revealed the address of the girls and the time when they are at home, for abduction.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad’s green cover flourishes by 117% in a decade||AHMEDABAD: The city’s green cover has increased by 117% in the last decade. The parks and gardens department of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) stated that the city’s green cover was 4.66% of the its geographic area of about 500 sq km in 2012 has increased to 10.13% by 2021. Officials said the state government had announced the results of the tree census in 2012 and the number of trees in the city was 6.18 lakh, covering 4.66% of the city’s area. Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar on Saturday, World Environment Day, tweeted: “City green cover increased from 4.66% in 2021 to over 10% in 2021. City has 283 gardens and planning 18 more in 2021-22. City has 42 urban forests and plans to add 10 more in 2021-22. AMC planted 10.13 lakhs sapling last year and is planning for 13.40 lakh saplings in 2021-22.” Jignesh Patel, director of parks and gardens, said going by survival reports from various NGO involved in increasing the green cover, the city’s green cover has increased by 10.13% of its total area. He said estimates of the trees cut in the city and the number of trees that have fallen, compared to the new plantation taken up by the AMC shows that the city in 2021 has more than 14 lakh trees. Patel said the city has 42 urban forest areas. Their plot sizes ranges from 3,000 to 11,000 square metres. Patel said the AMC has roped in NGOs for tree plantation and their certificates reveal that the survival rate is high, between 85% and 93%. “The AMC is the first municipal corporation to go in for the Miyawaki technique, where the native species of plants are planted close to each other that they get sunlight only from the top and grow upwards rather than sideways. As a result, the plantation becomes approximately 30 times denser, grows 10 times faster and becomes maintenance-free after three years,” he said. Patel said that after the 2012 tree census, the forest department has not taken up a official count and hence the AMC is going by its estimates. “If the state takes up the count, we are sure the number will be very close to our estimates,” he said. Sources in the forest department said that in 2018, the dense green cover in the city saw a reduction of over 20% along with a 17% decline in open spaces. Ahmedabad’s built up area has increased by around 72% up from 81.68 sq km in 2005 to 141 sq km in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabads-green-cover-flourishes-by-117-in-a-decade/articleshow/83267513.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Class VI girl opens her heart & purse to help needy student||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It isn’t an easy feeling for a Class VI student to part with the money she had been saving to fulfil a long-cherished wish. However, by happily donating the Rs 2,000 with her, Husnafathima has now become a real inspiration for her friends. The amount was used to buy a mobile phone so that her younger brothers’ friend, a Class II student of the Pattathil Government LP School at Mangalapuram, can attend online classes. For the last two to three months, Husnafathima had been saving the small sum of money her father Nisamudeen, a provisional store owner, gave her. With the money she hoped to buy a bicycle. It was then that she came to know through her mother that a classmate of her brothers, Muhammed Ali Hasan and Muhammed Ali Hussain, has no means to buy a mobile phone to attend online classes. Husnafathima agreed to give her small savings to buy a phone for him. “The boys already have an old cycle and they spend their leisure time riding it. The thought of spending the money that had been saving to buy a second bicycle for some other cause made them a bit sad initially. But when we told them about the plight of their friend, they too were so happy about their sister’s decision,” said Husnafathima’s mother, Fathima Beegum. Unfortunately, Husnafathima’s savings were not enough to get a mobile phone that fulfils the purpose. Husnafathima’s parents who supported their daughter’s generosity decided to raise the remaining amount from their friends. After great efforts, they managed to collect Rs 5,000 from their kith and kin. Meanwhile, the school authorities also chipped in. The boy, it is learnt, is living in a house badly damaged by a tree fall in the recent rains. “I am a member of school vikasana samithi. When the teachers told us about the needs of this boy, we were in a dilemma since we too have financial limitations. Still, we were worried about him. When I discussed the matter with my family, my daughter readily expressed her willingness to give the money she had saved all these months to buy a bicycle. Now we feel really proud of her,” said Husnafathima’s mother. “We should appreciate her gesture. Most of the students in our school are from the economically weaker sections. Last year we somehow ensured that all our students’ attended online classes despite their hardships,” said Beena B, the headmistress in-charge of the school. Husnafathima was a student of the same school till Class V.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/class-vi-girl-opens-her-heart-purse-to-help-needy-student/articleshow/83267480.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Forest fires? In March-April, Dehradun as polluted as Delhi||DEHRADUN: The spate of forest fires earlier this year may have caused Dehradun’s air quality to plummet to ‘poor category’ with air quality index (AQI) levels hovering between 201 and 300 for two straight months – March, when the AQI was 237, and April, when it was 225. This put Dehradun in the same category as Delhi, where the AQI hovered between 190 to 250, putting the air quality in the ‘moderate to poor’ category during March and April. Track the pollution level in your city“In all likelihood, the pollution rise in Dehradun in these two months can be related to the forest fires with other factors like construction works and vehicular pollution also contributing,” said SP Subudhi, member secretary, state pollution control board. Rishikesh, which neighbours Dehradun, also witnessed poor AQI of 221 during March although in April, the AQI level in the town had become moderate (194). Incidentally, the Covid curfew seems to have had little impact on the environment of Uttarakhand this time, unlike previous year’s lockdown, when the air quality in March and April remained in ‘moderate and satisfactory categories’ with AQI levels between 51 and 200 across the state. This, according to Subudhi, may be because Covid curfew was announced only towards the end of April this year whereas lockdown was imposed in the state soon after Holi in March last year. The period between March and May this year saw a brutal second wave of Covid with affected persons reporting breathing distress and impaired lung functions. Whether air pollution also had a role to play in aggravating the symptoms is something experts are not sure of, although poor AQI levels, as per Central Pollution Control Board indicators, does lead to “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.” That forest fires will have a detrimental effect on air quality was a fear being expressed by environmentalists even when the state’s jungles were blazing. In March, the state lost 868.4 hectares of its forest cover to 627 fire incidents whereas April saw 1807 fire incidents and lost 2418.65 hectares of forest cover. The intensity of forest fires this year could be gauged by the fact that in April, IAF choppers called from Bareilly for fire-fighting in Kumaon could not take off because the smoke from the fires was extremely dense. Locals in many areas in the hills had also complained about the severity of forest fires this year, with some terming their areas as having turned into ‘smoke chambers’.TOI had reported in early April that the high carbon content in the air due to rampant forest fires was beginning to impact the health of the people, especially the elderly, with many complaining of low visibility due to smoke while some were complaining of irritation in the eyes and difficulty in breathing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/impact-of-forest-fires-in-march-april-dehradun-was-as-polluted-as-delhi-recorded-poor-aqi-levels/articleshow/83265794.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Three from Iran held for divert-and-steal operation||HYDERABAD: Rachakonda police arrested three Iranian nationals on Saturday for their involvement in a divert-and-steal operation. In this, the accused would try to divert the attention of various businessmen and then steal their money. According to police, the arrested — Mohammed Hussain, Vaheed Rajab and Naseer Abhidi — are residents of Tehran and had come to India at different times in the last year-and-a-half. Initially, the trio were residing in Delhi and involved in business of cloth exports to Tehran. However, they suffered losses as a result of the pandemic-induced lockdown. As there was no lockdown in Hyderabad in April (this year), the trio moved to Tolichowki. Upon reaching the city, the accused hatched a plan to steal money from businessmen under the pretext of wanting to exchange US dollars. “The modus operandi of the accused is to show US dollars to shop vendors and other gullible innocent people and ask them to exchange the money with them. Later, by gaining the confidence of the victims, they take the notes of Indian currency from victims, divert their attention by keeping them busy with their talk and commit theft,’’ Rachakonda police said in a statement. Police got two different complaints in this regard at LB Nagar police station. During investigation, upon analysis of CCTV footage, the accused were identified and then arrested. Upon questioning, police found out that the accused had committed three offences in Cyberabad and two in Rachakonda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-from-iran-held-for-divert-and-steal-op/articleshow/83267503.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Illegal tree felling in Wayanad: Stern action to be taken, says Kerala forest minister||KOZHIKODE: Forest minister A K Saseendran said that the government will take stern action against all those involved in illegal felling of centuries old rosewood trees from assigned land at Muttil village in Wayanad. Addressing media persons at a press conference here on Saturday, Saseendran said that illegal plunder of trees had taken place in Muttil and those who felled the trees and the officials who colluded with them will be brought to book. “I had a meeting with top six forest officials in the state and have given directions for a thorough probe and to take stern action against those responsible. I have also had discussions with the chief minister on the matter,” the minister said. Saseendran said that the forest department would seek legal advice from the advocate general on the issue and added that if the ongoing investigations are not satisfactory, help from external agencies will be sought. The minister said that he along with the revenue minister has sought separate reports from the respective departments on the issue and will take further action after receiving them. The minister admitted that there was delay in taking action against those responsible in the case which surfaced in February. “The matter came to light just before the election dates were announced and the administrative affairs were mostly handled by officials,” he said. The mass felling of rosewood trees worth crores of rupees had taken place by misinterpreting a government order dated October 24, 2020, which allowed farmers to fell the trees which they had planted in land assigned to them under the Kerala Land Assignment Rules, 1964, and the tree which have naturally grown in the land. However, by misinterpreting the order, a large number of trees upto 500 years old have been felled despite that fact that the order allowed farmers to cut trees which were present on the land at the time of assignment, except sandalwood, only if the land owners had remitted the tree value of reserved trees during the time of assignment. Following the widespread misuse of the order, the revenue department had revoked the order in February. Meppadi range officer had seized 250 cubic metre of timber that was illegally felled in Wayanad and transported to Perumbavoor and other places. Though 42 cases were registered in connection with the illegal tree felling, no arrests have been made in the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/illegal-tree-felling-in-wayanad-stern-action-to-be-taken-says-forest-min/articleshow/83267505.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Excise subinspector feeds 200 at government hospital in Karimnagar daily||HYDERABAD: An excise subinspector stands outside the government civil hospital in Karimnagar every day along with six friends to distribute food packets, PPE kits, sanitisers and masks to Covid-19 patients and their attendants. This daily routine has been going on without a break since the second wave of Covid-19 hit Telangana, necessitating restrictions on the movement of people. Shaik Amer Arafath, an excise official attached to the enforcement wing, took the role of a Covid warrior after he found Covid-19 patients finding it hard to get food. Most of them are poor and even if someone could afford it, their attendants cannot move out due to Covid-19 curfew. Amer, who had a similar experience when his father was admitted to hospital a few years ago, decided that no one admitted in government hospital or their attendants should go to sleep on an empty stomach or struggle to find food. Amer and his friends Ashraf, Sohail, Rizwan, Khader, Qadeer and Azharuddin pool up money every day from their salary to help the patients and their attendants. During the first wave of Covid-19, they served food and supplied protection gear to the needy. “Covid-19 has hit everyone hard. Our aim is to provide humanitarian support to the families of Covid-19 patients irrespective of religion, caste or creed. Many are struggling to get food due to the strict enforcement of lockdown. We have been distributing 200 food packets, 200 water bottles, 200 face masks and 100 kg of banana daily,” Amer told TOI. He said he knew the pain of the attendants of Covid-19 patients as he had experienced it when his father was admitted to hospital multiple times. “I noticed attendants, despite having money, are struggling to get food. This moved me to take up the service,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/excise-si-feeds-200-at-govt-hospital-in-karimnagar-daily/articleshow/83268321.cms||Syed Akbar

Maharashtra’s Covid toll would be closest to France, which has recorded 1.09 lakh deaths so far. On Saturday, when the state registered its lowest single-day case count (13,659) in 87 days or nearly 3 months (since March 10, when 13,659 cases were registered), 741 deaths were added to the toll.

A condition with regards to the same is also imposed in the building permit order issued to the applicant. The decision to act tough against individuals and builders resorting to illegal constructions came after the civic body formed zonal-wise task force teams. As on date, though the clause is mentioned in the building permit rules, very few builders were found to be following it. “Action would be initiated against those violating the norms by not displaying the sanctioned plan,” the GHMC order read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/blgd-plan-display-must-at-sites-ghmc/articleshow/83267521.cms||---

Maharashtra’s Covid toll would be closest to France, which has recorded 1.09 lakh deaths so far. On Saturday, when the state registered its lowest single-day case count (13,659) in 87 days or nearly 3 months (since March 10, when 13,659 cases were registered), 741 deaths were added to the toll. Of these, only 300 deaths were registered on Saturday, while the remaining 441 were deaths that occurred over a week ago. The state thus had a toll of 99,512 deaths on Saturday.   “With cases in the state reporting a drop for the last two weeks, the fatalities too will start to report a dip in the next few days,” said an state official. “Maharashtra has been reporting deaths diligently and in a thorough manner. If it has a thick tail as far as cases and deaths go, it is because of a better public health network,” said a senior doctor.

Much of central and north Kerala did not get the feel of the monsoon at all. But weather agencies have indicated that there will be enhanced monsoon activity over the Bay of Bengal which could increase the rainfall in the state. IMD said an off-shore trough persists from south Maharashtra coast to south Kerala coast. The southwest monsoon is likely to advance to the central Arabian Sea, Maharashtra, Karnataka, parts of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu during the next 24 hours. Private weather agency Skymet Weather said Madden Julian Oscillation (a pulse of clouds and rain transiting along the equatorial belt around the globe impacting weather conditions over a specific region) is expected to move across the Indian Ocean during the next week. Monsoon depression is likely to form in about a week’s time to coincide with its passage and invigorate the monsoon current to accentuate rainfall activity. “Due to the two close cyclones, the onset over Kerala took place on a weak note. It is likely to start gaining vigour from the second week of June, once the low-pressure systems start forming over Bay of Bengal,” said S Abhilash, director-ST Radar centre, Cochin University. “It is normal to have low pressure systems and depressions during the monsoon season,” he said. After two days of normal rainfall, there will be isolated heavy rainfall of 7-11cm from June 8 over south and parts of central Kerala, including Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki. The wind will be squally with speeds reaching 40-50kmph gusting to 60kmph during these days over the Kerala coasts. Peerumedu, Poonjar, Anchal, and Konni recorded 4cm of rainfall each on Saturday, while Kumarakom and Vaikom, Idukki, Perumbavur, Chalakudy, Hosdurg, Thenmala, Neeleswaram and Chimoni received 3cm rainfall each. Varkala, Ernakulam South, Alathur, Mananthavady, Thalassery, Kudulu, Peringalkuthu, Vakkom, Kakkayam and Palluruthy got 2cm of rainfall each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/heavy-rains-likely-in-south-kerala-by-june-8/articleshow/83267525.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Jaipur||Drugs worth over Rs 15cr seized in 3 ops in 2 wks||Jaipur: The state police has seized over Rs 15 crore (based on MRP) of intoxicating drugs in three operations in the past two weeks hinting at a new trend of drug consumption in the state. Several districts have been alerted since the drugs were to be supplied there. However, the main kingpin Shyam Sunder Mundra, a distributer and Rahul Chauhan, the main agent, are yet to be arrested. Jaipur police has arrested three prime suspects behind the intoxicant drugs seized in Jaipur and Ajmer on May 23 and 24, respectively. The seized drug is in the form of tablets and was to be delivered in small towns and cities in central and western districts of the state. Police have kept over 30 distributors and several medical shops under lens for selling drugs to youngsters without doctors’ prescription. The consignment was made for towns like Ajmer, Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Jodhpur and Sri Ganganagar. "The school, college-goers and those in the late twenties are the prime targets. Unlike the traditional drugs, these are quite expensive which means the middle class, upper-middle class and the elite groups are the target," said an official. DCP, crime, Jaipur police commissionerate, Digant Anand said the seizure of drugs and investigation points towards a connection between the drugs seized in small towns in the last few months and the major seizure on May 23."These drugs were purchased from manufactures based in Dehradun, Solan, Mohali and Parwanu while distributors are based in the North-East. The intelligence agencies have zeroed in on several distributors who are behind the business," said Anand, while adding all the intoxicated drugs were manufactured in May month. Dalbeer Singh, SHO, Ajmer dargah, said that they have increased vigil in the vulnerable areas to prevent penetration of such modern drugs. "Some drug peddlers have been arrested under my jurisdiction," said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/drugs-worth-over-rs-15cr-seized-in-3-ops-in-2-wks/articleshow/83268310.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||A mobile clinic that caters to non-Covid cases||Thiruvananthapuram: Considering the difficulty of the public to visit hospitals during the time of the pandemic, Chirayinkeezhu grama panchayat has launched a mobile clinic that moves across the wards for non-Covid patients. District panchayat vice-president Shailaja Beegum inaugurated the health programme named ‘Arikilondu Doctor’ on Thursday. “The initiative aims at providing free treatment and medicines for non-Covid patients across 19 wards, including elderly and children who find it difficult to visit hospitals for their regular check-ups, as the taluk hospital here has been turned to Covid hospital. In the wake of Covid-19, many with non-communicable diseases like diabetes and blood pressure find it difficult to travel to hospitals and thereby their medications were also ceased. The mobile clinic that functions with a doctor, two nurses and a pharmacist also provides medicines for diabetes, blood pressure, asthma, etc. Also, the clinic has the facility to check oxygen level, diabetes, etc.,” said Chirayinkeezhu panchayat president P Murali. “The mobile clinic will be moving across all wards and a schedule has been prepared to ensure effective service. According to the schedule, the clinic will halt for one hour at two centres in each ward. Details regarding time and day have been already given to the ward members. Apart from that public were informed of this service through mike announcements and posters,” he added. The panchayat uses a school bus as mobile clinic. “Though the government has set up eSanjeevani app to facilitate teleconsultations, the majority here are unaware of such services. For such patients, this is found to be beneficial. Panchayat has raised the fund for this programme with the support of locals. Apart from this, the panchayat has also set up an ambulance for Covid patients. It will also start functioning soon,” said Chirayinkeezhu panchayat vice-president Saritha R. Around 30 patients were attended on the first day of the mobile clinic. Dr Fathima H said, “Most of them were elderly patients with a previous history of non-communicable diseases. Only a few reported old-age problems. If the patient needs advanced treatment we refer them to nearby public health centres. Every time we meet the patients, we adhere to Covid protocols, including social distancing, wearing face masks, face shield and gloves. In order to avoid the rush, the ward members provide token and allot time for the patients to visit the mobile clinic,” said Dr Fathima. “This is a great initiative launched by the Chirayinkeezhu panchayat. When I was told about this programme without any second thought I agreed to be a part of it. As a doctor I consider it as an opportunity to serve society,” said Dr Arya S Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-mobile-clinic-that-caters-to-non-covid-cases/articleshow/83267527.cms||---
---||Thane||Mumbai & MMR opening up, least curbs in Kalyan, Navi Mumbai||MUMBAI: A day after the state government announced easing of restrictions across five levels, it was clear that while Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and Thane fall in Level 3, where most sectors can be opened up but with restrictions, in the city’s neighbourhood—the Kalyan-Dombivli municipal corporation and Navi Mumbai civic body—are in Level 2 and can expect significant relaxations. Ten districts of the state and 3 municipal corporations fall under Level 1 and can go in for a complete unlock from Monday. Aurangabad, Nagpur and Solapur civic corporations, along with districts like Ahmednagar, Jalna, Jalgaon and Latur are in Level 1, with their weekly positivity rate less than 5% and oxygen bed occupancy less than 25%. Most districts were yet to issue official unlock orders, which are likely on Sunday, but officials said some districts were not in favour of total relaxation as they feared a fresh surge. District collectors held a review meeting with chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Saturday. Corporations with a 10 lakh-plus population have been treated as entities separate from a district for the process, officials said. Districts like Hingoli and Nandurbar are in Level 2, along with KDMC and Navi Mumbai. In these places, all essential and non-essential shops can remain open during regular hours, while restaurants can do business, including dine-in, with 50% capacity, along with malls and multiplexes which will also function at 50% capacity. TOI had on Saturday reported that Mumbai was in Level 3. The BMC on Saturday reiterated this and said all relaxations allowed by the state at this level will be applicable, except that women – except those in essential services – will not be allowed to travel by local trains. Friday’s state order had said local trains should be restricted for medical and essential workers and women. Mumbai narrowly missed being in Level 2 as its positivity in the week May 28-June 3 was 5.56%, slightly higher than the eligible rate for Level 2 and occupancy rate was 32.51% for oxygen beds. The NMMC narrowly missed being in Level 1 as it has a positivity rate of 2% but 26% oxygen bed occupancy; Level 1 requires 25% or less occupancy. With Thane district falling in Level 3, smaller corporations there like Mira-Bhayandar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur and Ulhasnagar will also fall in that category. While Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad cities are in Level 3 and will open up, rural areas of the district will go slow with Pune rural areas coming under Level 4 restrictions. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said the district being considered as three different units will help monitor rise in cases. A KDMC health official said it has a positivity rate of 4.5% while bed occupancy is 33.93%. On the other hand, the Panvel civic body is in Level 4 as it is in Raigad district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/city-mmr-opening-up-least-curbs-in-kalyan-navi-mumbai/articleshow/83273795.cms||---

Nearly 80% complained of health anxiety while more than 50% confirmed about other issues. According to the survey conducted over a period of a month, approximately 79.6% elderly complained of health anxiety due to rising Covid cases and casualties around them during the past month in the state. Around 67% elderly were found suffering from sleeplessness, insomnia and nightmares due to poor quality of sleep. Agewell Foundation founder Himanshu Rath said, “During the last month of second wave of pandemic, there was a rise of 50% in the number of older people seeking counselling/help for psychological issues like depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, fear, stress, sense of loneliness/isolation etc. Most older persons, despite having access to resources, are finding themselves helpless and vulnerable due to fast spreading coronavirus. It has devastated their peace of mind and life. They need urgent help in the form of counselling, useful tips and information, health care as well as emotional support.” It was also found that 63% elderly have developed symptoms of depression due to loneliness, social isolation. Further 62.4% elderly also complained of unceasing stress during Covid-hit period. “In view of the surge in cases across the country and a huge burden on the healthcare system, older people are afraid of the Covid consequences during the course of the disease. They seem much worried about getting a bed and proper treatment in hospital if they or any of their family members is ever in need”, added Rath. The organisation recommended that door-to-door step healthcare services should be provided for the senior citizens and dedicated programmes should be developed for their overall well-being including trained professionals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nearly-80-elderly-people-complain-of-anxiety-over-health-finds-survey/articleshow/83268328.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Raj’s progress on achieving devpt goals spotty: Report||Jaipur: Rajasthan’s progress in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) has been spotty, as per the SDG India Index released by Niti Aayog on Thursday. The state’s score improved just by 3 points to 60 in 2020, while the country’s average score rose from 60 to 66 out of 100.The state’s growth rate has been the lowest in the country after Bihar, West Bengal and Assam with its score rising reluctantly from 57 in 2019 to 60 in 2020. Unemployment, crime, lack of drinking water, pollution, and fewer number of women in Panchayati Raj Institutions, and lower number of toilets for girls in schools weighed on the progress to achieve 100% target by 2030.While the state has done well in poverty reduction by increasing MNREGA work, improved its goals under good health and well-being by reducing maternal mortality, mortality under five years of age, and better immunisation, it has failed to bring down crime and pollution. Murders per 1 lakh population have increased to 2.10 from 1.98, cognizable crimes against children have also seen an uptick. While the ratio of courts per 1 lakh population remained stagnant at 1.90, cases under Prevention of Corruption Act and related IPC per 10 lakh population risen to 5.46 from 5.40 in the past one year.The report revealed that even though the state has increased significantly the share of renewable in total energy mix and brought down CO2 by use of more number of LED bulbs, it has not been able to control rising pollution. According to the ‘India: Health of the Nation’s States 2017’ report, (disability adjusted life years) DALY rate due to air pollution at the India level was 3,469. The most affected state was Rajasthan with a DALY rate of 4,528, while the least affected state was Nagaland with a DALY rate of 1,408.When it comes to housing, drainage, door-to-door waste collection, Rajasthan has done fairly better scoring 81 out of 100. But under the ‘Life on Land’ goal, the geographical harsh realities of the state caught up the state and lowered its score to just 43 out of 100. Rajasthan’s forest and tree cover as a percentage of total geographical area is one of the lowest. Even though there is marginal increase in forest and tree cover reaching to 7.23% of the total area, the highest share of degraded land (52.69% of the total land area), has pulled down the scoring in the SDG goal to a very low level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajs-progress-on-achieving-devpt-goals-spotty-report/articleshow/83268319.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC to consider if Ludo is a game of chance or skill||MUMBAI: Is Ludo a game of chance or skill? This is a question the Bombay high court will consider. On June 3, the vacation bench issued notice to the state government on an application filed by a Mumbai politician seeking an FIR under the Prevention of Gambling Act against a company that operates online Ludo with money at stake. The players stand a chance of winning real “prize money” on the app, the HC was informed. Senior counsel Raja Thakare, appearing for a leader of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), said the challenge was to a February 2, 2021, order passed by a metropolitan magistrate at the Girgaon court rejecting his private complaint and refusing to direct police to register a first information report (FIR) under the anti-gambling law or cheating under the Indian Penal Code. The plea is for HC to declare Ludo a game of chance and not skill and it would attract provisions of Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act as it is played for stakes. The magistrate held Ludo is not a “game of chance” but “a game of skill” and that it requires skill to win the game. The bench of Justices S S Shinde and Abhay Ahuja asked Thakare why the sessions court was not approached first via an application for revision of the magistrate’s order. Thakare said the issue involved is larger, involving a substantial question of law on what the game constitutes, which only the HC could go into. He submitted the magistrate’s order was “erroneous as Ludo is a game of chance and not a game of skill and the provisions of Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act shall apply if the game is played for stakes.” The bench then issued notice, adjourned the matter to June 22 for a hearing, and said the state may file its reply by then. The application said his complaint against the company (not made a party before the HC) was filed on November 3, 2020, before Girgaon police station, after he saw children playing online Ludo with money at stake.  The plea before the HC stated that the app is allowed in two modes: ‘Online’ with unknown opponents on permission of a ‘host’ who is also on the app or ‘with friends’ who are known people via the app. There is an entry fee to join a ‘table’ in the ‘online mode’ and a portion of the fee is remitted to the game app. The claim before the HC is though it appears no player has control over what the dice rolls out, “the app and algorithm used by it” having a possible control over the roll of the dice “cannot be disregarded’’ and needs investigation. The applicant, MNS member K R Muley’s contention is playing Ludo for stakes amounts to betting or gambling and providing any place for such a game of Ludo would attract Section 4 of the Gambling Act as an offence of opening a “common gaming house for profit”. In 1996, the SC had said horse racing was a “game of skill” and does not fall within the ambit of the gambling prevention Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-to-consider-if-ludo-is-a-game-of-chance-or-skill/articleshow/83268340.cms||Swati Deshpande

The zoo authorities shared the news of the birth of two animals on World Environment Day. A male gaur calf, was born on June 2, and has been named ‘Kumaram Bheem’ by R Sobha, principal chief conservator of forest, in honour of the Gond tribal leader. The male one-horned rhinoceros, who is named Nanda, was born a fortnight ago. Sobha said: “The zoo is in the forefront in conservation and breeding of wild animals and birth of mega herbivores are worth a cheer in an otherwise gloomy pandemic situation.” Celebrating the World Environment Day, the zoo authorities organised a plantation programme of native wild species, especially the wild fruit-bearing trees, to improve the biodiversity of the premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rhino-gaur-cubs-cheer-for-nehru-zoo/articleshow/83267528.cms||---

While Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad cities are in Level 3 and will open up, rural areas of the district will go slow with Pune rural areas coming under Level 4 restrictions. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said the district being considered as three different units will help monitor rise in cases. A KDMC health official said it has a positivity rate of 4.5% while bed occupancy is 33.93%.

---||Kochi||SIT collects Ravi Pujari’s voice samples||Kochi: Special investigation team (SIT) probing the salon shooting case involving dreaded gangster Ravi Pujari collected his voice samples at Kochi on Saturday. The investigation team would now compare the voice samples of the gangster with his available voice clips, including the voice in the call he made to a vernacular TV channel claiming responsibility for the firing incident. The gangster had reportedly decided to target actor Leena Maria Paul after her name got connected with financial misappropriation cases. Police believe that the accused used gangs based in south India to hire shooters to threaten and extort from the actor, whom he believed made money through the crimes alleged against her. The youngsters who were arrested for reaching the salon in Kochi and firing, reportedly had no experience in handling a firearm and were given training before they executed the crime. Police are now on the lookout for others who could have been involved in arranging the execution of the extortion bid in Kerala. Sources said that the gangster was interrogated to find more about the accomplices whom he had contacted while hiding in Senegal. In August 2020, the government handed over the salon shooting case to the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) to conduct a comprehensive probe into the gangster’s activities in Kerala. Till then, local police as well as the crime branch had probed the case. The crime branch team made three arrests in the case and recovered the revolver used in the crime. The SIT is likely to question Pujari regarding his calls to other prominent personalities in Kerala, including politicians and businessmen. The salon shooting case refers to Pujari hiring two ‘shooters’ to fire at the salon run by Paul in Kochi on December 15, 2018. It was later revealed that Pujari had reportedly sought money from the actor, a month before the incident. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sit-collects-ravi-pujaris-voice-samples/articleshow/83267532.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||World||India-born engineer has key role in Nasa Artemis mission||MELBOURNE: As the first leg of Artemis, Nasa’s ambitious project to send a spacecraft into deep space, begins, overseeing the rocket’s core stage, or its backbone, will be Coimbatore-born Subashini Iyer. “It has been nearly 50 years since we last stepped on the moon … We are getting ready to take humans back to the moon and beyond, to Mars,” Iyer told TOI.  Artemis I will be an uncrewed flight of the spacecraft Orion, the first of three complex missions for exploration on the moon and Mars. Orion will travel 280,000 miles (over 4,50,000 km) from Earth, thousands of miles beyond the moon in a three-week mission. It will collect data while mission controllers will go over the performance of the spacecraft to set the stage for Artemis II, when a crewed spacecraft will orbit the moon. In 2024, Artemis III will take astronauts to the moon.  As the launch integrated product team lead with Boeing, Iyer is engaged with the component of the Artemis I which will take Orion into space — the Space Launch System (SLS) — whose core stage arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in late April. She has been involved with SLS for two years now. “My role involves overseeing any support that Nasa needs once the core stage is built and handed over to Nasa,” Iyer said. Iyer was one of the first women to graduate in mechanical engineering in her college, VLB Janakiammal College, in 1992. Now, she leads a diverse team of mechanical and electrical engineers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/india-born-engineer-has-key-role-in-nasa-artemis-mission/articleshow/83271818.cms||Priyanka A Chokhani

Coordinated climate adaption and mitigation planning is envisaged by 2030. Announcing the plan in Gandhinagar, chief minister Vijay Rupani said that Gujarat had become the first state in the country to implement a long-term action programme to address the challenges of climate change. The plan, prepared by the state’s climate change department in collaboration with experts from IIM-A and IIT-Gn, covers aspects such as renewable energy, energy conservation, forestry, coastal areas, tribal areas, animal husbandry, agriculture, and health. The state’s action plan aims to build a sustainable and climate-resilient future for its people in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, a government statement said. The plan has thematic groups representing the key priorities for Gujarat such as agriculture, water, health, forests and biodiversity, sea-level rise and coastal infrastructure, energy efficiency and renewable energy, urban development, and green jobs. It will have strategies such as people’s participation, mobilizing private investment as well as policy measures and public investment, the government release said. “Gujarat has placed a special emphasis on the use of solar and wind energy and electric vehicles for environmental protection,” Rupani said in his address at the event. “The state government has decided not to allow new thermal power plants, and has instead realized the effort of green, clean energy by generating 9,000MW of wind and 5,000MW of solar energy.” In the coming days, the CM said, Gujarat will be a leader in this field by producing 30 gigawatt of solar and wind energy. He added that his government was also promoting CNG and electric vehicles for pollution-free transportation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/climate-change-action-plan-launched-by-cm/articleshow/83267558.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Edu-tech project for visually impaired kids funded by SSIP||When a young kid is taught about shapes, one looks at those shapes, reads and hears what they are called, and then learns about each one. For instance, a circle looks round, a square has equal edges and four corners, and so on. Teaching this to a visually impaired child is a different process and even as they learn about different shapes, they are often unable to visualize it. Addressing this through a technology solution, postgraduate and doctorate scholars, Sarth Jha and Harshvardhan Jha came up with an innovation that helps visually impaired persons learn about shapes and visualize them easily. The project, which is in the testing phase currently, is funded by the Student Start-up and Innovation Programme (SSIP) of the state government. "We have received funds worth Rs 70,000 for the initial phase of the project. Using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, we have developed a device to help students self-learn about shapes and objects. We can use plastic or wooden toys of different shapes and sizes. A student just has to pick it up in their hand and place it on the detection pad of the device. The device will detect the object, for instance, an apple, and then play audio describing its shape, size, look. This way, the visually impaired student can get information about an object while getting to touch and feel it so that one understands better," said Sarth, explaining about the technology. Connecting the device to a bone-conducting earphone and a visual device can also help hearing-impaired students learn about objects in a similar way. At present, the device is being tested. "We want to build more prototypes and based on the feedback, we also want to improvise on the design so that it is more accurate. We have applied for additional funding under SSIP and we expect it will soon be cleared. We will send out the product for field testing by end of June," said Sarth. While Sarth is an MBA student from Sardar Patel University, Harshvardhan is pursuing his PhD in renewable energy from the same varsity. "Once the product is built, we plan to give it to various organizations and schools where visually impaired students take education. We will arrange for the funding through CSR partnerships and later give it for contract manufacturing so that it has a wider reach," said Sarth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/edu-tech-project-for-visually-impaired-kids-funded-by-ssip/articleshow/83267537.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Chandigarh||Haryana sets 2 lakh acre target for crop diversification||Amit Kumar Karnal: To take care of the declining water table and encourage farmers to move away from the water-guzzling paddy, the Haryana government has set a target to bring two-lakh acres of land under the crop diversification scheme, “Mera Pani Meri Virasat.” Farmers can switch to crops that require less water like maize, pulses (urad dal, arhar dal, Moong, moth, Soyabin, Guar), til, cotton, groundnut, castor, kharif onion and all Kharif fodder. However, the government dropped Bajra crop from the scheme this season. Under the scheme, an incentive of Rs 7,000 per acre will be given to farmers for making the switch from paddy. According to data provided by the agriculture department, of the total 2 lakh acre target set under this scheme, the largest is under cotton (1,10,850 acres), followed by fodder/fallow (43,900 acres), horticulture crops (30,000 acres), maize (11,991 acres), groundnut and til (2,000 acres) and pulses (1,260 acres). The government has also set district-wise target of diversification. Sirsa district topped the table with 29,010 acres, followed by Jind at 24,910 acres, Fatehabad at 24,255, Hisar at 16,825, Kaithal at 13,115, Bhiwani at 10,535, Sonipat at 10,260, Jhajjar at 9,690, Karnal at 8,200, Charkhi Dadri at 7,680, Ambala at 7,150, Rohtak at 6,440, Kurukshetra at 6,350, Yamunanagar at 6,280, Panipat 5,140, Faridabad 2,955, Panchkula 2,660, Rewari 2,370, Palwal 2,200, Mewat 1,566, Gurgaon 1,410, and Mahindergarh 1,000. The state government said the crop sown would be procured at minimum support price (if it falls under MSP fixed by the government). Interested farmers have to register themselves on any two portals - MFMB and MPMV portal. The portal will be kept open for registration by farmers till June 26. The government has issued directions to the deputy director of agriculture to make all efforts to achieve the target. Zone-wise officers have also been deputed. In 2020, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar launched “Mera Pani Meri Virasat Yojana” under crop diversification to conserve water. Karnal deputy director, (agriculture), Aditya Dabas said the move is essential to conserve water in the state. He urged farmers to sow crops which require less water than paddy to ensure availability of water for future generations. SDO Dinesh Sharma said only those farmers who had cultivated paddy last year and want to cultivate alternate crops on the same field during this season are eligible. Farmers who adopted crop diversification during the last Kharif 2020 under MPMV are also eligible for getting incentives.

The man, a bachelor hailing from Pathanamthitta, was carrying the tumor with a size of 50x27x26 cm when it was removed. “He was carrying it for the last three years without any apparent discomfort except the distension on the abdomen and had no plans of seeing a doctor until his relatives forced him to do so,” said Dr B Jayanand Sunil, surgical oncologist, KIMSHEALTH Cancer Centre. The patient knew about his tumor a year ago after a scan was done on him. But, since it did not interfere with his day to day life, he ignored it. It was a touch and go situation as the tumor, diagnosed as liposarcoma, was in the retro-peritoneum in the vicinity of the left kidney, left ureter and major vessels. Besides a biopsy, the patient was subjected to multiple investigations, including a PET scan, to ascertain that the malignancy had not spread to other organs, if it had, a surgery would have been futile, said Dr Sunil. Liposarcoma is a cancer that arises in fat cells in body’s soft tissue, such as the inside of the thigh or abdomen. It is a rare type of cancer that is typically a large, bulky tumor, and tends to have multiple smaller satellites extending beyond the main confines of the tumor. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/11kg-tumour-removed-from-mans-abdomen/articleshow/83267567.cms||---

As per the city corporation officials, they are collecting about 950 tonnes of waste on an average a day now, in addition to 200kg-300kg medical waste. This is at least 100 tonnes to 150 tonnes lesser than the waste collected on a normal day. A senior corporation official said, “The city used to generate about 1,000 tonnes to 1,100 tonnes waste earlier. At least 55% of them was wet waste and the remaining dry waste. After the lockdown, we have been noticing a considerable difference in the quantity of garbage generated in the city. It is mainly because of the closure of commercial establishments and eateries.” Pointing out that garbage was not collected on Sundays, he said as such the quantity would be higher on Mondays. “Even then, we had collected only 1,100 tonnes of waste last Monday. While the wet waste from the households in certain areas is sent directly to the micro composting centres, both the wet and dry waste from other areas is sent to the Vellalore dump yard.” A sanitary supervisor confirmed that the quantity of waste collected from residential areas has come down. “We used to collect about 4.5 tonnes of waste from two wards on a normal day. But it has come down by 50% in the past couple of weeks. Instead of the usual two trips, garbage trucks only do one trip a day now.” Another corporation official said they had deployed a separate vehicle per zone to collect the medical waste from triage centres, Covid care centres and containment areas. “We have distributed yellow bags to the sanitary workers to collect the waste. We collect about 200kg to 300kg medical waste a day and that is handed over to a private company, which is approved to process biomedical waste.” While some residents hand over used gloves and masks separately, others just dispose them of along with the wet waste, the sanitary supervisor said. “The habit of mixing masks with other waste has, however, come down significantly as many people are using reusable masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/garbage-generation-dips-in-city-by-100-150-tonnes/articleshow/83267582.cms||Nivedha Selvam

In a span of eight years, Rupwate began to advocate strongly for prisoner rights and managed to release around 200 of them on bail. Now, in a hope to widen her horizon in criminal justice, the 34-year-old first-generation learner secured admission at a German university for masters. With meagre resources at hand, the daughter of a farmer is banking on crowdfunding to achieve her dream. With limited funding and unviable education loan options, many students such as Rupwate are turning to crowdfunding platforms to fund their higher education. The number has gone up in the pandemic as many families suffered financial setbacks and several scholarships discontinued. Youngsters are reaching out to strangers on online platforms to raise funds for their academic pursuits. Rupwate, a Badlapur resident, had offer letters from several universities in the UK but managed only about 10-20% of the expenses as scholarships. She settled for Viadrina University, Germany, as the fees were relatively less. On her friends’ insistence she launched a campaign on Ketto and managed to raise Rs 17 lakh in eight days— over 80% of her requirement. Crowdfunding platform Milaap hosted about 9,200 fundraisers for educational causes in just about five months this year. The number was around 11,000 in the whole of 2020 and 7,618 in 2019. “Next to medical emergencies, education has been the second highest category for which campaigns are set up,” said Anoj Viswanathan, co-founder and president of Milaap. Education categories include funds raised by individuals for higher studies in India and abroad, infrastructure of schools and supply of material to underprivileged children. Zaheer Adenwala, co-founder of Ketto, another platform, said the number of campaigns for education has risen 100% from the previous financial year from 110 to 224. Recently, music artist Sumeet Samos, a JNU alumnus, crowdfunded Rs 37 lakh from 1,575 supporters on Milaap in less than a day, towards his education at Oxford. Samos’ success inspired Pallabi Sagar, an MA (social work) student from TISS, to raise Rs 90,000 to settle her tuition fee at the institute in Mumbai. “I had to settle my dues and get my marksheets from the institute,” she said. Daughter of a daily wage worker from Odisha, Pallabi now aspires to pursue her PhD. Families and friends are also raising funds for students studying in Indian institutions, after losing an earning member of the family to Covid. Campaigns are being launched for contributions as low as Rs 20,000. Kashmir’s Darakshan Ali, mother to an 11-month-old, secured admission at University of Edinburgh for MSc in Advanced Technology for Financial Computing. Abhishek Vyas, a graduate from National Law University, had an admission offer from Cambridge University last year but had to decline due to lack of funds. Now, he has pinned his hopes on crowdfunding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-pandemic-crowdfunding-for-higher-education-gains-traction/articleshow/83268414.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Ahmedabad||US sales of Gujarat pharma firms slump||AHMEDABAD: Even as overall pharma exports showed a robust growth in 2020-21, Gujarat-based top pharma companies’ revenues from the US market declined in the fourth quarter ended March 31. The US market sales were largely impacted due to the price erosion in old products due to increased competition. The lower US sales, however, were offset by the growth in domestic market sales, said industry players. Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd’s US sales dipped by 30% to Rs 269 crore in Jan-March quarter over the same period last fiscal, while Vadodara-headquartered Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited’s revenues from the US plummeted by 18% to Rs 475 crore. Cadila Healthcare’s formulation business revenues eased 6% to Rs 1,509 crore in Q4 when compared with the preceding third quarter of 2020-21. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s sales came down by 1.3% in Q4. Other pharma companies like Lupin and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories also reported lower revenues from the North American market. Torrent attributed the dip in revenues to the lack of new product approvals pending USFDA re-inspection of its manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the base business was also impacted on account of high single digit price erosion and discontinuation of Sartan group of medicines. “We continue to file double digit ANDAs (Abbreviated New Drug Applications), which will help in having double digit launches once we see USFDA clear our facilities,” the company said. According to an analyst, the Cadila Healthcare’s sales in the US were down on Q-o-Q basis due to weak flu season, homebound population in lockdown and price erosion in older products. “US market always goes through cycles. There are cycles when one sees hyper competition and price erosion. You will see these ups and downs in the US market. Six-month or one-year is too short a period to take a view. Rather a period of 2-3 years should be considered,” said Dr Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Limited, the flagship company of Zydus Cadila Group. Pharma players further stated that dispensation of prescriptions in US also slowed down due to Covid-19, which also affected the retail offtake of medicines. However, the domestic sales growth of these pharma companies helped them offset lower revenues from the US market. Torrent Pharma’s domestic sales grew 10%, while Cadila Healthcare’s domestic sales surged 18%. Alembic Pharma’s India sales rose 5%, according to the Q4 financial results of these companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/us-sales-of-gujarat-pharma-firms-slump/articleshow/83267579.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Coimbatore||Horticulture farmers reel under labour shortage, low prices||Coimbatore: Sweet potatoes cultivated in 1.5 acres of P Kandasamy’s farm at Madukkarai are ready for harvest. However, farm labourers are refusing to turn up for work due to the lockdown and traders are not coming to pick up the produce. Sweet potatoes will rot if left in the ground for long, especially with monsoon around the corner, says Kandasamy. He is not the only farmer facing challenges during the lockdown. A growing number of farmers in the district, especially those who cultivate vegetables that have to be harvested year-long, are facing a crisis because of labourer shortage and traders looking for the cheapest possible price. Pasupathy, who is growing lady’s finger in his farm at Vazhukkuparai, has started plucking the produce with the help of his mother and sister every alternate day, and selling directly to consumers. “You can’t leave vegetables without harvesting too long. So, we have begun plucking a few kilograms ourselves till people come for work,” he told TOI. “The only saving grace is the increase of vegetable price at the farmgate from the earlier Rs Rs 5 to Rs Rs 6 per kilogram, which was not even covering labour cost, to Rs Rs 15 now. “It is still not enough. We need the farmgate price to increase to at least Rs Rs 20.” Several farmers had spent up to Rs Rs 50,000 per acre on manure, labour and seeds. “It is becoming difficult to even get back the money spent on cultivation,” says Kandasamy, who hopes to get Rs Rs 10/kg, so that he won’t have to get into debt. B Sathish, who cultivates lady’s finger at his farm 8km from Chavadi, says traders offered him Rs Rs 2/kg. “We are wondering how we can feed ourselves this year.” It’s high time to introduce minimum support price for vegetables and milk, say farmers’ associations. “Traders are offering us rock-bottom prices. With hotels and caterers seeing low business and many even closing, traders don’t have enough business. As people are working from home and staying indoors, consumption seems to have fallen,” says Karthik Krishnakumar of Tamil Nadu Vivaisaigal Sangam. “Even dairy farmers supplying to the private sector are getting hardly Rs Rs 22/litre, which is not feasible at all,” he adds. The last year has been so challenging that they are now planning to give up cultivation of vegetables altogether and stick to banana and coconut trees, farmers say. “They are risk-free. But if all farmers give up horticulture, there will be a food crisis soon,” adds Kandasamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/horticulture-farmers-reel-under-labour-shortage-low-prices/articleshow/83267597.cms||---

Sleuths from central crime branch have seized Rs 3.7 crore from Johny K V, a resident of Basaveshwaranagar. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Sandeep Patil said Johny, a native of Arakkunnam in Ernakulam, cheated many persons by claiming to be the director of ‘JAAlifestyle India Pvt Ltd’ with its office in KHB Colony, Basaveshwaranagar, and headquarters in London. He promised Rs 240 per day for just watching the advertisements. “Claiming that there’re launching an advertisement project, he asked those wishing to become a member to make an online payment of Rs 1,109. He lured people saying the member would be given the task of viewing 60 advertisements per day and Rs 4 would be paid per advertisement. If the member brings 10 more persons, he/she will be paid Rs 4,400 as commission. Those introducing 10,000 members will get Rs 17.6 lakh and for 1 crore members, the promised commission was Rs 352 crore,” Patil said. Johny retired from the military as Lance Naik after serving for 18 years and came to Bengaluru in October 2020. Police said they have taken help from cybercrime experts to probe into his dealings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ex-army-man-held-for-fraud/articleshow/83267603.cms||---

A Mumbai Metro One Private Limited (MMOPL) spokesperson said to ensure better social distancing, the frequency will be 10 minutes during peak hours and 15 minutes during non-peak hours. Services will increase from 100 to 130 on weekdays. The first train from Versova will be at 6.50am and last train from Ghatkopar at 10.15pm. Stations will open 15 minutes before departure of the first train. The government had permitted resumption of Metro services from October 15, 2020, following lockdown. Mumbai Metro, however, took few days for safety runs. Services were half of pre-Covid days and it was operating at a third of passenger capacity then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-metro-services-to-increase-by-30-from-tomorrow/articleshow/83270693.cms||Manthan K Mehta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: No lockdown for illicit liquor brewers||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The amount of hooch seized by the excise department officers in the district last month suggests that not all tipplers were staying ‘dry’ during the lockdown. The excise officers have seized a total of 200.5 litres of spurious liquor during the month of May. In comparison, only 55 litres of hooch was seized in the previous month. According to senior excise officers in the district, there was only a small increase in the total number of cases recorded in May. This meant that the illicit liquor brewers went on an overdrive to increase productivity. In May, the total number of Abkari Act cases recorded were 119 while in April the corresponding figure was 109. The difference in quantity of wash (the fermented product from which spirit is distilled) seized in the two months would reveal that the brewers were trying to meet high demand. While in April, the amount of wash seized during the raids was just 765 litres, in May the quantity seized was 15,865 litres. Besides the 200 litres of spurious liquor, the officers also seized 131.95 litres of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) that was meant for bootlegging and 277.91 litres of spurious IMFL, mostly smuggled from other states, in May. Deputy excise commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram, N Ashok Kumar said that majority of catches made in the last month were after May 8 when the lockdown came into effect. “This means that the demand just skyrocketed following the closure of bars and government-run liquor outlets,” he said. The officer said that while the department was already maintaining strict vigil, they have reinforced the vigil by launching a special drive across the state called Operation Lockdown under the instructions of excise commissioner S Ananthakrishnan. Under this special drive, the excise officers would join hands with local police to conduct raids in each locality. This is expected to act as a deterrent and reduce the illegal activity of brewing. Kumar added that another thing noticed during the latest lockdown was that several fresh offenders were also there among the arrested while during the lockdown last year, it was mostly habitual offenders who got arrested. The result is reflected in the data of catches made in May 2020. Just 95 litres of hooch and 4,800 litres of wash were seized in May last year. “These newcomers are mostly labourers who lost jobs owing to the lockdown,” Kumar said. During the month of May, the department had also seized 662kg of ganja in the district. This includes two major catches of 400kg of ganja from Kattakkada on May 7 and 250kg of ganja seized from Kuzhivila on May 8. In April, the amount of ganja seized was only 29kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-lockdown-for-illicit-liquor-brewers/articleshow/83267589.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan
---||Hyderabad||Parents in Hyderabad unwilling to admit children to school due to Covid||HYDERABAD: A number of parents in the city are unwilling to admit their children into pre-primary sections due to surge in Covid-19 cases. While some don’t want their children to engage in online classes at such an early stage, others are worried that skipping pre-primary sections may lead to issues while admitting their child in class 1 at a later stage. Srinath K, an IT employee, was to admit his 4-year old daughter in LKG last year. Due to the pandemic, he skipped admission hoping that the situation may improve by 2021. With Covid second wave turning out to be even worse, he is worried over his daughter’s future. “Ideally, this year, my daughter should have been in UKG. While my other eight year old child is comfortably attending online classes, it is not possible for my four-year-old as she is not even aware of the concept of school and learning,” said Srinath. The concern is much the same for other parents who are now teaching basic alphabet, numbers and rhymes to their children at home. “Since I am working from home, I spend some time with my son to give him foundation lessons. Now, I intend to directly seek admission in class 1 once he turns six in 2022,” said Varsha Jose, a parent. Some are unwilling to spend huge amounts towards online education. “When students go to school, they follow a certain discipline and learn inter-social skills. They indulge in physical activities. I don’t find any sense in paying up to Rs 1 lakh for online classes where they’d be merely showing them videos,” said a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-unwilling-to-admit-children-to-school-due-to-covid/articleshow/83268416.cms||Preeti Biswas

He said they would continue with intense Covid-19 control measures until bringing the positivity rate down to 5%.The number of active Covid cases has also come down to 33,658, with 4,656 patients getting discharged from various treatment centres. The number of recovered patients now stands at 1,85,371.The Covid-19 toll shot up to 1,468, with the state including another 43 deaths that occurred in the district in the bulletin. One of the deceased was a 25-year-old man without any comorbidities, who was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) on May 12 and died on Thursday. Among the remaining victims were a 40-year-old man with type-2 diabetes mellitus, who was admitted to the CMCH on May 18 and died of pneumonia on Thursday, and a 45-year-old man who was admitted to a private hospital with fever, cough and breathing difficulties on Wednesday and died on Saturday.The day also saw sub-inspector Gopalan, who was attached to Uthukuzhi police station, succumbing to the virus. He was undergoing treatment in the Erode Medical College. There are unconfirmed reports that his 24-year-old son had also succumbed to the virus a little more than a week ago.Meanwhile, a video of a man, whose father died of Covid-19 on Saturday, accusing the CMCH of putting his father on an empty oxygen cylinder support went viral on the day. However, CMCH dean Dr A Nirmala said the patient’s family had misunderstood the situation. “The cylinder had oxygen. But the patient collapsed suddenly. Oxygen shortage is not the cause for his death.”Health officials said they were testing 10,000 to 12,000 samples a day, despite the drop in the daily caseload.State chief secretary V Irai Anbu, who reviewed the Covid-19 control measures in Coimbatore and Tirupur on Saturday, has instructed the health officers not to relax Covid-19 control measures and efforts to improve the health infrastructure. He also instructed them to shift their focus to rural areas from the urban areas and avoid cases of delayed medical care and hospitalization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/test-positivity-rate-falls-to-17-from-36-in-district/articleshow/83267612.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The complaint was registered by SOG PSI P K Bhut against Shikharval Udaysinh with the Madhavpura police on Thursday for operating the agency without valid registration. Bhut said that during surveillance, they spotted a security guard standing at Vaibhav Complex. When questioned, he identified himself as Mahipalsinh Ravat, a resident of Kubernagar. He told the police team that he worked for Jai Ambe Security Services, and was paid a salary of Rs 8,000 per month. He said that the uniform bearing the logo of the firm had been given to him by the company. The police asked him where the agency was located, but Ravat did not have the address. However, he passed on the owner’s number. When cops called the number, they found out that the firm was owned by Udaysinh. When asked, he told police that he he did not have the licence to operate a security agency but had got the agency registered with the AMC. The Madhavpura police have registered a case against him. The PSI stated that the staff members of the SOG got the information that a private security agency was operating in the city without a valid license.

With donations getting dried up due to precarious economic conditions of many previously well-off community members, these Islamic seminaries are gasping for breath. Having remained shut almost for a year or opened briefly before the second wave forced them to teach online or put the padlocks on the classrooms, a group of heads of madrassas met recently to find a way out. Meeting under the banner of Rabta-e-Madaris, an organization of around 100 madrassas in the city, the madrassa heads and teachers decided to appeal to the community to bail them out. “Before the lockdown, we had an expenditure of around Rs 5 lakh, including the electricity bills of Rs 95000, monthly. Now this electricity bill is coming around Rs 55000 monthly as our madrassa is closed for months and our 4500 students have gone home. The madrassa paid salaries regularly to around 40 staff members till August last year, but since then the salaries have been slashed and many teachers have also left for their native places,” said Mohammed Zahid Khan of Madrassa Meerajul Uloom at Cheetah Camp. Maulana Moin Ashraf Quadri (Moin Mian) who heads Madrassa Jamia Quadria Ashrafia at Grant Road said that it has been extremely difficult to pay the salaries of 24 teachers. “But for the help of a few well-wishers, the madrassa would have been financially ruined. Most of our donors are in deep financial distress and they don’t have surplus cash to donate,” he said. A few madrassas like Quwatul Islam Arabic Madrassa at Pallagalli in Dongri are using the reserved funds to stay afloat. “Our reserved funds and our committee members’ donations have kept us going. Our madrassa is slightly better off than usual madrassas and we have also continued teaching online,” said M A Khalid, the madrassa’s patron. Maulana Burhanuddin Qasmi, director of Jogeshwari-based Markazul Maarif which teaches English language to madrassa graduates, said big madrassas would somehow survive but “many small madrassas have either perished or may perish soon if not helped urgently.” Qaru Naeem taught at a madrassa in Jogeshwari before the first lockdown was announced. As the madrassa closed, he left for his home in Bihar, spent a couple of months there and returned in January this year. “I had hardly settled down when the lockdown was announced again and the madrassa shut. I have barely survived here by borrowing and with help from a few friends,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-madrassas-get-hit-hard-in-second-wave/articleshow/83269434.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Second wave serves a bigger blow to restaurants||Dilip Thakkar runs a restaurant serving Gujarati thali for 42 years in Ahmedabad. Never has he seen such a time when he had to let go of at least 50% of the staff while operating with just half the staff. “Since the pandemic, revenues have taken a big hit because of frequently changing norms. Even though the business did begin reviving around Diwali, the first and second wave of Covid infections brought along restrictions. As footfalls reduced, meeting even operating expenses became next to impossible,” said Thakkar, who has conditionally let off his staff, promising to hire them back as the situation improves. Crowd control measures and allied restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 spread caused havoc to the restaurant business, bringing order volumes and restaurant footfalls tumbling down. As revenues declined by a significant 60% in 2020-21 against 2019-20, many restaurants shut down, some others downsized their staff and some moved to smaller premises. Similar is the case of Smit Sagar, who runs a restaurant serving international cuisine at Rajkot. Sagar said, “We had a live kitchen concept and hired chefs from different parts of India. But due to the pandemic and related restrictions, the business didn’t take off, and I incurred losses worth Rs 70 lakh and had to relieve some 18 people.” Estimates by Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) Gujarat suggest that at least 10lakh persons are employed across restaurants in the state, of which a significant 50% have lost their jobs or have been forced to take up alternate occupations, as earnings of restaurants went down. The challenge lies the other way around too, say industry stakeholders. Staffers employed with restaurants have taken up farming in their native places or have turned to alternative sources of livelihood as they fear the third wave will bring along similar restrictions and once again affect their income and job security. Outdoor catering business lostBesides dine-ins and takeaway, outdoor catering is a significant source of revenue for restaurateurs. However, estimates suggest that in the past one year, catering business has declined by a whopping 90%. Narendra Somani, president, HRA – Gujarat, and an Ahmedabad-based hotelier and restaurateur, said, “With barely any events taking place, outdoor catering business is at a huge loss. While business conferences and private social gatherings have barely taken place, even we ddings were a muted and downsized affair. Due to this, at least 90% of the outdoor catering business has been wiped out.” Deliveries take a hit tooTakeaway business too was adversely impacted with the second wave. In Ahmedabad, order volumes have come down by at least 50% or more of what they were in March. In pre-pandemic times, the city which used to witness some 75,000 food deliveries every single day, now sees barely 30,000 takeout orders. Similarly, in Rajkot, the number has reduced from 50,000 deliveries in a day to about 10,000 at this point. Third wave fears cloud outlookRestaurateurs are no more optimistic about the near future fearing a third wave of Covid may once again hit business. Thus, many are unwilling to resume. The second wave hit businesses even harder because restaurants have been allowed to operate only for deliveries and stop dine-in services. “People go to restaurants for an entire experience. With dinein services being barred, the revenues dropped 30% against March. Dine-ins account for over half of our revenues. While takeaways do help sustain order volumes, it is no match to the dine-in revenues,” said Rushad Jinwala, owner of an Ahmedabad-based restaurant. “During the first wave, restaurants were closed, and landlords were cooperative. However, this time, all overheads were as is including electricity bills, rent, cost of gas and staffers too,” said Jinwala.

She said being an industrial state with rising number of Covid-19 cases, Tamil Nadu was in need of more number of vaccines to inoculate the industrial workforce. Vanathi said the complete lockdown has had a devasting effect on the state’s economy as well. “At this juncture, I request you to increase the allocation of vaccine to the state to y inoculate the people in the 18-45 age group,” she said. Pointing out that the mucormycosis (black fungus) cases were also on rise in the state, Vanathi also pitched for increase in allocation of Liposomal Amphotericin B to treat the same effectively. The Coimbatore South MLA also urged the Union government to commission and utilize the integrated vaccine facility at Chengalpattu to boost the vaccine production and distribution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vanathi-demands-more-vaccine/articleshow/83267624.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The approval has been granted initially for “distribution and use under controlled condition” of 4 million doses of Covaxin, which can be used only under specific conditions including observation by the ministry of health, a loosely translated version of Anvisa’s announcement said. “After using the 4 million authorised doses, the Agency will analyse the data for monitoring the use of the vaccine in order to assess the next quantities to be imported,” the Anvisa website said. Brazil’s health ministry had placed an order for importing 20 million doses. “For the partial authorization, Anvisa considered the pandemic scenario in Brazil, the adjustments and new data presented in the new import order, as well as the information gaps that still exist in the analysis of Covaxin's data and the mitigation actions proposed by the technical areas,” Anvisa said. “In the case of Covaxin, the director rapporteur Alex Campos highlighted the improvements made in the line of manufacturing (at) Bharat Biotech after the inspection by Anvisa held at the factory in India, in April this year, in addition to the approval of the phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccine in Brazil,” it explained. One of the special conditions laid down by Anvisa for the exceptional import is that all the consignments for Brazil should have been manufactured after the GMP adjustments have been implemented by Bharat Biotech. In March this year, Anvisa had turned down the first import request of the Brazilian health ministry following which the ministry approached Anvisa again in May end. In May-end, Bharat Biotech too submitted two applications to Anvisa seeking approval for GMP certifications for Covaxin’s production line as well as its biological input. In March-end, Anvisa had refused to grant GMP certification to the company’s facilities citing non-compliance with GMP standards based on observations by its inspectors that visited the Genome Valley facility in Hyderabad in the first week of March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/brazil-regulator-nod-to-covaxin-imports/articleshow/83268487.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Delhi||Unlock 2.0: Delhi Metro to run at 50% capacity||NEW DELHI: Four weeks after its services were completely suspended to contain the spread of Covid-19 and 48 days after its doors were closed to passengers not engaged in essential services, Delhi Metro will resume operations from Monday, June 7. If you are planning to travel by the Metro, keep sufficient time on your hands as the trains would be carrying only 10-15% of their usual capacity. While announcing the new relaxations as part of the gradual ‘Unlock’ process on Saturday, CM Arvind Kejriwal said Delhi Metro will be operational with 50% seating capacity. While the Metro was allowed to transport commuters engaged in essential services when the lockdown was imposed from April 19, its services were completely suspended from May 10. Come Monday and the general public would be able to travel by Metro, although it is likely that they would have to wait for a long period before boarding a train. As the trains have been allowed to operate with limited capacity and no standing travel, an eight-coach train that can accommodate around 2,400 passengers will now operate with just around 240 commuters. “Seating will only be allowed on alternate seats with no provision for standing travel till further directions. In view of this stipulation, the capacity utilisation of the system will be around 10-15% of its total capacity available on normal days,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director and spokesperson, DMRC. While public transport buses have been operational throughout the lockdown with 50% seating capacity for those engaged in essential services, their frequency was low due to decreased demand. Cluster Scheme buses, which has a fleet of around 2,990, had been operating 1,655 cluster buses, but would now operate normal services on all routes with restrictions on 50% seating capacity, an official said. Delhi Transport Corporation, meanwhile, would also operate a maximum number of its 3,762 buses with restrictions in place. Cabs, autorickshaws and e-rickshaws, etc, will continue to ply with maximum two passengers. DMRC said it will induct only half of its 336 trains, which make 4,500 trips a day normally, into service on Monday, with a frequency of approximately 5-15 minutes on different corridors. The number of trains and normal frequency will be gradually restored by Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unlock-2-0-metro-to-run-at-50-capacity/articleshow/83267618.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The decision has been taken in the wake of several practices, being followed for tattooing, which is resulting in severe health issues. As per the government decision, a committee headed by local self government secretary has been constituted as the licensing authority in the state. The committee will have a medical officer in charge of a health institution, health supervisor or health inspector from the local body, officer from the district chemical analytical lab and officer from state pollution control board. Only licenced artists and agencies will be allowed to perform tattooing in the state. The licence should be displayed at the centres. The inks used for tattooing has to be approved by the state drugs control department. Only disposable needles and tubes should be used for tattooing. If non-disposable equipment is necessary then there should be a facility for autoclaving at the centres. “The new regulation will come into effect soon. It has been decided to provide a deadline for all tattooing artists and centres to apply for licence in their respective local bodies. After that, none of the centres will be allowed to function in the state without a licence,” said a senior health department official. The artists will have to produce the necessary qualification, training and experience certificates before the committee while applying for the licence. Biomedical waste management rules will have to be followed strictly at the centres for disposing the used syringes and tubes. The health supervisors or the health inspectors from the local bodies will be conducting periodic inspections at the centres to check the biomedical waste management. The director of health services had written to the state government that it should seriously consider banning the unscientific tattooing practices being carried out in the state, especially at festival venues, where the artists are using same needles and inks for different persons. The DHS had alleged that this is causing serious health issues, including spreading of various diseases like hepatitis and tetanus. Even allergic skin diseases are being reported in some cases due to unscientific use of needles. Based on this report, the state government decided to make licensing mandatory for the tattoo artists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/now-licence-must-for-tattoo-artists/articleshow/83267632.cms||---

Final decision regarding the restrictions and relaxations is expected on Sunday. These make it a strong case for complete “unlocking” as per the latest order of the state government. Aurangabad district, excluding the municipal limits, has positivity rate slightly above 5% along with 20% oxygen bed occupancy and could expect certain relaxations. Administrator for Aurangabad municipal corporation Astik Kumar Pandey said the local civic body would formally ratify the order as per local situation. “The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is scheduled to have a meeting on Sunday. The latest Covid situation would be discussed before ratifying the state order,” he said. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan, who heads the DDMA, said they would take a necessary call on relaxation of curbs after reviewing the latest data of the pandemic situation. Elsewhere in the region, Beed and Osmanabad districts are expected to have least relaxations considering higher bed occupancy and positivity rate, whereas Nanded and Latur are eyeing complete unlocking. Beed district collector Ravindra Jagtap said his district falls under ‘Level 3’ as per latest state-level order. “We will issue the district-level order declaring partial curbs and relaxations shortly,” he said. Nanded district has lowest occupancy of oxygen beds (4%) and lowest 1.9% positivity rate in the region. Nanded district collector Dr Vipin Itankar said he would make public announcement about restrictions for breaking the chain through Facebook live on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-city-may-go-for-complete-unlock-order-today/articleshow/83265884.cms||---

The deceased was identified as S Jeevanandham of Bodipalayam near Madukkarai. “Jeevanandham, a college dropout, was a labourer. He was addicted to drugs.

---||Delhi||Mass vax camp for shopkeepers, workers at CP||New Delhi: Before the markets reopen in Delhi from Monday, New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) has decided to get all its shopkeepers and workers at Connaught Place vaccinated. On Saturday, it organised a mass vaccination camp in association with a private clinic after registering around 400 people.“We are the first market association in Delhi to arrange such a facility to ensure that markets remains safe for customers. The camp was organised in the E block corridor with Covid-appropriate norms like social distancing, ventilation, sanitisation, etc., in place. A majority of our members are above 45 or senior citizens and they had earlier managed to get themselves inoculated, but the young workers who are travelling in public transport are still vulnerable to the infection,” said Akshya Jain, joint secretary of NDTA.“To ensure these workers receive the Covid-19 vaccine without any hassles, we had organised the camp and it received great feedback. Shopkeepers bore the cost of vaccination for their employees while the cost of setting up the vaccination camp was incurred by NDTA,” he added.The traders’ body is also planning to organise another camp for non-members and their workers. “We are thankful to New Delhi Municipal Council’s health department for ensuring continuous sanitisation during the camp, sub-divisional magistrate for providing marshals, and Delhi Police for deploying staff. We had also arranged for doctors and ambulances. I am sure that other markets will also be willing to hold such camps and we will provide them guidance if required,” said Amit Gupta, executive member of NDTA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mass-vax-camp-for-shopkeepers-workers-at-cp/articleshow/83267638.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi traders unhappy with odd-even norm||NEW DELHI: While shop owners welcomed Delhi government’s move to open markets and malls from Monday, they were still unhappy at the order to carry out business on an odd-even basis. A number of traders’ associations had earlier stressed to the lieutenant governor and state government that such a scheme for market operations wouldn’t be feasible in most wholesale and retail markets. They have requested LG Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to review the decision, arguing that commercial plots in most markets had multiple shops, some of them even bearing the same address. In such circumstances, it would be difficult to identify which shops should remain closed and which should open. “Almost 90% of Delhi’s traders are against the odd-even scheme because it will cause confusion and chaos,” claimed Paramjeet Singh Pamma, vice-chairman, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association. “When such a format was adopted last year, many shops violated the norms due to confusion. Instead, the government should constitute Covid coordination committees with the help of market associations and give it the responsibility of imposing norms and implement the odd-even scheme, if required.” Vijay Kumar of South Extension I Market Association had another point of discontent. “Shoppers come to several things, not one. Why would they come to buy shoes from a shop one day and then come the following day to buy dresses from another shop? Coming to the markets numerous times is risky in this situation,” he said. “All our shops should be allowed to open. We are planned markets with big common areas so maintaining social distance shouldn’t be an issue.” On Saturday morning, before Delhi government’s relaxation order was released, New Delhi Traders’ Association wrote to the LG to allow complete opening of markets. Atul Bhargava, NDTA president, explained, “We have to pay property taxes, electricity charges and rent for the lockdown period since we haven’t been given relief for the closure period. We can’t run at losses any longer and have to ensure sales start picking up. In our letter, we requested permission for uninterrupted operation of retail markets and commercial centres.” The traders suggested instead that the government could provide adequate Civil Defence personnel, and arrange Covid testing and vaccination camps for the traders and shop employees, a majority of whom are migrants from other states. Hemant Gupta, general secretary, Bhartiya Udyog Vyapaar Mandal, added, “Now that the markets are to open from Monday, arrangements should be made for disinfection of shop and common areas and clearing of drains. Also, traffic police should be deployed to prevent crowding in places like Sadar Bazar, Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh. Though the traders’ associations have distributed circulars in this regard, police action is important to implement them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-unhappy-with-odd-even-norm/articleshow/83267627.cms||Vibha Sharma

In view of preparations for the Kumbh earlier this year, the road connectivity from Dehradun to Haridwar had been improved and several flyovers were made and the roads were widened on the route. A toll plaza was also constructed on route at Nepali Farm despite opposition by locals as the stretch already had a toll plaza in Dehradun at Lachhiwala. Locals said there was no need for a second toll plaza at a distance less than 40-km from the first one. Aggarwal said, “Taking cognisance of the opposition by the locals, I held a detailed conversation with chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat and Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank. We decided to remove the toll plaza at the Nepali Farm.” Notably, the Nepal Farm is an important location that connects Rishikesh with Haridwar and Dehradun. Aggarwal, who is also the MLA from Rishikesh, said, “A request was made to the CM in this regard and it is heartening that it has been accepted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-toll-plaza-at-nepali-farm-announces-speaker/articleshow/83266863.cms||Kautilya Singh

The labour is scared of coming back and there is also a decline in the working capital of the industries. To make things worse, the procurement of raw material has become expensive and the market to sell finished products has also shrunk,” said Pankaj Gupta, president, IIA state chapter. Experts from the IIA also claimed that to retain the investment in the state, specific plans are being discussed with the government. “To turn the situation around, we must focus on promoting businesses related to medical equipment, food processing and packaging, which can reach people in containment zones”, added Gupta. People associated with the industries have also demanded that the lockdown restrictions should be eased keeping in mind the impact on the industries. In addition, vaccination should be provided for the business community and industrial workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/industrial-losses-in-uttarakhand-touch-rs-1500-cr-since-march/articleshow/83266871.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The plant was assembled in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Tirupati at the manufacturing facility of Discovery labs at Choutuppal. The plant produces around 60 litres of oxygen per minute with 93-95% purity, which is the required standard for medical oxygen. They have a present capacity to manufacture around 20 plants each month of capacities anywhere between 60 litres/minute to 1,000 litres/minute of oxygen. When Telangana was at its peak of oxygen crisis, Prashant Manne, Sireesha Yadlapalli and Ashish Naredi, classmates at ISB, came together along with other friends, to ease the oxygen shortage being faced by people. Initially, they looked at procuring these plants and installing them at hospitals by raising funds. However, all suppliers asked for a time of minimum six weeks for delivery which could get further extended as most of them were importing these plants to India. “We collaborated with Dr Sasidhar Gumma from IIT-Tirupati, who had been researching on the subject, took his designs and succeeded in operationalizing the plant in quick time,” said Naredi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/isb-alumni-launch-oxygen-plant-in-hyd/articleshow/83268529.cms||---
---||Delhi||Students unhappy, but Delhi University decides to go ahead with its online exams||NEW DELHI: Over two lakh undergraduate and postgraduate students of Delhi University will appear for online open book examinations from Monday, June 7. Despite the opposition from students, the university has decided to conduct the exams believing it to be imperative for their future. On the ground that Covid-19 had infected students or had led to deaths in their families, many students had wished for DU to make do without the exams this year. Several college unions had also submitted representations to the university administration requesting cancellation. Students who do not have access to the internet or have other problems going online have the option of sitting for a physical exam. The students have to indicate their choices while submitting the exam form. However, as DS Rawat, dean of examinations, disclosed, “Not one student has opted for the physical mode this year.” Some teachers said since the exams were open book and online, students should not face too many problems in appearing for the tests. Around 80,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students will appear for OBE from the colleges, while the School of Open Learning has a large aspirant body of 1.2 lakh students. “There has been no change in the rules and the OBE will be similar to the one held in December,” said Rawat. “I will be sending a personalised email in English and Hindi to each student appearing for the exam with the examination rules and guidelines.” One of the guidelines says, “In case of poor internet connectivity/any unforeseen technical glitches etc, the student is advised to submit his/her script beyond the specified time period (5 hr) with the documentary evidence to the email ID of the nodal officers of the college/department. The maximum time limit for delayed submission is 30 minutes with documentary evidence of non-submission on the portal. However, all such cases (email submission) will be examined by the review committee, and these answer sheets shall be evaluated based on the decision of the review and the result of such students may be delayed.” Explaining why it is necessary to hold these exams despite the academic disruptions caused by the pandemic, Kumar Ashutosh, who teaches at the College of Vocational Studies, said, “For final year students, the exams are important if they are planning higher education abroad. They are required to submit the results for the final year of college. Those seeking employment too will have the final results checked by their hirers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-unhappy-but-du-decides-to-go-ahead-with-its-online-exams/articleshow/83267653.cms||Shradha Chettri

To be setup under the state’s scheme for small scale distributed solar projects, the cumulative power generation capacity of these projects is about 2,500MW and they will bring in an investment of more than Rs 10,000 crore in green energy and allied sectors. The projects provide fillip to country’s mission of achieving 175GW renewable energy by 2022 and 450GW by 2030, the state government stated on Saturday. “Gujarat is the only state in the country which has signed power purchase agreements for such a large capacity through small scale distributed solar projects,” said state energy minister Saurabh Patel. The Gujarat government had unveiled a policy in 2019 for the development of small-scale solar projects having size of 0.5MW to 4MW in the state’s distribution network. The government, through GUVNL, had invited applications from individuals, company or association of individuals and co-operative societies among others to put up such small-scale solar projects under the policy and supply power to the discoms at the applicable tariff of Rs 2.83 per unit for a period of 25 years. Despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Tauktae cyclone, the state-owned discoms had received 12,404 applications for aggregate capacity of 7,959MW solar power from small scale project developers including various individuals, proprietorship firms, partnership firms, companies etc within a period of 3 months. Of this, GUVNL discoms signed PPAs for 3,979 projects, which will be commissioned within next 18 months. “The establishment of these solar capabilities will not only facilitate the rapid development of solar projects in many small areas of non-fertile land but will also encourage the participation of small investors and entrepreneurs,” the energy minister stated. He added that with all these solar projects coming up in different parts of the state, there would be an opportunity to make a significant contribution to the national target of adding renewable energy capacity as well as make the best use of the existing strong power transmission and distribution network of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/small-solar-projects-gujarat-signs-ppas-for-2500mw/articleshow/83267665.cms||---
---||Pune||20% of Maharashtra’s 18+ population & 25% in Mumbai covered with at least one jab||MUMBAI: In approximately six months since the Covid-19 vaccination drive started across India, 20.4% of the 18-plus population in Maharashtra has got at least one shot of the vaccine. Statistics show that 18,623,132 or 1.8 crore of Maharashtra's 91,435,000 population eligible for the vaccine have got at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine. The number is higher in Mumbai, where 28,13,035 have taken the first shot. “Mumbai has a population of 1.3 crore, so we believe over 25% of the eligible people have taken the vaccine,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. A mathematical analysis done by UK mathematician Murad Banaji a few weeks back showed that the number of Covid-19 deaths among the elderly 60-plus population in Mumbai had dropped (in comparison to the first wave) due to vaccination. Maharashtra leads the states in vaccination. Although in terms of percentages, Himachal Pradesh has covered 37.3% of its eligible population with the first dose, in absolute numbers this is only 20,60,164. With the threat of a third wave, experts maintain that vaccination is the only way forward. “The only way ahead for India is to increase vaccination among the vulnerable populations, especially senior citizens. Already states such as Orissa and Tripura have shown that an increase is vaccination has led to a drop in the number of deaths per million,” said Bengaluru-based epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India. He said that once we ensure the vulnerable population gets two doses and others manage one dose, India would be in a safer place as far as the Covid-19 pandemic is concerned. At present, there is a still a long way ahead. “We cannot achieve herd immunity or anything close without covering 70% or so of the eligible population,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said that covering 20% of the population is no yardstick. “The only way is to push vaccination for all within the next three months,” he said. Meanwhile, as on Saturday, India has administered more than 23 crore doses. Of these, 18 crore Indians have received the first dose while 4.5 crore have received both the doses. On Saturday, Day 141 since vaccination started on January 16, 3.1 million were vaccinated. The health ministry press release said that states such as Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have totally administered more than 10 lakh beneficiaries in the 18-44 age- group for the first dose of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/20-of-states-18-population-25-in-mumbai-city-covered-with-at-least-one-jab/articleshow/83278012.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Delhi||Delhi: Helping kids tackle Covid stress through art||NEW DELHI: Dimple Mehta, mindfulness and character strength coach, enjoys the classes she takes these days. When children as young as 4 years share their observations and stories on naming their plants and caring for nature, Mehta feels elated. These classes have helped the children deal with the stress of the Covid-19 pandemic and being confined to their homes. Mehta and the kids have been brought together by NGO Route2Roots, which aims to help children unwind from everyday stress. Since 2016, the NGO has been collaborating with schools on such classes. Its Virsa programme, for instance, makes children aware about art, culture and heritage. Rakesh Gupta, co-founder of Route2Roots, said, “We realised that the youngsters were going through a difficult time. So we thought of helping them even if the classrooms are online. Yoga, mindfulness and brain development have been particularly beneficial for the kids, and I have been receiving a lot of feedback from parents and schools.” Unlike the usual classes where the students are visible in small frames on the computer screen, Mehta’s broadcast uses a three-camera shoot and the teachers in the studio can interact with the students/teachers/parents in an atmosphere of a virtual classroom streamed into everyone’s home. Mehta, who has been conducting these classes for about two years, said, “The children enjoy my classes because they are interactive. We have activities that the children enjoy. Earlier, the students joining our classes used to be in the 8-14 year age group. But now I also see kids as young as four logging in.” The NGO has arrangements with over 20,000 schools for these classes. It has also tweaked the system in such a manner that even students in rural areas can log in with the low internet bandwidth proving no obstruction. The classes and workshops are for free. The workshops are in various disciplines like Hindustani vocal music, Kathak, Bharatanatyam and theatre. Gupta said, “Holding these workshops during the pandemic has also helped various artistes who had been without work. We have been able to pay and help over 100 artistes in this manner.

---||Delhi||East Delhi Municipal Corporation students to get books by June 9||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation has kept June 9 as the deadline to distribute among all students books procured from Delhi Bureau of Text Books. The civic body is planning to resume the academic session from June 10 onwards and has directed all the 300 EDMC-run schools to complete the book distribution exercise before that. “Due to Covid restrictions, it was getting difficult to procure books from DBTB earlier. Now that all schools have got the supply, they have been asked to immediately distribute books among parents. Students who migrated with their parents and are yet to come back to Delhi will be given books on their return. The purpose of timely distribution of books is to ensure studies of children don’t get affected,” said EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain. “Classes will be conducted on Google Meet and WhatsApp. Worksheets will be distributed to those who can’t access these facilities,” said a senior EDMC official. The civic agency has also asked the schools to expedite online distribution of a cash subsidy of Rs 300 to all the students for writing material such as notebooks. As part of an e-governance initiative, the education department has hosted its website as well as one of its schools at Mayur Vihar on the EDMC portal. “The civic body has given a target to 300 schools to design and host their individual websites on the EDMC portal. It will help parents access all the relevant information without coming to schools,” said EDMC education committee chairman Romesh Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-corpn-students-to-get-books-by-june-9/articleshow/83267664.cms||Vibha Sharma

With this new status, these seven universities will be able to not only conduct admissions on their own by setting up their admission committees but will also be able to determine their fee structures independently. ‘The decision was taken behind closed doors. To exempt these universities from the centralized admission process and the purview of the fee regulatory committee (technical) is wrong. The government should reconsider its decision,’ the representation made by ABVP states. The list of seven universities does not include state government universities which in a way undermines the role and exemplary performance of many state varsities, it said. The government has in the next few days sought an action plan to ensure the creation of world-class infrastructure, high-tech and student-friendly classrooms, and laboratories at these institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abvp-objects-to-in-principle-nods/articleshow/83267669.cms||---

He then managed to get back on his feet by starting a small business selling snacks in September last year. However, this year, the shop closed down after the statewide lockdown and having no other skills, Singh now works as a daily wage labourer, earning Rs 500 on a good day. He told TOI he had to take up the job to pay off the loan he had taken to fund his business. Singh had opened his shop by taking a loan of Rs 3 lakh under the chief minister’s Swarozgar Yojna, a self-employment scheme started by then-chief minister Trivdendra Rawat mainly to provide employment to people who had returned to the hills during the lockdown. His story had inspired others, who also got the confidence to come to their native villages in the hills and sustain themselves here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chef-who-started-biz-now-a-daily-wager/articleshow/83266902.cms||Prem Punetha

Lakshadweep administration in a press statement said that the operations from New Mangalore port to northern islands will lead to savings of approximately Rs 200 per MT in fuel and 15 to 20 hours in running time as northern islands of Lakshadweep, on an average are 120-160km closer from Mangalore port as compared to Kochi port and around 50km closer than Beypore port. The administration said that Thinnakara berthed at New Mangalore Port Trust on May 25 and completed loading rapidly. Within 17 hours the ship could load and start it’s return voyage, carrying essential commodities and other important items for the islands of Kadmat, Kiltan and Chetlat, sources said. “The loading at New Mangalore port was completed in 17 hours whereas it used to take anywhere between 5-7 days to load the cargo ships at Beypore port. The challenges which were faced at Beypore port are congestion, non-availability of berth and long waiting hours. At the same time, New Mangalore port has better infrastructure, safety and security arrangements, ample storage space and good connectivity which led to better efficiencies in handling of cargo,” the statement said Administration claimed that the step has been widely appreciated and welcomed by the islanders. Lakshadweep administration is also working on starting passenger ship services to and from Mangalore to northern islands, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cargo-vessel-from-mangaluru-reaches-islands/articleshow/83267679.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While there are 27 kumki elephants in Theppakadu camp, 28 tamed elephants are housed in Kozhikamuthy camp. “All precautionary measures are being taken at the camp. Feeding time has been increased from one hour to three hours as each elephant is fed separately and sent back once feeding is done,” said MTR field director K K Kaushal. There are 54 mahouts at the camp. “Only 12 mahouts have been vaccinated so far. They are from tribal communities and show little inclination towards vaccination. We are creating awareness among them. Before they enter the camp in the morning, thermal scanning is done,” the official said. Coronavirus preventive measures have been taken in the Kozhikamuthy elephant camp from last year, said ART deputy director S Arokiaraj Xavier. “As many as 196 inmates of the camp, including mahouts and their relatives, have been vaccinated. They are also given medicine to boost immunity. Swabs were taken from 52 mahouts for RT-PCR tests last month,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/anti-virus-measures-at-elephant-camps/articleshow/83267667.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune college likely to offer engineering education in Marathi||PUNE: Once all permissions come through, Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering (PCCOE) is slated to become the first institute in Maharashtra that will impart engineering education in Marathi from 2021-22 academic year. “Across the country, 14 colleges have made an application to start a batch in their regional language, such as Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Hindi and Bengali,” said Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). Four colleges from Uttar Pradesh, two from Rajasthan, two from Maharashtra, two from Tamil Nadu and one each from Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh have made the application. While most of the colleges have proposed to start a batch in computer science, there are proposals for electrical, mechanical and civil engineering as well, with some colleges proposing two batches in different streams, according to data shared by Sahasrabudhe. It is yet to be seen how many of the proposals materialise. College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) is the other college in contention from Maharashtra. When contacted, CoEP director BB Ahuja said that while they had proposed to start a batch in Marathi this year, the decision was deferred as they wanted to be well prepared before taking on a new initiative. “There were concerns regarding availability of books. However, the decision has only been deferred for this year. We will again take it up next year,” said Ahuja. GN Kulkarni, director of PCCOE, said, “Our board of governors has approved the decision to start an undergraduate course in Computer Engineering in Marathi. We have applied to AICTE to allow intake of 60 students so that we can start the batch this year itself. We hope to get a positive reply in 10-15 days. We would also need to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Directorate of Technical Education and Savitribai Phule Pune University.” The institute has not yet done any survey to find if any students in the existing batches would have opted for Marathi medium had the option been available to them. “We generally do such surveys when we think of starting a new course on our own. The call to start a batch in a regional language came from AICTE and I am sure they must have conducted a survey,” said Kulkarni. AICTE, in a news conference in March, had quoted from a survey covering 5,000 engineering students studying in second to final year wherein 42% had said that they would have opted to learn in their mother tongue if the option was available. Tamil had found the most number of takers, followed by Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, etc, Sahasrabudhe had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-college-likely-to-offer-engg-education-in-marathi/articleshow/83268583.cms||Ardhra Nair

The state, meanwhile, saw one of the highest single-day turnouts, with 3.72 lakh getting vaccinated on Friday. The state’s previous highest single-day turnout was 3.9 lakh in April. On most days last week, the turnout was between 2-2.5 lakh. The state has so far vaccinate d 18,623,132 or 1.8 crore, with at least one shot. It has given out 2.37 crore vaccine doses since January 16. On Saturday, nearly half a lakh of recipients in Mumbai were in the 18-44 age group, taking the total recipients in this group to 4.6 lakh. Most vaccinations (53.074) took place in private sector, with private hospitals tying up with housing colonies and corporate entities for mass vaccination drives. BMC is struggling with stocks. “We have 75,000 vaccine doses with us right now. It should help us carry the programme for few days next week,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-75k-get-jab-on-sat-no-free-vax-today-bmc/articleshow/83268695.cms||---

The police have registered a case of an attempt to murder and invoked the provisions of the Indian Firearms Act after Tagunde lodged a complaint with the Warje police. “Around 9.15 am, Tagunde was speaking with his workers, when four men on two two-wheelers reached the sport and the pillion riders opened fire,” deputy commissioner of the police (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad said, before adding that two of the suspects have been identified. Gaikwad said, “Prima facie, it is suspected that the incident was a fallout of an old rivalry or it is related to Tagunde’s financial dispute/s.” “Tagunde was passing on some istructions to his workers at a bungalow project site near Wonder Futura building. That’s when the suspects arrived and pillion riders fired two bullets in Tagunde’s direction. The suspects fired two more rounds of bullets towards a material on site before fleeing the scene. None of the bullets hit the target,” inspector Shankar Khatake of the Warje police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-men-open-fire-at-a-sub-contractor/articleshow/83268611.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Oximeter can predict which patient will need oxygen support, KEM doctors show how||MUMBAI: A leading public hospital has proposed a simple method to predict which Covid-19 patients are likely to require oxygen support or higher care during hospitalisation. In a research paper published in the latest edition of JAPI, doctors from BMC-run KEM Hospital’s pulmonary medicine department said the assessment only requires the patient’s oxygen saturation readings to be taken once while lying down and immediately another reading while sitting up on the bed. If the readings differ quite a bit, it is possible the patient has Covid-induced platypnea-orothodeoxia syndrome (POS) -- a condition in which breathlessness is alleviated when lying down and worsens while sitting or standing up. “Even a fall in oxygen saturation in sitting position as compared to supine position can predict the need for oxygen therapy during treatment,” said the study. The doctors, led by head of department Dr Amita Athawale, said POS could just be an “uncommonly common bedside sign”. When contacted, Dr Athawale said, “It is a simple bedside observation while one checks oxygen saturation, normally it should be equal in sitting and lying down position. But in Covid 19, where people don’t realise they are hypoxic, then different readings in sitting or standing position suggest that s/he be checked early for hypoxia.” The study of around 50 patients done during the first wave of the pandemic found 15 patients diagnosed with POS required oxygen supplementation at some point of their stay in hospital. KEM Hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said the study predicts a low-cost way to ascertain which patient will need oxygen. “It helps triage. A patient who while supine has an oxygen saturation of 95 will not be ignored if his/her readings while sitting up are also taken,” said Dr Deshmukh. He said doctors could advise such patients to lay in a prone position to help them breathe better..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-oximeter-can-predict-which-patient-will-need-o2-support-kem-docs-show-how/articleshow/83270860.cms||---
---||Dehradun||How indulging in hobbies is helping people deal with lockdown blues||Dehradun: With Covid-induced lockdown limiting city residents within the confines of homes and reducing the amount of time they used to lose in the daily humdrum, several locals have turned to their hobbies to stay positive and beat the blues. “The restrictions put in place due to the pandemic gave me an opportunity to reconnect to my long-lost hobbies of sketching and painting. Now that I am working from home, I get some spare time to paint and sketch,” said Sandeep Gupta, a 38-year-old working professional. The lockdown has also provided an opportunity for those living outside their native cities/villages to bond with their families. “I was put in a boarding school at a very young age. So, I never really got the chance to spend quality time with my family members. The lockdown offered me an opportunity to bond with them. I have now learned to appreciate the simple pleasures of life in this pandemic,” said Mayank Agarwal, a 19-year-old student. This period of social isolation has also prompted several locals to pivot their careers and convert their hobbies into serious enterprises. Riya Kapoor, a homemaker until the pandemic, now runs a tiffin service from her kitchen. “I always enjoyed cooking and in this lockdown, I decided to launch my tiffin service. Not only am I making decent money but I have also started donating some of my earnings for the cause of the kids who lost their parents in this pandemic,” said Riya. Speaking about the importance of pursuing hobbies, Mamta Singh, a mental health expert, told TOI, “Engaging in hobbies is an effective way to divert the mind from the negative things happening around as such activities give us a break from our monotonous schedules. Hobbies also help a person prevent the risk of mental health issues.” (By Ashita Kapoor)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/how-indulging-in-hobbies-is-helping-people-deal-with-lockdown-blues/articleshow/83266893.cms||---

The boy, Anand Sai, was playing with his friends near the nala, which is under repair. Bowenpally police said that maintenance works on the nala, which flows in front of the boy’s house, had been taken up by the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) by sanctioning the works to a contractor in view of the ensuing monsoon. The nala widening and repair works were allegedly taken up with no safety measures such as putting up barricades and signboards to warn others. “The accident was witnessed by the boy’s friends and a local, near the building. He and a few others rushed to the spot but they could not do much since they could not swim,” K Ravi Kumar, Bowenpally inspector, said. The mishap took place at around 9.45 am and the police arrived at the scene at around 10.30 am with a few swimmers, however, the boy could not be traced. Later, officials from the fire department and the GHMC roped in Hussainsagar Shiva, an expert at recovering bodies from Hussainsagar, and retrieved the body. Police said that a case was registered against nala contractor Ramu under Section 304 II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC. “Since the contractor did not take any precautionary measures, he was booked under 304 II. Any SCB official later found to be irresponsible will also be booked,” the inspector said. Expert Shiva traces body in minutes:Officials of the Disaster Response Force of the GHMC and fire department authorities could not locate the body in the search operation that lasted for three hours. It was Hussainsagar Shiva who could trace the body within minutes. “The body was recovered from the nala which is 20 feet deep. The body was stuck between rods that were put up for the repair works. I reached the spot within 30 minutes after receiving a call from Bowenpally inspector K Ravi Kumar,” said Shiva.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-no-barricades-8-yr-old-boy-drowns-in-open-nala-under-repair/articleshow/83267694.cms||---

In articles submitted to the TOI expert panel for verification, unverified cures and false claims involving onions, farm chickens and lightbulbs stood out. One message claimed people can contract the fungal infection mucormycosis from onions or vegetables stored in the refrigerator. Another viral message found circulating on social media said mucormycosis can spread from farm chickens. And in a video, which has since been dismissed as a prank, a man is seen lighting a bulb by bringing it close to his vaccine injection site. All the messages are false. "A post claiming that #BlackFungus can spread through farm chickens is in circulation on social media. This claim is #FAKE. There is NO scientific evidence that the infection can spread from chickens to humans,” the Press Information Bureau's fact check team stated on Twitter. There's also no known link between onions and mucormycosis. The US CDC has clarified that people get mucormycosis "through contact with fungal spores in the environment". "For example, the lung or sinus forms of the infection can occur after someone inhales the spores from the air. A skin infection can occur after the fungus enters the skin through a scrape, burn, or other type of skin injury," the CDC has said in its advisory. It added that mucormycosis cannot spread between people or between people and animals. As for the video clip which has a man "lighting a bulb" by bringing it in contact with the vaccination site on his arm, the uploader later released another video to say it was only a "prank" that was shared with friends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fact-check-no-you-cant-catch-mucormycosis-from-onions/articleshow/83268641.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Flood fear looms large in areas along nalas||SECUNDERABAD: Over 500 families residing in several colonies near Hasmathpet lake antipate a flood-like situation this year too. The residents say that despite last year’s floods, the engineering wing of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) has not rebuilt the retaining walls to prevent flooding of nearby areas. “Last year in October, we were one of the most affected people in the city due to the floods. One or two parts of the wall which separate the colony and the nala had collapsed due to the flooding of the nala after the Hasmathpet Lake gates were opened,” Girish Pranav, a resident of Royal Enclave, told STOI. The resident said during the recent rains that lasted for 15 minutes, there was an increase in the water level of the open nala. “If heavy rains occur during the monsoon, the nala can overflow and it can be a very big problem for hundreds of families. Despite alerting the SCB about the issue, there is no response,” he said. Another resident of the same locality, Ramesh Reddy, said that the flood-prone areas can be inundated again if officials don not take up civic works on the nalas and lakes. “Residents of these colonies have complained to the engineering wing officials about the issue but nothing is being done,” he said. SCB additional engineer Gopal Krishna Das said, “Contractors have delayed taking up nala repair works. We were supposed to complete the civic works ahead of monsoon as per the schedule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/flood-fear-looms-large-in-areas-along-nalas/articleshow/83267698.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Monsoon near, nala desilting works still incomplete in Secunderabad Cantonment||SECUNDERABAD: The monsoon is round the corner, but works pertaining to desilting of several nalas in the Secunderabad Cantonment limits are incomplete. Desilting works in Vasavi Nagar, New Vasavi Nagar sector-B, Jyothi Colony, Jupiter Colony, Brook Bond Colony, Gruhalaxmi Colony, New SBH Colony and several other colonies in SCB ward number V are progressing at a snail’s pace. Shortage of labour, non-availability of earth movers and large volume of sewage have been cited as main reasons for works not progressing at a brisk pace, according to an SCB engineering official. Two major nalas, Picket Nala and Hasmathpet Nala, which run to a length of 10 to 13 kilometres —cover most of the Cantonment area and, till date, desilting works have been completed up to five to seven kilometre length, the official added. “After desilting is completed, works pertaining to re-building retaining walls and culvert repair works would be taken up,” an SCB engineer said. Confederation of Cantonment Residents Welfare Association (CCRWA) secretary DLS Sreshti has appealed to SCB chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy on behalf of RWAs to complete desilting works to prevent flooding of colonies in the upcoming monsoon season. Meanwhile, laying of sewer trunks, which has been taken up abutting Ramannakunta Lake in ward no-VI, was nearing completion to prevent flooding of downstream colonies. On Saturday, former SCB ward member Pandu Yadav inspected the ongoing works and asked officials concerned to speed up remaining work within a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monsoon-near-nala-desilting-works-still-incomplete-in-cantt/articleshow/83267701.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Tunnel, stns, depot account for major portion of cost hike||Even as the project cost has shot up, there is growing uneasiness within government circles at the inability of the ruling MVA to shift the metro car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. Last December, the Bombay high court stayed the suburban collector’s decision to hand over the Kanjurmarg land for the car shed. “Since then, there has been virtually no initiative on the part of state agencies to vacate the stay,” a source said. The high court had fixed the matter for final hearing in February, but the state sought time to file replies and the case was adjourned to March. “Between March and April 2021, the case came up five times in the HC. But each time the matter came up, the state constantly sought more time,” an official said. On February 2, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), too, filed an application seeking that the stay order be vacated as a “public project was being gravely affected”. “After filing the application, the MMRDA has done little to push the case in the court for an early hearing,” an official said. A senior bureaucrat ascribed the cost escalation to various reasons, the controversy over the car shed being one of them. “The original project cost was based on the terrain of the Delhi metro. It was later found that Mumbai has a different terrain,” he said. The land acquisition cost for Metro 3 also drastically increased once the project commenced. The original estimate for land acquisition was fixed at Rs 590 crore, which has now increased to Rs 1,483 crore. The largest cost escalation component is for construction of the tunnel, stations and car depot. It was initially pegged at Rs 10,708 crore, but the revised cost estimate is Rs 18,711 crore. Early this year, a nine-member government panel headed by the then chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said an integrated metro depot at Kanjurmarg will save the government Rs 1,580 crore against land and construction costs. The committee appointed by the state government said the Metro 3 car shed at Aarey can accommodate only 30 rakes, while the Kanjurmarg one is large enough to hold 55. The panel report also concluded that the 41-hectare Kanjurmarg plot is big enough to be an integrated depot for three Metro lines: 3, 4 and 6. The 20-page report mentions that “if the integrated depot is planned at Kanjurmarg, an interchange station of Line 14 and Line 6 can be proposed at Kanjurmarg, facilitating better interchange between Lines 3, 6 and 14”. The Shiv Sena-led alliance government also has to cope with another obstacle on the Kanjurmarg land. Construction giant Shapoorji Pallonji has invested Rs 471 crore on the 500-acre Kanjurmarg sprawl with the Garodia family, which has claimed ownership over the plot. When tenders were first invited in 2016, the cost was based on the 2011 estimate of Rs 23,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tunnel-stns-depot-account-for-major-portion-of-cost-hike/articleshow/83270949.cms||---

The protest call was given by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions protesting at the Ghazipur border (near Delhi) against the farm laws. On Saturday, farmers, carrying black flags, burnt copies of the law at public places and near the offices of BJP MPs, MLAs and other government representatives in Jaspur, Kashipur, Bazpur, Gadarpur, Dineshpur, Rudrapur, Kichha, Sitarganj, Nanakmatta and Khatima towns of the district. The agitating farmers also held a protest near state education minister Arvind Pandey's house in Gularbhoj (Gadarpur). Police were deployed and barricades were erected outside the minister's house to prevent any untoward incident. Copies of the farm laws were also burnt in front of state transport minister Yashpal Arya’s camp office in Bazpur. Tejender Singh Virk, president of Terai Kisan Mahasabha, said, “The government is hell-bent on scuttling the farmers’ agitation but we will continue our protests till our demand of repealing the black farm laws is met.” In a similar vein, Karm Singh Padda, state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said that the farmers’ stir won’t stop till the laws are repealed and MSP is guaranteed. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, the spokesperson of the SKM, who was in Bazpur for the protest, said, “We have been protesting for two crop seasons and are ready to continue our stir for the next eight or even more crop seasons.” Meanwhile, Tilak Raj Behar, former Congress minister, said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intention of helping his industrialist friends has put the entire farmer community in jeopardy. They are forced to protest in Delhi, away from their farms and houses.” Notably, the Uttarakhand unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also rendered support to the agitating farmers in Kashipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/terai-farmers-observe-sampoorna-kranti-diwas-burn-copies-of-farm-laws/articleshow/83266924.cms||Aakash Ahuja

The practice of ecological restoration includes soil control, reforestation, removal of non-native species and weeds, revegetate disturbed areas, daylighting streams, reintroduction of native species as well as habitat and range improvement for targeted species,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ifgtb-submits-project-report-on-rejuvenation-of-river-cauvery/articleshow/83267706.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Baby boy born with rare genetic condition gets new lease of life||Coimbatore: When 2.5-month old baby boy Viyan was wheeled into the Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital in early March, he had fever, critical anemia and bleeding from his mouth and abdomen. Doctors suspected he was suffering from a rare life-threatening genetic disorder known as primary hemophagocytic lympho-histiocytosis (HLH).On Wednesday, the baby, now 5.5-month old, was discharged after a three-month admission to the intensive care unit and treatment that involved an immune cell-depleted haploidentical (half matched) stem cell transplant.The HLH is a condition in which the body’s immune system is not able to kill specific pathogens, but produces a self-injurious pattern of inflammation. It is an exuberant response of the immune system leading to inflammation, but does not result in the pathogen getting eliminated. It involves causing a cytokine storm, which the immune cells start attacking the body’s normal blood cells and bone marrow, in particular. In Viyan’s case, the disorder managed to functionally paralyse his bone marrow.In fact, the bacterial infection entered through the baby’s skin, from his right groin, and rapidly spread to his abdominal wall, making it look he had suffered bad burn injuries. The treatment included a surgery to remove the infected portion of the skin completely to stop its spread and grafting skin from his own body to follow it up.Doctors then put him on antibiotics to control the infection and then began the process to perform a stem cell transplant, which was the only way to correct the genetic defect. They had to specifically perform a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which involved intravenous fusion of stem cells from a donor to re-establish production of white blood cells and red blood cells, and plasma in the baby’s body. Viyan unfortunately had no siblings or an unrelated donor, whose tissue antigen was identical to his. So, the doctors chose to take stem cells from his father to avoid any delay.For two weeks, both the baby and father were put on immunosuppressants to condition their immune system to lay low. This was to avoid Viyan’s body rejecting his father’s stem cells, which in turn from attacking Viyan’s body, a condition called graft versus host disease. Once doctors had results showing that his father’s stem cells were low on killer “alpha beta T cells and B cells”, they took out his stem cells, further manipulated it to remove remaining such cells, if any, and transplanted them into the baby boy on April 17.One and half months later, Viyan was discharged as doctors were happy with his blood cell counts. However, the boy would have to remain under close monitoring to see how his body handles any new infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/baby-boy-born-with-rare-genetic-condition-gets-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/83267711.cms||---

They have been active in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh for a long time,” said Rajesh Sah, in-charge of the Civil Lines police station. The arrest comes after one Anil Jakhmola, who works in SIDCUL (Haridwar), approached the police with the complaint that his bike was stolen at gunpoint while he was returning home from work on May 28. The official added that the four accused — in their early thirties — are history-sheeters and thus, they have been booked under the Gangster Act. This is the second instance in a week when the local busted an auto-lifter gang. Earlier on June 1, the police had arrested two men — also Bijnor residents — and had recovered eight motorcycles from their possession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-auto-lifter-gangs-busted-in-a-week-in-roorkee/articleshow/83266926.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court gives four weeks’ time to decide on remission for lifers||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court gave four weeks’ time to the home secretary and director general of prisons to take a call on representations from life convicts seeking remission. The court expressed anguish over scant regard shown by the home secretary and the boss of the prisons’ wing towards orders of the high court and guidelines of the Supreme Court in granting remission to life convicts even after serving two decades of jail term. While setting aside the belated rejection orders passed by the home secretary on representations seeking remission made by life convict SK Zakaria and 12 others, Justice K Lakshman asked the kin of the life convicts to file contempt pleas against the home secretary and others if they continue to be indifferent. The high court clearly said the authorities should not take more than a month to take decisions in such matters. The apex court too asked the officials to take decisions in tune with the ongoing pandemic situation. “None of them is working on the minds of the officials,” the judge said. The judge said remission is a benefit of reduced sentence awarded by the state to those prisoners whose conduct was found to be good inside the jail. “Good conduct, higher education qualification ..., should play a role in deciding remissions,” the judge said while finding fault with the home secretary’s mechanical rejection orders that contained no explanation for the decisions. The judge said that as remission is earned for every year spent in jail, authorities must calculate the actual jail term and the time already spent in jail along with remand time. The judge also found fault with the authorities for taking three years to take a decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-gives-4-weeks-time-to-decide-on-remission-for-lifers/articleshow/83267705.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The judge has, however, allowed the police to continue their investigation into the case. In her complaint lodged with the Jubilee Hills police, the accused’s wife alleged that her husband beat her up severely on the night of June 2 and even tried to strangulate her. She also accused him of selling away 70% of the hospital shares to splurge on women with whom he had extra-marital affairs. Based on her complaint, the police filed an FIR and launched an investigation. The accused filed a petition in high court seeking the quashing of the FIR. His counsel argued that the allegations were baseless and made at the behest of the CMD’s daughter and son-in-law who had issues with his charity work. The case is scheduled to come up for hearing again on June 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/judge-stalls-cmds-arrest-till-june-11/articleshow/83267709.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Of 10 states with top Covid death rates, 6 are hill states, U'khand 2nd||Dehradun: For 11 days now, six hill states have been among the top with the highest Covid-19 case fatality ratios (CFRs) in the country. As of Saturday, Uttarakhand has the second highest CFR in the country, at 2%, followed by Nagaland at third (1.9%). Health experts said lack of infrastructure, trained personnel and connectivity seem to have caught up with these states in the second wave of the pandemic. The Social Development for Communities Foundation (SDC), which has been tracking Covid-19 data in Uttarakhand, observed the pattern and released a report on Saturday. “What we found was alarming. Six Himalayan states are among 10 states with the highest death rates,” said Anoop Nautiyal, who runs SDC. Besides Uttarakhand and Nagaland, the other hill states on the list are Meghalaya (sixth with 1.7% CFR), followed by Himachal Pradesh (1.7%), Manipur (1.6%) and Sikkim (1.6%). Overall, Punjab has the highest death rate, at 2.6%. Goa, Delhi and Maharashtra (1.7% each) round up the list. The union territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands is also among those with the highest CFRs, at 1.7%. “The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed yet another grave fragility of the mountain states … The Himalayan states are considered frontal barriers to the security of the nation. It is vital that the health of the people in these states is accorded the highest priority and support,” said Nautiyal. The six hill states have been adding a few hundred cases every day which. On Saturday, for instance, Uttarakhand added 619 cases, Nagaland added 309, Meghalaya 497, Manipur 717 and Sikkim 253 (data for Himachal Pradesh was not available). While these numbers may not, in themselves, seem alarming, the limited health infrastructure in these states means added pressure that can be difficult to handle. As a point of comparison, on June 5 last year, Uttarakhand had added 62 cases, Nagaland 27, Himachal Pradesh 10, Manipur had added 8 and Sikkim just 1 (data for Meghalaya was not available). “The second wave has exposed the alarming absence of healthcare facilities in the hills,” said Dr Ajay Khanna, secretary of the Indian Medical Association, Uttarakhand. “We hardly have trained doctors. Those working in the hills are always overburdened. Most posts are vacant. Connectivity to healthcare institutions is also a huge problem,” he added. Then, there are localised catalysts. In Uttarakhand, it could have been the Kumbh Mela, Dr Bhupendra Kumar Singh, an orthopaedic surgeon who was conferred the Padma Shri, said. “There is still very little awareness. Infrastructure is poor. But one of the biggest reasons is Kumbh which, I strongly feel, has disturbed the management. Pilgrims reached their villages in hills and UP, transmitting the virus,” he added. It’s true across hill states. “We know the hills don’t have big hospitals, the best trained doctors or the support system to deal with Covid-19. No wonder death rates are up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/of-10-states-with-top-covid-death-rates-6-are-hill-states-ukhand-2nd/articleshow/83265992.cms||Ishita Mishra

The Saravanampatti police said 45-year-old Shanthi, of Ramanathapuram, had handed over the chain to a staff nurse at the Dr Muthu’s Hospital, where she was admitted with Covid-19, while she was shifted to the intensive care unit on May 25, requesting her to keep it safe. When Shanthi asked the staff nurse to return the chain a few days ago, a police officer said, the latter told her the chain was handed over to the hospital PRO, Prabhakaran, for safety reasons. “Shanthi met Prabhakaran, who did not give her a proper reply. She then approached hospital manager Ravichandran and he held an inquiry with Prabhakaran, who said the chain was missing from his table.” The manager checked the CCTV footage and found ambulance driver Dheepan taking away the gold chain from the table. “Dheepan told the hospital management that it was Prabhakaran who asked him to get the gold chain from his office table. However, Prabhakaran has denied the charges,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hospital-pro-booked-after-gold-chain-goes-missing/articleshow/83267713.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state recorded daily cases below 1,000 after 81 days. Likewise, Ahmedabad at 142 new positive cases recorded lowest daily tally in 85 days. Analysis of daily cases reveals that in seven days, the cases fell by 55% from 2,230 cases on May 29 to 996 on June 5. The last time the state was in 901-1000 cases range was in mid-March. Compared to mid-March figure however, the number of deaths is higher. At 15 deaths, it was the lowest since April 6. In the second half of March, average daily deaths were eight. The active cases in Gujarat reached 20,000 on Saturday, the lowest in 58 days. The phenomenon is primarily attributed to high number of Covid patients getting discharged from the hospitals. For Gujarat, the number was three times higher than that of the new cases. More than half (eight out of 15) deaths were recorded from eight municipal corporations – Ahmedabad city alone recorded deaths of four Covid patients. Officials in the AMC said that the city had 3,276 active cases on Saturday morning which is likely to go down to below 3000 for the first time after April 10. The AMC officials said that there has been a constant decline in the number of cases since April 25. Officials said that there has been no change in the pattern of spread and western Ahmedabad continues to account for 60% of Covid cases and the remaining 40% are from the eastern part of the city. The new west zone areas of Thaltej, Gota, Bodakdev, and Chandkheda in the north west zone and in south west zone, the areas of Jodhpur, Vejalpur and Bopal account for the highest number of cases even today. In the west zone the areas of Navrangpura, Paldi, Vasna, Naranpura, Ranip, and Vadaj still have high number of cases. However, this number was much less as compared to April per day cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-81-days-gujarat-records-fewer-than-1k-daily-cases/articleshow/83267775.cms||---
---||India||Covid hits cancer care, may leave a long-term impact||NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 pandemic has considerably impacted cancer care in the country with a major decline in screening activities that has raised concerns about missed diagnoses leading to more patients needing oncology treatment in advanced stages and a jump in cancer-related deaths over the next few years. Cancer screening had either completely stopped, or was functioning to less than 25% in 70% of centres. New patients registrations fell by 54%, outpatient clinic visits by 46%, hospital admissions by 36%, pathology by 38%, radiology by 43%, surgeries by 49 to 52%, chemotherapy by 37%, radiation by 23% and palliative care by 29%, shows a Lancet Oncology study conducted by several researchers as part of National Cancer Grid of India between March 1 and May 31, 2020. The study underlines the long-term impact of cessation of cancer screening and delayed hospital visits on cancer stage migration and outcomes are likely to be substantial. “Our estimates of missed cancer diagnoses, delayed diagnoses, and subsequent burden on health-care services and the probable overall impact on cancer mortality indicate the possibility of a serious public health problem in the next five years,” it says. The cohort study evaluated data from volumes of services in 41 cancer centres that are part of the National Cancer Grid of India over a three month period (March-May) during the pandemic in 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. While the study primarily covers large hospitals with major footfall, the reduction in registered number of patients and OPD visits can be due to distributed cancer care with many patients avoiding tertiary care hospitals or traveling to metros for seeking care, instead going to smaller care centres near home. However, the delayed screening and diagnosis is seen as a major concern by most experts. “What this data captures is very few screening programme that were underway during this time. For instance, the screening for Cervical Cancer is lifesaving and one of the most important screening programme in our country. So, if screening programme have been impacted, we will be able to see increase in higher stage diagnosis of Cervical in coming few years,” says Aju Mathew, leading oncologist at Kerala’s MOSC Medical College. “These reductions in numbers reflect huge numbers of patients who have dropped off the system. And will result in hundreds of thousands of cancer deaths over the next few years,” says Tata Memorial Hospital Director Dr CS Pramesh. “The ability to provide cancer services during the pandemic has been affected in several ways. Many oncology centres have restructured their services to create Covid units. There have been reductions in staffing,”it says. Besides, access to health-care facilities has been restricted due to travel restrictions and patients have often been unwilling to visit hospitals for fears of infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-hits-cancer-care-may-leave-a-long-term-impact/articleshow/83272236.cms||Sushmi Dey

The upward trend however stopped in May, when private hospitals were asked to procure their own vaccines as the government would no longer provide them the stocks. A total of 8,33,149 people received the shots in May, registering a decline of 38% from the previous month. The Covid-19 vaccination drive saw participation of private hospitals in the first three phases, when healthcare workers, frontline workers and people in the 45-60 age group were inoculated. However, when the vaccination of the 18-44 age group started in May, private hospitals struggled to procure doses on their own. While big private hospital chains like Max are procuring vaccines through their corporate offices, smaller ones are struggling. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) said that it has processed payment to procure 30,000 vaccine doses for various hospitals in Uttarakhand, which it said will arrive in the second quarter of June. Earlier, the body had announced its plans to help private hospitals procure Covid-19 vaccines. “We have paid Rs 1.89 crore to the Serum Institute of India (SII) and they have assured us that the vaccines will be sent to us by June 14 or 15. We will be able to start the vaccination drive in private hospitals after we receive the stock,” said Dr Ajay Khanna, secretary, IMA. He added that people will be administered the vaccine for Rs 900 a dose. Meanwhile, private hospitals who tried to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers, as per the new government guidelines, said they are facing hurdles. “We tried to approach SII, but they said we have to procure a minimum quantity of vials. We don’t know whether it will be sustainable for us to go ahead, so we are planning to kickstart the drive with doses provided by the IMA,” said Dr Mahesh Kuriyal of CMI Hospital. Dr Vipul Kandwal, owner of Arogyadham Hospital, claimed to have approached SII over a month back and received only a “verbal assurance”. “They only said that they will intimate us when to make payments and delivery will happen at least 10 days after that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-vaccination-drive-in-ukhand-badly-hit-as-most-private-hospitals-await-vaccines/articleshow/83265996.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Huzurabad win must for Eatala Rajender to reinforce his image||HYDERABAD: Former minister Eatala Rajender has a tough task on his hands to retain his Huzurabad Assembly constituency, as several other leaders who were either shown the door, or themselves came out of the ruling TRS party, have failed to make a dent on the ruling party’s electoral prospects in the past. One of the richest politicians in the country Konda Vishweshwar Reddy had won the Chevella Lok Sabha seat on the TRS ticket in 2014. Just before the 2018 Assembly elections, he quit TRS to join Congress. Though he contested the Chevella parliamentary constituency on Congress ticket in 2019, he lost to the TRS. Former minister Konda Surekha and ex-MLC Ramulu Naik too failed to defeat TRS in the elections they contested after coming out of the party. She joined Congress after leaving TRS, only to lose the election to TRS’ Challa Dharma Reddy in Parkal Assembly constituency in the 2018 Assembly polls. Even MLC S Ramulu Naik—who came out of TRS alleging injustice by the party leadership—could not win the Graduate MLC poll from Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam constituency. Interestingly, all these leaders had contested on Congress ticket, but Eatala—or one of his family members—is likely to go to the hustings as a candidate of BJP in the bypoll to Huzurabad constituency. Political analysts said it would be crucial for Eatala to retain the Huzurabad seat keeping in view his political future. In case of one of his family members is contesting the bypoll, the damage would be minimal to Eatala’s political future even if the seat is lost. But a victory would see BJP increasing the heat on the ruling party ahead of 2023 Assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huzurabad-win-must-for-eatala-to-reinforce-his-image/articleshow/83268721.cms||Roushan Ali

On the basis of all the medical parameters today, his condition has been observed better than yesterday. He is closely being monitored by a team of three doctors,” the statement read. Milkha’s family also issued a statement through a spokesperson that the athlete “is stable and doing well, but still on oxygen.” “Please ignore the rumours floating around. It’s false news,” the spokesperson said, referring to some false social media posts about his death doing the rounds since morning. Sports minister Kiren Rijiju also quashed the rumours. “Please don’t run false news and create rumours about the legendary athlete and pride of India Milkha Singh Ji. He is stable and let's pray for his fast recovery,” he tweeted. The 90-year-old was on Thursday admitted to the hospital after his oxygen level started dropping. The four-time Asian Games gold medallist’s son and golfer Jeev Milkha Singh confirmed the development. “Milkha Singh ji’s condition is stable and he is on oxygen in ICU of PGI,” Jeev said. On Friday, the 1958 Commonwealth Games gold medallist had received a phone call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi enquiring about his health. Modi expressed hope that the former athlete will be back soon to “bless and inspire athletes, who will be participating in the Tokyo Olympics.” The Padma Shri awardee is suspected to have contracted the infection on May 19 from a house help. Meanwhile, Milkha’s 82-year-old wife Nirmal Kaur, who had also contracted Covid-19 days after her husband got infected, continues to be in the ICU of Fortis hospital, Mohali. “Mrs Nirmal Milkha continues to battle it out valiantly. Thanks so much for your continued prayers and wishes. We are grateful,” the statement from the family further read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/docs-kin-scotch-milkha-dead-rumours-say-he-is-stable/articleshow/83267008.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The study titled ‘Multicentre Epidemiologic Study of Coronavirus Disease-Associated Murcormycosis, India’ soon to be published in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) journal Emerging Infectious Diseases by a group of authors led by city-based Dr Atul Patel, also highlighted the fact that 65% of the deceased were diabetics and 32% of them had ICU stay due to Covid-19 infection. The study’s focus was to understand the impact of Covid-19 on prevalence of mucormycosis, and the researchers claimed that the number of normal mucormycosis cases remained the same, whereas Covid-associated mucormycosis (CAM) doubled. In comparison of survivors and non-survivors after six weeks of treatment, the non-survivors (deceased) were slightly older at mean age of 55 years compared to 53 years for those who survived the infection. Only 17% of those who succumbed had only Covid as underlying condition, whereas 65% had diabetes and 2% each had renal transplant and blood diseases. In terms of spread of the infection, 45.5% of the deceased had rhino-orbital (nose and back of the eye) involvement, followed by 35.5% who had rhino-orbito-cerebral (involving nose, eye and part of brain). About 13% had pulmonary involvement, the study found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eye-nose-infection-in-45-of-mucormycosis-deaths-study/articleshow/83267767.cms||Parth Shastri

The five suspects, including two criminals on record, were arrested by the crime branch on the charge of robbing a bag containing Rs13.5 lakh from the car of a businessman by diverting the attention of driver at Wagholi on April 30. The suspects have been lodged in Yerawada central jail. Police had seized a car, bike and other articles, collectively worth Rs7.14 lakh, from the possession of Gunjal and his accomplices Pradip Kondhalkar (24), Ishappa Pandi (19), Ganesh Kale (32) and Vijay Rathod (22). Investigations conducted by senior inspector Ganesh Mane from crime branch (unit VI) and his team revealed that gang leader Omkar Gunjal (24) from Lonikand was running an organised crime syndicate for committing robberies and dacoities and creating a reign of terror on Ahmednagar highway over a period of time. Mane, under the guidance of deputy commissioner of police Shrinivas Ghadge and assistant commissioner of police Laxman Borate, initiated a proposal to invoke MCOCA against Gunjal and others. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale considered Mane’s proposal and accorded sanction to invoke the stringent law.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad school seeks post-dated cheques||AHMEDABAD: St Xavier’s High School, Loyola Hall, has decided to collect post-dated cheques from parents that would reflect the amount payable towards school fees for the academic year 2021-22. The decision has been taken after the Ahmedabad-based school faced Rs 55 lakh deficit last year after many parents did not pay fees. To avoid a similar situation this year, Fr Xavier Amalraj, principal of the school, said he has written a note to the parents giving instructions regarding depositing fees for the new academic year beginning June 7. The post-dated cheques were to be submitted to the class teachers between June 2 and June 5. Last year, authorities of self-financed schools in Gujarat agreed to the state government’s proposal of slashing tuition fees by 25% for the 2020-21 academic year. The decision was taken as the Covid-19 pandemic had put many parents under financial duress. The move was expected to offer respite to over 30 lakh students in the state across 20,000 schools. The schools had reopened from January this year in a staggered manner after campuses remaining closed for over nine months. However, they were forced to shut down immediately after Covid-19 cases saw a surge in the state. While the schools are to reopen from Monday for online education, there is no clarity on when they will reopen for in-person classroom teaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-school-seeks-post-dated-cheques/articleshow/83267743.cms||---

---||Pune||Debris dumping by the river irks Kalyaninagar citizens||Pune: Debris dumping by the riverside in Kalyaninagar has agonised residents because their complaints before civic officials have gone unheard. Citizens have reported construction debris being dumped on an almost daily basis on the river banks in Kalyaninagar, leading to water pollution. Even after residents raised an alarm regarding debris dumping yet there has been no action from the civic body, said Biren Bhatt. “The dumping activity has been taking place since 2018 and there are satellite images that clearly show the dumping on riverbanks,” Bhatt said. Photographs of Mula Mutha river flood water reaching the nullah near the Panchsheel plot in 2019 indicate that the flow has been blocked due to the debris. Residents said that trucks dump debris from nearby areas and this has been proving harmful to the river. After Bhatt raised an alarm via social media on May 16, presenting satellite images and actual photographs of the spot where the dumping was taking, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) responded to Bhatt via Twitter. “Hi, we have created a complaint about your concern and assigned it to the relevant department. The complaint token number is T17418. You can also track the status of your complaint on http://complaint.punecorporation.org Thank you,” the tweet stated. A follow-up of the ticket raised and registered by the PMC revealed that no action was taken in 15 days. Assistant municipal commissioner of Ahmednagar Road ward office Suhas Jagtap said, “A team of sanitary inspectors has been assigned to monitor and take strict action against offenders. It will be ensured that debris dumping is strictly prohibited.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/debris-dumping-by-the-river-irks-kalyaninagar-citizens/articleshow/83268764.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

A 25-year-old sex worker from Budhwar Peth, who was unable to go back to her hometown in West Bengal, said, “We don’t have any savings, so we could not even afford food when the lockdown began. We are grateful for the volunteers of the NGO for providing us with with groceries and ration, so we wouldn’t have to starve.” Another sex worker, who is a mother of two, said, “My children tasted alphonso mangoes for the first time this year, which made them very happy. Since they have to be indoors, the toys given by the NGO keep them entertained and occupied.” The NGO also provides regular counselling to the sex workers to encourage them to work towards a new vocation and learn new skills to opt for an alternate career.

The plan, which has been drafted with the help of experts, will be implemented in the next five years. “It is because of the wetland that we don’t feel water scarcity the way other Indian cities do. It has been recharging ground water of the city, despite daily withdrawal. It naturally purifies the waste water of the city and discharges it in rivers. Otherwise, we would have had to pay a few thousand crores to treat effluent,” Kumar said. He pointed out that the plan included encouraging farmers to go organic. “We will ask them not to use chemical fertilizers and pesticides to preserve the rich EKW biodiversity,” said Kumar. Minister in charge of environment Ratna De Nag agreed that saving EKW was their priority. Kumar pointed out that the onslaught of Amphan and Yaas has changed the alignment of Bengal’s coastline. “In some places, the sea has eroded into more than 300 metres inland. We have drawn up ‘Shankarpur-Digha Coastal Management Plan’ to reclaim land, strengthen our embankments in sustainable manner. Replicating the success of planting 5 crore mangrove plants in the Sundarbans, we will plant 5 crore mangroves in Digha-Shankarpur and the riverine areas of N 24 Parganas,” he added. WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra described how people had destroyed the biodiversity, “accelerating the end of human civilization”. “The Covid virus has brought the world to its knees. We may have to face numerous such threats, if we don’t care about the environment immediately,” he said. On the eve of the World Environment Day, the National Green Tribunal reopened a case filed by environmentalist Subhas Dutta for non-compliance of its earlier orders in coastal Bengal. NGT bench comprising justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Gupta (expert member) asked the state to file a compliance report in four weeks. Dutta said, “The sudden disposal of the matter without fixing any responsibility and lack of direction in any major issue have encouraged polluters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-drafts-rs-120cr-plan-to-save-ekw/articleshow/83267772.cms||---

City Chowk’s senior inspector Sambhaji Pawar told TOI, “The deceased was a criminal on police record with 11 offences registered against him at various police stations.” The officer said a few years ago, Khan had married Nabbu’s wife’s younger sister. Following differences, Khan divorced his wife, resulting in clashes between him and Nabbu. In one of the clashes, Khan attacked Nabbu and other family members, leaving them seriously injured, following which, he was booked and arrested for attempted murder. The probe has revealed that on Friday night around 9.30 pm, Shoeb and Khan came across each other and had a heated argument. This was followed by Khan brutally physically assaulting Shoeb. On learning about it, Nabbu rushed to the spot and in a fit of rage, allegedly stabbed Khan thrice in the chest, stomach and thigh. Some of the passersby saw an injured man and rushed him to Government Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared brought dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/criminal-on-police-record-murdered-2-arrested/articleshow/83266088.cms||---

For level-3 of unlocking, an area needs to have a positivity rate of 5-10% or oxygenated bed occupancy of up to 40%. For level-4 places, the positivity rate should be 10-20% or not more than 60% oxygen bed occupancy. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in its order stated that the weekly positivity rate in its jurisdiction was 6.11% and oxygen bed occupancy was 27.47%. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) authorities stated that its weekly positivity rate was 5.8%, while the oxygen bed occupancy was 15.91%. Pune rural with 13% positivity rate and 13.3% oxygen bed occupancy was pushed to the Level 4. Non-essential shops would not be allowed to operate, while marriage attendance cap would be 25 people till further orders. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said splitting the district into three different units would help monitor the rise in Covid cases. He said all the restrictions were imposed after discussions with the authorities concerned. Amid the relaxations in the two corporation limits in the district, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar stressed on strictly following the Covid protocols. He said the Pune municipal corporation and police teams would be on vigil and anybody flouting the norms would be penalised. Kumar’s Pimpri Chinchwad counterpart Rajesh Patil told TOI that civic ward offices would establish 10 flying squads to keep a watch on the use of face masks, following social distancing norms. He said zonal officers of the civic body were empowered to introduce more stringent measures based on local conditions. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh said they were putting in more efforts to increase tests and carry out more surveillance. “There will be thorough monitoring this week to reduce the positivity level, so that more relaxations can introduced after the next review meeting.” “This order will be especially beneficial to small hotels and restaurants, which primarily sell food. For bars or permit rooms, however, this will not be of much help as most of their business is generally done after 5pm; it won’t be economically viable to keep the premises open for just half a day. We hope the administration allows operations till 11:30pm,” Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers Association, said. “The new orders are a significant step towards recovery,” Prashant Girbane, director-general of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture, said. “Industries are already operating at some level, and the new orders give us room to step up operations. The only issue we may face is that of transportation, as we can ferry only 50% of our employees in the company-operated chartered transportation,” Dileep Batwal, secretary, Federation of Chakan Industries, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/low-positivity-rate-o2-bed-occupancy-prompt-pmc-pcmc-to-ease-curbs/articleshow/83268848.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Most of these doctors are now involved with mucormycosis (MM) management as the Covid cases are ebbing. Dr Yogesh Mori, president of Junior Doctors Association (JDA), said that while the association had launched the doctors-on-wheels initiative during Covid times, now the members are managing the back office for MM cases. “The JDA members used to provide first-aid and assessment right at the ambulances outside the 1,200-bed hospital. The initiative was appreciated as it could reduce the mortality and severity till the patients are allotted beds,” he said. “Now members such as Dr Oman Prajapati and Dr Mansang Dodiya manage distribution of amphotericin B in the hospital and carry out HR management duty under the hospital leadership.” Dr Prajapati said that they used to field several calls daily for the injection. “But we would be very stringent when it comes to allocation. Saving every life in MM counts,” he said. Dr Hiren Patoliya, a JDA member and part of the doctors-on-wheels initiative, said that it was a great experience to learn patient management after completion of the course. “We saw several critical cases in the queues outside Covid hospital. Our members used to flag the critical patients who would get priority for admission,” he said. Dr Parth Modi, another member of JDA, said that they often had to face arguments, but the blessings they recceived after the Covid patients got admitted are the memories they cherish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/junior-docs-form-backbone-of-mucormycosis-management/articleshow/83267761.cms||---

However, it has left many students from the districts in a dilemma over their participation in the government organised vaccination drive. So far, close to 7,000 foreignbound students have been registered with health department. A total of 350 students will be given Covishield at IPM every day. The government has sought special permissions from the firm to decrease time interval between two doses to four weeks. Students have raised concerns over government’s failure in arranging vaccinations in districts. “Sir @KTRTRS @KTRoffice please arrange vaccination centers in districts for student who are traveling to abroad for education. Traveling to Hyderabad for vaccination during lockdown would be difficult to most of students. Sir please consider this issue and arrange alternative,” tweeted Rakesh Reddy.

Sources said the administration will take up the issue with the ministry, with a senior official pointing out that they are already working on it. Last year before the coronavirus lockdown was enforced, the matter was discussed in the meeting chaired by UT adviser Manoj Parida with members of Industrial Advisory Committee of Chandigarh. The administration had last converted leasehold plots into freehold in 1983 in commercial category. The matter was also taken by up MP Kirron Kher with the MHA and the ministry of urban development. Industrialists have been demanding for conversion of leasehold property into freehold and leasehold to leasehold in Industrial Area for long. Recently, the administration had even conducted a survey in Industrial Area for checking leasehold plots. The administration had set up phases I and II of Industrial Area during the 1970s on an area measuring 147 acres. The plots are governed by zoning and architectural control, which were prepared according to conditions prevailing at that time. There are 1,884 plots in both phases, of which 700 are 1 kanal and above, while there are 443 and 180 plots measuring 10 and 15 marla, respectively. There are as many as 381 plots of 5 marla. Recently the UT had sought a report of violations in industrial plots, including leasehold and freehold. The report was later prepared by the estate office and put up before the committee formed to address pending demands of industrialists of the city. Thereafter, certain need-based changes in the architectural controls in accordance with modern day industrial requirements were allowed. The UT had said cycle stands could be used for other purposes such as storage of raw material and other industrial related functions. In addition to these changes, the UT had also stated that in wake of theft incidents in industrial areas and requirements of industry, partial covering of central courtyard with poly carbonate sheets for storage only was also allowed, subject to compliance of building bylaws and Fire no objection certificate from competent authority of the municipal corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-plans-to-push-for-leasehold-to-freehold-before-centre/articleshow/83267039.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

CPM state secretary Tammineni Veerabhadram on Saturday sought to ask Eatala how could he join a party which promotes hatred on religious lines. “What happened to your (Eatala) leftist ideology,” he wondered. “How will Eatala do justice to the backward classes and the downtrodden when the BJP government at the Centre is privatising public sector units. It is unfortunate that Eatala has chosen the BJP to safeguard his political future. It is better that Eatala reconsiders his decision of joining the saffron party,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cpms-poser-to-eatala-on-joining-bjp/articleshow/83268858.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

More ventilators and oxygen beds are being arranged in the district and taluk hospitals and some public health centres at the local level, said health department officials on Thursday. Since it is feared that children could be affected mainly in the third wave, pediatric departments will be started in all the taluk hospitals and oxygen arrangements and mini-ICUs will be set up there. Such facilities will be set up in private hospitals also as directed by the state government. In the district women and children hospital, 60 beds will be arranged and special ICU will be set up for children. Ten ventilators will also be installed. There are 40 beds in the hospital now, the officials said. In the taluk hospitals of Ottapalam, Pattambi and Mannarkkad 10 ICU beds will be arranged in the first stage. In the Chittur and Alathur taluk hospitals centralized oxygen beds will be set up. To overcome rush of patients, mainly children, during the possible third wave of Covid-19, local-level public health centres and community health centres will be strengthened, they added. The CLFT centres of Perumatty, Kanjikode and Mangad will be expanded to meet any emergency situation. The second wave has already put great pressure on the health facilities in the district. The average TPR in the district on Thursday stood at 21.37%. In 33 grama panchayats, the TPR is above 30% and it is above 40% in three, the officials said.

Occupancy of beds in civic areas may pose a hurdle. Even if these hospitals are located in civic areas, many beds are occupied by outsiders. The bed occupancy was 35% in PMC and 23% in PCMC, respectively. In PMC areas, 8,271 beds out of 12580 beds were vacant, while in PCMC, 8095 beds out of 10,475 were empty. According to civic officials, majority of positive patients in municipal areas are in home quarantine. The data of the Pune Metropolitan region (PMR) region shows that 2,927 people in PMC are in home isolation, while 1,903 patients in PCMC are receiving treatment at home. Critical care expert Kapil Borawake, who is attached with intensive care units at Sahyadri hospital and Vishwaraj hospital, said, “The number of Covid occupancy in the city’s ICUs has gone down below 30% . Among those currently undergoing care, more than 70% are from rural areas of Pune and small towns in adjoining districts.” Apart from positivity rate, the other key factor in giving relaxations from lockdown is hospital bed occupancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/70-of-those-undergoing-care-from-non-urban-belt/articleshow/83268863.cms||---

As on May 4, 2021, a large number of private hospitals that have contracted with M/S Serum Institute of India & M/S Bharat Biotech have been supplied with Covishield and Covaxin doses. These private hospitals are not limited to bigger metros but also from Tier II and III cities across states,” the ministry said. Some of the smaller cities to have recieved vaccines through private route include, Guntur, Nellore, Srikalahasthi and Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh, Dibrugarh in Assam, Sambhalpur in Odisha, Ankleshwar, Kutch, Morbi, Vapi and Surat in Gujarat, Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Palghar in Jharkhand, Jammu, Srinagar in J and K, Bellary, Davangere, Mangalore, Mysuru, and Shimoga in Karnataka. There were several other such cities and towns. There is regular communication with states and UTs, informing them on vaccines received by private hospitals against contracted doses so that their performance is closely monitored. Also, a regular review is being taken with manufacturers to follow-up status of each delivery to the states and private institutions. Terming reports on vaccine inequity as “inaccurate and speculative”, the government said it is in regular discussion with states and UTs to ensure the vaccination programme is run efficiently. States with less number of private hospitals have been requested to review the status and list out the better performing hospitals under AB-PMJAY and state specific insurance schemes, keeping a geographical spread in mind and encouraging them to get in agreement with the vaccine manufacturers,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-denies-new-policy-is-creating-vaccine-inequity/articleshow/83272340.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Forget Tax, Focus On Vax||Thiruvananthapuram: Finance minister K N Balagopal's maiden budget, presented in the assembly on Friday, had limited its focus to Covid-19 emergencies but it neither made any new tax proposal nor dared to explore options to cut the state's soaring expenditure cost. The revised budget set aside Rs 1,000 crore for vaccine procurement and another Rs 775 crore for Covid care and preventive measures. The new finance minister, however, shunned the predilection of his predecessors for frills and gimmicks in presenting the budget. Poems and quotable quotes found no place in his speech. Instead, he delivered a matter of fact speech that lasted only an hour and one minute. The differences, however, ended there. After all, it was a revised budget with very little choices.Throughout his speech, Balagopal tried to present the dire situation of the state economy, which has contracted by nearly 4% in the 2020-21 fiscal. Echoing his predecessor T M Thomas Isaac’s oft repeated statement, Balagopal put forth the second Pinarayi Vijayan government’s fiscal policy: “Borrowing is not a sin and mounting debt can't intimidate the Leftist government”. “We face a severe financial crunch. But that won’t scare us away from loosening our purse to bring support to the needy. The government would continue with the free grocery kit distribution. Enough would be done to ensure cash flow to the vulnerable sections badly hit by the pandemic. The health infrastructure facilities will be ramped up to face all sorts of health emergencies. Once the economy bounces back, we would think about tax hikes,” he said.The minister later clarified further the reasons that prompted him not to go for tax increase. "Even if we increase the tax now, we will have to announce another amnesty scheme soon,’’ he said, hinting that the poor health of the economy was the only reason that prompted him not to explore tax hike options. However, the realistic views of a contracting economy described by the minister in his budget speech and later during his interaction with media, did not reflect in the budget documents. He shared Isaac’s anticipation that the state economy could dramatically bounce back to achieve a 6.6% growth in GSDP growth rate from the -3.82 growth rate it registered in the 2020-2021 fiscal. It may be recalled that governor Arif Mohammed Khan, in his address to the House, had said the 6.6% GSDP growth projected by the government for 2021-22 seemed unrealistic, given the second Covid wave and lockdowns. If a highly optimist Isaac dreamt that the state's revenue receipts would jump to Rs 1,28,375.88 crore in 2021-22 from Rs 93,115 crore in 2020-21, and the state's own tax revenue would grow from Rs 45,272 crore to Rs 73,120 crore, the medium fiscal plan tabled by Balagopal projects a still higher growth for the period. According to documents, he expects the revenue receipts to increase by around Rs 2,600 crore in 2021-22, though the state's own tax revenue could go down by close to Rs 1,300 crore.Ambiguity took the sheen away from the Rs 20,000 cr Covid package announced to revitalise the economy. After announcing Rs 8,900 crore for direct cash transfer to those under financial stress owing to loss of livelihood due to the pandemic, the minister had to explain outside the assembly that the cash transfer would only be in the form of existing welfare pensions, state’s contribution to MGNREGA workers and payment of pending bills of government contractors. “What is important is that money should reach their hands in one way or another,’’ he said, prompting opposition leader V D Satheesan to term the claims about the entire Rs 20, 000 crore package a hoax. Additional resource mobilisation for announcements made in the revised budget was not listed in the revised budget estimates, he said.Balagopal presented a Rs 1866.79 cr deficit budget, which showed an additional expense of only Rs 1,715 cr from the one presented in January. The minister, however, said he was open to queries and criticism of the opposition besides promising to engage in dialogue with them. “It’s true that the new finance minister had very little elbow room as he presented only a revised budget. But, it is surprising that there is no attempt to address the burgeoning debt. The revenue and fiscal deficit of the state have increased by 60% as per the latest data. Even if he is wary of introducing new taxes, he could have definitely attempted certain measures to cut the government expenditure," state finance commission former chairman B A Prakash said.The budget promised to address the new challenges faced by the education sector and promised to speed up KSFE's laptop purchase scheme. At the same time, in a major departure from the original scheme announced by Isaac in the last budget, Balagopal said the government has dropped plans to develop a `modern digital platform' to link potential job seekers with global companies, under the Knowledge Economy Mission. He said the government would roll out the project in association with the existing recruiting agencies and their platforms to leverage the Work from Home (WFH) concept in vogue.\Public finance expert and social scientist Ram Mohan said the new finance minister should be congratulated for having presented a fairly transparent and honest account of Kerala’s public finance. However, he said the budget should have explored steps to improve the tax administration. "Failure to collect tax is a major problem. Uncollected taxes of the state amounts to Rs 20,000 crore,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/forget-tax-focus-on-vax/articleshow/83260801.cms||---

For a lane where every square foot of space is worth thousands of rupees, planting of trees was out of the question. But about 300 residents of Kumbhar Sheri’s 63 houses have done the unthinkable and send across a message for citizens in the old city areas of Surat on this World Environment Day. Only one car can pass at a time through the lane in Kumbhar Sheri. In the past six years, the residents of Kumbhar Sheri have grown 18 trees in the narrow lane and have planted several oxygen generating plants in nearly 300 pots. The residents are projecting their lane as a model on how plantation on a small scale is possible even in congested localities. Raju Chunara, a businessman and resident of Kumbhar Sheri loves planting trees. “When I used to go for plantations in the lanes of Mahidharpura people used to object to it claiming that there was no space and lane would get more congested. So, me and other residents of my lane decided to prove that with planning, plants will not create problems. On the contrary, it will help improve the atmosphere of the locality,” said Chunara. Ghanshyam Maisuriya, another resident of Kumbhar Sheri said, “We live in the centre of the city. We hope that this plantation practice spreads to other areas. We even go to other areas for plantations.” About 15 boys and girls from Kumbhar Sheri volunteer for plantations in Mahidarpura area. All the residents of the lane are responsible for plants outside their houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/green-lane-in-heart-of-diamond-trading-hub/articleshow/83266602.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

In PMC areas, the number has gone below the 5,000-mark. In the second week of April, it was at 55,000. In PCMC limits, there are now 3,000 patients undergoing treatment, down from a peak of 25,000. Data shows that since mid-April, there has been a 90% drop in active cases in PMC limits and an 88% fall in PCMC limits. Also, both the civic bodies have been reporting less that 500 Covid cases for the last six consecutive days. The recovery rate in the region is now 97%. Health officials said there there has been no fresh surge of cases in the last two weeks, from anywhere in these two regions. A PMC official said, “The drop in daily cases has also led to a reduction in the number of micro-containment zones in the city, to less than 30. Seven civic wards have no micro-containment zones because of the shrinking numbers. Three civic wards have added less than 100 cases in a week's time. The case doubling rate in the city has increased to 900 days.” Sanjeev Wavre, assistant health chief at PMC said, “Though the cases have been on the decline, the administration has kept a plan ready if surges do occur. Over 9,000 beds at our Covid Care Centres can be made operational and cots at the jumbo facilities can be recommissioned as per requirement.” Meanwhile, data released by the district health office has revealed that daily caseload in rural areas of the district, which was on the rise, has been steadily declining. A week ago, Pune rural had over 20,800 active patients. The number reduced to 11,400 — a steep fall of 9,400 within a week. “We have been implementing strict measures in rural areas, which includes tracing of people suspected to be infected and restrictions on movement and gathering. Some areas have been identified as hotspots. Monitoring has been stepped up in these locations,” a health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sharp-drop-in-active-case-count-in-both-civic-limits/articleshow/83268874.cms||Sarang Dastane

Finance minister K N Balagopal has allocated Rs 5 crore for building infrastructure facilities for fish processing considering the possibilities for making value-added products. Officials in the fisheries department said alternative modes of employment related to fishing are envisaged in the crisis-ridden sector. “Projects for self-help groups in the community are already addressing the welfare of fisherwomen. Employment opportunities are being generated for children of fishermen who have graduated from colleges,” said an official of the department. In the budget presented a few months ago, the state had announced a scheme to supply kerosene with a subsidy of Rs 25 per litre at a total allocation of Rs 60 crore. The traditional fishermen are operating their fishing crafts having out-board motors which use kerosene as fuel. The quantity of kerosene available under the PDS system is very limited and fishermen depend on middlemen for kerosene, often at exorbitant rates. “Matsyafed has implemented a scheme to supply subsidized white kerosene with a subsidy of Rs 25 per litre. This has resulted in the reduction of operating expenses,” said Lawrence Harold, managing director, Matsyfed. However, fishermen unions are a dissatisfied lot. “The trade unions led by Left parties themselves had urged the Centre to provide Rs 7,500 per month to each community member as financial aid to the unorganized sector affected by Covid. We are facing starvation. The fisheries sector has been reeling under losses due to the fall in marine catch, especially Indian oil sardines from 2012-2017. This was at a time when there were 120 fishing days in a year. Against that, last year there were hardly 40 days because of Covid restrictions and extreme rainfall and cyclones. From January 1, 2021, not a single inboard vessel has gone fishing,” said Charles George, state president, Kerala fish workers forum. In his budget speech, finance minister said the present NDA government has been trying to take away the controlling rights of state governments over the coastal sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fishing-community-unhappy-with-budget/articleshow/83266122.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

SCR chief public relations officer, Ch Rakesh said the zone loaded 44,374 tonne of parcels during May in the current financial year. “The achievement is significant considering the pandemic situation across the nation. Since the Covid outbreak last year, the zone ensured the supply chain of the essential commodities is not affected. In addition, special focus is being given to support the agricultural sectors, by initiating kisan rails from several new destinations,” he said. As per the official record, the parcel earnings recorded by SCR for May is almost Rs 3 crore higher than the previous highest parcel revenue earned during January 2021. The zone recorded the highest ever single day parcel earnings of Rs. 1.09 crore on May 6 2021. “One of the major contributors for this growth has been the 40 time-tabled parcel trains operated by the zone during May. These trains have helped in the transportation of several essential commodities like fruits, medicines among others,” Rakesh said. The revenue for May includes milk transported through ‘Doodh Duronto’ specials to Delhi. SCR has operated 69 kisan specials transporting 24,748 tonne of agricultural produce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scr-earns-revenue-of-rs-19-1cr-in-may/articleshow/83266124.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The drive assumes significance in wake of the dwindling vaccination numbers in the city. The initiative was taken up by officials of the City police station in the old city area and is likely to be extended in other police station areas too. Officials of the City police station took up a drive to register and ensure vaccination of vegetable vendors in the Bhoiwada and Fatehpura vegetable markets. The police had tied up with Kalyanprasad temple in the old city for vaccination. It ensured 32 vegetable vendors were vaccinated on Saturday and officers are eyeing vaccination of 100 or more vendors and persons with similar profiles on Sunday. City police inspector V R Vaniya said that the drive will be targeting a population that can be vulnerable to Covid-19 or could be superspreaders. “We will vaccinate labours, rickshaw drivers and people who come in contact with more number of people,” he said. The police creates awareness using a public address system even as the She Team of the City police station remained present to register people. Their vaccination was taken up immediately. After the drive, the initiative was discussed by the top brass of the city police. It was appreciated and will be taken up elsewhere too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-take-up-drive-to-ensure-jabs-for-vegetable-vendors/articleshow/83266466.cms||---

ZP CEO Mangesh Gondawale said plateaus from Gautala, Sarola, Bhendala, Daultabad viewpoint and Gogababa hill will be covered under the green drive. “We have been planting around 70 varieties of seeds on the plateaus to develop grassland and scrubland on the line of Kaas plateau. The idea is to develop the biodiversity of these plateaus and not encourage any tourism,” he said.In an official drive, the Aurangabad district administration began planting 6,000 saplings at the foothills of Gogababa hill. Speaking on the occasion, Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said conservation of nature should become an integral part of every citizen. The MGM University here had organised a lecture of conservationist H M Desarda to mark the occasion of World Environment Day. “The human being at large needs to minimize intervention in the ecology by reducing different man-made activities that are harmful to nature,” said Desarda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/seed-sowing-activity-marks-world-environment-day-in-aurangabad/articleshow/83266137.cms||---

Timber merchants said auctioning the logs in time could have earned the state coffers several crores of rupees. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had a few days ago enquired about what had happened to the thousands of trees uprooted by cyclone Amphan. According to a KMC parks department official, 15,000 trees in the city were destroyed that night. The civic body had cut the uprooted trees and the logs were stacked in parks and grounds. The task of auctioning was handed to West Bengal Forest Development Corporation and the sale was to be finished by 2020. But the process is yet to take off. The logs now lay scattered, with rot setting in, said a civic official. But, a forest official said, the auction might have been derailed by the pandemic. Trees uprooted in Salt Lake and New Town are also lying in Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation and New Town Kolkata Development Authority warehouses. NKDA officials said for the 4,647 felled trees, they had replanted 3,738. “We have kept all the uprooted trees in our stackyard near Tank 11 in Salt Lake. Not a single tree has been misplaced. We have been working onthe auction process,” said a BMC civic official. Officials said a tender was invited for the auction. With over a year now, most uprooted trees could now be used for fuel, officials said. Around 4,500 trees had fallen in the BMC area during Amphan, of which 2,500-3,000 fell in Salt Lake and its adjacent localities. KMDA also replanted several trees in Rabindra and Subhas Sarobars. Several trees of medium height at the Lake were found retrievable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trees-uprooted-in-amphan-yet-to-be-auctioned/articleshow/83267798.cms||Saikat Ray

The rural area comprises 13 tehsils and 14 municipal councils. On April 28, the number of hotspot villages had increased to 465, which was the highest since the outbreak of the contagion last year. Dr Bhagwan Pawar, the district health officer, told TOI, “We took stringent measures in these villages to restrict the movement of people. We also conducted extensive testing. These measures helped us identify and isolate Covid patients at an early stage, which ultimately resulted in the reduction in cases.” The district administration categorized villages in high and semi-alert villages and told the respective tehsil administrations to conduct door-to-door surveys and organize mass testing, Pawar said.  “As almost all shops and establishments are going to reopen in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal civic limits, we can’t rule out the increasing movement of people. This would again be a big challenge for us,” he said. Pawar said their primary focus would be on aggressive testing and speedy vaccination. The Covid recovery rate had also gone up from 85% on May 19 to 94% on Friday. Ayush Prasad, the Zilla Parishad’s CEO, said, “The situation has significantly improved in rural Pune. Our healthcare facilities have adequate oxygen and ventilator beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hotspot-villages-reduce-to-186-from-397-in-district/articleshow/83268886.cms||Sandip Dighe

These immortal lines from Robert Louis Stevenson’s ‘My Shadow’ have captivated the imagination of children down generations. On Saturday, even grown-ups had an opportunity to marvel at the disappearance of the shadow. At 11.35am, there was no shadow in Kolkata, be it of a 6-ft pedestrian or a 260-metre skyscraper. At that time, the sun was at its zenith or directly over our heads, not a bit to the south or north. “Saturday was zero shadow day in Kolkata. At 11.35am, the proverb, ‘wherever there is light, there should be a shadow’ did not apply. Not just people in Kolkata but everywhere between the Tropic of Cancer (+23.5° latitude) and Tropic of Capricorn (-23.5° latitude) lose their shadows, albeit momentarily, twice a year. Those two days are called zero shadow days. Kolkata, located around +22.5° latitude experienced the first zero shadow day on Saturday at 11.35am,” said MP Birla Institute of Fundamental Research director (research & academic) Debiprosad Duari.  The event is linked to the motions and positions of celestial bodies with respect to earth, which in turn, has a direct bearing on events, like change of seasons, tides and eclipses. “It reminds us of our presence on earth with a cosmic perspective,” he said. Locations north of Krishnagar in Bengal that lies exactly on the Tropic of Cancer will not get a zero shadow shadow, neither will cities located to the south of Sao Paulo, situated on the Tropic of Capricorn. While Saturday’s zero shadow day was during the sun’s northward movement, Kolkata will experience it again on the sun’s return path at 11.41am on July 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sun-right-overhead-no-shadow-at-11-35am/articleshow/83267800.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Pune||Should CT scores guide Covid care? Experts are divided||Pune: The usefulness of the chest CT severity score - which helps define extent of lung involvement in Covid patients - has been over-estimated, some medical experts have said. The score, they said, also has high inter-observer variations, which means values can vary between two or more observers reviewing the same report. They added that a software that's heavily relied on to read data is not standardised either. Treating doctors said the role of the CT severity score then, in decisions regarding triaging, hospitalisation and treatment of Covid patients, is unclear. The doctors said more specific guidelines are needed to address an "unwarranted rush" among patients to know their "score".But radiologists TOI spoke to said the scoring system has been standardized to a significant extent and has helped correctly triage patients. "There is software that helps determine the score. But final assessment is by a radiologist," said radiologist Deepak Patkar, director (medical services) and head (imaging) of the Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital in Mumbai.As for inter-observer variations, Patkar said, "A reporting radiologist gives the CT severity score so there is possibility of a slight variation, which can be expected in any investigation that is based on an observer’s interpretation. But the variation is not wide enough to grossly alter the course of treatment for Covid patients."Breach Candy hospital's radiologist Anirudh Kohli said, "CT severity score may be done manually or via software. The software is, of course, more accurate. Since calculating the CT severity score is a manual and subjective process, we only use automated software at our hospital."The severity score, experts said, is given on the basis of lung involvement patterns. "These depend on geography of the lesion in both lungs and the pattern, which differs according to low or high severity on the high-resolution CT (HRCT)," Pune-based radiologist Avinash Nanivadekar said."The standardization of the CT severity score is based on multiple factors which include radiologists' interpretations, expertise in Covid CT scans readouts, evolving radiology data and scientific evidence," Nanivadekar said.A CT technologist's role is to perform a low-dose high-resolution CT (HRCT) with proper breathing instructions to the patient. A radiologist's role is to evaluate lung fields in Covid pneumonia and other ancillary findings."The radiologist also has to make a decision on Covid-19 pneumonia 'mimics'. The report needs to be interpreted in the context of RT-PCR swab status and symptoms," Nanivadekar added.Wrong notions among people are also to be blamed for the scramble for chest CT scans. "Many times, it (the chest CT) is done too early as people are rushing to know the score. Such an early CT scan tends to provide a false sense of security. Ideally, a CT scan should be done on the sixth or seventh day of illness in a patient," critical care expert Vilas Gundecha said.Infectious disease expert Sanjay Pujari (also a member of the national Covid task force) said the issue is not just with accuracy of the score or observer variations, but clinical usefulness as well."CT severity score has not been incorporated as a trigger for any intervention in national or international Covid-19 guidelines. Treatment (with steroids or remdesivir) is initiated based on the need for oxygen and not the CT severity score," Pujari said.If the patient is stable, the CT scan does not add anything to the management of the patient. "Scores are only rough guides. The clinical picture is what guides decision making," said infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/should-ct-scores-guide-covid-care-experts-are-divided/articleshow/83268896.cms||Umesh Isalkar

As per the autorickshaw financial assistance scheme, autorickshaw drivers get a sum of Rs 1,500 in their bank accounts from the government during the Covid-related restriction period. Senior officials of the Nashik RTO said the decision to provide this financial assistance taken in a meeting chaired by the chief minister on April 19. Accordingly, autorickshaw permit holders must apply for the aid on the website of the state transport department — transport.maharashtra.gov.in. The scheme was also activated at the Nashik transport office under the guidance of RTO Bharat Kalaskar. As per the figures provided by the Nashik RTO, there are 37,636 autorickshaw permit holders in the region. Of them, 6,044 have claimed the benefits. Regional transport officer Bharat Kalaskar said the autorickshaws owners who have not made applications yet should do so at the earliest. The process is easy as the owner just has to fill in the registration number of the autorickshaw, license number and Aadhaar number. He appealed to the presidents of the autorickshaw unions to help their members in filling the application. Bhagwan Pathak, president of the Shramik Autorickshaw, Taxi Union of Nashik said, “More than the financial aid, autorickshaw owners are happy that the government has shown concern for them during such trying times.

On June 1, the 28-year-old from Vizag completed his unfinished task by scaling the world’s highest peak, Mount Everest, in his second attempt. Anmish, who stays in PM Palem area of the port city, was just about 900 metres away from the peak three years ago when he decided to abort his attempt and return to save the life of fellow climber Rambabu, who required immediate medical attention following an injury. He has set a target to scale seven summits in the world and has now completed three with the scaling of Mt Everest (8,849 metres). Before this, he took seven days to scale Mt Kilimanjaro (5,895m), the highest mountain in Africa, in January 2020. A month later, he conquered Mt Aconcagua (6,961m) in South America in five days, just before the world was locked down by the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The MBA graduate, who is also a champion in martial arts, reached the base camp on April 19 in his quest to conquer the Everest. The weather was unstable, and the country was also hit by two cyclones — Yaas and Tauktae — on its eastern and western coast in the following days, which also affected the weather in the Himalayas. Anmish, whose father Venugopala Raju worked with the BSF, underwent a brutal winter training programme in the icy heights of Ladakh before embarking on his Everest mission. “My father was my main motivator. After retiring from the BSF, he worked as a lorry driver to manage the family. Unfortunately, we lost him in an accident in 2014. He always encouraged me to take up adventurous activities. Because of him I took up martial arts. I am also into various social activities,” Anmish, who also contested for Vizag MP seat as an independent candidate in the 2019 general elections, added. His next aim is to scale Puncak Jaya, also known as Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, and Mt Kosciuszko, the tallest mountain in Australia, in July or August this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-climber-scales-everest-sets-eyes-on-oz-peak/articleshow/83268910.cms||Siva G

Before this, he took seven days to scale Mt Kilimanjaro (5,895m), the highest mountain in Africa, in January 2020. A month later, he conquered Mt Aconcagua (6,961m) in South America in five days, just before the world was locked down by the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The MBA graduate, who is also a champion in martial arts, reached the base camp on April 19 in his quest to conquer the Everest. The weather was unstable, and the country was also hit by two cyclones — Yaas and Tauktae — on its eastern and western coast in the following days, which also affected the weather in the Himalayas. Anmish, whose father Venugopala Raju worked with the BSF, underwent a brutal winter training programme in the icy heights of Ladakh before embarking on his Everest mission. “My father was my main motivator. After retiring from the BSF, he worked as a lorry driver to manage the family. Unfortunately, we lost him in an accident in 2014. He always encouraged me to take up adventurous activities. Because of him I took up martial arts. I am also into various social activities,” Anmish, who also contested for Vizag MP seat as an independent candidate in the 2019 general elections, added. His next aim is to scale Puncak Jaya, also known as Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, and Mt Kosciuszko, the tallest mountain in Australia, in July or August this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-climber-scales-everest-sets-eyes-on-oz-peak/articleshow/83273346.cms||Siva G

Volunteers should get in touch with doctors of School of Tropical Medicine (STM) to participate in the trials. “The phase III clinical trial for the newer Covid vaccine, Covovax, is ready to take off soon in Kolkata at the School of Tropical Medicine,” said Santanu Kumar Tripathi, who will be the principal investigator of the trial at STM. Covovax is Serum Institute’s version of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by US-based Novavax, which had announced that the jabs have an efficacy of 96% against the original strain, determined in a phase III trial conducted in the UK. Under the trial protocol, 120 participants will be part of the cohort. Participants will receive two doses of either Novavax or Covovax, both active vaccines, three weeks apart.

Restrictions were imposed last year during April and May due to the first wave of Covid and this year as well restrictions were in place due to the second wave.In April and May this year, there were 179 road accidents in the rural district while during the same period last year, there were 113 accidents. After the Covid outbreak last year, the Centre had imposed a nationwide lockdown from March 25, which continued till May 31. This year as Covid cases started to increase in the district post-February, the district administration and the city police starting imposing restrictions on the movement of people and trade and business. Hence, the rush of vehicles subsided from April 1. The state government also imposed strict restrictions from April 15, which continued till May 31 and even further. As a result, the road accidents in the district also dropped in the rural district. Before the pandemic, during April and May in 2019, there were 249 accidents. Meanwhile, during the Covid induced restrictions in April and May last year, there were 113 accidents, where 84 people lost their lives while 62 were injured. However, even with the recent restrictions, the number of accidents increased to 179, which claimed 115 lives and left 89 people injured.Superintendent of police Sachin Patil of the Nashik rural said the restrictions during April and May in 2020 were far stricter than the recent restrictions in the same months. Hence the rate of accidents, deaths and injuries were more this year compared to last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-rural-58-rise-in-road-accidents-compared-to-last-year/articleshow/83266162.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Criminal complaint against retired cop for lodging ‘false report’||MUMBAI: In a rare instance, a magistrate court recently ordered a criminal complaint to be registered against a retired head police constable for “intentionally lodging a false report against an accused”. Sagar Mayekar, now a 68-year-old Bhandup resident, was booked and arrested for causing death by negligence, after a speeding car he was purportedly driving, knocked down a biker in 2010, subsequently killing him. While in the FIR retired cop Suresh Walzade named the accused, having “witnessed” the accident, during deposition in court he claimed to knew nothing about the accident. The court acquitted the car driver. But reprimanding the retired cop, the court said, “He has given evidence in a very casual manner by deposing that he does not know anything about the accident. It seems that the informant (Walzade) has intentionally lodged a false report stating the name of accused and thereby set the criminal law in motion. Hence, he has committed an offence...” the court said. The court directed its judicial clerk to file the complaint against Walzade. It said the case should be registered under section 211 of Indian Penal Code relating to falsely charging someone for an offence with intent to injure them. The section is rarely used and attracts a maximum sentence of two years in jail. The prosecution said Walzade lodged a report on August, 11, 2018, alleging that when he was on patrol duty along with other staff near Bhandup railway station, the car speeded and rammed into the bike. The FIR said Walzade and other cops picked up the injured, Prathamesh Mahadik, and made him sit in their car. It said the car driver identified himself as Sagar Mayekar. Mahadik had suffered head and chest injuries and was taken to hospital. He died two days later. Mayekar was booked for causing death by negligence. In addition to Walzade, the prosecution examined the victim’s father and investigating officer as witnesses. Other witnesses could not be traced. The father turned hostile in court. He submitted that he did not know what happened to his son and what treatment he was undergoing. The father did not recognise the accused in court. Walzade too turned hostile in court. The investigating officer, however, said he found that the accused by speeding and driving negligently dashed the bike. The court, however, observed that the investigating officer had neither taken photographs of the spot and vehicle nor recorded statements of witnesses on the spot. He admitted that the vehicle involved in the accident was not owned by the accused. The investigating officer also accepted that he had not collected CCTV footage. “The evidence of this witness clearly shows he has not investigated the matter properly. Such evidence of the witness is not useful for the prosecution,” the court said. The court said the evidence was not sufficient to prove the accused was found speeding, driving rashly and negligently, and causing the victim’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-criminal-complaint-against-rtd-cop-for-lodging-false-report/articleshow/83271295.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Sputnik V trial couple champions vax value||KOLKATA: When they first heard that a clinical research organisation was looking for people who could be volunteers for the Sputnik V vaccine, Kalyan Dey and Pujita Mondal were lovers who were about to get married. They got into a pact that for the cause of science, they would be volunteers in the trial and take the first and second jabs before and after their wedding. The idea was to spread awareness about the necessity and importance of vaccination in a pandemic-riddled world. Just before Sputnik vaccines arrive in the city, the two are proud about their contribution and have together started a social media campaign to sensitise the community about the importance of vaccination. They were stopped by many who told them that this might bring in infertility and impotence at a time when they were entering their newly wedded life. But there was no stopping Kalyan, a physiotherapy practitioner at the hospitals run by the Ramakrishna Mission at Narendrapur and at the Bharat Sevasram Sangha, Ballygunj, where he is also a faculty for a physiotherapy course run by Makaut, and Pujita, a yoga teacher at a centre she runs at Sonarpur. The two participated in the trial at Peerless Hospital under the supervision of Subhrojyoti Bhowmick after they were screened and declared fit. Kalyan also had to convince his 64- year old mother to be part of the trial. The two were counselled both by Bhowmick and officials at CliniMed LifeSciences. “They naturally had questions but were very brave; we need more such fearless volunteers today,” said Snehendu Konar, spokesperson for CliniMed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sputnik-trial-couple-champions-vax-value/articleshow/83267807.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Rare intestinal gangrene found among four Covid-hit, two dead||HYDERABAD: Not just the lungs; the deadly coronavirus seems to be damaging the small intestine of patients as well. Since the start of the pandemic, the Osmania General Hospital (OGH) alone has reported at least four cases of a rare intestinal gangrene — all among people who had previously recovered from a bout of Covid-19. While one among these was referred to OGH during the first wave, the other three came to the hospital’s notice during the ongoing second wave. According to doctors, the gangrene is caused due to Covid-19-induced blood clots that have so far been commonly found in the blood vessels of patients’ lungs. It requires removal of the small intestine leaving patients unable to eat any food. A patient either has to be on intravenous feeding for life or undergo an intestinal transplant. Of the four patients at OGH, one has already had a transplant while another is due to undergo it soon. Two other patients — from Wanaparthy and AP — succumbed to the complications, doctors said. Once the small intestine is removed, a person cannot intake any food and can only be kept on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (a method of feeding that bypasses the gastrointestinal tract). During the first case, we had a 20-year-old girl who had developed full bowel gangrene and after the removal of the organ, her father managed to keep her under TPN for four months. An intestinal transplant was then done. Currently, a 60-year-old patient from Mahabubnagar is awaiting transplant,” said Dr C Madhusudan, head of the department of gastroenterology and transplant surgeon, OGH. He added that the incidence of blockages in intestinal blood vessels and bowel gangrene is increasing with Covid-19. Just like clots in blood vessels connecting the heart and brain result in cardiac arrest or brain stroke, in case of intestinal vessels the blockage cuts off blood supply to the intestines, which results in gangrene. Such patients present with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, gradual increase in heart rate, increase in abdominal distension and hypotension. While these cases were few and far between earlier, most of those were reported among the elderly. “We used to see a case once in two-three years among elderly patients with diabetes, high blood pressure, high level of cholesterol etc. But now, we are seeing these cases among young people too,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rare-intestinal-gangrene-found-among-four-covid-hit-2-dead/articleshow/83268919.cms||Amrita Didyala

ACP (Traffic) Sitaram Gaikwad said that IRAD is a system started by the central government that will help in analyzing the cause of road accidents and take corrective measures to prevent accidents in the future. He said that 60 police officers of 13 police stations also received the training. They will from now visit every accident spot in their respective jurisdiction and fill all the details in the IRAD application in their cellphone. Apart from the police, officials of the municipal corporation, public works department, national highway authority of India and the regional transport office also have access to the application. Once the details of the accidents are filled by the police personnel in the application, it is also visible to the officers of the other departments concerned. If the officials notice that more accidents are occurring at a particular road or spot, they can then take up various measures to prevent accidents in the future. In 2020, a total of 935 motorists and pedestrians lost their lives in road accidents across Nashik district. The rural parts of the district had more accidents in 2020, despite of the two-month lockdown, compared to the number of accidents in 2019. Senior officials of the Nashik police said that rash driving, wrong side driving, not following basic traffic rules, not wearing seat-belts and helmets were the main causes of road accidents and deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/205-cops-trained-to-use-irad-app-to-prevent-road-accidents/articleshow/83266166.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The Nashik West forest division on Saturday launched an unique scheme ‘Guler Mukt Nashik’ to persuade children residing in various villages to voluntarily give up using slingshots to kill birds.Forest department teams will visit villages in Peth taluka to interact with children to make them understand why they should not be killing birds. The exercise will continue till June 30. All children who give their slingshots to the visiting forest teams would be given books and chocolates as incentives. “The department will also prepare a list of all such children and after June 30, we will select three children by draw of lots. They would be awarded with a cycle, cricket bat and ball and a volleyball respectively,” said assistant conservator of forest (Nashik West) Anand Reddy. The department plans to replicate the scheme in other talukas. About 250 species of birds are found in Nashik, which houses one Ramsar site and three important bird areas.On Saturday, Reddy led a team at Aad village in Peth taluka and interacted with both the children and elders of the village. “We made a good beginning by collecting 20 slingshots from 18 children of the village. I had fruitful discussion with the village head, who promised that the elders will ensure that henceforth no villager indulges in killing birds,” said Reddy.Explaining the rationale behind the scheme, Reddy said that killing of birds using slingshots is a serious issue in Nashik. There has been a decline of various bird species owing to habitat loss and hunting. Since taking legal action can backfire, the forest department is keen on winning over the villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/stop-using-slingshots-get-bat-cycle-forest-dept-to-kids/articleshow/83266219.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Organised by Ugam, which is a support group of NGO Indian Cancer Society (ICS) , Sunday’s event will revolve around how cancer survivors come out victorious against Covid. For the last seven months, the NGO has been taking care of underprivileged cancer patients suffering from Covid right on its premises in Parel “ICS, in collaboration with Tata Memorial Centre, established and operationalised the 40-bed cancer Covid centre in November 2020. The centre is located on the premises of ICS, Parelbuilding. The state-of-the-art facility funded by TCS and constructed by Tata Projects with the involvement of the BMC is a classic example of synergy among different stakeholders to support the larger cause of cancer,”said Dr Vandana Dhamankar of ICS. The centre was set up in three months and is functioning at its full capacity over the last seven months. Ugam, which was set up to empower cancer survivors, has members who were treated primarily at Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel.

---||Mumbai||Kirit Somaiya says BMC must reveal details of all nine vax bids||MUMBAI: BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has demanded BMC reveal details of all nine bids it received for its global tender for one crore vaccines. Somaiya has been accusing BMC of perpetrating a scam, and said rejection of all bids on Friday vindicated his stand. While global tenders floated by states, including Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab, did not receive any response, BMC received nine bids. Late Friday evening, BMC issued a press release saying it had rejected all bids as the documents were not in order. In a letter to civic chief Iqbal Chahal, Somaiya alleged most bids were fake as the companies existed only on paper. Some companies were formed few days before submitting bids. “They had no experience, no authority and their financial backgrounds were never checked,” he said. Chahal refused to comment on Somaiya’s allegations. The letter states that tender conditions were frequently changed without transparency and logic. “Till the deadline for submission of bids only three were received by BMC. Then on the last day, few hours before submission timing ended, BMC received five tenders, most of them benami and fake. The bids were submitted without relevant documents and BMC accommodated the bids by extending the deadline for submission by eight days.” Somaiya said BMC must reveal the names of bidders and relaxations in tender conditions it had offered along with reasons. “The background of all bidders must be investigated and fake ones must be punished,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-civic-body-must-reveal-details-of-all-nine-vax-bids-says-bjp-leader/articleshow/83267923.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Case dip prompts private hospitals to shift focus to general patients||KOLKATA: With the number of patients dropping steadily across private hospitals that had converted to Covid-only facilities since May, beds and floors are now being opened up for non-Covid treatment. While some will resume non-Covid treatment in a restricted way from Monday, others have already started converting beds for the same. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), 30 Covid critical care beds are being converted into non-Covid from next week. The hospital will also restart day-care emergency services like dialysis and chemotherapy that remained suspended for more than a month. “We have 130 critical care beds of which just 56% is now occupied. Due to a renewed demand for non-Covid beds, we plan to convert 30 Covid critical care beds into non Covid ones from next week. Our non-Covid critical care beds are now fully occupied,” said Narayana Health zonal head R Venkatesh. Peerless Hospital plans to convert one Covid unit into a non-Covid one a week later. Number of Covid patients at the hospital has slumped from 170 to less than a hundred over the last 10 days. “A week later, we may convert yet another Covid unit into a non-Covid one, if the present trend continues, which, I believe, it will. At the moment, we have both Covid and non-Covid vacancies which hasn’t happened in nearly two months. But we can’t admit non-Covid patients in Covid ICU which remains full. So, berths for critical non-Covid patients are still limited at our hospital,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.. In early-May, Medica Superspecialty Hospital had more than 300 Covid patients. It has now dropped to 140 and the hospital has already converted 180 beds into non-Covid ones. “The drop has been quick, thanks to the restrictions and it’s still falling which is great. Now, we need to shift our focus back to non-Covid patients. who have been neglected for the last month-and-half,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. He added that the hospital, that had shut down its OPD at the height of the second wave in early-May, has now started welcoming patients back. At Narayana Multispecialty Hospital in Howrah, a Covid floor will be converted back to a non-Covid unit on Monday. Till last month, Charnock Hospital used two of its four buildings for Covid treatment. “Now, we will have an additional non-Covid building since the Covid numbers have dropped,” said Charnock managing director Prashant Sharma. More than 100 Covid general beds at AMRI Hospitals have been converted to non-Covid since the third week of May across its three units. “We had 425 general Covid beds till two weeks back. We hope to convert at least another 100 by the next fortnight,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/case-dip-prompts-pvt-hosps-to-shift-focus-to-general-patients/articleshow/83267832.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

This was the first mass agitation by the community since the Supreme Court set aside reservation. Nearly 5,000, including women and children, gathered at Chhatrapati Shivaji stadium and then walked to the district collector’s office. Organisers said there will be mega agitations in Aurangabad, Nashik, Pune and Nanded soon, before a final one in Mumbai. Police and district administration said no permission was sought or granted. Superintendent of police R Raja told TOI: “The protest march was in violation of Covid-19 restrictions in the district. An offence has been registered against the organizers and participants.” Fifty officers, 500 policemen and a company of State Reserve Police Force were deployed at the venue and along the route. In addition, 300 posts were set up in the district. Fourteen inter-district nakabandi points were set up to prevent people from entering Beed town.

Domestic helps, Cable TV operators and TV channel staffs have been including in the list of potential super spreaders. The government has put the responsibility of the getting these people vaccinated on Kolkata Municipal Corporation for the city while district magistrates will organise special camps to inoculate them. “Many households are still not allowing domestic helps. Even as many above 45 have managed to take their first dose at government vaccination centres, those between 18 and 44 are still left out of the drive. We need to inoculate them so that they can go back to earn their livelihood,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. Health officials said that even cable TV/channel operators too have to go out on work regularly and they also need the vaccine protection. The health department previously had made a list of prioritised group in the 18-44 category that included the likes of hawakers, transport workers, media persons, transgenders and sex workers.

---||Lucknow||Ayodhya Mosque project to be named after freedom fighter Maulvi Faizabadi||AYODHYA: The Ayodhya mosque-hospital project on 5acre land mandated by Supreme Court will be named after noted freedom fighter and revolutionary Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah Faizabadi, who was martyred on this day 164 years ago. This was announced on Saturday by the mosque Trust — Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation — which decided to dedicate the entire project comprising the mosque, hospital, museum, research centre and community kitchen after Faizabadi, also called ‘Lighthouse of Independence’ for keeping Awadh free of British dominance for over two years after the 1857 revolt. Notably, the mosque Trust constituted by Sunni Waqf Board had exclusively told TOI nine months ago about its in-principle decision not to name the mosque after Mughal emperor Babur.  Talking to TOI, IICF secretary Athar Hussain, said, “On his martyrdom day, we have decided to name the entire project after his name. In January, we dedicated the research centre to Maulvi Faizabadi, who was the icon of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood. Even 160 years after the first war of independence, Ahmadullah Shah Faizabadi is yet to get his due in the annals of Indian history. Masjid Sarai, Faizabad, which was Maulvi’s headquarters during the 1857 mutiny, is the lone surviving building that preserves his name.” After being killed and decapitated by a British agent, they buried his body and head in two different places to prevent people from turning his grave into a mausoleum, said Husain. War veteran and mosque trustee Captain Afzaal Ahmad Khan said, “The British feared Maulvi was as dangerous in death as he was during his lifetime. It’s unfortunate that even though British officers like George Bruce Malleson and Thomas Seaton have mentioned his courage, valour and organisational capabilities in the History of Indian Mutiny, Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah is blanked out in our school and college textbooks.” According to researcher and historian Ram Shankar Tripathi, “While being a practising Muslim, he was also the epitome of religious unity and Ganga-Jamuni culture of Faizabad. In the revolt of 1857, royalties like Nana Sahib of Kanpur, Kunwar Singh of Arrah fought alongside Maulavi Ahmadullah Shah. His 22nd Infantry Regiment was commanded by Subedar Ghamandi Singh and Subedar Umrao Singh in the famous Battle of Chinhat.” Tripathi further narrates that “Maulavi wanted Raja Jagannath Singh of Pawayan, a zamindar in district Shahjahanpur to join the anti-colonial war. On June 5, 1858, with prior appointment, he went to meet Raja Jagannath Singh in his fortress. On arriving at the gate, he was greeted with a volley of gunshots from Jagannath Singh’s brother and retainers. The Maulavi died on the spot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-mosque-project-to-be-named-after-freedom-fighter-maulvi-faizabadi/articleshow/83268948.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

This was a mistake,” said Fadnavis in an online interaction with editors of a daily. Fadnavis and Pawar had been sworn in as CM and deputy CM in 2019 but the government lasted barely 80 hours as NCP leader Sharad Pawar ordered those who had gone along with his nephew to return. Ajit Pawar too finally returned to the NCP fold. Explaining his decision, Fadnavis said he had been stabbed in the back and one has to do whatever is needed to stay alive in politics. “So, when you are stabbed in the back, you have to give a befitting response. When an opportunity arose, we seized it,” he said. His decision to form the government with Ajit Pawar was a result of “mixed feelings which included anger”, he said. “Now, I can say that what we did was not at all liked by our supporters and BJP supporters. I agree that my image among supporters got substantially dented. It would have been better had we not attempted what we did, but at the time I thought it was the right decision,” said Fadnavis. Last week, Fadnavis called on Sharad Pawar. He later tweeted a picture of their meeting, calling it a courtesy call. Political observers said it was clear that Fadnavis is trying to build bridges with the senior Pawar, who did not tweet about the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/move-to-form-maha-govt-with-ajit-mistake-but-no-regrets-fadnavis/articleshow/83267921.cms||---

After failing to find the drug in open market, family members of a patient have posted an appeal on social media requesting for 40 doses of the drug. “My father could not get the drug because KGMU is giving it first to those in ICU. Critical patients need the drug more but mucormycosis is a deadly disease with 50% mortality rate, hence, every patient should get it. However, we have been asked to get it from the market due to shortage at KGMU,” said the patient’s daughter. The drug vanished from the market after a sudden rise in mucormycosis cases last month, leaving patients at private hospitals in the lurch. State health department had made the provision to sell the drug through the Indian Red Cross Society-Lucknow (IRCS-L) to patients at private health facilities. Adequate supply was maintained for patients at three government-aided institutes – KGMU, RMLIMS and SGPGIMS – where the drug is given free of cost. Amphotericin B is the main drug used to check the spread of black fungus infection. The cost of the drug ranges from Rs 1,000-7,000 depending on the brand and the mode of supply. A patient requires six doses daily for at least three days. The treatment can be extended to weeks as per the condition of the patient. The requirement of the drug is high in KGMU because it has nearly 80% (291) of the total patients from across the state undergoing treatment at Lucknow hospitals. KGMU officers acknowledge the shortfall in supply against the demand. “There is a shortage of the drug. At present, the supply is less than what is required due to the huge caseload. However, the university and government is working hard to bridge the gap,” said KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh. The shortage is turning out to be a big ordeal for patients and their families. Son of another patient from Sravasti said, “Doctors say that my father’s eye will have to be removed due to the infection. However, to check the spread of infection further, he requires the drug for at least 14 days, but it is not available in KGMU. With the help of friends, we managed to get an alternate drug, which is not as effective as the original one.” 3 more succumb, 11 new cases reportedThree more patients admitted to KGMU with black fungus infection succumbed to the disease on Saturday. The patients belonged to Barabanki, Pilibhit and Sultanpur. Besides, 11 new cases were reported, which took the number under treatment at the university to 291. Doctors performed surgeries to remove infected tissues on 16 patients. Six were discharged after recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-pvt-hosps-shortage-of-mucor-drug-hits-kgmu/articleshow/83268962.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Mumbai||Pune college could be first in Maharashtra to teach engineering in Marathi||PUNE: Once all permissions come through, Pune’s Pimpri Chichwad College of Engineering (PCCOE) may become the first college in Maharashtra to impart engineering education in Marathi from the 2021-22 academic year. “Across the country, 14 colleges have applied to start a batch in their respective regional language, such as Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Hindi and Bengali,” said Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). Four colleges from Uttar Pradesh, two from Rajasthan, two from Maharashtra, two from Tamil Nadu and one each from Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh have applied for it. While most colleges have proposed to start a batch in computer science, there are proposals for electrical, mechanical and civil engineering as well, with some proposing two batches in different streams, according to data shared by Sahasrabudhe. It is still to be seen how many of the proposals materialise. College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) is the other college in contention from Maharashtra. When contacted, CoEP director B B Ahuja said while they had proposed to start a batch in Marathi this year, the decision was deferred as they wanted to be well prepared before taking on a new initiative. “There were concerns regarding the availability of books. However, the decision has only been deferred for this year. We will again take it up next year,” said Ahuja. G N Kulkarni, director of PCCOE, said, “Our board of governors has approved the decision to start an undergraduate course in Computer Engineering in Marathi. We have applied to AICTE to allow intake of 60 students so that we can start the batch this year itself. We hope to get a positive reply in 10-15 days. We would also need to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Directorate of Technical Education and Savitribai Phule Pune University.” The institute has not yet done any survey to find if any students in the existing batches would have opted for Marathi medium had the option been available to them. “We generally do such surveys when we think of starting a new course on our own. The call to start a batch in a regional language came from AICTE and I am sure they must have conducted a survey,” said Kulkarni. AICTE, in a news conference in March, had quoted from a survey covering 5,000 engineering students studying in second to final year, where 42% had said they would have opted to learn in their mother tongue if the option was available. Tamil had found the most number of takers, followed by Hindi, Telugu, Marathi and Kannada, among others, Sahasrabudhe had said. When asked about the availability of study material, teachers and the challenge of campus placement, Kulkarni said, “At the national level, there is a campaign to translate available textbooks into the regional languages and our teachers are also providing assistance. Most of our teachers speak Marathi as their mother tongue, so orienting them will not be a problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-pune-college-could-be-first-in-state-to-teach-engg-in-marathi/articleshow/83267137.cms||Ardhra Nair

A case of abduction has been registered at Mehrauli police station in south Delhi. Rapper Aditya Tiwari, who goes by the stage name of MC Kode, allegedly went missing from Saidulajab area after being trolled online for comments he made about a religious text during a rap battle four years ago. The old video apparently went viral some days ago. After Tiwari’s address and his phone number were put in public domain, he was trolled. According to the FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, the rapper’s mother, Deepa Tiwari, said she was told that her son had posted an alleged "suicide note" on his Instagram account on June 2. The post allegedly said, “The constant suffering and trials and tribulations of life have made me weak. I hoped for it to end one day and be at peace. Currently, standing at an isolated bridge overlooking the Yamuna river where I could see the waves answering my distress calls while giving me much needed perspective. I could only ask for your forgiveness as my selfish action will definitely cause a great amount of grief but I need you to realise this it comes at the cost of me being finally at peace and safeguarding the people associated with me, give them time to grieve. I do not blame anyone for anything but myself. A relief from my own existence is going to serve as a punishment that the entire country wanted (sic).” Atul Thakur, DCP (South), said, “A missing report was filed but Aditya could not be traced, following which a case of abduction was registered on Saturday. Investigations are on.” Deepa told TOI that she was in touch with her son till May 31 and he hadn’t mentioned his troubles to her. “Cornering someone for an online video that was shot when he was not even 18 years old isn’t right,” she said. “I don’t keep track of social media all the time, but his friends reached out and I felt something was amiss. We are now living in a vacuum.” Aditya moved from his house to Saidulajab around six months ago because he needed a place that was peaceful to write.

Some of the villages depicted extreme awareness in fighting the problem and Saroda Panchayat Samiti is one of them.The panchayat samiti is located some 60km from the district headquarters and 16km away from Sagwada subdivision. Block development officer Sunil Shah said three villages fall under the panchayat samiti — Saroda, Damorwada and Kesarpura — and has a total population is 7,723.“We all were tense when all of a sudden 82 persons tested positive for the virus and there was a serious threat of more people falling ill. Before waiting for the district administration to impose prohibitory orders, the gram panchayat held an emergency meeting and we announced a complete lockdown of 15 days even before the state’s Jan Anushasan Pakhwada was imposed,” sarpanch Pannalal Dodiyar said.The entire area was sanitised. “Complete lockdown was adhered to by the villagers seriously and shops, establishments were completely shut from May 3 to 17,” up-sarpanch Praveen Pandya said.The most commendable initiative was taken by the village youths who created a WhatsApp group called ‘Sathi’ and raised funds through donations. The money was used to purchase steam machines, sanitisers, masks, gloves and oximeters that were distributed to all the infected patients. Five committees of ward panchs were formed who were responsible for contact tracing and getting their sampling done at the hospital.Every Monday, massive sampling was held at the CHC here. The core committees visited homes to take feedback from villagers on their health conditions. A panchayat helpline centre was set up where people could approach for all kinds of Covid related assistance. When people required medical kits, the help centre would facilitate home delivery of the same. The Sathi team distributed masks, medicines, ayurvedic kadha to homes from the money they raised through crowdfunding.A whopping amount of Rs 1.21 lakh had been collected within a short span and the volunteers ensured every rupee was spent in extending relief to distressed villagers. Social functions and gatherings were completely prohibited as panch committees spread word of caution to stay alert until the virus is defeated completely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dungarpur-villagers-raise-funds-to-distribute-essentials/articleshow/83267846.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Sarpanchs, youths create awareness on vaccination in rural areas||Jodhpur: While the focus has shifted to rural areas to control the spread of corona infection, bringing villagers under 45+ category out for vaccination is turning out to be a huge challenge for the administration and the medical staff.Amid this reluctance, sarpanchs of some villages and some youths have come forward to encourage these villagers for vaccination through door-to-door visits. They are creating awareness and addressing the myths associated with vaccines.Among such youths, one Dixit Parihar of Jodhpur has taken up the initiative to disseminate awareness about vaccination among the villagers. A budding journalist, Parihar has focused on villages of Osian sub-division and is meeting villagers to inform them about the benefits of vaccination in this alarming situation.Parihar has been distributing pamphlets in the villages and has been doing door-to-door surveys for the past several days to spread awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic.“There is a lot of fear and ignorance among the villagers about it. Villagers think that getting a corona vaccine can lead to death or some other complication. Elimination of these unfounded beliefs is very important for the success of vaccination,” Parihar said.He has visited villages near Osian like Dabri, Khabra and Khetasar, and has approached the villagers with the help of the medical staff there, who have not yet been vaccinated despite the eligibility to convince them into getting vaccinated.He claimed that his efforts have borne fruit and many of the villagers have got the jab after his persuasion.Similarly, Bhanwarlal Prajapat, sarpanch of Deonagar in Balesar subdivision, has also been walking door-to-door to convince villagers for vaccination.He has prepared a list of villagers who have not yet got the jab and has got invitation cards printed, which he has been distributing to these villagers with a request to visit the vaccination camp, scheduled at the gram panchayat on June 7.Prajapat said that instead of the government machinery, if sarpanchs, being local persons, take up this task in their hands and convince the villagers, vaccination would be a success in villages too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sarpanchs-youths-create-awareness-on-vaccination-in-rural-areas/articleshow/83267847.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Guv Mishra acting under Centre’s pressure: Chief whip Joshi||Jaipur: The Congress government and the state governor could once again be heading towards a face off. The flashpoint currently is governor Kalraj Mishra’s letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot demanding a probe over alleged deliberate wastage of covid-19 vaccines in Rajasthan.Chief whip in the state assembly Mahesh Joshi has accused Mishra of working under pressure from the Central government in demanding the probe. Joshi said that earlier too governor Mishra acted under pressure from the Centre in refusing to convene the assembly session despite the cabinet recommending it twice. The chief whip was referring to the tussle between Gehlot-government and governor Mishra during the rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot in July-August last year.“At that time, we maintained the governor’s dignity. Now again the governor is doing the same thing,” Joshi told reporters on Saturday. He added, “The governor is a good man, but he acts under pressure from the Centre. He is unable to tolerate pressure.”Joshi said, “There is demand of probing an issue which is not even an issue. An atmosphere is being created about wastage of covid vaccines, while we have a complete record of how many vaccines got spoiled. The wastage is least in Rajasthan.” He added, “If we talk of real issues, why did the governor not demand free vaccination for Rajasthan’s youths from the Centre? Why did he not write to Centre when there was shortage of oxygen, remdesivir and black fungus injections in Rajasthan?”Joshi said, “If a probe is needed, let the central government set up an inquiry on how much vaccine was wasted in all the states.”Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas claimed that Rajasthan made the most efficient use of the vaccines. “For the 18+ category, we got 17,87,720 doses of covishield and covaxin, but we administered 18,16,130 doses, which is 28,410 doses more. This happened because we gave 11 doses, instead of 10, from a single vial,” Khachariyawas said. He added, “BJP is trying to make wastage an issue because it does not want to vaccinate the country’s youth for free and is diverting public attention.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/guv-mishra-acting-under-centres-pressure-chief-whip-joshi/articleshow/83267876.cms||---

That is why, some Vashi residents like advocate Nilesh Bhojane and others contacted the NMMC and Reliance hospital at Koparkhairane to organise the vaccination camp. Funds were internally raised in the ward; our aim is to make the entire ward fully vaccinated,” said a local organiser, Anshu Vaardhaan. He further added: “Many lower middle-class citizens like drivers, maids, courier boys, gardeners, liftmen among others are in the high-risk category, but are not considered frontline workers. That is why some of the citizens decided to collect funds for the inoculation....”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/900-needy-persons-at-high-risk-get-free-vax-in-mumbai/articleshow/83271350.cms||Vijay Singh

The commission has put rehabilitation of these children on priority and has written to all the districts to share their plans at the earliest. The commission has already received a list of more than 1,500 children and more are being added almost daily, claimed officials. Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “We have asked for the list of orphaned children from the districts and not just of those who have lost their parents due to Covid but others as well. We have asked for the measures taken by them for rehabilitation of the children. While the education and health department has expressed its willingness for this, we are also looking at setting up shelters in the existing government homes where there are very few children especially girls whose parents have died. Once the proposal is finalised, we will send it to the government so that it can be deliberated upon." The commission will also look at providing for the children who have lost one parent or been abandoned by their families due to various reasons. Officials claimed that they will incorporate government policies like Palanhar scheme and others to facilitate the process. The state government had declared that it would look after children orphaned during the pandemic, irrespective of whether their parents died due to Covid or some other ailment. A few days ago, the Central government had also declared to provide care for children orphaned due to Covid and launched the Bal Swaraj Portal wherein states were asked to provide details of the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-panel-to-draft-proposal-for-rehabilitation-of-orphan-kids/articleshow/83267873.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

He broadcast his act live on Facebook and had almost bled to death when Facebook, cyber cell and PCR-emergency response vehicle personnel swung into action. They tracked the man using technical surveillance tools and rushed him to two hospitals, saving his life in the nick of time. Lal, a father of two kids, has been emotionally vulnerable since the death of his wife in 2016. An altercation with neighbours triggered him, who is a worker at a sweet shop, to take the extreme step. As he went live on Facebook, the platform’s internal system, which flags any such attempt, rang an alarm. Around 12.50am, DCP (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy received a call alert from Facebook’s US office about a suspicious self-harm live video being posted by a male Facebook user located in Delhi. The alert was generated as part of the coordination framework established between the cyber cell and international social media platforms. Immediately, cops checked and analysed the account details shared by Facebook over email. The number linked to the Facebook account was found to be switched off. Cops then obtained the address linked to the given mobile number, which turned out to be of Palam, near Sector 6, Dwarka. The information was shared with Palam Village police station. Simultaneously, the information, including the likely location of the person and his Facebook live clip in which he was showing suicidal tendencies, was also shared with the Delhi Police Command Room for activating the nearby PCR vans and emergency response vehicles. PSI Amit Kumar of Palam Village police station rushed to the given address. When Kumar and his ERV reached the given location, he found the man in a very bad shape with heavy blood loss. He and his team rushed the man to a nearby hospital, but seeing his critical state, the hospital advised to take him to a better facility. The man was then taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre. As per the latest updates, due to the timely medical intervention, his life was saved despite the excessive blood loss. Police commissioner SN Shrivastava has appreciated the efforts of the police personnel. They are also going to be rewarded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-save-mans-life-after-facebook-flags-suicidal-activity/articleshow/83268963.cms||---

Also, the level of both the pollutants in a residential area is almost equal to industrial and commercial areas. Track the pollution level in your cityThe facts were revealed in the ‘Assessment of ambient air quality of Lucknow city’, Pre-Monsoon 2021 report, released by the CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) on the eve of World Environment Day on Friday. The gaseous pollutants were monitored in one residential area, Aliganj, and three commercial areas – Charbagh, Alambagh and Aminabad. The ultrafine PM10 and PM2.5 pollants were found to be 10-40% high than permissible limits in various parts of the city by the study, as reported by TOI on Saturday. In all the localities, pollution levels were below the permissible limits of 80 micrograms set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) but higher than the permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (which has stricter norms) of 20 and 40 micrograms set for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, respectively. Diesel vehicles are the major source of the two gaseous pollutants in the city. If inhaled, these pollutants may lead to respiratory problems like bronchitis and may cause coughing, wheezing, phlegm and asthma attacks. “The IITR report reflects that there is an increase in consumption of diesel by 13.5% which may be one of the reasons behind the increasing trend,” said IITR chief scientist GC Kisku.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/air-equally-toxic-in-industrial-residential-city-areas-report/articleshow/83268992.cms||Mohita Tewari

Most people, belonging to denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in the state, can hardly produce an Aadhaar card or any other ID proof to get themselves inoculated. “We have been living here at abasti (ward no. 2) near Khatushyam temple (in Sikar district) for the past 30 years. But we neither have Aadhaar cards, nor ration cards or any other identity document. None in my family has been vaccinated as we don’t have any documents to prove our identity. Everyone should get vaccinated. Yeh sahi hai humare liye (It is the right thing to do),” said Savitri Devi (48), who has11 children and belongs to the Bhopa community and her husband earns a living as a daily wage labourer. “We tried several times to get an Aadhaar card made, but they (agents) demand Rs 5,000 to Rs10,000 to get it done. Where will I get so much money from? We don’t even have the money to arrange food for ourselves on a daily basis. My husband has gone out now to fetch something to eat,” said Savitri. Her husband (Samandar Bhopa) earns around Rs 400-500 a day, but according to Savitri, it has been difficult to find a job during the pandemic. At times, they have to depend on food distributed by the NGOs to sustain a living. A senior official said, the state government has no policy so far to vaccinate the nomadic and denotified tribes in the state. Amra Ram (80), who is a resident of Dhod tehsil in Sikar district and belongs to Bhopa community, said nobody (from local administration) has ever enquired whether he or his wife have got vaccinated. “If they (the government) vaccinate us, we will not refuse. We have no children. My wife (Rama Devi, 75) and I stay alone here. We don’t even get benefits under government schemes as we do not have any identity proof.” According to Gopal Keshawat, former chairman, denotified tribes, nomadic and seminomadic welfare board of Rajasthan, of the 80-90 lakh population of denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in the state, only 3-4 per cent people have Aadhaar or any identity document. According to the draft list of denotified tribes, nomadic tribes and semi-nomadic tribes of India, there are 80 such communities in Rajasthan. “I had written to the centre last year demanding to frame a policy for vaccination of denotified and nomadic tribes as most of them don’t have ID proof. Less than one per cent of the whole nomadic tribes community has been vaccinated so far. I had also demanded a financial package for them, but nothing has been done so far,” said Keshawat. Padma Shri award winner Gulabo Sapera (50), who is an artiste and belongs to the Sapera Kalbeliya community, said, “Forget about vaccines, it has been difficult to arrange two square meals a day for the past one year as we don’t have any means of livelihood now. People are dying of hunger. None of the artistes from our community have been vaccinated. Moreover, we didn’t receive even a single rupee from the state government last year when financial support of Rs 2,500 each was assured to the folk artistes.” The state’s art and culture department had launched the Mukhya Mantri Lok Kalakar Protsahan Yojana to provide financial support of Rs 2,500 to folk artistes during the first wave of Covid pandemic last year. There are around1 lakh artistes in Rajasthan who belong to Kalbeliya, Bhopa, Mirasi, Langa Manganiyar communities.

Health authorities claimed that it will create a demand and people will try to procure it from anywhere which will increase the chances of its black-marketing. The doctors prescribing the medicine are creating a demand for the medicine, despite its unavailability in the state. "For my 53-year-old patient who was undergoing treatment at a private hospital, doctors prescribed 2-DG. We searched for the drug in the market and everywhere in Jaipur and contacted the health authorities but we did not find it," said Hitesh Bandhia, a city businessman. Bandhia said, "Why the doctors are prescribing the medicines which are not available in the market." Not only Bandhia, but a lot of attendants of patients are facing the same problem, who are trying to get the medicine from Delhi. A doctor in Jaipur prescribed 2-DG to a 70-year-old patient whose HRCT score was 20/25 and who was in respiratory distress. His attendants searched for the medicine and also put it on social media but in vain. Aware of unavailability of the drug,the doctors also put a note on the prescription mentioning that the medicine is not available in the market so it has to be procured from outside. A senior health department official said, "The drug has not arrived in the state yet. But, a lot of people are demanding it. When we ask them, they tell us that doctors are prescribing it. I want to make it clear that 2-DG is not available in the state but soon it will be made available. The doctors prescribing it to the Covid patients are unnecessarily creating problems for the attendants of patients, who will try to buy it from anywhere which may give rise to incidents of black-marketing. We are appealing to the doctors since the drug is not available, they should not put pressure on the attendants."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/docs-prescribing-drdos-covid-med-despite-unavailability-in-state/articleshow/83267885.cms||---
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: HC grants bail to 3 men||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has granted bail to three people arrested in connection with last year’s northeast Delhi riots case observing that there was no prima facie evidence to show their involvement in the violence. Justice Mukta Gupta granted bail to Shabir Ali, Mehtab and Rais Ahmed, who are accused of being a member of unlawful assembly among other charges. The court directed the three be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 25,000 each with a surety of like amount. It also imposed various conditions, including that they could not leave the country without prior permission, and in case of change of residential address and/or mobile phone, the same would be intimated to the court concerned by way of an affidavit. “Keeping in view that the petitioners were present as members of a mob at gali No.1 Akhadewali gali after 11pm when some members of this group were armed with sarias (iron rods), dandas (sticks), stones, swords, knives etc, however, there is no material, even prima facie, on record to show that they were members of the mob that was present at Gali No.1 Brahmpuri at 10.30pm that indulged in pelting stones,which caused injuries to Nitin and killed Vinod Kumar, this court deems it fit to grant bail to them,” the court observed. The prosecution cited statements of two constables who had identified the accused among people seen in the footage of CCTV at Gali No.1, Akhadewali Gali on February 24. It alleged that the accused were part of the alleged mob that committed the murder of Vinod and caused injury to Nitin in Brahmpuri. More than 750 cases were registered in connection with the northeast Delhi violence, which claimed at least 53 lives and left several others injured. So far, over 250 chargesheets have been filed in the violence-related cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-delhi-riots-hc-grants-bail-to-3-men/articleshow/83268984.cms||---

The NIA is likely to file the chargesheet in the case by the month-end. Sources said that one of the reasons is that the entire case forms part of a single conspiracy and thus investigations are linked. “The complaint of vehicle theft was fake and was masterminded by dismissed police officer Sachin Waze. Each of the components of the conspiracy cannot be segregated. This includes planting of explosives in the SUV, lodging a false vehicle theft complaint to protect its owner and his subsequent murder,” an officer said. “It was in the benefit of investigations to club all the three cases and let one investigating agency handle it,” said an ATS official. ATS sources said ATS has helped the federal agency with several tip offs and leads in the investigations of this complex case. The ATS had conducted the initial investigations and unearthed the murder conspiracy of SUV owner Mansukh Hiran, had arrested convicted constable Vinayak Shinde and Gujarat-based mobile sim card provider Naresh Gor. The NIA then nabbed cops Riyazuddin Kazi and Sunil Mane. Later in March the ministry of home affairs had handed over the two probes-planting of gelatines and Mansukh’s murder to NIA. The NIA arrested assistant police inspector Riyazuddin Kazi and Inspector Sunil Mane. The ATS till last month were also looking for one Maruti Eeco car which was stolen by Waze from Aurangabad and brought to Mumbai. The ATS investigations suggested that the car was stolen with sole intention to plant explosives and kill some suspects of outlawed organisations in a fake encounter and take the credit however the plan failed for some reasons and Waze ended up planting gelatines himself. Sources said that the NIA is likely to file a chargesheet by the end of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hiran-murder-nia-takes-over-suv-theft-case-as-well-in-mumbai/articleshow/83269899.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Kolkata||Child rights panel to file HC petition against EC||Kolkata: The chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR) is set to file a public interest litigation at Calcutta High Court to pray for compensation from the Election Commission to children who have been orphaned in the second wave or families that have lost their children to the virus. In the petition, WBCPCR has held the Election Commission of India directly responsible for holding elections in an unprecedented eight phases that spanned more than a month and allowing large rallies with crowds throughout the state with no Covid guidelines. According to the state health department Covid data, from less than 4,000 active Covid-19 cases in Bengal a week before the first phase of polls on March 27, the active case count had zoomed to more than 1.1 lakh by the time elections concluded on April 29. New cases per day increased from under 400 to around 16,000. Data sourced from the health department revealed that nine children had died of Covid-19 between February and May this year and 21,665 had been infected during this period. WBPCPR chairperson Ananya Chakraborti says Bengal had brought Covid under control through multiple measures, which included restrained celebrations of festivals when the elections were thrust upon the state, endangering the lives of nearly 10 crore people, triggering the bed-and-oxygen crisis and forcing the shutdown of all activities in the state and cancellation of crucial examinations. “People argue that there were no polls in Delhi, Maharashtra or UP, and yet they suffered. But then, Delhi and Maharashtra had not behaved with as much restraint during festivals as Bengal had. And the situation in UP was created by allowing another super-spreader event like Kumbh Mela,” she countered. Chakraborti pointed out that the EC not only rejected the call for postponement of a super-spreader event like the elections, it fuelled the spread of the virus by moving central forces to different parts of the state that had till then remained untouched by the scourge of Covid-19. “The EC is entirely responsible and accountable for the children, firstly those who have lost their lives for being affected with Covid, secondly those who have survived the disease and are thus compelled to live the rest of their lives with post-Covid syndromes. Thirdly and most importantly, those who have lost both their parents and guardians. Fourthly those, who are being compelled to live like orphans since their parents and guardians are admitted in medical facilities,” Chakraborti said, adding that they needed to be provided an interim relief by the EC immediately and compensated properly later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/child-rights-panel-to-file-hc-petition-against-ec/articleshow/83267173.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A total of 718 new cases were reported taking the count of Covid patients in the state so far to 7,84,461. On June 4, 798 new cases were reported in the state and it was after 79 days that less than 800 cases were reported. It was on March 15, that 797 new cases or less than 800 new cases were reported, since then more than 800 new cases were reported everyday in the state. A 0.8% positivity rate — the number of people testing positive out every 100 samples tested — was reported in the state on Saturday. On June 5, as many as 81,812 samples were tested and of it, 718 were found positive. Thus on an average, 0.8 persons out of every 100 tested, were found positive. Number of active cases too further decreased on Saturday. On June 4, there were 12,889 active cases in the state which decreased to 11,344 on June 5. The number of people recovering also outnumbered the number of people testing positive as 2,225 people recovered from the disease on Saturday. With these people recovering, the number of people who have recovered so far from covid-19 and have been discharged from the hospitals reached 7,64,822. At the same time, 38 deaths were reported in a single day in Madhya Pradesh taking the death toll since the pandemic began to 8,295.

---||Delhi||‘Delhi free to frame any food scheme except under NFSA’||NEW DELHI: The Union food ministry on Saturday refuted the charges of Delhi government that the Centre had blocked its “ration at doorstep” plan, saying that the city government is free to frame any programme, but cannot tweak the scheme under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), which is implemented uniformly across states. “The Centre will provide additional ration at notified rates for any other scheme that the city government wants to launch. Where is the issue?” a source in the ministry said. While the Centre bears the entire cost of the foodgrain under NFSA and beneficiaries only need to pay Rs 1, 2 and 3 per kg for coarse grain, wheat and rice, the states and UTs can buy from Food Corporation of India (FCI) at fixed rates for any other scheme. Food ministry officials said Delhi government has so far lifted all its quota of NFSA (37,400 tonnes) of grains and distributed 90% of it. As far as PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna (PMGKAY) is concerned, it has lifted 63,200 tonnes and has started distribution. “It's absolutely wrong to say that the Centre is preventing any state from doing something. Why would the Centre deprive the citizens from any welfare scheme of any government? They can have another scheme, give it any name. Why insist on disrupting an existing pan-Indian scheme, which is under NFSA?” an official asked. Ministry officials said Delhi government has not taken action on the implementation of the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’, which could have served more than a million migrant workers in the capital without any cost to the city government. “Delhi government also suspended the use of e-PoS machines in April 2018 in its nearly 2,000 fair price shops. After persuasion, only now these have been installed, but have not been fully used for online PDS transactions. This undermines transparency and rightful targeting under NFSA and PMGKAY,” said an official. The officials claimed that while the national average of Aadhaar authentication of PDS transactions is almost 80%, it’s ‘nil’ in Delhi, which denies lakhs of migrants the benefits of portability and encourages diversion of foodgrains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-free-to-frame-any-food-scheme-except-under-nfsa-extra-ration-for-any-other-scheme-centre/articleshow/83269009.cms||---

Sensitizing and imparting training to the available staff for treatment of children, is the top priority of the government, said officials.Officials say that despite the fact that the second wave or second peak has been flattened now and as per the calculation models available that forecast one or one and a half months ahead, there is least possibility of any peak in next couple of months. Though there is no certainty that there will be another peak, but as a precaution it is considering that the next peak — if at all — could be between September and October, the officials said.“Available data regarding pandemics say that first peak is generally low, second is high and third is low like first. But we are considering that if there will be any third peak, it will be at least as high as second peak, so that our preparations are above what will be required in such a scenario,” said an official.Additional chief secretary health, Mohammed Suleman said, “Kids have so far thankfully not been infected. As such, we are taking into consideration that there are chances that they may get infected if there is any other peak. Firstly, we have normal ICUs in districts, and pediatric ICUs are only in 20 districts. Now we are working to ensure that every district has at least one pediatric ICU beds. And at the same time we are also working to ensure that every district has a pediatric ward, one of the available wards will be notified and upgraded into pediatric wards”.“We are working on all fronts, like the available ventilators in our state are for adults, kids can also use this, but the infants cannot use it, so we are also looking for such ventilators”, he said.“From our past experience we found that we had adequate normal beds and oxygen beds, but some more ICU and HDU beds were required, so these type of beds are being increased”, he said. “Then we had to arrange for oxygen during the difficult times, we are ramping up arrangements from now onward. We are also ensuring that all our staff are trained properly for the treatment of kids and younger population,” said Suleman said.“It is mainly the doctor and staff who treat the patients, training manuals are being developed, several rounds of training will be done,” he said.“Overall, we are working for pediatric treatment, increasing ICU/HDU beds, ensuring adequate oxygen availability, providing proper training to the staff and then also ensuring availability of the medicines that may be required,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/health-infra-gets-booster-dose-amid-talks-of-3rd-wave-of-virus/articleshow/83271337.cms||Amarjeet Singh

According to data, 27% of mucormycosis patients have been diagnosed when they were Covid positive. The hospitals are taking different measures to check its spread. While some are adding antifugals in treatment on prophylactic basis, others are monitoring sugar levels of patients as steroids used in Covid treatment spike sugar levels and increases risk of mucormycosis. More than 74 persons have already died due to mucormycosis in the state. In Bikaner, doctors used MB on 40 patients who were Covid positive and were suffering from moderate to severe symptoms. “Apart from following Covid treatment protocol, nebulisation with methylene blue was done by instilling few drops of MB in the flow meter, oxygen concentrator, moisturising jar through which oxygen pass and we have found that it can inhibit growth of almost all types of contamination, including mucormycosis present in oxygen,” said Dr Gunjan Soni, senior professor and head of the department of respiratory medicine, SP Medical College, Bikaner. A lot of debate is going on unhygienic humidifiers as one of the possible causes of mucormycosis. To prevent it, doctors of SP Medical College used MB in flow meters, mosturising jars so that the oxygen passes through it before reaching the patient. Dr Gunjan and his team of doctors performed conducted study on 40 RT-PCR confirmed moderate to severe Covid patients admitted to RDH Hospital of SP Medical College. “Patients were given 4ml of 0.1% MB in nebulized form12 hourly along with few drops of MB in flow meter, oxygen concentrator and moisturising jar. It was observed that 33 out of 40 (82.50%) cases studied showed recovery with improved SPO2 levels with a mean of 93.5, reduced respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature and over all well-being,” said Dr Soni. Dr Soni said the results of the study are quite encouraging and it will be published in journal before making them public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bikaner-docs-use-anti-malarial-drug-on-covid-patients-to-check-mucor/articleshow/83267893.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Hyderabad||Courage, hope, inspiration can help beat cancer||HYDERABAD: Cancer is one of the 10 leading causes of death in India. A staggering 14 lakh new cases are diagnosed and close to 10 lakh people succumb to cancer every year in India. Anyone living with a history of cancer, from the moment of diagnosis through the remainder of life, is a cancer survivor. It is estimated that there are well over 20 lakh cancer survivors at any given point of time in the country. Major advances in cancer prevention, early detection and treatment have resulted in longer survival, and therefore, a growing number of cancer survivors. However, the enormous challenges posed by Covid-19 has hugely disrupted cancer care, with a disproportionately large number of people presenting late, with consequently poor survival. The concept of recognising ‘Cancer Survivors Day’ began in the US in 1988, which is celebrated on the first Sunday of June. This year’s the 33rd annual, worldwide celebration of life on June 6 will unite cancer survivors, caregivers, family members, friends and healthcare professionals to demonstrate that life after a cancer diagnosis can be meaningful and productive. Knowledge, courage, hope and inspiration can help beat cancer. And that is the key message to convey to cancer survivors, nay, ‘cancer conquerors’. Cancer affects the body, mind and soul. And, therefore, just treating the physical being is not adequate. Cancer can leave a host of problems in its wake - physical, emotional and financial hardships, which often persist after diagnosis and treatment. Hence counselling is an extremely important component of cancer care, which ensures patients and their relatives are better informed, better prepared, and more importantly, feel more in control at every stage of their treatment and beyond. While it is heartening that “communication skills” has been introduced into the Indian Medical Curriculum three years ago, there needs to more focused efforts made to ensure that it forms an important component of training and assessment for doctors pursuing a career in cancer care. Through my first hand experience of taking care of my mother who ‘conquered’ breast cancer, and equally, practising the art and science of breast surgery both in the UK and India, I have seen several ordinary women become extraordinary through their tremendous courage, rock solid determination and unwavering perseverance in the fight against cancer. The importance of the multidisciplinary treating team to instil this much-needed inner strength cannot be overemphasised and is critical to the victory against cancer. There is an urgent need to develop more dedicated cancer support groups across India (run by those who have been through cancer), that can further reinforce the psychological/emotional assistance to those who are newly diagnosed and enable them to swiftly return to a normal life. ‘Out of difficulties grow miracles’. A disease is nothing but the body's signal to transform lifestyle, thought processes and approach to life. Cancer is one such disease that can be conquered if one does not get overwhelmed by fear and uncertainty. On this special day, I take this opportunity to salute the ‘cancer conquerors’ and wish them good health, always.

---||Kolkata||Chat therapy: Stars provide succour in trying times||Kolkata: Many celebs have started donning a new hat to help those struggling with loneliness during the pandemic. They are happy to be a part of online chat sessions that give a break to people from their otherwise gloomy lives. If actress-turned-TMC MP Satabdi Roy is interacting with people on Google Meet, cinematographer-turned-director Premendu Bikas Chaki, actor Manali Manisha Dey, director Subrata Sen and script writer Padmanabha Dasgupta are lending an ear to the aged who have no one to talk to. Psychiatrists agree that celebs allowing strangers access to personal interaction can kick in a good feeling. While some cynics complain that this is a new platform of philanthropy meeting publicity, psychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra insists that these chat sessions give a “supportive shoulder” for “loners”. “They help deal with anxiety and foster a sense of brotherhood. However, any form of therapy done by untrained professionals have the potential to do more harm than help,” he said. Satabdi RoyRoy does not entertain any political conversations in her ‘Sudhui Golpo Alpo Alpo’ sessions. She has already entertained some 120 callers and can’t figure out how long it will take to entertain all the requests. The other day two viewers called in from Bangladesh and Nigeria. “Had it not been for this prolonged period of being at home, I would never have thought about this idea. Some ardent fans sit with their entire families to share their stories. I was pleasantly surprised that Class XII students, who might not have watched my movies, logging in. They shared their anxiety about studies, exams and future,” she said. Roy understands that her hour-long virtual presence is helping many to deal with their blues. “Not everyone wants to approach counsellors or are even aware of the need to do so. Besides money and stigma are a factor. I am not trained in counselling but it feels good when many say that memories of these chats will make them happy long after the meet is over,” she added. Premendu Bikas ChakiChaki has personal reasons for spearheading the ‘Kaan Pete Roi’ initiative for lonely elders. His daughter, who was studying at the Prague University of Economics and Business, will soon be shifting to Brussels to take up an internship at the European Parliament. “My wife and I have to wait till two in the morning to communicate with her. I don’t know how long we will be able to sit up till that late and communicate. That’s why I understand the need of elderly people separated from the kin,” he said. Even before the pandemic, Chaki has made it a habit to call up veterans from the industry. “It is our responsibility to call at least one elderly person a day and make them feel that they have someone to hear them out,” he said. Creative designer Ekta Bhattacharjee, who is part of Chaki’s ‘Kaan Pete Roi’ initiative along with Padmanabha Dasgupta, director Subrata Sen, actor Manali Manisha Dey, director Utsav Mukherjee and script writer Aditi Chatterjee, enjoys listening to stories of elderly people. She understands that many of them love to walk down memory lane but are often dismissed as nostalgia-struck seniors. “One elderly lady said she missed speaking to her granddaughter since their inter-personal relationship wasn’t good because of her daughter-in-law. The pandemic only aggravated her loneliness. Chatting with me helped her fill up that void,” Bhattacharjee said. On Tuesday, actress Ritabhari Chakraborty announced a helpline called ‘Heal With Me’ where mental health professionals will offer free counselling for those who have lost their near and dear ones to Covid. “My friend, Rahul Dasgupta, and I have tied up with a clinic. Two psychologists are offering free counselling from 11 am to 8 pm,” she said. As of now, the actress will herself not be present online during the counselling. However, she is considering suggestions on how to personally value-add to the initiative with her virtual presence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chat-therapy-stars-provide-succour-in-trying-times/articleshow/83267177.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

In a comparison conducted by the health department, it has come out that there have been 2,262 deaths in the second wave (till Friday). During the first wave, 982 people had succumbed to the virus. The state has so far recorded a total number of 3,244 Covid deaths. In all, 69.7% deaths occurred in the second wave, while poseightitivity rate rose to more than double. Compared to 58,403 cases in the first wave, the state reported 1,35,521 cases till Friday in the second wave. If the first wave is considered to be from the detection of first case in March last year till February 23 this year, when the number of active cases was at its lowest, the average number of cases reported in the first wave per day was 171, while the same in the second wave is 1,342 per day — an eight-time rise. According to health department officials, the mean age of deaths in the second wave was 61. In the first wave, it was 64.2 years. The case fatality rate registered in the first wave was 1.68% as compared to 1.67% in the second wave. The majority of the people who lost their lives in the second wave had comorbidities (around 70%) whereas in the second wave only 41.6% of such cases were seen. The age distribution of deaths reveals that the percentage of deaths occurring in the 30-44 age group out of total deaths, almost doubled in the second wave, with 290 patients losing their precious lives in this age group in second wave. A government spokesperson said 8.95% patients died at home in the second wave, higher when compared to 5.09 % in the first wave. Also, 4.1 % of cases were brought dead in the second wave. The official said there was not much difference in the percentage of hospital deaths that occurred in the first wave and the second wave, which indicated that even though the number of cases increased in the second wave, the state government was well prepared with its resources like beds, oxygen, remedesivir, steroids and other drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/of-3-2k-covid-deaths-in-hp-2262-died-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/83272715.cms||---

That the current pandemic-induced crisis of enormous proportions has received prime attention in the budget is a welcome relief in these times of generalized anxiety and fear. The Kerala government deserves the kudos from all for its commitment to free and universal vaccination despite its fragile financial position as well as the shameful policy of selective vaccination of the national government. Equally welcome are the decisions to strengthen the healthcare system at all levels and initiate vaccine research as well as production although the financial resources earmarked cannot but be more than a small initial allocation. One hopes that these initiatives will lead to long-range policies to develop a health-linked industry---pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical---as well as research and development given the effective demand for healthcare among all segments of the population. To me, the budget looks like a supplementary one without many details being put out in the public domain. The Rs 20,000 crore Covid-package seems to be a continuation with some re-packaging of the earlier schemes with a net addition of Rs 2,800 crore. In fact, the difference in revenue expenditure between the previous January 2021 budget and this budget is a mere Rs 2,605 crore. The expected net addition to public debt seems unaltered at around Rs 30,670 crore but the capital expenditure shows a negative Rs 12,546 crores that suggests a net diversion of capital receipts to revenue expenditure. As I have often pointed out, such a predicament is the result of the government’s inability to collect the taxes and non-tax revenues that are due. One would expect a dip in own revenue collection during these pandemic times. But what one cannot understand is the fact that when the growth rate in state income fell by 3.82% in 2010-21, state revenues recorded a decline of 18.77%, i.e.; for every one percentage fall in state income, the state revenue fell by close to 5%. Are we to understand that the rate of tax evasion rose in the name of the pandemic? The new finance minister is honest enough to admit, even if indirectly, that the tax collection efficiency leaves much to be desired. He has promised that once the pandemic is over, “vigorous efforts will be initiated to increase tax and non-tax revenues”. Not many previous finance ministers in recent times have been bold enough to admit that “if everyone starts remitting their due tax, our fiscal stress could be easily overcome”. One hopes that he will follow through with his promise although I feel concerned when he says that his government does not believe in “tax collection by intimidating and coercing traders and industrialists”. Commodity taxation is being paid by consumers; the traders and industrialists are legally expected to hand them over to the government. It is part of the rule of law. Breaking law should invite punishment; then there is no need for prior coercion. It is too early to judge a finance minister within days of his assuming office. He needs time and he needs the solid backing of the entire cabinet in his task to set the public finance of the state on a sound footing. He also needs the support of the people at large. People expect so much from a government but you can get only that much as you pay to it by law.

Kori was held on charges of kidnapping a minor girl. Earlier, the tainted trio of Kudwar station house officer Arvind Pandey, sub-inspector Sanjay Yadav and head constable Brijesh Singh along with a homeguard were suspended. Asha Devi, mother of deceased stated in her police complaint that the three policemen had assaulted and strangled him. “I begged them to send him to jail if he was guilty and stop the assault. They did not heed my pleas and sent me and my younger son away. Around 3pm the next day, I was informed that Rajesh’s condition had deteriorated and we were told to reach the district hospital. When my younger son reached the hospital, he found Rajesh dead. The cops had killed my son,” she alleged. The complainant also alleged that before Kori’s arrest, the cops had also misbehaved with the women at their house and hurled casteist slur. Kori was accused of abducting a girl, who was found on June 3. While the girl was sent home, Kori was kept at the police station. SP, Sultanpur, Vipin Mishra said, Kori’s autopsy revealed ligature marks on the neck, while no other injuries were found on the body. “We are probing the case,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sultanpur-custodial-death-3-cops-booked-for-murder/articleshow/83269016.cms||---

Parents say that the government must assure that their kids get the shield against the virus in the form of vaccine before sending them to school. As the row surged, the state school education department has sought feedback from parents on whether schools should be opened as of now or not. Parents maintained that in absence of vaccination for kids, sending them out of home is dangerous. CBSE and MP Board have cancelled exams for Class 10 and 12 citing pandemic. “Both my children have not stepped out of the home for over 3 months now. How can we even imagine sending them to schools,” said Akash Rajput, a parent. “Over the year, children have adapted to online classes. I fail to understand the logic behind sending them back to offline campus classes when the pandemic third wave possibilities lurk,” said Abhishek Jain, a parent. Parents felt that absence of vaccination for children is a big concern. “In such situation, how can they even think of sending kids to schools when there is no vaccination for them,” said Ashok Maurya, a parent. School education department has urged parents to send their feedbacks on opening of schools till June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ensure-kids-get-jabs-before-schools-reopen-urge-parents/articleshow/83271359.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Kolkata||Ball set rolling for vaccination of Tolly technicians, artists||Kolkata: On Saturday, the Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern (FCTWEI) announced a free vaccination drive for all technicians and artists of Tollywood. On the same day, Welfare Association of Television Producers (WATP) also announced that two private television channels are also organizing a free vaccination drive for artists and technicians. The Artists’ Forum, too, sent out a message to its members asking them to send their name, Aadhaar card details, forum registration number and the names of projects they are working in on Monday. According to FCTWEI president Swarup Biswas, their drive will begin at the Chalachchitra Satabarsha Bhaban on Tuesday. “We are planning to vaccinate at least 200 people a day. This drive will continue till everyone who appeals to FCTWEI has been vaccinated. This is important for saving lives and livelihood. The Federation has always worked for the welfare of artistes and technicians. I hope good sense prevails among those who have been criticizing us,” Biswas said. However, this drive will not stop FCTWEI’s protest against shooting at hotels, banquets, godowns and rented houses that is being passed off as “shoot-at-home”. “On Friday, a team was shooting in the banquet at a hotel on Kalyani Express Highway. We will continue our protest against such shooting,” he said. Meanwhile, director Saibal Banerjee, the president of WATP, told TOI: “Zee Bangla and Star Jalsha, along with producers, have taken this drive to vaccinate artists and technicians. We have already started collecting names of people.” Samrat Ghosh, Cluster Head – East ZEEL, said, "Not only technicians and artists, we also want to offer free vaccination to others working in the production houses and channels." Actor-turned-BJP member Rupa Bhattacharjee said, “Unlike other professions, artists are the only ones who work without wearing a mask. So, they should have made it to the list of frontline workers. I whole-heartedly support Biswas’ efforts. Producers and channels have come forward too. I wish all this had begun earlier.” Actor Debdut Ghosh, who is the former assistant secretary of Artists’ Forum, has unconditionally congratulated Biswas for this drive. “I am glad that everyone is pitching in. In this election, I have contested against Swarup’s brother, Aroop Biswas, in Tollygugje. Yet I support when Swarup and FCTWEI have taken a pro-industry initiative. Vaccination is the responsibility of the government. There has been a lot of confusion and controversy regarding our vaccine policy. In this case, I will say better late than never. Through Swarup, the state government has discharged its duty,” Ghosh said. Actor Shantilal Mukherjee, the former joint secretary of the Artists’ Forum, has also congratulated FCTWEI for taking this initiative. “The reservations we had expressed against Swarup Biswas remains. Despite that, we still congratulate the federation for initiating their drive. Some days back, Artists' Forum had written to the health department as well as the department of Information & Cultural Affairs. Subsequently, we called them up and were told that we will be informed about the date, time and venue of the vaccination drive.” Meanwhile, the Sourav Ganguly Foundation has offered to vaccinate 50 needy artists. “Artists’ Forum has been asked to provide a list of those names. It is great that everyone is to do their bit for each other,” Mukherjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ball-set-rolling-for-vaccination-of-tolly-technicians-artists/articleshow/83267182.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Delhi||On the platter: Delhi Police to set up 11 satellite kitchens for its staff||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has undertaken an ambitious project to set up an integrated food preparation and delivery network to provide nutritious food to its over 95,000 personnel daily at its police stations and office complexes of various units of the force spread across the city. Police commissioner SN Shrivastava is learnt to have given his nod to the plan, which involves setting up of 11 “satellite kitchens” at different locations based on the mapping of consumers in a specific zone. These kitchens will also be used in providing food to those cops and paramilitary personnel who are engaged in law and order duties round the year. At present, fooding for cops runs in an ad hoc manner at majority of places and “poori sabji” packets are sourced randomly for law and order duties. This network will not only be cost-effective but also a great relief for the cops who spend a lot of time away from home. “There are nearly 180 operational messes in different police stations of 15 districts and 11 units. Around 4,000 regular mess members are enrolled apart from a large number of personnel availing diets on cash payment basis. Cops are also engaged in law and order duties apart from putting in extra hours on road during festivals and other important occasions, as and when the duty demands,” a senior officer said. During the cops’ presence in odd hours, they are currently provided refreshments and food packets through temporary arrangements. According to Delhi Police, no mess facility is available in 13 units, including Crime Branch, Special Cell, PCR, Licensing, DE Cell, Vigilance, Anti Corruption, Railways, Metro and Special Branch, due to shortage of space and non-viable individual operations. These issues will be duly covered in the proposed plan. The tentative locations where the kitchens will be set up are Haiderpur, Malviya Nagar, PTC Jharoda, Bapu Dham, Dwarka, Shahdara, Wazirabad P&L, Begampur, Sarita Vihar and Vikaspuri. “The infrastructure for food preparation, electricity, water, physical space and other related facilities shall be provided by the department,” said an official adding that food will be supplied to the consumer locations in refrigerated conditions through environment-friendly, fully equipped vehicles. The plan also includes setting up of kiosks in police stations and units, which will function like mini-canteens after receiving the food packets and will be operational round the clock. Delhi Police is likely to provide equipment and apparatus, which are presently available at its different establishments, for free for this project. “The prices of food items have not been fixed yet, but it has been proposed that they will be reasonable and shall not be more than Rs 50 per person per meal, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-the-platter-delhi-police-to-set-up-11-satellite-kitchens-for-its-staff/articleshow/83269031.cms||Raj Shekhar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Crematorium’s barricades stay after ‘higher ups’ call||MUMBAI: Defying orders of additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal, the assistant municipal commissioner (C ward), executive engineer, Building Proposal and Health Infrastructure Committee have refused to remove barricades that block safe access from the rear to Chandanwadi crematorium at Marine Lines. Sources said on Friday C ward had arranged for police bandobast to remove the barricades put up by the developer for the adjoining BIT chawl plot when a call was received by the AMC directing that status quo be maintained. “The call was from higher-ups,” said sources, and hence the barricades were not pulled down. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal did not respond to TOI’s text messages and calls. The crematorium, declared structurally dangerous, has been taken up for redevelopment but continues to be operational, as it is the only Hindu crematorium for A, B and C wards. In February, a slab at its entrance had collapsed, forcing people to go to Walkeshwar to cremate their dead. The contractor warned BMC that while the entrance has been propped up with bamboos, it may collapse during heavy rain and he will not be responsible. Health Infrastructure Committee, while awarding the redevelopment contract, had assured access from the rear, removing barricades erected around BIT chawl. BMC is the owner of the BIT chawl plot. After TOI last week carried a photo feature on the crematorium and danger it poses to people’s lives Jaiswal had ordered removal of barricades but junior officials defied his orders. The controversy snowballed, forcing Mumbai city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh to step in. He has called a meeting on Monday to resolve the issue. “I will ensure the barricades are removed and safe access from the rear is provided to people,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chandanwadi-crematoriums-barricades-stay-after-higher-ups-call/articleshow/83267925.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Delhi||Delhi: Wind, rain damage Jama Masjid minaret||NEW DELHI: It was not just trees, which were damaged in the sudden gust of high wind and rain on Friday afternoon. A large sandstone block from the right minaret of Jama Masjid, which is open for the public, also fell down in the courtyard. With a lockdown in place and the mosque shut, no one was around and there were no injuries. The imam of the mosque has now decided to write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the repair and conservation of the 17th-century Mughal structure. Red sandstone and marble were used in the mosque, which was built in 1656 by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. The strong wind on Friday led to a section of the red sandstone falling down from the minaret. The impact was such that a few-inch hole was created in the courtyard. Imam Bukhari told TOI that it happened during the prayer time in the afternoon. “The mosque is shut due to the lockdown but I and my staff were present. The prayers were going on inside the mosque’s sanctorum and this happened outside,” he said. Bukhari further said that the red sandstone piece, which fell down, was about two metres long and three inches wide. “In the past too, a few stones had fallen down and repairs were done by the Archaeological Survey of India. Only recently, the ASI had finished the conservation and repair work of the three domes of the mosque. I have informed the ASI about the latest damage.” He stated that he would write a letter to the PM as “it is a matter of great worry. If there were people in the mosque at the time of the accident, it would have been a disaster.” Ruing the condition of the mosque, historian Swapna Liddle said that “it is an old building and is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture. Every inch of it needs to be properly assessed for defects. The restoration work so far has involved bandaged methods, where they just repair what gets damaged. That is why our buildings deteriorate so much.” Liddle added that in Shah Jahan’s time, there was a system of repairs. “These days, they put wrong material in the repairs, they put cement instead of limestone mortar. These kinds of measures, done without expert knowledge, lead to more damage to the structure and could be a danger to the public.” Historian Rana Safvi said that it was important to conserve the structure as it was of national importance. The mosque has always been a symbol of faith for the Muslims of the country and is a focal point for the community living in Delhi, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wind-rain-damage-jama-masjid-minaret/articleshow/83269063.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Dining would be allowed in restaurants, bars and food courts with 50% capacity from 7am to 4pm from Monday to Friday. They would be able to entertain only parcel orders on Saturday and Sundays. Liquor shops would also remain open from 7am to 4pm from Monday to Friday in both the municipal corporation areas. Malls and theatres would continue to remain closed, though. The norms effective in the Pine Municipal Corporation areas would be applicable in Pune Cantonment Board and Khadki Cantonment Board limits. The Pune collectorate issued an order late in the night, stating that Dehu Road Cantonment Board should follow the orders effective in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits. The rural areas of the district, with higher positivity rate of Covid-19 cases than the two civic limits in Pune, were placed under Level 4. Thus, there would not be much relief from the Covid-induced restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-city-now-essential-shops-can-function-7am-4pm-dining-at-eateries-at-50-capacity/articleshow/83269052.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Nagpur||‘Meeting unlock norms means disease severity down & herd immunity close’||Nagpur: Welcoming the five levels fixed by the state government to determine the level of relaxations and restrictions for each district, doctors in the city said though only time will tell how effective the measures were, meeting these criteria indicates the severity of disease has reduced and the spread has been successfully contained. Some of them also warned that there could be a spurt in cases in areas still untouched by the virus. On the other hand, some of them said the falling positivity rate and fewer admissions indicate we are close to herd immunity. Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed, a medical microbiologist, said less than 25% O2 bed occupancy means severity of disease is less. “Similarly, the test positivity rate going down shows were are doing sufficient number of tests and have managed to keep the spread under check,” he said. Terming unlockdown as necessary, Dr Ahmed said we can’t wait forever for the disease to be eradicated. “Health of people is important but economic activities are also necessary. Many may die not because of the disease but due to poverty if the lockdown is not lifted,” he said, adding that the Covid appropriate behaviour must be followed. Chest physician Dr Vinit Niranjane said though the concept is scientific, the unlocking is too premature and too early. “Our positivity is below 5% which qualifies the district to restart everything. I feel weekly markets and social gatherings must not be allowed as of now. Another wave is not expected so soon but the cases will start rising again. We saw how those testing positive had history of attending marriages or other functions,” he said. Critical care specialist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said there is no certainty if these parameters are perfect or not. “If the infection has to spread, it will. Also, there is no guarantee people will necessarily follow norms. Only time will tell if these measures are going to be effective,” he said. “As per our experience, we are close to herd immunity. In between, such spurts will keep coming. Areas which have not reported large number of infections will remain vulnerable. Yet, unless a major mutation takes place, there are less chances of resurgence. Hence, whether unlock or lockdown, we must keep following physical distancing, wear mask and use sanitizer,” he said. Urologist Dr Sadashiv Bhole said, “We can’t remain in lockdown forever. I think it is a good idea to differentiate districts as per certain paraments. Cases are really low while the economy is suffering badly. Now, it is the responsibility of society to keep the postivity rate down and help each other return to normal life. We need to take more precautions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/meeting-unlock-norms-means-disease-severity-down-herd-immunity-close/articleshow/83267917.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh second state to administer 2 crore jabs||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh became the second state in the country to administer over two crore doses of coronavirus vaccine to its people with Maharashtra leading the table with 2.4 crore doses. More than 22 crore Indians have been vaccinated till date and UP accounts for 8.9% of total jabs administered nationwide. Gujarat is a close third with 1.8 crore doses. Acknowledging the milestone, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, said, the credit for this achievement goes to the health teams working round-the-clock. On an average, vaccinations take place at 6,000 sites in the state every day. Following the enthusiastic response to Mission June, the state government has decided to raise next week’s vaccine target and number of booths.Among districts, Lucknow (10.24 lakh), Gautam Budh Nagar (7.32 lakh), Ghaziabad (6.55 lakh), Kanpur (6.52 lakh) and Meerut (6.48 lakh) top the list while Chitrakoot (67,555), Lalitpur (91,099), Sravasti (94,108), Kasganj (95,546) and Kannauj (98,686) are the bottom five. Officials engaged in the vaccination process revealed that only a miniscule number of those immunised reported adverse effects. “Of total doses given in state, 0.007% recipients complained of side effects. This translates to 1,400 episodes of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), but not one was serious or fatal,” said an officer engaged in the vaccination drive. Insiders revealed the state was eyeing the No. 1 one position in the country with its Mission June vaccination campaign. Now, the chief minister has directed officials to intensify the drive and raise the capacity by three times. To encourage people to take the vaccine, the state government has undertaken measures, including setting up women special booths, guardian booths, drive-in vaccination facilities. ACS Prasad informed that bookings for the women special booths will open from Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-second-state-to-administer-2cr-jabs/articleshow/83269087.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Covid -ve test must for MBBS exam; no HC relief||Rejecting interim relief, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Saturday refused to stay the MBBS examination to be conducted by Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) from June 10. Justice Avinash Gharote has directed that the 40,000 examinees must test negative on RT-PCR or rapid antigen test before appearing for the exams. The petition was filed by NGO Herd Foundation and a physiotherapy student. “The MUHS therefore is directed to issue an advisory to the principals of the various colleges and also to publish it on website, indicating that it would be desirable that each examinee should get tested for Covid-19 and produce the negative report to examiner along with his/her hall ticket on June 10,” the judge said. Those undergoing rapid antigen test are advised to get an RT-PCR test done before June 15. “If the RT-PCR report is found positive, such an examinee would not be in a position to undertake the examination. This is all, however, subject to the directives and instructions in the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the state government, as prevailing on June 7 or thereafter,” the HC added. Justice Gharote kept the issue of maintainability of the petition open. The Nashik university had questioned the locus standi of petitioners, saying no MBBS pupil had approached HC to stay the exams. The judge said the Covid-19 situation appeared to be normalizing, considering the decreasing number of patients across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-ve-test-must-for-mbbs-exam-no-hc-relief/articleshow/83269133.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Hyderabad||Patients’ kin caught selling Remdesivir, say Hyderabad cops||HYDERABAD: In a startling find, police discovered that some of the people involved in black marketing of anti-viral drug Remdesivir are those who earlier procured the injection for their near and dear ones for Covid-19 treatment. As of now, hospitals continue to use Remdesivir in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. With their kin either recovering from the infection or falling prey to it, they no longer need the vital vials and are now resorting to illegal sale to make a quick buck. However, some of them landed in the police net. Additional deputy commissioner of police (Task Force) G Chakravarthy said in some cases which they had busted in connection with illegal sale of Remdesivir, they nabbed persons related to Covid-19 patients. “When their kin, afflicted with Covid-19, were in need of Remdesivir, they had bought the injections, which were not easy to get due to its heavy demand. However, when their kin recovered before the full course of medication or died while undergoing treatment, the patient’s relatives are selling the leftover injections at higher price in the black market,’’ Hyderabad police said. Though the cost of each Remdesivir injection is Rs 3,490 per unit, some tried to sell the unused drug for Rs 15,000 a vial. In at least five cases, relatives of Covid-19 patients were nabbed and the drug vials were seized. In some cases, police found the prospective sellers tried to pass it on to patients in need at the same price they had procured earlier. Police, however, warned them and let them off as trading in the drug is illegal. Remdesivir is sold by pharmacists only after collecting a patient’s Aadhaar details, Covid-19 positive report, prescription and other documents from the hospital. “As per the rule, the pharmacists should report back to the drug distributors to whom they had supplied Remdesivir,’’ Task Force inspector S Raghavendra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/relatives-of-covid-hit-caught-selling-remdesivir-police/articleshow/83268046.cms||Srinath Vudali

Nadaf, along with assistant professors Venkatesh Prabhugaonkar, Vivek Kapale and Amol Kamat visited Galgibaga beach for a spot assessment. Tauktae has flattened the leftover sand bar of Cyclone Vayu by 60m in width for a 100m-stretch, Nadaf said. Due to the recent deposit of sand near the mouth of the Galgibaga, the river has become shallow and at many places sand is visible even during high tide. The chopping off of the sand bar has opened a new channel for the river to meet the Arabian Sea. The earlier route of the river is cut off and water enters the the old channel only during high tide. The team further observed that during high tide, the water in the river increases by about 1.2m and the velocity of the water during backward movement is very high. Therefore, the high tide clubbed with the water coming from the upper reaches during the monsoon will pose a serious threat to those living on the banks of the Galgibaga and Mashem. The rate of erosion during the rains will further increase leading to more damage. The sand deposits have also posed a big challenge to fishermen. A possible solution to this raising of river bed at the mouth might be to scientifically remove the sand and redistribute it on the seashore itself, said Nadaf. Fishermen said that they used to catch fish in the river but due to the recent changes they are unable to any more. The simplest and most effective way to protect the beach, say experts, would be natural dunes and natural coastal vegetation. Suitable trees need to be planted and the growth of coastal vegetation, popularly called sand binders (Ipomea), must be taken up on a large scale. Man-made structures such as seawalls, sandbags, and sand fences have huge disadvantages. Seawalls and sandbags actually escalate beach erosion and destroy the beach. Instead of adding structures, ‘beach nourishment’ can be tried instead. Wherever possible mangroves must be planted, Nadaf said. He also suggested that strategic planting of trees and other coastal vegetation is the need of the hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tauktae-alters-high-tide-line-at-galgibaga/articleshow/83267924.cms||Albert Fernandes

He had earlier said that there are huge gaps in compliance of environment rules and there were clear governance deficits on the subject and higher authorities are not adequately concerned about the plight of the citizens. World Environment Day is celebrated on June 5 and the theme for this year's event is “promotion of biofuels for better environment”. The NGT was established on October 18, 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act 2010 for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources, including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment and giving relief and compensation for damages to persons and property, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

A delegation of the committee, led by chairman Sandeep Shirodkar, met the deputy town planner Prakash Bandodkar at Mapusa and pointed out that illegal land filling is going on in part of a large khazan area belonging to the comunidade of Boa Esperanca, Aldona. “Trucks are seen dumping mud and debris in the field in a clandestine manner without any valid permissions from the authorities concerned or the tenants,” Shirodkar said. The association’s vice-chairman, Janardhan Pednekar, has demanded the field be restored to its original condition as the farmers have been cultivating it since many years. “If the restoration is not carried out, nearby fields will be inundated and damaged during the monsoon,” he said . Bandodkar has assured them that action will be taken once he verifies the complaint. “I will definitely take action within 10 days,” he said. The association has also submitted a memorandum to the deputy collector for Bardez, mamlatdar of the taluka and administrator of comunidade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/halt-illegal-filling-of-paddy-field/articleshow/83267927.cms||---
---||India||PTSD from second wave a major cause of concern||BENGALURU: After the traumatic second wave of Covid 19, the biggest concern now is about how people cope with grief and fear. During the panel discussion on ‘Surmounting the Second Wave — Pandemic Lessons on Dealing with Grief, Loss and Fear’, organised by the Bangalore International Centre, experts said many people may suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and there’s a need for innovative methods that spark hope and policy shifts. Rohini Nilekani, writer and philanthropist, said grief, loss, and fear had rarely been encountered together by so many people all at once in the country. “The Nimhans helpline received around 4.5 lakh calls, mostly from people with no history of clinical mental illness. The psychosocial crisis was observed because of the fear of death, fear of not finding beds and oxygen shortages,” she said. Another study cited by Nimhans showed that PTSD had gone up by 7-9% among those living in areas with more Covid cases. She added that a shortage of mental health professionals was an issue, with just 9,000 certified psychiatrists for over 1.3 billion people. Prabha Chandra, professor of psychiatry, Nimhans, said there was a shift in concerns haunting people. While in the first wave, it was the stigma around the infection and economic losses, in the second, it was all about loss, grief, and death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ptsd-from-second-wave-a-major-cause-of-concern/articleshow/83272718.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Nagpur||As city heads to unlock, NMC & cops on toes to enforce norms||Nagpur: The city police and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) are gearing up for strict enforcement of Covid norms as the lockdown-like restrictions are proposed to be lifted from Monday. NMC’s Nuisance Detection Squad comprising 176 retired defence personnel, 800-odd traffic cops and personnel from the police commissionerate will be on toes to ensure no crowding in public places and strict implementation of Covid-19 protocol. DCP (traffic) Sarang Awad said, “Since April 2020, traffic police have been penalizing motorists without masks and people not following distancing norms, but our primary responsibility is enforcement and traffic management.” He said special squads will be formed to patrol busy intersections, commercial areas and other public places to contain the spread of coronavirus. “NDS team will focus on the city’s commercial areas, especially under Gandhibagh, Mahal, Satranjipura, Mangalwari, Dharampeth and Laxmi Nagar zones,” said deputy municipal commissioner Dr Pradip Dasarwar. Failure to maintain distancing, crowding in shops will entail heavy penalties on the shopkeepers, Dr Dasarwar said. According to statistics procured from NMC, since the Covid outbreak, the NDS team has penalized 48,027 Covid-19 protocol violators and recovered Rs3.96 crore fine from them. Highest fine of Rs1.66 crore was paid by citizens without masks. Shopkeepers and marriage halls caught disobeying Covid-19 protocol paid Rs1.39 crore fine, according to the statistics. Traffic police fined around 29,430 citizens, especially motorists, and recovered Rs1,27,18,300 fine for flouting guidelines. Of these, 6,618 were caught without masks, while 22,812 were fined for not following distancing norms. Besides, traffic police of 10 zones detained 6,395 vehicles for violating rules. Dr Dasarwar appealed to the people of Nagpur to cooperate with both city police and NMC to implement rules. “This is for everyone’s safety. There is confidence among the people, but it should not lead to complacency and neglect. We have all brought coronavirus under control to a large extent and with great difficulty. It cannot be allowed to worsen again,” he said. NMC’s nuisance detection squad and traffic police have penalized 77,457 citizens for violating Covid-19 guidelines and recovered Rs5.23 crore fine so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-city-heads-to-unlock-nmc-cops-on-toes-to-enforce-norms/articleshow/83267948.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Noida||Doctors in Noida insist on hybrid ICUs for both adults and kids||Noida: Doctors have questioned the Noida administration’s decision to ramp up paediatric facilities for the next wave of Covid, saying most children are unlikely to get infected and spending on hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) specifically for kids would be a waste of resources. Experts dealing with Covid for the past one year suggested that the administration should adopt a hybrid model so that wards and ICUs for adults can be quickly upgraded for children’s needs if required. They also pointed out that ICUs only for children would require additional doctors and nurses, at a time there was a severe crunch of skilled manpower. Doctors also expressed doubt on the assumption that more children were likely to get infected in the third wave. They said the assumption was based on the premise that kids could be at maximum risk because by the time the third wave comes, most people aged over 18 would be vaccinated. Another belief is that since the first wave affected senior citizens most and many in the 30-50 age group were infected over the past two months, the third wave may be critical for children. The doctors termed these explanations “unscientific”. “So far, we have seen very few children getting critical from Covid. Children are generally a healthy population. In adults, there are standard doses and easier procedures compared to children. Specialists are required for handling intensive care for kids,” said Dr Ashutosh Sinha, additional director of paediatrics at Fortis Hospital. Other doctors, however, said there were enough resources to handle the few serious cases in children. “The treatment and medicines are the same for children over 10 years of age and those for adults. Most of the equipment and bed sizes are also the same. Only consumables like masks and drugs are different, which can be easily arranged in adult ICUs,” said Dr DK Gupta, paediatrician and chairperson of Felix hospital. The doctors also said creating extra ICU wards would need additional resources, at a time hospitals were already stretched. “More facilities with PICU wards will need many more skilled nurses and paramedical staff. There is a shortage anyway. The focus should rather be on training the existing staff on handling both situations,” said Dr Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/doctors-in-noida-insist-on-hybrid-icus-for-both-adults-and-kids/articleshow/83261878.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Thane||500 Ulhasnagar buildings of 1990s need audit: Panel||ULHASNAGAR: Residents of more than 500 buildings from Ulhasnagar have been advised to get a structural audit done after two recent building collapses. A committee appointed by the Ulhasnagar municipal commissioner has drawn up a list of 505 buildings constructed between 1994 and 1998 — a time which saw constructions mushroom in Ulhasnagar. Most of these buildings had been constructed using an inferior quality of sand, the panel’s report has stated. This sand is locally known as ‘ulve’ sand. The committee has put out a list of such buildings in each of the municipal wards — the maximum number (160) such buildings in ward 4 while there are 133 in ward 2, 118 in ward 3 and 94 in ward 1. The municipality on Saturday appealed to citizens of these building to get a structural audit done urgently. Last month, 12 people died after two buildings in Ulhasnagar — Mohini Palace and Sai Shakti — collapse within 15 days of each other. Civic officials said that both these buildings had been constructed between 1994 and 1995 and were not a part of buildings listed as ‘dangerous’. Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation’s public relation officer, Dr Yuvraj Bhadane, said that many buildings in the city which have collapsed in the past had come up between 1994 and 1995. “They had been constructed using inferior ulve sand.” He said the civic committee has collected details of all such buildings. “If residents fail to get the structural audit of their buildings done on a priority basis, we will have to forcibly evacuate people to pre-empt loss of life.” The civic body has earmarked schools, colleges and community halls to house people, if the need arises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/500-ulhasnagar-buildings-of-90s-need-audit-in-mumbai-panel/articleshow/83271473.cms||Pradeep Gupta

The CCF has also called for a special gram sabha to discuss the issue and said the objective of the village panchayat should be “sustainable development and not destructive development planned in a haphazard way”.

Speaking at the launch of a new tractor for farmers at Calangute recently, Lobo said farming and fishing were the main sources of income for people in Calangute until the mid-1970s when tourism began to boom, which led people to abandon these traditional activities for lucrative businesses. “I’m happy that in the last three-four years, many people have restarted farming activities and I’m confident that the remaining farmland which is uncultivated by their owners will also see a revival soon,” he said.

---||Goa||Goa government extends curfew by 7 days, essentials can stay open till 3pm||PANAJI: The state government has extended the state-wide curfew for another seven days till June 14, but has announced a few relaxations as part of a calibrated easing strategy. Announcing the extension, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that essential stores will be allowed to remain open till 3pm, while stores dealing with home repairs and monsoon essentials will also be allowed to reopen. “Our government has decided to extend the state level curfew till 7am on June 14,” he tweeted. “Timings for essential shops as defined will be increased to 7am to 3pm. In addition, shops, stores related to house and building repairs, monsoon preparedness, or rain protection and stationery items will be allowed to open.” Sawant’s announcement caught many by surprise, since the chief minister himself had announced that a review meeting would be held on Sunday to take stock of Goa’s Covid trajectory and decide whether or not to continue with the curfew. Formal orders regarding the extension of the state level curfew will be issued by collectors of the South Goa and North Goa districts. On Saturday, Goa reported 567 fresh Covid-19 cases and 17 mortalities. The state’s positivity rate and active case load continues to drop, with 8,216 active cases as on Saturday. Recoveries, too, have outpaced the addition of new infections. After a lot of reluctance, the curfew was imposed in Goa on May 9 after Covid cases surged and the healthcare sector was swamped with patients. During the curfew, stores selling essential items, grocery shops, liquor stores were allowed to stay open from 7am to 1pm, while medical stores and restaurant kitchens are allowed to function till 7 pm. While the opposition has been in favour of the curfew continuing, environment minister Nilesh Cabral is of the opinion that the state needs to open up as economic activity needs to resume. The government has already asked its departments to start functioning with full capacity. Higher education institutes have also announced that they will reopen from Monday onwards for staff though online classes will continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-extends-curfew-by-7-days-essentials-can-stay-open-till-3pm/articleshow/83267935.cms||---

This year, Delhi government has set a target of planting over 33 lakh saplings across the capital. Rai said the government also plans to hold a mega plantation drive — Van Mahotsav — from June 26 to July 11. “We will hold a mega plantation drive where we will plant over 33 lakh saplings across the city. All state government ministers, the speaker of Delhi legislative assembly, MLAs, NGOs and RWAs will all be taking part. The plantation drive will be handled by different government departments and agencies, including the environment department, DDA, MCD, PWD, BSES and others,” Rai said, while planting a sapling at Raj Niwas Marg in Civil Lines on Saturday. “On June 9, we will hold a virtual meeting with all these agencies and the entire plan will be finalised,” Rai added. Stressing on the campaign, “Ek paudha zindagi ke naam” (One sapling for one life), Rai asked people to come forward and take at least one sapling and nurture it for life. He claimed that the government would be distributing lakhs of saplings at government nurseries, to increase the city’s green cover. “In the last few years, the relentless work done by Delhi government under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has helped us to bring down air pollution by around 25%. I am confident that with the help of Delhiites, we will be able to run this mega plantation drive successfully,” the minister said. Delhi government has already taken several steps to combat air pollution, including anti-dust campaigns, introducing the tree transplantation policy, the all-new electric vehicle policy and the ‘Red light on, Gaadi off’ campaign, amongst others. Last year, the state government had set a target of planting 31 lakh saplings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/get-saplings-for-free-from-14-govt-nurseries/articleshow/83269158.cms||---

The Muscovy duck at the zoo has hatched five ducklings. It is an exotic bird species. “Mother and ducklings were kept in separate enclosures. It is kept without disturbance,” said the director of the zoo, H Rajamohan. The first zoo of eastern UP, Shaheed Ashfaqullah Khan Prani Udyan in Gorakhpur, was dedicated to people on March 27 by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “Since then, it has gained popularity. Carnivores, snake house and aquarium drew crowd. It was getting an average 3,500 visitors everyday and the number went up on weekends. The newborns at the zoo will draw more visitors,” he added. The zoo has about 154 animals and more would come once the lockdown is lifted. The rhino from Assam and zebra would come under an exchange programme. It has the capacity for 387 animals. One of the biggest attractions of the zoo is a 7D theatre for which e-tenders would be floated. The shops promoting products under ODOP scheme of the state government are another highlight. It was after a long wait of more than a decade that the Gorakhpur zoo got ready. It was approved in 2009-10 by the Mayawati government but was made functional in the Yogi government in 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gorakhpur-zoo-gets-5-duck-hatchlings/articleshow/83269118.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa’s largest healthcare institute has no intensivist to take care of critical patients||PANAJI: Even as Goa Medical College was forced to expand its ICU facilities as Covid-19 cases multiplied in April, the state’s largest healthcare establishment doesn’t have a single intensivist. Its ICU beds are currently managed by the stretched anaesthesia department, and the ICU at the super-specialty block is being guided by a cardiac anaesthetist from the cardiology department. GMC’s attempts to hire an intensivist have been futile so far. The last time this post was advertised was during the first wave last year. Dean Dr S M Bandekar said that the salary demands of intensivists are high, which they can't meet. A consultant joining any super-specialty department at GMC is paid Rs 3 lakh per month at an entry-level. “We are willing to hire an intensivist, but nobody wants to join us for salary reasons. Dr Sunil Sagar, under whose leadership the ICU in the super-speciality block has been set up this month, is as good as an intensivist. He is one of the best we have. He has a DM in anaesthesia,” Bandekar said. The role of an intensivist is critical in ICUs, as this specialist has knowledge of how various treatments affect the organs of a patient, and accordingly regulates fluid intake by precisely considering other parameters. Bandekar added that while GMC doesn’t have an intensivist per see, he said its ICU staff is well-trained. The ICU beds at GMC and the South Goa district hospital are being managed by around 17 anaestheia staffers and a dozen post-grad students and doctors serving bond. Besides 150-plus Covid ICU beds, GMC also has 35 non-covid ICU beds. A senior doctor said that while GMC’s ICU staff is trained, by no stretch of the imagination can it be said that it’s adequate. “It is tough going for GMC with so little staff, especially when the hospital has been handling loads of critical cases. However, in Goa, we don’t have intensivists,” the doctor said. It is not just government hospitals but even private ones — except 2-3 major ones — are currently without intensivists. A while ago, GMC had tried to get a doctor serving bond trained as an intensivist. She completed a year’s training in ICU post her MD in anaesthesia. “For a brief period, we had an intensivist, but she went back to her home state after marriage,” said Bandekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-largest-healthcare-institute-has-no-intensivist-to-take-care-of-critical-patients/articleshow/83267947.cms||Bindiya Chari

Towards this effort, the state government inked a long-term agreement with Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL) on Saturday to try and disburse subsidies for the sale of electric two-wheelers and cars. Environment minister Nilesh Cabral said that the government aims to make electric two-wheelers cheaper than petrol-powered two-wheelers while the price difference between a conventional car and an electric car will be reduced from 30% to 5%. “Goa has the highest consumption of fossil fuel and that is why it is the committent of this government to bring down fossil fuel ratio down. We have signed an MoU with CESL where they will act as the programme manager for the scheme and disburse state subsidy to original equipment manufacturers which will passed to the consumer by reducing the cost of electric vehicles,” said Cabral. The minister was speaking on the occasion of World Environment Day. Cabral said that Goa Energy Development Agency will collaborate with CESL to transfer subsidy for every electric vehicle sold. CESL also has the responsibility to bring in manufacturers of electric vehicles, charging stations and lithium rechargeable batteries to Goa. “The state’s subsidies are in addition to the subsidy for scrapping of vehicles and the Centre’s subsidy for electric vehicles. For motorcycle pilots, 50% to 54% of the cost of the vehicle will be subsidised. Plus we are offering a combined subsidy to make Goa a zero carbon state over the next eight to 10 years,” said Cabral. The minister also announced that the government has started a programme to restore coastal bunds and a tree plantation drive in Salcete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-eye-on-carbon-neutral-goa-to-incentivise-e-vehicles/articleshow/83267961.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Scientific farming raised cane production by 3 times’||LUCKNOW: Appreciating a farmer for using scientific techniques in farming, Prime minister Narendra Modi on Saturday tweeted about his digital interaction with Arvind Kumar of Hardoi district and said that using scientific techniques and inputs in farming has not only increased the cane production in his fields three times but ethanol plants at sugar mills has made his life easy. He also encouraged Kumar to go for complete organic farming and use solar pump for irrigation to save Earth. The PM asked Kumar if the sugar mill where he sells his produce has installed the ethanol plant. “We are requesting that if the future of the cane growers is to be secured then we have to think beyond jaggery and sugar and that is the reason why we are focusing on ethanol.” PM said that farmers get hit by both the bumper production of cane and slump in production. Kumar said that ethanol has brought one major change for cane growers which is timely payment from the mills. “The government buys it from the mills and makes instant payment and mills make timely payment to cane growers. Besides, it is mixed with petrol and that saves environment,” said Kumar. PM further asked him about his farming practises and if he is into organic farming. “You are young, educated and doing farming for years, are you aware that the entire world is now insisting on organic farming and use of organic fertilisers?.” Kumar said he has sown `dhaincha’ seeds in his fields and used compost. “I use NPK spray on cane leaves but not for more than two times.” When asked by PM if he uses urea he said he uses chemical spray. PM asked him to go for organic farming and ecourage other farmers to do the same. “Kya aapka mann karta hai ki shat pratishat jaivik kheti karein, market mein products jaivik ke naam se bikein” (don’t you get the urge to go for cent percent organic farming? It will help farmers in a big way. We get worried when our mother takes ill. We are making our mother earth suffer because of use of chemicals. Use of chemicals pollute the earth and affect productivity,” said the Prime Minister. Before ending his digital one-to-one with Kumar, PM gave him a word on solar pumps as well. “Are you aware of the solar pump? UP has good number of water resources in several parts. Aapka kaam solar pump se hi ho jayega diesel ki zaroorat nahin hogi. That will also be a service to the environment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/scientific-farming-raised-cane-production-by-3-times/articleshow/83269156.cms||---

Book stores cited lockdown as the reason for shortage. They said that unlocking has just begun and required books will be made available soon. “My son is in class 4. As per the school syllabus couple books are still not available in the market. I am waiting for them," said Anuj Singh, a parent. Another parent said that schools should have rather started online classes only from July 1. “Classes do not help much when proper books are not available. Despite several efforts, I could not arrange books. My son has to skip a few periods as it becomes difficult to understand without books," said Ankit Agarwal, a parent. Schools, however, said that they are conducting normal classes so that students would not feel absence of books. "Classes have just started and in such a situation it is not viable to force children for attending classes with all books. Students need not to worried about it," said a school teacher without quoting his name. Schools claimed that they are focusing more on curriculum activity classes so that such problem could be faced. Book stores said that all books will be made available soon. "Few stores have all books while others have not. As unlocking has begun this problem will be also resolve soon," said a book store owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/e-classes-kickstart-but-books-off-shelves/articleshow/83271495.cms||---

The pink party succeeded in retaining the Nagarjunasagar seat with a huge majority of 18,448 votes. In the Nagarjunasagar elections, the TRS had adopted a multi-pronged strategy. In the case of Huzurabad also, the party does not want to take any chance as Eatala Rajender is a strong leader in the constituency and a six-time MLA. Party sources said that in the Nagarjunasagar model, party president K Chandrasekhar Rao took the charge and visited the constituency much before the bypoll notification and announced sops to the constituency. He even addressed a second public meeting before the bypoll, which is rare for a party president. Secondly—while deputing about half a dozen ministers, including district minister G Jagadish Reddy—several MLAs and other senior leaders were made mandal incharge to ensure the party’s victory. The third strategy was poaching important leaders from other parties. BJP senior leaders like Kadari Anjaiah joined the pink party and another leader was assured to nominated to the council. “In Huzurabad, party leaders have already collected the list of developmental works that need to be taken up in Huzurabad and Jammikunta municipality. Local leaders and ZPTCs, MPTCs and sarpanches have been asked to identity long-pending issues in the constituency,” a party leader said. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is also expected to visit the constituency either by the end of the month, or next month not only to announce developmental works but also to boost the morale of the local leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-may-prefer-nsagar-poll-plan-redux-in-huzurabad-too/articleshow/83267965.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Goa||Goa: Work on restoring damaged sand dune taken up at Cavelossim||COLVA: Work on restoring a sand dune has been taken up in Cavelossim, after it was destroyed by a hotelier whilst building a concrete platform at the location. Based on orders of the National Green Tribunal, the Goa State Biodiversity Board along with the Cavelossim Biodiversity Management Cell has taken up the restoration work. The tribunal ordered the concrete platform to be demolished and the sand dune restored after a complaint by a villager Iris Passanha. On Saturday, environment minister Nilesh Cabral, on the occasion of World Environment Day, inspected the restoration work. Cabral said this is just a first step towards eco-system restoration, which needs united efforts to restore and save the environment. Goa Biodiversity Board member secretary Pradeep Sarmokadam said that eight months back, he took the help of former NIO scientist Antonio Mascarenhas and erected picket fencing on the destroyed sand dune so as to collect sand through natural processes. He said it would take around 4-5 years for its restoration. Cavelossim biodiversity cell chairman Dixon Vaz spoke about Sal river breaching the bundhs and saline water ingressing into fields, destroying crops. He urged the minister to take up work of building the bundhs. Cabral urged the locals, just like the sand dune restoration, should take up work on the bundhs by utlising the help and knowledge of farmers as they know the right methods. Cabral promised all assistance through the state government for the work. Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao said that environment issues cannot be taken up on piecemeal basis and should be take up as a whole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-on-restoring-damaged-sand-dune-taken-up-at-cavelossim/articleshow/83267967.cms||---

North Delhi Municipal Corporation opened one such site at Ajmal Khan Park on World Environment Day on Saturday. In place of flower pots, the corporation reused old tyres, dustbins, defunct carts, water tanks and swings for planting saplings in the park. A splash of paint gave a fresh new look to these art projects. “These corners give a new look to the park and also spread the message of reusing waste. There is a plan to develop a portion of the park on the same concept of ‘waste to art’ park and the project is in the planning stage,” said a north corporation official. “Meanwhile, we are in process of developing such corners at parks in east Punjabi Bagh and Rajendra Nagar.” The civic body also launched a mega drive on Saturday to plant one lakh saplings during the monsoon. The drive was launched by MP Manoj Tiwari and mayor of north corporation Jai Prakash at the Mata Basanti Devi Park at Azad Market Chowk. “We aim to complete the target with the help of various NGOs. We should also fix responsibilities for taking care of the plants and ensure their survival,” said Prakash On the occasion, South Delhi Municipal Corporation also planted nearly 2,800 trees and shrubs on the occasion. “Broad-leaved trees species such as palash, ber (Ziziphus mauritiana), peepal and varieties of rudraksha, amaltas, ashoka (Saraca asoca), moulsari, neem, kachnar, champa and African mahogany were planted at various places,” said a SDMC official. In the central zone, SDMC mayor Anamika planted trees at Harinagar ward. She said the plantation drive will be conducted with diligence and post care will also be given priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-plans-art-corners-to-recycle-waste/articleshow/83269201.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The process to hand over bodies to relatives is in on. On Friday, Yellow Gate police conducted an aerial panchnama of the spot where P305 drifted and sank. The panchnama is an essential part of any criminal investigation to understand the sequence of events, spot of an offence and investigators narrate it before court during trial. While conducting the panchnama for P305, the investigating officer also went to the place in a helicopter, where tug Varaprada had sunk with 11 crew members during Cyclone Tautkae on May 17. Police had taken two survivors in the helicopter for panchnama, where they narrated to the cop how the mishap had happened. The chopper went 40 nautical miles from Mumbai shore, where P305 was stationed at ONGC’s Heera oilfield. Mustafizur Rehman Shaikh, chief engineer of P305, had lodged a case against Rakesh Ballav, captain of P305 and others for not making a distress call on time and endangering the lives of others. As many as 75 crew of the barge had died in the mishap. “Some bodies were beyond identification. So, we collected blood samples of their relatives and sent them to Kalina FSL. So far, 10 samples have been matched to the relatives and bodies are being handed over,” a police officer said. “Besides this, some bodies were recovered in Valsad too. We are collecting DNA sample reports of bodies from Surat FSL as well. They will be analyzed/matched to blood samples of relatives in Mumbai,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dna-samples-of-10-sunk-barge-victims-bodies-match-relatives-panchnama-done/articleshow/83269216.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa government plans to revive, create 100 water bodies in forest areas||PANAJI: Seeking innovative ways to reduce man-animal conflicts, the forest department plans to create and revive around 100 new water bodies in forests that dot the state. The move, along with plantation of scores of fruit-bearing trees in the jungles will help prevent wild animals from straying into human habitations, said chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday. Speaking on the occasion of World Environment Day, Sawant said that the department also plans to distribute and encourage the plantation of five lakh fruit-bearing trees. “We looked to see why there were man-animal conflicts and we found that the animals leave the jungle to search for things that they can’t get - water and food. That is why, to reduce human-animal conflict we have started water harvesting and growing fruit-bearing trees in forests,” said Sawant. The chief minister announced that the state government has paid compensation of Rs 10 lakh as relief to farmers who suffered from human-animal conflict. “The state has a dedicated wildlife rescue team that is available 24x7,” said Sawant. The theme for this World Environment Day is ‘Restoring the Ecosystem’, and Sawant called on all stakeholders to help preserve and protect forests, wild animals and other natural resources. Ironically, Sawant has vehemently refused to engage with wildlife activists and environmentalists who waged a long campaign to stop trees from being felled in the Mollem wildlife sanctuary. Sawant said that in order to create awareness about the importance of natural forests, the state government has been organising special events like bird festival, turtle conversation, etc. He also said that eco-tourism activities are being promoted through biodiversity parks and new nurseries that are being set up at Harvalem in north and Dharbandora in South Goa. “250 youth have been trained as nature guide to inform people about the rich biodiversity of the forests. There are 50 vaidya mitras who can harvest different herbs available in the forests and are registered with the forest department,” Sawant said. The forest department is distributing saplings at Campal ground for free with the aim of planting 5 lakh trees in the state to mark World Environment Day. “Ecosystem restoration requires everyone to work together, the government and the people. Only then can the ecosystem be restored,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-govt-plans-to-revive-create-100-water-bodies-in-forest-areas/articleshow/83267963.cms||---

Shukla said, world has witnessed outbreaks of many worrisome diseases in the last ten years, including deadly infections like SARS, MERS, Zika and Ebola. This is a sign that we have to pay attention to environmental protection and promotion to avoid diseases. The webinar focused on the importance of taking a holistic approach towards tourism and benefitting all the stakeholders while ensuring the protection of environment and the local community. All the speakers emphasised that "regenerative tourism" is part of a larger movement around the world. The panelists said that a different change has been seen in the mindset of tourists in the Corona times.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: More than 53k returnees worried about getting jobs||Dehradun: The migrant workers who came back to Uttarakhand during the second wave of Covid-19 are uncertain of their future, adding that job prospects look bleak for them. Recently, a detailed report compiled by the Rural Development and Migration Commission revealed that 53,092 migrant workers returned to Uttarakhand between April 1 and May 5 in the wake of the second wave of Covid-19. The report has been handed over to the state government. According to the report, the maximum number of migrant workers returned to Pauri and Almora – the two districts which have witnessed maximum migration since November 9, 2000, when the state was created. From April 1 to May 5, as many as 14,850 migrants returned to Almora, followed by 9,473 to Pauri, 8,087 to Tehri, 4,713 to Champawat, 4,105 to Bageshwar, 3,083 to Chamoli, 2,990 to Nainital, 2,450 to Pithoragarh, 1,474 to Rudraprayag, 1,308 to Pauri, 349 to Udham Singh Nagar, 152 to Dehradun and 58 to Haridwar. Among these, a maximum of 34,360 migrant workers returned from Delhi, Gurugram, Chandigarh and Mumbai. Arun Negi, a Rudraprayag resident, said, “A large number of youths from Rudraprayag and Tehri worked in hotels and eatery joints in the Delhi and the NCR region. After the first Covid-19 wave, customers were reluctant to visit restaurants and before things could return to normal, the second wave of the virus struck. The owners of these establishments had to sack a high number of their staff as their earnings dropped to zero.” Negi, who worked in an NCR-based restaurant, said that there is a low possibility of the returnees finding a work opportunity now. Last year, the Uttarakhand government had started the CM Swarozgar Yojana. Around 10,000 people had filed to avail the benefits of the scheme which aims to help returnees set up their work. Of these, loans have been approved for 3,904 projects and while the bank has rejected 3,265 applications, 168 requests are still under process. SS Negi, vice-chairman of Rural Development and Migration Commission, said, “There is a need to provide social and financial support to the returnees. We need to set up committees on block and district levels. The commission has suggested seven sectors — tourism, agriculture, horticulture and animal husbandry, among others — which can help in providing job opportunities to these people and boosting reverse migration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-more-than-53k-returnees-worried-about-getting-jobs/articleshow/83266426.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Delhi||Delhi: Creation of city forests adds to green cover||NEW DELHI: The capital has seen a steady growth of green cover in the last decade, evolving to the present 21.9% of Delhi’s 1,484 sq km. This has not been achieved simply by planting more trees, but also by restoring areas that were lying bare, some even used as waste dumps. With the theme of World Environment Day on Saturday being ecosystem restoration, the city forests have proved important ecological and green hotspots and provided an environmental balance amid the urban sprawl. In the past few years alone, city forests have emerged at Mitraon, Nasirpur, Alipur, Taj Enclave, Hauz Rani and Garhi Mandu. Saplings were planted on World Environment Day in 2016 at Garhi Mandu that have seen a revival of flora and fauna. Taj Enclave near Geeta Colony, spread over 1.75 hectares, was a garbage dump before the waste was cleared and native species planted there. While natural forests stand in several locations of the city, the urban forests have been developed in such a manner that they allow habitat restoration while coexisting with recreational activities. To achieve this, bridges and walkways have been created and signages put up identify trees and medicinal herbs. “These allow people to learn about the native trees and plants,” said a forest officer. “We have also grown medicinal plants, even cacti in some patches. In some city forests, waterbodies have been created to attract birds and wildlife.” While a new city forest at Chhatarpur is in the planning stage, similar projects are under development by Delhi government’s forest and wildlife department in Ayanagar, Jaunapur and ITO. An official said, “We have created sections where insect houses are present. These indicate how insects play a key role in the ecosystem. The aim is to provide knowledge to local people, especially children, while providing green spaces.” Environmentalist professor C R Babu explained that for any ecosystem to thrive, a three-tier trophic level was important. “Native plant species can grow in the urban green hotspots and lure back insects, birds and other fauna. The green areas also act as a carbon sink, trap dust and regulate temperature naturally,” said Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/creation-of-city-forests-adds-to-green-cover/articleshow/83269211.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

His driver was also shot at and injured. The deceased, identified as Shailendra Kumar, 60, was a native of Garhpar under Biharsharif police station area in Nalanda and was on way to Patna to meet his son when the criminals intercepted his car and asked the driver, Anil Kumar, 55, about his identity before shooting him thrice in the chest around 8.30am. Anil, who belongs to Bichli Khandakpar in Nalanda, is undergoing treatment at a hospital. Shailendra had retired from the Bhagwat Nagar branch of SBI in Agamkuan, Patna City, on February 28 this year, branch manager Neeraj Kumar said. “He was a very calm and composed officer. He never had even an argument with anyone during his professional tenure,” Neeraj added. SP (rural) Kantesh Kumar Mishra said a police team had been sent to Biharsharif to talk to his family members and relatives to know the reason behind the murder. “It’s yet not clear why he was shot dead," Mishra said. Fatuha SDPO Rajesh Kumar Manjhi said the driver didn’t stop the car when criminals first tried to intercept it. Manjhi said the shooters were following the car. “They fired through the window after which the car climbed over a median. They asked who was the manager to which the driver said he was sitting behind. Soon thereafter, they fired several rounds, killing Shailendra on the spot,” he said. Manjhi said three separate teams were working to crack the case. "We hope to crack the case soon," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-banker-shot-near-fatuha-driver-injured/articleshow/83267262.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Goa||Goa: Monsoon makes soft arrival, moderate activity expected||PANAJI: After one of the wettest pre-monsoon seasons in seven decades, the southwest monsoon arrived in Goa on World Environment Day - the normal date - though there was not much precipitation till evening. Though it was quite bright and sunny till almost evening, the annual system gathered momentum to cross over Goa from Karwar in Karnataka from the south by afternoon. The northern limit of the monsoon extends upto Harnai, north of Ratnagiri in Maharashtra. The southwest monsoon being often described as a pulsating system that produces heavy rain and also slows down in phases, India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji considered the parameters before making a declaration. The conditions for onset of monsoon were slightly weak in the beginning. But after a delay in advancing over Kerala, the monsoon winds gathered speed and it arrived in Karnataka and Goa in two days. Widespread, though moderate, rainfall activity for past three days was one of the criteria for declaring arrival of monsoon. “The speed of the wind and direction is another criteria for declaring monsoon arrival. It should be ideally westerly or southwesterly and up to a height of at least 3.5 kms to 4 kms above mean sea level,” Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji said. Rainfall activity, wind speed and direction being satisfactory, continuous cloud formation is also a requirement, the scientist said. “The cloud formation is expected to gather momentum,” he said. A few places received moderate rainfall by evening. The scale of monsoon activity may not be heavy during the next few days. Further, the rainfall activity may weaken after Monday for a couple of days. The rainfall during the past 24 hours till Saturday morning, was very light though widespread. Ponda recorded 3mm, Mormugao 1.8mm, Canacona and Sanguem 1.2mm each while other centres received much less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monsoon-makes-soft-arrival-moderate-activity-expected/articleshow/83267972.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Vaccine coverage lowest in May due to severe shortage||PUNE: The month of May had the lowest number of Covid vaccinations in the district since March despite the drive opening up to include large beneficiary groups such as the 18-plus category. After the vaccination drive opened for citizens from March 1, all priority groups became eligible for shots in May, including those in the age group of 18-44. But data from the health department revealed that nearly 5.06 lakh doses were administered in May — not even half of the approximately 14.15 lakh inoculations in April. The drive to cover everyone over 45 began on April 1. In March, when the drive opened for only the 60 and 45-plus groups (with comorbidities), nearly 6.41 lakh citizens were vaccinated. Officials said the increase in the interval between two Covishield doses and vaccine shortage slowed down coverage in May. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “The reasons for the low number of shots administered in May, in comparison to March and April, were irregular vaccine supplies and shortage. By May-end, Pune district had administered over 27 lakh doses. If vaccine supply had been regular with a higher volume of doses, we could have reached at least 40 lakh beneficiaries by May-end, which means an additional 12 to 13 lakh doses by end of last month.” Health experts had earlier said giving the maximum number of people first doses would have been ideal for some level of widespread protection against the virus. Across the globe, the standard practice during peak pandemic has been to finish first-dose coverage of a large population as quickly as possible. Experts had said that the lead vaccine in India, Covishield, will confer at least 76% immunity after the first dose. But Sanjay Pujari, from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19 and director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, doubted the efficacy of a single dose, especially after the emergence of the Delta variant. Pujari said, “Nearly 60-70% of a population should be fully vaccinated to get some protection from the virus, assuming that there aren’t any immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants. With variants such as Delta coming into the picture, this still remains evolving science and the exact picture is unclear.” In a study reported this week, scientists in India said the Delta variant, first detected in India, is more infectious than the Alpha variant first detected in the UK, and is also the reason behind the second wave. “Our data indicates B.1.617.2 shows high transmissibility and surges without any increase in case fatality rate (CFR). We estimate the transmissibility to be as much as 50% greater than B.1.1.7. Viral load of B.1.617.2 appears to be higher than B.1.1.7,” said the study conducted by scientists from National Centre for Disease Control, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-coverage-lowest-in-may-due-to-severe-shortage/articleshow/83267970.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nagpur||Easing of curbs welcome. Up to us to stay cautious, says citizens||Nagpur: Citizens had varied reactions to the state government’s announcement of lifting lockdown-like restrictions as per the five-level unlock plan. Yet, a majority concurred with the opinion that the onus of not letting our guard down lies on citizens. Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NHRA), said, “It’s nice that the city opens with a sensible order. It’s up to the citizens to follow protocols and guidelines to manage the level of restrictions and keep the city moving almost 100%. Now, we are directly responsible if there’s any lockdown ahead.” “People were looking forward to the unlocking process, but once the curbs are done away with, they should cautiously and responsibly go on with their work,” said Modern School director Neeru Kapai. “Though this unlocking was necessary for many business and work sectors, as uncertainty is the punchline here during Covid times, people should be very responsible with their actions,” Kapai added. Lawyer Firdos Mirza termed it as a welcome move. He said, “It will instil confidence in the public and also provide solace to the economy. Everyone must keep in mind that the government has not yet prepared any national plan to deal with the pandemic, so they have to take care of themselves. Thus, each citizen must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Lalit Khullar, director of Tripude Institute of Management Education, said, “This might not be the best time to initiate the process of easing restrictions, but people should resolve to follow Covid precautions strictly.” Chartered accountant Shivkumar Rao’s immediate reaction to the news of was that of surprise. He said, “However, the matrix defining level-wise unlocking seems to have been calibrated well and monitoring on a weekly basis also appears fine. It’s now entirely up to the citizens and businesses to follow guidelines and ensure that we don’t slip to further levels. We should aim to be at level one permanently.” Mohota Science College’s vice-principal Rina Saha believes that restrictions should have been eased earlier. She added, “Now that we are heading towards a routine without restrictions, we need to follow all norms as experts have suggested that the third wave can affect children. We should do our best to protect our loved ones.” Vidarbha Industries Association Lady Entrepreneur’s Wing chairperson Manisha Bawankar said, “The government should not open all the sectors together because cases are still above 100 in the city. The relaxation of curbs should be a step by step process so that the projected third wave causes lesser damage.” Retired school principal Kana Roy Chaudhuri said it’s important to open each and every shop as soon as possible to bring the state’s economic condition back on track. She added, “It will help people who were out of business. Also, people should follow Covid guidelines properly and if they have any symptoms, they should get a test done immediately.” Entrepreneur and angel investor Shashikant Chaudhary agreed with Chaudhuri’s opinion. He said, “This is the right time to open up as the financial health of organizations as individuals have taken a huge toll. But we need to take baby steps first, take feedback, and then increase the speed of easing restrictions gradually.” Businesswoman Monica Bhagwagar expressed strong opposition to the decision. She said, “Nagpur citizens never learnt a lesson from earlier conditions as some are still not following the rules properly and venturing out aimlessly. This may lead to the third wave. It is my humble request to the state government to execute the unlock process in a phased manner which would be more convenient according to the situation.” (With inputs from Shuchi Purohit & Dev Sethia)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/easing-of-curbs-welcome-up-to-us-to-stay-cautious-says-citizens/articleshow/83267971.cms||---

Referring to the day’s worldwide theme “ecosystem restoration,” the members of Vainguinim Valley residents’ association and La Citadel Colony residents association stated that action in the matter would be a good start to the restoration process. The association pointed out that after their complaint, an experts committee deputed by Goa Coastal Zone Management Mommittee (GCZMA) had inspected the site on April 23, 2021. In its report, it had recommended issuance of a stop work order to the party to prevent further degradation of the ecologically fragile intertidal zone. The committee had also recommended removal of cement used in construction of wall instead of eco-friendly material. The conditions contained in the approval from GCZMA have been breached by the party, the report stated. The hotel, which has taken up the construction of the wall, had dismissed the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/act-against-beach-wall-cabral-urged/articleshow/83267978.cms||---
---||Bhopal||In ‘Chipko’ style, people vow to protect trees in Buxwah||Bhopal: Almost 48 years after the famous Chipko Andolan to protect the forests of the foothills of Himalayas, a similar campaign to protect the proposed felling of over 2 lakh trees for a diamond mine has started in Chhatarpur district a part of Bundelkhand region of MP. On the World Environment Day, people in Buxwah staged demonstrations, hugged the trees and vowed to protect them. They observed fast to save the trees. Another group tied ‘Raksha Sutra’ around the tree trunks and took oath to save the green lungs of Bundelkhand, a drought-prone area. The trees are likely to be felled for a diamond project in Buxwah— the Bunder Mining Project. A PIL has also been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the project which had been secured by Essel Mining & Industries Limited (EMIL), an Aditya Birla Group Company, in 2019. The Bunder project was first owned by Rio Tinto – the Anglo-Australian MNC – but later went to EMIL tat bagged the bid two years ago. The state government is tightlipped over the controversy. Rio Tinto was associated with the project for 12 years, before leaving in 2016. It too faced issues related to environmental clearances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/in-chipko-style-people-vow-to-protect-trees-in-buxwah/articleshow/83271561.cms||Deshdeep Saxena
---||Mumbai||Cost of Mumbai Metro 3 soars by Rs 10,000 crore in 5 years||MUMBAI: The cost of the underground Metro 3 project has escalated by over Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 33,406 crore from the original estimate of Rs 23,136 crore in 2016. When tenders were invited in 2016, the cost was based on the 2011 estimate. The escalation proposal was submitted to the state finance department by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is implementing the 33.5km rail link between Cuffe Parade and Seepz, in February. The finance department is yet to clear it. “There is a perception that no further cost should be approved till the controversy over the location of the car shed is resolved,” a government source said. It is also learnt that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is funding almost 60% of the total project cost, has not released funds for Metro 3 for the past year. “It is not JICA’s fault. The agency is waiting for the cost escalation approvals by the state and Centre,” a source said. Even as the project cost has shot up, there is growing uneasiness within government circles at the inability of the ruling MVA to shift the metro car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. Last December, the Bombay high court stayed the suburban collector’s decision to hand over the Kanjurmarg land for the car shed. “Since then, there has been virtually no initiative on the part of state agencies to vacate the stay,” a source said. The high court had fixed the matter for final hearing in February, but the state sought time to file replies and the case was adjourned to March. “Between March and April 2021, the case came up five times in the HC. But each time the matter came up, the state constantly sought more time,” an official said. On February 2, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), too, filed an application seeking that the stay order be vacated as a “public project was being gravely affected”. “After filing the application, the MMRDA has done little to push the case in the court for an early hearing,” an official said. A senior bureaucrat ascribed the cost escalation to various reasons, the controversy over the car shed being one of them. “The original project cost was based on the terrain of the Delhi metro. It was later found that Mumbai has a different terrain,” he said. The land acquisition cost for Metro 3 also drastically increased once the project commenced. The original estimate for land acquisition was fixed at Rs 590 crore, which has now increased to Rs 1,483 crore. The largest cost escalation component is for construction of the tunnel, stations and car depot. It was initially pegged at Rs 10,708 crore, but the revised cost estimate is Rs 18,711 crore. Early this year, a nine-member government panel headed by the then chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said an integrated metro depot at Kanjurmarg will save the government Rs 1,580 crore against land and construction costs. The committee appointed by the state government said the Metro 3 car shed at Aarey can accommodate only 30 rakes, while the Kanjurmarg one is large enough to hold 55. The panel report also concluded that the 41-hectare Kanjurmarg plot is big enough to be an integrated depot for three Metro lines: 3, 4 and 6. The 20-page report mentions that “if the integrated depot is planned at Kanjurmarg, an interchange station of Line 14 and Line 6 can be proposed at Kanjurmarg, facilitating better interchange between Lines 3, 6 and 14”. The Shiv Sena-led alliance government also has to cope with another obstacle on the Kanjurmarg land. Construction giant Shapoorji Pallonji has invested Rs 471 crore on the 500-acre Kanjurmarg sprawl with the Garodia family, which has claimed ownership over the plot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cost-of-mumbai-metro-3-soars-by-rs-10000cr-in-5-yrs/articleshow/83269265.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

The facility will have 10 paediatric beds, six high-dependency units and five neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) beds. The cantonment board has already prepared a proposal in this regard and forwarded it to the Ministry of Defence for seeking funds under PM Cares. Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB, said, “Our proposal has been scrutinised and approved by the Principal Directorate Defence Estates (PDDE) Southern Command. It has been forwarded to the ministry for seeking Rs5.43 crore funds.” The facility can be made functional within 45 days of receiving the funds, he said. “The civil work has been completed. We will have to purchase equipment necessary for the facility,” Kumar added. The PCB constructed the facility with the help of a trust for starting a maternity ward, Kumar said. “Considering the present immediate requirement, we have decided to convert it into a child and mother care Covid unit. It will be the first of its kind facility in the city,” he said. Two weeks ago, defence secretary Ajay Kumar held an online meeting with chief executive officers (CEOs) of all cantonments to discuss issues pertaining to health infrastructure in cantonments. “During the meeting, the secretary told us to seek funds under PM Cares so we have sent this proposal to the ministry,” added Kumar. PCB resident medical officer Dr Vidyadar Gaikwad said they could handle critical patients effectively as the hospitals had all necessary infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcb-to-set-up-ncov-facility-for-mother-child-care/articleshow/83267974.cms||Sandip Dighe

Pravin Kamble (26), a resident of Sasanengar, did not register the FIR after the robbery because he was involved in conducting the last rites of coronavirus patients. The complainant was headed to his sister’s residence in Hadapsar, when some unidentified men signaled him to stop while one of them threatened him with a knife. Kamble stated in his FIR, “The suspects asked me to hand over the cash and valuables and threatened to kill me if the demand was not met. The suspects then stole my motorcycle and sped away towards Kondhwa.” Assistant inspector Narendra Patil from crime branch (unit VI) said, “The frontline worker was so afraid that he did not dare to register a police complaint.

BC Bhartia, president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said while he’s happy with the impending unlock, he advises caution. “Both traders and consumers have been waiting for things to unlock but everything has to be done within the safety guidelines. Government machinery must also be present on the ground to ensure that people comply with all norms,” said Bhartia. Rajesh Rokde, director of All India Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council and secretary of Nagpur Sarafa Bazaar, said, “People have learnt to live with Covid-19, so they are cautious but not scared. For our industry it is very important for a prosperous environment to be there, as people come to jewellery shop only after all wants and needs have been fulfilled. As it is we all are taking utmost precautions at the shop to ensure that all stakeholders are safe.” Shivkumar Rao, president of Vidarbha Economic Development Council said the new unlock guidelines have put the onus on citizens. “The new guideline instructions are extremely transparent in telling citizens what to expect if the parameters are breached. Nagpur is fortunate enough to be in level one and it’s a huge responsibility. My advice to our members will be to still take lot of precautions and be cautious in your approach.” Dipen Agarwal, president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade said, “Traders are upbeat that economy will soon come back on track. Since the pandemic started, traders have suffered losses so the unlocking is a welcome step. At the same time many of us have lost their loved ones during the devastating second wave, and that has taught us to be cautious. Our members have decided to tread on the safe side and implement strict safety protocol for our staff and customers.” He added that government too needs to pitch in and provide sop to businesses which suffered due to the pandemic. Ashwin Mehadia, president for Nag Vidarbha Chambers of Commerce said, “While traders are happy about shops finally being opened up fully, the worry is about the weekly review. So if we are demoted to level two or below after two weeks then all business plans go awry. So this new adjustment to fast changing dynamics will take time.” Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association said, “We were always open but because of trade and industry being closed, there was no business. We are confident that within a week or so, marginal business will return. We need the outstation guests to arrive as that is where the room occupancy levels go up. The unlock matrix declared by the government is indeed a welcome step as it helps us understand the parameter.” Pradeep Gupta, vice-president of Sitabuldi Merchants Association said, “The only concern is that due to no festive season immediately in front of us plus wedding season is also over, so there won’t be a huge response. My opinion is that we should all close down our shops by 7pm for the first two weeks to avoid complications, and then move ahead in a phased manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/traders-welcome-unlocking-but-want-to-put-cautious-foot-forward/articleshow/83267987.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Lourenco made the demand in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, minister for environment, forest and climate change Prakash Javadekar, Railways minister Piyush Goyal, Ayush minister Shripad Naik and chief minister Pramod Sawant. He said that the government would do “a great service to Goa and to Goemkars in doing away with these environmentally catastrophic projects” - double tracking of South Western Railway line (SWR), Tamnar power project and a four-laning of National Highway NH 4A. “The CEC in its report has come down heavily on the double tracking of SWR line as it ‘will destroy the fragile eco-system of the Western Ghats which is an internationally recognised biodiversity hotspot and also one of the most important wildlife corridors of the country’. It has further added the double tracking would lead to hardly any returns ‘by marginally enhancing the capacity of the most inefficient section of the Railway Network passing through ecologically sensitive and bio-diversity rich Tiger Reserve, Two Wildlife Sanctuaries and a National Park,” Lourenco pointed out in his letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aleixo-writes-to-pm-over-linear-projects/articleshow/83267982.cms||---

CM Nitish Kumar on Saturday launched the ‘Mission 5.0 Plantation’ by planting a mahogany sapling at his official residence at 1, Anney Marg, here on the World Environment Day. “State’s environment, forest and climate change department (EFCCD) has fixed a target of planting five crore saplings in the current FY under the Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Abhiyan to create awareness about environment protection,” a press note issued from the CM’s office said. Soon after the CM launched the programme, plantation was formally started in all forest divisions across the state. The rural development department (RDD) also started the plantation drive at various places under the MGNREGS. Similarly, the women volunteers of Jeevika, different NGOs and paramilitary forces also launched the plantation drive on the occasion. To meet the demand under the Mission 5.0 Plantation, the EFCCD has prepared more than 5.5 crore saplings in its different nurseries across the state. A total of 1.24 crore saplings would be planted by the EFCCD under different departmental schemes. “Two crore saplings would be handed over to the RDD for plantation under the MGNREGS, while another 1.5 crore saplings will be provided to Jeevika. Around 15 lakh saplings will be sold to common people by the EFCCD. Another 20 lakh saplings will be planted by different organizations, including the NGOs and paramilitary forces,” the press note said. Bihar’s total green cover reduced to only 9% in 2000 as almost all forest areas fell in the newly carved Jharkhand after the state’s bifurcation. To increase the green cover, Nitish had launched ‘Hariyali Mission’ in 2012. Bihar successfully increased its green cover to 15% by planting around 22 crore saplings since 2012. Principal secretaries to the CM, Deepak Kumar and Chanchal Kumar, were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-govt-to-plant-5-crore-saplings-in-2021-22-nitish/articleshow/83267302.cms||Madan Kumar

With the gap between the two doses increased to 84 days, their second jabs are scheduled almost around the time when they would have to leave. With states like Kerala and Maharashtra writing to the Centre seeking reduction of the gap between the two jabs, these students say they might have to fly to these states to get their second shot, if the relaxations is not allowed in our state as well. The Maharashtra government has appealed to the Centre to lower the age cut-off for these students. Darsh Chopra, a class XII student of Birla High School, who is headed to the university of Purdue to study maths and statistics, took his first jab in May an is due for the second on August 23. “I am thinking of taking the second dose in either Mumbai or Pune because they have relaxed the rules there,” he said. Most foreign campuses have asked students to come in with a covishield vaccine and have also been given the last date of arrival on campus, where they have to stay in quarantine for a week. “I have to reach campus by August end and my second dose is due on August 23. I am mulling going to Kerala to take my second jab where the rules are relaxed,” said Aishani Chatterjee, a student of La Martiniere for Girls. She is headed to the University of Michigan for an undergrad programme in neuro sciences. Her classmate Sarah Roy, who is headed to the Trinity Western University, Canada, for an undergrad course in media and communication is tense about managing her second jab before leaving. “I cannot push back my last date of arrival on campus,” she said. There are several students, who are not headed abroad but booked an appointment the moment they became eligible. Anuj Chopra, who was the student president of Birla High School is one such. He has secured his admission at Christ University, Bangalore and is waiting to fill the forms of the Delhi University and will write the test of the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-securing-seats-in-foreign-varsities-worry-about-second-vaccine-dose-on-time/articleshow/83267306.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Chandigarh||On farmers’ issue, BJP leadership has failed to show sincerity: Joshi||Chandigarh: Former cabinet minister and BJP leader Anil Joshi, on Saturday, criticised his party leadership in the state as well as in Delhi for failing to understand the pain of farmers and for not being able to build a consensus on farm laws. Joshi, a two-time former MLA from Amritsar North, said that senior leaders in his party need to shun the “Hath Yog” and show sincerity on the farmers’ cause if they have to remain alive in Punjab politics. Joshi told TOI, “When we have lost municipal bodies elections in Punjab badly due to farmers’ agitation, do you think they will allow us to contest assembly polls? If farmers have dug their heels at the Delhi border for the last six months, do you think they would budge now? If you cannot put across the issues of those who have shown faith in you, do you still think that you will survive in politics?” Urging the BJP government to listen to the farmers, Joshi said the farmers think that BJP leaders have a say at the top level and can resolve the issue, but they don’t know that a former cabinet minister doesn’t get a hearing at the state party president level. “It has been over six months now since the farmers are sitting at Delhi borders. Nearly 500 farmers, including our friends and family members, have become ‘shaheed’. There should be some pain,” said Joshi, former local bodies’ minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-farmers-issue-bjp-leadership-has-failed-to-show-sincerity-joshi/articleshow/83268015.cms||Sanjeev Verma

Trichy district has 8,06,198 cardholders. Almost all the shops were crowded with the beneficiaries waiting for their turn to get the groceries for this month. The PDS staff had already distributed tokens to the cardholders few days back and each shop was to entertain 200 people every day.. Despite the issue of tokens as part of the crowd control measure, people hardly followed the social distancing norms in many of the shops. District supply officer (DSO) of Trichy Anbazhagan said, “I found people flouting the social distancing norms in the queue and advised them to keep distance to avoid the spread of the Covid-19 infection.”The state government had provided Rs 2,000 as a first instalment of the Rs 4,000 Covid-19 relief assistance last month. Anbazhagan said that 98 % of the people received the Rs 2,000. “Very meagre number of cardholders did not collect the assistance. Such beneficiaries can collect the payment at the ration shops now,” he said. The districts were awaiting further orders on the distribution of Corona relief kit with 13 groceries to the cardholders. Officials said that the order was expected in a week. The order on the distribution of the remaining Rs 2,000 is also yet to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/public-make-beeline-to-pds-shops-flout-norms/articleshow/83268019.cms||---

I am forced to sing on roadsides now regularly ever since marriages, birthday parties and anniversaries have shrunk. I don’t know how else to earn. The restrictions give me just a few hours,” Shaikh, who is from Murshidabad in West Bengal, said. The crowd walks around Shaikh as he sings, but donations are few and the sum paltry. “I cannot blame them. Most are in a hurry to get stuff and go home. There was a time, not too long ago, when I used to earn up to Rs 20,000 a month. People loved my singing and with functions and parties always happening, I would get hired to perform and was paid handsomely at times. The pandemic took it all away. I sing here or on MG Road and people called me if they had an event. I do the same thing now, but there are hardly any listeners, and no calls. On a good day, I get Rs 100 to Rs 150,” he said. Shaikh, who lives in Ashrafnagar in Kondhwa, said he came to Pune five years ago. “My parents, wife and children are in my village in Murshidabad. My landlord here has been kind and despite irregular payments, has allowed me to stay on. Earlier, I could send money to my family regularly but not any more. I quit my job as an electronic items repairman and took up singing full-time as a passion. I am there from 7am and keep a positive frame of mind and hope each day that the situation will return to normal again,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/busker-on-salunke-vihar-road-keeps-singing-even-when-the-going-gets-tough/articleshow/83268023.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Jaipur||Illegal mining at proposed tiger reserve site, Rajasthan admn ‘ignorant’||JAIPUR: The assault on nature continues unabated in Dabi range of Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary (RVS), a newly proposed tiger reserve in Bundi district, as the mining mafia has been brazenly excavating sandstone from the forest land and exporting it. Illegal mining is an open secret in the region as scores of vehicles ply fearlessly and echoes of sounds of drilling machines can be heard in distant villages. But all this has failed to wake up the administration. TimesViewThe state government's commercial interests are conflicting with conservation. Forest land is crumbling to mining pressure despite the Supreme Court imposing a blanket ban on such activities. The mafia is brazenly violating the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980. Rajasthan’s latest draft forest policy proposes strict control over mining. But ground reality is entirely different. The chief minister should intervene before the wildlife habitat is destroyed beyond repair. Ramgarh Sanctuary is a fresh hope to accommodate the ‘extra’ Ranthambore tigers.Documents in possession with TOI states there are 27 illegal sandstone mines operational on the forest land in Dhorela Gararda, Dasalia, Lambha Koh, Palanka and Dhaneshwar forest blocks of Dabi range. A forest official source said, “Nowhere in the state is illegal mining taking place on forest land on such a scale. Last year, Keyhole Markup Language (KML) files of every illegal mine operating on forest land were submitted to the then Head Of Forest Forces (HOFF). The activities, unhindered by law, is destroying the ecology beyond repair.” Green activists demanded the state government to intervene before its too late. Tapeshwar Singh Bhati, president of Kota-based Mukundra Hills Environment and Wildlife Society, said between 2019 and 2020, more than 95,000sqm of forest area has been ravaged. The mining mafia is not just carrying illegal excavation, they are also dumping the waste on forest land disturbing the ecology. “The issue has been brought to the notice of divisional forest officer (DFO) and ranger, but no action has been taken. In the last two months, seven complaints have been registered at Rajasthan Sampark portal. The pleas remain unheard till date,” he added. Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) and Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) were unavailable for comments. Sources alleged that the mafia was earning in crores of rupees by selling sandstone in European countries. “It is estimated that sandstones worth Rs 100 crore have been stolen from the state forest resources. On an average, a mine produces enough stones for 20 trucks,” sources said. Rampant mining could also prove to be a major setback in declaring the sanctuary as a tiger reserve. The government had recently approached the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to develop a sanctuary in Bundi as the fourth tiger national park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/illegal-mining-at-proposed-tiger-reserve-site-raj-admn-ignorant/articleshow/83268032.cms||Ajay Singh
---||Chandigarh||‘Dossiers’ on MLAs, ministers raise ‘ammo to oppn’ concern||Jalandhar: Reports of Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh carrying dossiers on Congress MLAs and a few ministers in his meeting with the three-member panel appointed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to look into the crisis within the Punjab Congress on Friday has led leaders to fear more questions and embarassment for the party. Party leaders believe that while the CM may have used the material for fire-fighting, it would provide ammunition to the opposition. MLAs are also concerned about the impact on their future prospects. CM baiters have already started pointing out that at least two of the ministers in his camp face serious allegations. They asked if the CM had apprised the three-member panel of these. It is learnt that earlier Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar sought action against one of these ministers from the CM in the presence of other ministers. In his recent meeting with the three-member panel, he again raised the issue and sought his expulsion from the state cabinet. Reported use of dossiers has caused surprise and anxiety in Congress circles as these could have serious implications not only for ticket seekers, but also for the party leadership. Although use of the dossiers have been widely reported, CM’s camp has not yet denied their presence. “This amounts to acceptance that corruption has been prevailing in the government and allegations of large-scale illegal mining etc with active connivance of elected representatives were true. However, the biggest question remains why the CM did not check MLAs or his ministers or act against them. The dossiers reflect that the CM was aware of such alleged activities and in that case, minimum he could have done was to summon such ministers or MLAs and warn them and in case they did not mend their ways to take action against them. Dossiers raise questions not just about the particular MLAs or any minister but about the working of the entire government also,” said a Congress MLA. “Now party high command would also be answerable once they have been apprised of any sort of corruption or irregularities by the MLAs or any minister. There can be embarrassing questions at the national level,” another MLA said. “Things have come too far. Now can any minister on whom dossier is there continue in the cabinet and will the MLAs who face allegations of any illegal activities face legal and party action?” asked a Punjab minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dossiers-on-mlas-ministers-raise-ammo-to-oppn-concern/articleshow/83268024.cms||IP Singh

These four districts fit both the criteria for Level 1 — less than 5% test positivity and less than 25% oxygen bed occupancy — set by the state government’s disaster management department. All shops, markets, malls, activities and events will be allowed and all offices will function with 100% capacity in the districts/units coming under level 1. None of these five units issued any notification for unlockdown by late Saturday night. Authorities appear to be a bit hesitant in lifting all the restrictions. Yavatmal, Chandrapur and Gondia district authorities told TOI that their notifications will be out by Sunday evening after discussions with the health department officials and guardian ministers of the respective districts. Akola and Washim were the only two districts in Vidarbha to release notifications on Saturday evening. Both districts fall in Level 3. Akola’s district collector Jitendra Papalkar said several relaxations will be allowed from from 7am on June 7 as per state order. In Washim, district collector Shanmugarajan issued new notification. Buldhana is the only district that falls in Level 4. Buldhana is also undecided about the notification. Sources said guardian minister will hold meeting on Sunday after which notification will be issued. Nagpur City (municipal corporation region) as well as Nagpur district (Rural) both units are in Level 1 and set to be fully unlocked from Monday. However, the district collector (for rural) and the municipal commissioner (for city) were busy holding meetings with district and city health officials throughout Saturday, but none of them issued any revised guidelines or unlock plan. The Nagpur municipal corporation issued an official correspondence stating that unlock notification will be issued on by Sunday evening. On Sunday, district guardian minister Dr Nitin Raut will chair a meeting with the authorities at 11am. While Nagpur district’s overall positivity rate is 3.86%, city’s TPR is 2%. Only 6.4% oxygen beds are occupied in city while 8.1% in district. The bed occupancy report for the week that ended on June 3 shows that Bhandara, Wardha and Gadchiroli have less than 25% oxygen beds occupied, which means they fit in one parameter. But, the test positivity in these districts is slightly higher than 5%. So, they are in Level 3 and will not be fully unlocked from Monday. But all these districts will definitely get relaxations. The notifications are still awaited. Amravati, with 6.56% positivity and 28.5% oxygen beds occupied, falls in the Level 3 along with Akola having 7.74% positivity and 43% of oxygen beds occupied (up to June 3).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-chandrapur-yavatmal-gondia-eligible-for-total-relaxations/articleshow/83268029.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has tied up with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RFID) to produce and distribute Sputnik V, developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, in India. State nodal officer for vaccination and IAS officer Vikas Garg told TOI that though the state government had not received any reply till date from RFID, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had shown interest to supply the two-dose Sputnik V. “They have indicated some offers and conditions in their letter and we are considering them. It is still in the pipeline,” said Garg. He refrained from sharing any further details till the decision is finalised by the state government, where it is also to be seen whether the state government has the required logistics to store this vaccine at below freezing point temperatures. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has till date approved three vaccines in India – Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. Garg also said the state government is awaiting a reply from Johnson and Johnson as to whether they can supply Covid vaccine to Punjab or not. As the Punjab government had approached various vaccine manufacturers across the globe, it had got a setback after Moderna and Ppfizer had last month declined Punjab’s request for sending vaccine directly to it. Both these companies had informed the Punjab government that they were working with federal governments across the world to supply their vaccine for use in national immunization programmes and thus cannot directly deal with the state governments. Snowman Logistics, the integrated temperature-controlled logistics service provider, had on June 3 partnered with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to provide end-to-end logistics solutions for delivery of Sputnik V all over India. As Sputnik V is required to be stored in minus temperatures, the logistics company has assured to maintain temperature between -20°C and -25°C through the delivery process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pbs-sputnik-v-hope-in-indian-pharmas-offer/articleshow/83268043.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The fall has been attributed to the intense lockdown coupled with multi-level doorstep screening measures.The city had on May 26 recorded the highest ever daily fresh infection when it registered 771 fresh cases. The days before and after the peak also saw the city recording 682 fresh infections on an average. Following the intense lockdown that saw all commercial establishments shut and public movement on roads severely reduced, fresh infections for the past few days have come down to an average 273, a fall of 60%. Close to 1,000 potential positive cases with high body temperature and low saturated oxygen level symptoms were identified through doorstep screening carried out across 65 wards for the past two weeks. Besides the multi-level screening, the civic body said that hotspots were screened once every two days through volunteers. “Fever camps held at 44 locations every day were another reason for the cases coming down. Surveillance teams report potential positive cases directly to the nearest UPHC doctors for early screening. Such measures contained the spread,” S Sivasubramanian, commissioner, Trichy corporation said.Similarly, from 42 containment zones in the third week of May and 19 in the last week, contained areas in the city which reported multiple cases are down to 12 now. The city has also managed to reduce Covid mortality by 44% in the last two weeks. From reporting nine to 14 deaths a day in the last week of May, the city has been recording only four to five daily in the past few days. “We are still focussing on vulnerable wards to encourage early hospitalisation and vaccination, thus avoiding the fatalities,” the commissioner added. There will be continuous focus on as many as 15 wards in K Abishekapuram zone, that has 133 hospitals and government medical college hospital, to keep the spread under check, the officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/new-cases-in-trichy-dip-by-60-deaths-by-44/articleshow/83268035.cms||Deepak Karthik

You can go for higher studies” This was a question K Chandra least expected from backward class welfare minister S S Sivasankar when she met him with a petition at an event in Sendurai on Friday. The 18-year-old girl, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in Ariyalur district, had passed class XII but was planning to set up a tailoring shop at her home to support her family.“If one of you from the community completes higher education and progresses, it will guide and encourage others also to study. I can help you in this,” the minister further told the girl who belongs to a scheduled tribe (ST) community. A resident of Narikuravar colony in Sendurai, Chandra had passed class XII from Sendurai government higher secondary school. However, despite clearing the board exams, she did not join higher education due to her family’s poverty. While promising to provide her a sewing machine as she wished, Sivasankar offered her financial support to pursue higher education according to her choice.“I have secured 60% marks in the board exam. The support given by the minister has given me confidence to study. I will discuss this with my family members and approach the minister again for educational help,” Chandra told TOI. Meanwhile, a video clip of the meeting has gone viral on social media platforms earning the minister, who won from Kunnam constituency, much appreciation. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/girl-seeks-sewing-machine-min-offers-her-help-for-studies/articleshow/83268036.cms||---

There have been ups and downs, especially during the second wave, but young entrepreneurs, who have founded these start-ups feel once the situation improves, their endeavours would be back on track. Shahwar, who has a startup in the tourism sector, said, “We had founded our start-up in January 2020. In March, there was a lockdown and we felt lost but there was a boom from the month of September and our clientele swelled. We started offices at eight places and hired 25 people during the period. It was the time when people bored by a prolonged lockdown wanted to go out. We organised several international tours as well. Till March, everything was going well but then there was a devastating second wave and our start-up has suffered. We hope that tourism picks up again.” Talking about his startup, Shahwar said, “We have developed an app, through which tracking code is given to traveller’s family members too, to enable them know in real time location of the person who has gone out for travel, whether the car that was hired for him/her was sanitised or not, hygiene-level at the hotel and so on. Pramod Maithil, who has been working in the field of education, was promoting the concept of T-lab (tinkering labs) in schools, where children experiment with scrap generated at home and end up creating something from the scrap. “It's different from conventional learning as there is no authority or curriculum to decide what they have to do. There are tools and scrap with which children have to produce something using their creative instinct”. Pramod said that he has been working on the concept since 2015 and by the time the lockdown happened in 2020, he had his T-lab in 12 schools. Some of them were doing extremely well but schools closed down after the outbreak of corona and for sometime, he felt he had lost the plot. During this period, students of schools in Mughalsarai and Faizabad in UP requested their teachers for an online tinkering lab. The teachers contacted Pramod, who saw a silver lining in what the teachers told him. He asked for a teacher and 10 students from each school to begin again. He mentored students through WhatsApp chats, asking them to plan what they wanted to create.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-based-startups-keep-hope-afloat-amid-pandemic-pessimism/articleshow/83271603.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Police, however, are skeptical as the three women lodged a complaint at the Kotwali police station on Friday, against one person, alleging non-payment of wages. When the parties concerned were called on Saturday, at the station to settle the matter, the women changed their statement, alleging gang rape by five men. Vijay Dhuli, Kheri SSP, said, “The matter seems suspicious as the women changed their written complaint. But, we have registered an FIR as per their latest complaint. They will be sent for a medico-legal examination on Sunday. All the accused have been detained and are being questioned by our officers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-women-daily-wagers-confined-2-gang-raped-by-five-men-in-kheri/articleshow/83266531.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Kochi||Highway heist case: SIT quizzes BJP Kerala president K Surendran’s staff||THRISSUR: The Special Investigating Team (SIT) probing the recent highway heist case at Kodakara on Saturday questioned the BJP state president Surendran’s secretary, Dipin, and his driver Ledheesh as well as the CPM activist Rejil. According to the SIT sources, all the BJP leaders who have been questioned have more or less made similar testimonies that they knew Dharmarajan, who is the complainant in the looting case, but they had no role in the transport of the money in Dharmarajan’s car and the highway robbery. They argued that BJP’s election campaign materials were sent through Dharmarajan, and they were contacting him for details of the transportation of those materials. Dipin and Ledheesh also disclosed to the police that they had seen Dharmarajan on several occasions and had spoken to him over phone, but never held any talks with him in connection with the highway heist incident, the sources said. Questioning of Surendran’s staff had strengthened the possibilities of the SIT officials summoning Surendran also. But the officials declined to confirm or deny this possibility. The SIT questioned Rejil from SN Puram near Kodungallur following reports that he had taken about Rs 3.5 lakh from Ranjit, who is one of the arrested accused in the case. Rejil had reportedly conceded that he had taken some money from Ranjit but he claimed that it was part of the amount Ranjit had borrowed earlier. Rejil had also promised to the police that he would hand over the money to the police soon. The SIT sources said that those who were associated with the case had also visited the election committee office of actor Suresh Gopi who was the BJP candidate in Thrissur. The election committee office was located on the ground floor of the BJP district committee office. However, the SIT officials declined to confirm the reports that they would question Suresh Gopi. Meanwhile, Congress leader and candidate in Thrissur assembly seat Padmaja Venugopal has demanded an inquiry into the source of the massive funds deployed by the BJP candidate Suresh Gopi in the constituency. She said it was not clear whether the cost of helicopter journeys of Suresh Gopi before the election had been included in his election expenditure statements submitted to the Election Commission. “More importantly, it is not clear whether there is any hidden understanding between the LDF and BJP to ensure that the probe into the highway heist case will not reach its logical conclusion. I will wait till the case takes a decisive turn before exploring the possibilities of filing any election complaint, Padmaja told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/highway-heist-case-sit-quizzes-k-surendrans-staff/articleshow/83267314.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Girl, 18, out with school friends on scooty during lockdown gang-raped by group of 6||BAREILLY: An 18-year-old Dalit girl who went for a ride on her scooty with her two school friends was allegedly dragged from her two-wheeler, assaulted and gang-raped by six men in Bhagwanpur Dhimri village of Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly district. The young girl has suffered injuries and is in a state of shock and trauma, sources said. The crime was reported on the outskirts of Bareilly city on May 31 during Covid lockdown and she mustered enough courage to inform her parents on Saturday. The accused had even threatened to kill her. The girl's elder brother and her school friends later took her to the local police station in Izzatnagar and lodged a complaint. An FIR was registered and Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan immediately sent a team with the girl to the village. All the accused named in the complaint are residents of the same village and are absconding. Multiple teams have been deployed to trace them. In her complaint, the girl said, “I was riding a scooty with one of my school friends while my other friend was on a different bike. When we were passing through the village, a few young men stopped us." According to police, three of them pulled her out from the scooty while others started assaulting her friends. One of her friends managed to escape from the place, but her other friend was seriously injured and he fell unconscious, the police said. "They then dragged me to an abandoned field near a dry canal where all of them took turns to rape me while I kept on pleading for help. After raping me, they threatened to kill us," the girl said in her complaint. "I still remember their names. They were calling each other by their names - Dharmendra, Anuj, Vishal, Neeraj, Amit and Naresh. Naresh was the most aggressive of them all and probably leading the gang. I want strict action against the accused," she added. The police further said that the 18-year-old was too scared and "didn’t want to cause embarrassment to her family". So, initially, she remained quiet. Later, she gathered courage after her sister's counselling. Meanwhile, the girl’s friend, who was also assaulted, said, “They snatched our phones and started thrashing me. We couldn’t understand what was happening and then I fell unconscious. I couldn’t do anything to save my friend.” When contacted, SSP Sajwan told TOI, “We have registered an FIR under IPC section 376-d [gang rape] along with the SC/ST Act against six persons. The girl’s statement has been recorded and we have inspected the crime scene and collected information about the accused. They will be arrested soon. We will ensure strict action is taken against all of them." The girl has been sent for medical examination and her statement will be recorded in the court, Sajwan added.

NIT Durgapur has designed a low cost oxygen concentrator that is coming to the market on Monday. There were three central institutes that were competing with each other over designing oxygen concentrators — IISc Bangalore, Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI) and NIT Durgapur. NIT beat others to bring the finished product to the market. After patenting the design and know-how and technology transfer, mass production has started recently and institute management confirmed that the product will make its debut on Monday. The machine has been named Pranayaam and has been prepared in the laboratories of the mechanical engineering department of the institute. The work started during the first phase of Covid and once the machine was ready, clinical trial was done at Sanjiban Hospital that has been serving Covid patients and Calcutta Heart Clinic. “The feedback from the two hospitals have been very encouraging and so we moved ahead with the project. Finally from our laboratories through non-exclusive technology transfer, we will be able to reach safe homes and patients who are in home care/isolation or in oxygen on wheels support systems,” said Anupam Basu, the director of the institute. At Rs 30,000 per machine, Pranayaam will not only help ease breaths but will save pockets too. The machine has a capacity of five litres per minute oxygen flow. “We have been able to reach a purity level of 96 per cent,” said SS Roy, faculty member of mechanical engineering department, who led the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nit-durgapur-designs-low-cost-o2-concentrators/articleshow/83267312.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Business||Second wave of Covid turns Indian consumers pessimistic||MUMBAI: Consumer confidence in India has slumped to the lowest level since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) started measuring it through surveys in 2016, while the consumer outlook on the economy and employment have worsened against the backdrop of the ravaging impact of second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. RBI’s Current Situation Index, which reflects responses of citizens to how they see themselves currently placed with respect to employment, prices, income, and spending compared to a year ago, has been negative (pessimistic) since July 2019. In May 2021, perceptions fell to an all-time low. Indians have for the second time turned pessimistic about the future which is reflected in the Future Expectation Index dipping into negative territory. The index takes into account perceptions about the general economic situation, employment scenario and household income over a one-year horizon. The last time Indians had turned negative about the future was in May 2020 as Covid-19 lockdowns were extended and the pandemic spread. While the worsening sentiment can be attributed to the second wave of the pandemic, consumer confidence had taken a hit in March as well. In the survey two months ago, consumers were pessimistic on all parameters except spending. They are still positive about spending, but much less compared to two months earlier. According to economists, the weakening of demand is one of the reasons why the monetary policy committee chose to ignore inflationary pressures arising out of the surge in global commodities prices. According to the RBI, inflation becomes sustained only if it is backed by demand. RBI has pointed out that household spending has weakened in the latest survey round with even essential spending showing signs of moderation while non-essential spending continues to contract. While 71% of the respondents had said that spending on essentials had gone up in March 2021, only 63% saw increased spending in May. RBI conducted its consumer confidence survey from April 29 to May 10 in 13 major cities –– Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Patna, and Thiruvananthapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/second-wave-of-covid-turns-indian-consumers-pessimistic/articleshow/83272754.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Date extended after only 45% schools file info on RTE kids||JAIPUR: Considering the fact that only 17,000 out of 38,000 (44.73%) private schools in the state have filled up information regarding online classes they have provided to RTE students, Directorate of Secondary Education, Bikaner has extended the last date of filing to June 8. Private schools in Rajasthan, who have claimed dues for Right to Education (RTE), have been asked by the government to provide information regarding the medium through which they have provided online classes to the students for 2020-21 session and also to give phone numbers of students for verification. According to sources, many schools have allegedly given false information. Some private schools have given fake numbers, filled same number for the entire class, some schools of same city have filled up same numbers and some have even claimed that they provided personal classes to students, a claim which was found to be false due to pandemic. Around Rs 400 crore is spent every year on RTE students by the government. Schools said that for the last two years the money was not cleared. Since March 2020, primary schools have remained closed and classes in majority of the private schools have not been held. So the department is now asking for proof. The directorate said that if the numbers are found to be false during verification, the school will not get any money under RTE from the government. Director of secondary education Sourabh Swami said, “We have received applications and verification is on. If classes were conducted, verification will confirm it. The claim of any school found not to be giving any online classes to students will be re-considered.” Association of private schools of Rajasthan, School Shiksha Pariwar president Anil Sharma said that if any school has given false information, then action should be taken against them. “Some schools may have done that, but we cannot blame the remaining thousands of schools for that. If any school has done it, action should be taken against them. But claims of other schools must be cleared,” Sharma said. The process of RTE for 2021-22 session has been postponed due to the ongoing pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/date-extended-after-only-45-schools-file-info-on-rte-kids/articleshow/83267323.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||2nd wave hits Haryana hard: 58 deaths daily for 95 days||Chandigarh: Haryana reported 4,89,964 new Covid-19 cases and 5,555 deaths in 95 days of the second wave, with an average of 58 deaths and 517 cases daily. If the first wave of Covid took the authorities by storm, the second wave came with more complications, like mucormycosis, especially in May. Till June 4, the deadly disease had infected 1,056 patients in 17 districts and claimed 91 lives. Shortage of medicines, beds and ventilators among others kept the health authorities on tenterhooks during the second wave of Covid and the toll in three months has been more than 150% than during nearly 12 months of the first wave of the pandemic. According to health authorities, when the second wave began on March 1, the state recorded 166 new cases and two deaths. Thereafter began the upward trend and by May 15, the daily count reached even 15,700. However, the slide has set in and the state reported 895 fresh cases and 71 deaths on Friday (June 4). During the second wave, even the rural belts were affected, with mysterious deaths being reported, especially in Jind, Hisar, Sirsa, Bhiwani and Rohtak districts. As the opposition levelled charges of lack of preparedness on the government, the Haryana government began special scanning of villages from May 15. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar coordinated with the team led by additional chief secretary (health-cum-home) Rajeev Arora , additional principal secretary Dr Amit Aggarwal and health experts and officials involved in system of tracking, tracing and treatment. The chief minister had said that the number of cases would come down from May 20, but the slide began well ahead of time. “We cannot give credit to a single person or organisation for flattening the wave. The entire state, including medicos, para medicos and nursing staff gave their best during this period,” said Khattar. Having dealt with two Covid waves, the health authorities are now gearing up for the third anticipated wave which is expected to affect the children and youth. Lack of infrastructure, staff shortage As cases mounted, health authorities grappled with a shortage of oxygen beds, medical oxygen, ventilators and BiPAP machines and ICUs. Shortage of oxygen kept the health authorities on tenterhooks between April last week and May first week, as fatalities were reported in Faridabad, Rewari, Rohtak and Hisar districts of the state. Till April 16, Haryana did not even have oxygen allocation quota and the health authorities calculated a requirement of 60MT against actual requirement of 300MT during peak days. The shortage did not only trigger black marketing of medical oxygen cylinders but also made Khattar and his team to put in place its own system of procurement and supply of oxygen, oxygen beds, ventilators and ICU beds. DRDO was enlisted for providing back-up support to the state after private hospitals got embroiled in overcharging controversies. Black marketing of medicines, oximeters The second wave triggered panic buying, stocking and hoarding of essential medicines like remdesivir, tocilizumab and amphotericin-B, while rates of Covid essentials like thermal scanners, oximeters, oxygen concentrators and emergency cylinders shot up even as suppliers ran out of stock and hoarders stocked up. TOI had busted one such racket in Hisar. In the black market, an oximeter was available for Rs 1,400 per piece when the market rate is generally Rs 250 to Rs 300. Oxygen concentrators, BiPAP machines were available at a rent of Rs 25,000 to 40,000 per week. Police arrested 76 persons and registered over 70 cases in this connection. Haryana government too arranged over 1 lakh oximeters through local purchase, CSR and donations from general public Farmers agitation blamed for spike Unlike first wave, the impact of second Covid wave was felt more in rural areas, including farmers. As more farmers were infected at Shahjahanpur-Khera borders of Haryana-Rajasthan border, the BJP-JJP alliance government in the state blamed protesting farmers for the spread of Covid in rural belts. Even Haryana health minister Anil Vij claimed that cases in rural belts were due to protesting farmer frequenting the Delhi borders. These charges have been trashed by opposition leader and former CM Bhupinder Hooda and farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni. “Had it been the case, then why was not a single person infected during the last Covid wave? All this is being said just to derail the farmers’ protest,” said Charuni. Lockdown: ‘Mahamari Alert-Surakshit Haryana’ While the first 15 days of May saw a lockdown in the state, restrictions continued even in the second fortnight of the month. The measures led to flattening of the wave, according to government claims. However, other measures like increased testing and vaccination also helped. Till June 4, 92.19 lakh people had been tested and 59.52 lakh vaccinated in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2nd-wave-hits-haryana-hard-58-deaths-daily-for-95-days/articleshow/83268061.cms||Manvir Saini

This time it is about not filling artificial waterholes meant for wildlife.In a complaint, wildlife lover Sheikh Munna Sheikh, president, Sarpamitra Nisarga Savwardhan Bahuuddeshiya Sanstha, Akola, released pictures of four dry waterholes in Mahan beat under Barshitakli forest range. “Pictures of these waterholes were taken on May 30 evening in compartment no. 398 with GPS locations. Even as summer is at its peak, not a single waterhole was filled, tus spelling doom for wild animals,” said Munna.“With the arrival of monsoon, these waterholes will be filled naturally. A nexus between staff and contractor cannot be ruled out to claim fake bills towards wages and filling these waterholes by tankers,” said Munna.“This is also one of the reasons why wild animals turn towards cities in search of water and end up causing conflict,” he said.Akola deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Arjuna KR said, “We have been supplying water during the summer season to meet the requirement of wildlife in these waterholes. However, due to a lack of funds, we are unable to maintain waterholes daily. We have not yet released the bills of the contractor.”“Despite Covid-19 restrictions, we are trying to ensure that water is available in these waterholes,” he said. The official also released a picture of a tanker filling waterhole on April 13, 2021, in Mahan beat.Munna countered the official claims. “On May 26, it was Buddha Pournima when the staff is supposed to monitor animals approaching these waterholes. If these waterholes are being filled regularly, why there is not a single drop of water?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/waterholes-go-dry-in-akola-forest-wildlife-lover-smells-a-rat/articleshow/83268050.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Chief minister M K Stalin, while announcing the extension of the statewide shutdown, allowed shops selling essential commodities to reopen and government offices to resume work with 30% staff. Though Covid-19 cases have fallen in several districts, in Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Tirupur, Erode, Salem, Karur, Namakkal, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts, the pandemic has not been brought under control, the government said. Certain relaxations, however, are extended to these districts too to address the essential requirements of people, Stalin said in a statement. Activities permitted so far, including sale of vegetables and fruits in mobile vehicles, will continue in all districts, the statement said. Tasmac outlets, tea shops, standalone shops other than those selling groceries, vegetables and fruits, commercial malls, textile and jewellery showrooms and cinema theatres will remain closed. No activity will be permitted in containment zones across the state. Orders have been issued to Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner and respective district collectors to strictly enforce Covid management directives, including wearing of face masks and social distancing, chief secretary Irai Anbu said. Curbs on public and private bus transport and metro rail will continue. Take away services will continue to be permitted in restaurants, hotels, bakeries and mess between 6am to 10am, 12 noon to 3pm and 6pm to 9pm. Staff working in private organisations and IT/ITES companies must work from home. All government offices can function with 30% workforce across the state and sub-registrar offices can issue 50% tokens a day for registrations, the order said. “Passengers with e-registration shall be permitted in rental vehicles, taxis and autos. Taxis will be permitted with three passengers apart from driver, and autos will be permitted with two passengers,” the order said. Travelling to The Nilgiris, Kodaikanal, Yercaud, Yelagiri and Courtallam for emergency reasons will be permitted after getting e-pass from the respective district collectors. Inter-state and inter-district travel in case of individuals allowed for medical emergencies/funeral/last rites with e-registration, while intra-district travel for the same reasons is allowed without e-registration. While continuous process industries and industries manufacturing essential commodities can continue to operate, export units that have export commitments or orders and their vendor units providing inputs to such industries in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Salem, Karur, Erode, Namakkal, Trichy and Madurai can function with 10% workforce for export related work and to send samples. Earlier, it had allowed such units to function with 50% workforce in the rest of the districts. “I appeal to people to go by walking to get provisions and avoid using two-wheeler and four-wheeler. People should avoid stepping out unnecessarily,” Stalin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lockdown-in-tn-till-june-14-curbs-eased/articleshow/83267319.cms||---
---||Agra||Not a single patient received free Covid treatment under Ayushman Bharat scheme in Agra dist||Agra: In the last 15 months, over 25,500 people tested Covid-19 positive in Agra district. Out of these, not a single patient received free-of-cost treatment under the Centre’s flagship Ayushman Bharat scheme. Testing and treatment for Covid-19 was made available free of cost for the Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries at private laboratories and empanelled hospitals across the country in March 2020. Nodal officer of Ayushman Bharat scheme in Agra district, Dr PK Sharma, said, “So far, no bill from any private hospital for treatment of a Covid-19 patient under the Ayushman Bharat scheme has come for approval. However, several patients suffering from other diseases have availed benefit under the scheme during the pandemic period.” Health department records show while none of the Covid-19 patients received the benefit of the Ayushman Bharat scheme, 12 patients suffering other health issues benefited under the scheme from March 2020 to May 2021. There are around 1.72 lakh families having Ayushman Bharat golden cards in Agra and around 8.77 lakh people are eligible for free access to healthcare services.A total of 64 hospitals, including 42 private centres, are empanelled for cashless treatment under the scheme. The central government scheme is aimed to provide affordable healthcare in the form of tertiary hospital treatment to the poor and the vulnerable though a health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year. The first case of Covid-19 was detected in Agra district on March 1, 2020. In the last 15 months till Saturday, 25,671 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the district. A total of 425 Covid-19 patients died during treatment. A 40-year-old resident of Devri road, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “My father tested Covid-19 positive on April 27 and suffered breathlessness. Following reports of mismanagement at government centres and for better treatment, we had taken him to a private hospital located on NH2, which was a dedicated Covid treatment centre. When we showed our Ayushman Bharat golden card, the hospital refused to admit the patient. Later, we had to pay a bill of Rs 2.2 lakh for my father’s treatment.” Chief medical officer Dr RC Pandey said, “So far, we have not received any formal complaint regarding any Covid-19 patient covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme turned away by a private hospital or charged for treatment. Suitable action will be taken against the hospital in case of any complaint.”Senior pediatric surgeon Dr Sanjay Kulshrestha said, “The Ayushman Bharat scheme is suffering from negligence of the health department. Poor beneficiaries of the scheme are turned away by private hospitals. The health department has not developed any mechanism in the districts, like issuing a helpline number, to address complaints of patients. Besides, state authorities need to proactively check the implementation of the scheme. The beneficial scheme of the central government is getting wasted on a large scale.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/not-a-single-patient-received-free-covid-treatment-under-ayushman-bharat-scheme-in-agra-dist/articleshow/83266569.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Mumbai slipped to Level 3 by thin margin of .6%||MUMBAI: Among the worst hotspots in the country during both the Covid-19 waves, Mumbai stabilised in May, but clearly not enough for shops and restaurants to keep regular hours. The city falls in Level 3 as per the five-point system employed by the state government to relax restrictions. Malls and theatres will remain shut, and restaurants can operate up to 4 pm, and that too at 50% capacity to ensure social distancing norms are observed. Many had expected Mumbai, which has been recording a test positivity rate of less than 5% in June so far, to get into Level 2, which would allow shops, both essential and non-essential, to remain open through the day and a wider group of people to travel by the local trains. The reason for Mumbai’s continued vigil is spelt out clearly in the state criteria. Districts and corporation areas that have a weekly test positivity rate of less than 5% or oxygen bed occupancy of more than 40% fall in Level 3. Mumbai in the May 28-June 3 week had a test positivity rate of 5.56% (to round it off, 5.6%) and occupancy rate of 32.51% for oxygen beds. As any one of these two criteria can be used to dock the city or district into the Level 3 category, the state authorities have just done that. “It is better to gradually acclimatize to the opening-up process,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “Mumbai will be forced to go in for a gradual relaxation of norms,” he added. As per the state rules, a regular review of the criteria will be conducted to assess whether a district can move from, say, Level 3 to Level 2. Mumbai could in the next week or two get more relaxed norms. State chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said that the public health department will release state-level data for oxygen bed occupancy and district-level data for positivity rate and bed occupancy every Thursday. “In case a district has to be upgraded or downgraded to a level with fewer restrictions or higher restrictions, an analysis of a two-week moving average data and a clear trend has to be reflected and then a decision can be taken,” Kunte said. “But that is when the problems could begin for a city such as Mumbai. Overcrowding and congestion, and failure of people to wear a face mask or maintain social distancing, could lead to a rise in infection levels,” said a senior doctor at a civic hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-slipped-to-level-3-by-thin-margin-of-6/articleshow/83270286.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Hyderabad||Second Covid wave 6 times severe in terms of oxygen need||HYDERABAD: Demystifying the impact of second wave of Covid-19 that had put an unprecedented pressure on the medical and health infrastructure, researchers have found that while only 15% of Covid-19 patients had suffered from shortness of breath in the first wave, a huge 80% of patients required oxygen supplies in wave II. This, in other words, means that there was six times higher demand for oxygen in wave II. The average age group of those affected most was 37.1 years in wave I when compared with 50.5 years in wave II. While acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was reported in only 6.4% of patients admitted to hospitals in wave I, it went up to 48.7% during wave II. Admission to ICUs was limited to a mere 12% in wave I, whereas it touched 56.4% in wave II, according to a research study by AIIMS Rishikesh. The study, primarily based on AIIMS Rishikesh data, gives an insight into wave II in other places too as it helps epidemiologists in planning for the assumed wave III. The study revealed there was higher proportion of increased age, oxygen requirement, ventilator requirement, ICU admission and organ impairment among the admitted Covid-19 cases. According to the study published in the pre-print server ‘MedRxiv’ on June 4, the measured case fatality rate was 29% in wave II, while it was 9.6% in wave I. The proportion of patients requiring oxygen was 81.8% in wave II, while it was 11.2% in wave I. Similarly, the CT severity score in wave II was higher than wave I. The study said a higher proportion of patients required oxygen, high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, ICU and high dependency unit admissions in wave II when compared to wave I. Covid-19 mortality was also higher in wave II than wave I. The percentage of severe cases during wave I was 37.5%, while it went up to 70.2% in wave II. “We also found that hospitals in wave II are utilising various novel therapies like Remdesivir (11.3% as against almost nil in wave I) and steroids (72.1% versus 4% in wave I) in higher frequencies as compared with wave I. This has associated complications too like high blood sugar levels in 14% of patients as against 9.6% in wave I and dreaded mucormycosis,” the study warned. The research team comprised Mayank Kapoor, Budha O Singh, Prasan Kumar Panda, Pathik Dhanger and Anant Kataria from the department of internal medicine (infectious diseases division), AIIMS Rishikesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2nd-wave-6-times-severe-in-terms-of-o2-need/articleshow/83268068.cms||Syed Akbar

Banas Dairy officials organized a symbolic tree plantation drive in each taluka of the Banaskantha district and promised to plant one crore saplings during the monsoon season. A function was held under the aegis of Banas Dairy and Galbabhai Nanjibhai Patel Charitable Trust. “Since the last four years people of Banaskantha have been participating in the tree plantation drive. Today we reaffirm our commitment to keep working towards the cause. We are aware that one tree is equivalent to one oxygen plant. The plant that produces oxygen in its entire life is much less than what a tree produces in its lifetime,” said Shankarbhai Chaudhary, chairman of Banas Dairy. Earlier, Chaudhary launched the World Environment Day event from Dantiwada taluka’s Uttampura Angiya village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/banas-dairy-to-plant-1-crore-trees-in-coming-monsoon/articleshow/83266664.cms||---

The pact has been signed with an aim to sensitise school students towards environment protection. Tata Steel vice-president (corporate services) Chankya Choudhary said the project has successfully started building a generation of environment conscious warriors who would conserve and protect the biodiversity and treasures of nature. “It is necessary not only to educate the young generation but also empower them with the right opportunities and tools,” he added. An official communication by the steel major said more than 1,050 birds’ nests and 1,200 bird feeders were prepared and installed at different places by students in their locality in West Bokaro and Jharia. The statement said, “To inculcate the habits of plant conservation and to develop the student’s affection towards plants, students collected the seeds of various fruits and vegetables and formed 270 seed collection banks. These seeds were planted in kitchen gardens or distributed to others with a request to take care of the plants. Students from Joda and Noamundi created 300 herbal and 42 medicinal gardens and prepared more than 3,000 paper and cloth bags which were distributed among the community people to spread awareness against the use of plastic bags.” While St. Mary’s School, Jajpur, Odisha was the best performing school and won the ‘Green School Rolling Trophy’ for the year-long activities, Tata DAV Public School, Ghatotand, West Bokaro, was adjudged as the second best performing school for the year 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tata-steel-foundation-signs-mou-with-teri-for-green-school-project/articleshow/83267531.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Covid spread in Jharkhand’s rural areas negligible||Ranchi: The spread of Covid-19 in Jharkhand’s rural areas has been negligible during the ongoing second wave contrary to the fears that the virus has made inroads into the remote places infecting scores of villagers, a state government survey has found. The Intensive Public Health Survey (IPHS) of the health department ended on Saturday and was carried out from May 25 using Rapid Antigen Test kits. The virus had wreaked havoc in the state throughout April with the daily average cases being reported in four-digit figures (new cases) and triple-digit figures (deaths). The majority of the hospitals in the state’s urban centres virtually ran out of beds, triggering fears of a rapid spread of the virus in the rural areas. Concerned over the situation, the government rolled out a mega door-to-door health survey in the rural areas coupled with rapid antigen testing for early detection and treatment. However, the figures available from the IPHS has revealed that out of 1,86,509 people identified as suspects, only 920 have turned positive till June 4. Of the total positive cases, about 35 are kids under the age of 18. In terms of positivity rate, it is only about 0.5%. According to the 2011 socio-economic survey, Jharkhand has about 52 lakh families in villages and the IPHS data suggest that till June 4, the field teams scanned 49,12,479 families of which 2,44,10,412 people were tested. Of these, 15,692 people were found with TB, 1.11 lakh with sugar levels on the higher side and 1.13 lakh people with high or low blood pressure. The Covid-19 infection remained negligible. “The IPHS has certainly come as a great relief for the state government as the positive rate has been very low contrary to our earlier fears,” the nodal officer of health departments IEC wing, Siddhart Tripathi, told TOI. He added that during the initial days of the outbreak of the second wave, the health department and the state government were very concerned about the rural areas as the majority of the population lives there. The state government was hard-pressed to provide sufficient medical facilities in these areas. “But on directions of chief minister Hemant Soren, the state went ahead to scan every person in the rural areas and to our disbelief but for the greater good now, we can conclusively say that the virus hasn’t hit the hinterlands, at least in our state,” Tripathi said. He added that before the launch of the door-to-door survey, the department had set up 464 Covid care centres to serve as the first point of medical response, anticipating a surge in the number of patients. “But only nine persons were required to be referred to the Covid care centres. The rest of the confirmed cases were with mild infection or remained asymptomatic and are managed with home isolation,” he said. Even though the Union government has prescribed RAT for mass testing, its results are always questionable compared to RT-PCR or NAT testing. Tripathi, however, maintained that many of those who tested negative in RAT were also scanned with other modes of testing but remained negative. “Even if we were to consider the positive rate by all three modes of testing methods, we don’t find the situation alarming or concerning in rural areas now,” he said, adding that as part of preparations, the health department is now working on setting up additional NAT testing machines in 16 high prevalent districts soon. “In addition to government and private RT-PCR labs, we have 222 TruNat testing machines in all districts. The health department is now in the process of installing more machines in 16 select districts on a priority basis as part of advance planning to prevent any surge in future by better testing and tracking,” he said. Jogesh Gambhir, owner of a city-based private healthcare centre —Raj Hospital — and president of the Association of Healthcare Providers in India (APHI), agreed that the virus has perhaps been contained well in rural areas given the dip in daily cases. He, however, added that the real impact will be known in another fortnight after the recent relaxations. “If the hospitals aren’t flooded with cases from rural areas, this means the virus may have lost its intensity. Going by this yardstick, the findings of IPHS survey looks appropriate. But we will have to wait for a few weeks to actually know the situation as the unlocking has begun,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-spread-in-jharkhands-rural-areas-negligible/articleshow/83267544.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Goa||Goa: Antigen testing centre at Malbhat||MARGAO: A free Covid antigen testing centre has been started at Malbhat, Margao. Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, who claimed credit for opening the centre, said the facility will operate from 9am to 5pm, including on Sundays, and that results will be made available to patients in 15 to 20 minutes. The centre is headed by Dr Vinella Gomes who is assisted by four nurses. Kamat, on Saturday, thanked chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane for “granting permission for the centre which will help in controlling the likely third wave.” He advised the government to “be ready” to start RT-PCR testing at this centre “in case the need arises.” “I really appreciate the efforts of the South Goa collector and the health department to quickly respond to my request and start an antigen Covid testing centre at Malbhat. I also thank Dr Gomes and her team for attending to patients from Saturday,” Kamat said. In stark contrast to the vaccination camp that was inaugurated in Margao recently, the testing centre was launched without a formal programme. The recent vaccination drives in Fatorda witnessed politics being played over the pandemic by political leaders and their supporters. A verbal duel broke out between supporters of Kamat and BJP workers on the last day of the Tika Utsav held in Margao, seemingly over claiming credit for organising the camp. Earlier, a political slugfest had ensued between Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai and BJP general secretary Damodar Naik over the issue of non-Goans being vaccinated at the Margao urban health centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/antigen-testing-centre-at-malbhat/articleshow/83268159.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Bullet train: Bids invited for Vadodara corridor||VADODARA: The National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHSRCL), which is implementing the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project, has invited bids for around 8.2 km stretch of the high-speed rail (HSR) corridor in Vadodara. The bids have been invited for the C-5 civil package. It includes design and construction of civil and building works including testing and commissioning for double line HSR involving Vadodara HSR station, confirmation car base, viaducts and bridges, crossing bridges and associated works. It is worth mentioning here that alignment of the HSR in Vadodara has been changed. NHSRCL has saved at least Rs 2,000 crore with re-alignment of HSR corridor in Vadodara. The earlier plan was to construct HSR station by dismantling the existing platform number six of Vadodara railway station. After re-alignment, the HSR station of the bullet train project will now come up at platform number seven of the railway station. The initial survey for HSR alignment was done in early 2017. In Vadodara station area, the HSR alignment was designed to cross the yard from east to west near the platform area where almost 13 railway lines were to be crossed. The bridge span was proposed to cross the railway tracks from west to east. But the site was coming in the red colour coded zoning map (CCZM) zone – the flight path of the aircrafts coming in and out to the Vadodara airport which required clearance of air space from the Airport Authority of India (AAI). For launch of the girders, all the flight movements needed to be cancelled which was not approved by the AAI. The proposed location of HSR is now in front of the central and local bus depot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bids-for-vadodara-corridor-of-bullet-train-project-invited/articleshow/83266484.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: On World Environment Day, many pledge to save ecology||RANCHI: Celebrating the World Environment Day, the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) organised two online sessions through Facebook live sessions to raise public awareness on healing the environment and deliberating on far-sighted and proven solutions of ecological restoration to make the planet more healthy and sustainable. The two sessions — ‘Regenerating Ecosystems for a Sustainable Future’ and ‘Ecosystem Regeneration through Energy Efficiency’ — were aligned with the official theme, ‘Ecological Restoration’, of the World Environment Day. The United Nations has also designated 2021-2030 as the decade for ‘ecosystem restoration’ and over 70 countries, including India, around the world have pledged to bring 350 million hectares of the deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2030. Drawing attention on forging a collective effort to restore our ecology in the session, ‘Regenerating Ecosystems for a Sustainable Future’, Padma Shri Ravindra Kumar Sinha, who is the vice-chancellor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (Jammu) and also popularly known as ‘Dolphin Man of India’, said, “There is a greater need to rejuvenate our ecological systems through sustainable means for preserving the natural resources and protecting aquatic life and wildlife, which are on the verge of extinction.” Ashwani Ashok, head of renewable energy at CEED, said, “There is enough scientific evidence to suggest that indiscriminate use of natural resources and over-dependence on fossil fuel-based development have a debilitating impact on our social and economic lives. Recovery of our earth’s ecosystem is crucial to support the livelihood of millions of people and bring in a new era of sustainability.” The second session revolved around a carbon-neutral world through technological innovations. Meanwhile, different programmes on plantation and webinars were also held across the state to observe the day. Chief minister Hemant Soren planted a sapling at his official residence to mark the day and appealed to people to save and conserve the environment. In Muri, Hindalco observed the day with quiz, drawing and slogan competitions. Unit head of Hindalco (Muri plant), N N Roy, stressed on numerous aspects for restoration of the environment through plantation while keeping the water and air clean among others. “Our unit has taken several initiatives to keep this plant environment-friendly and make the unit greener, stronger and smarter,” he said. At Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) headquarters in Ranchi, several programmes were held. Dignitaries hoisted the ‘Environment Flag’ and took an oath to preserve the environment and protect biodiversity. “CCL is continually striving towards sustainable mining and environment conservation. Eco parks are being established in the various operational areas of the company and widespread aforestation is being carried,” the PSU said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/on-world-environment-day-many-pledge-to-save-ecology/articleshow/83268399.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Post-Covid mental health issues on rise||Ranchi: Things changed for Siddhant Kumar (30) a young businessman, who loved socializing, after he and his family members gradually recovered from Covid. He stopped talking to people around him and spent most of the time in seclusion. He identified that things were not usual and normal with him and decided to contact Dr Siddhartha Sinha, senior consultant at Ranchi Institute of Neuro Psychiatry and Allied Sciences (Rinpas). Siddhant is not a lone case as many others are going through a similar situation even after recovering from the viral disease. In this particular case, Siddhant had lost his close family members, spent days in anxiety when his paralytic father and co-morbid mother developed Covid symptoms and himself got admitted to the hospital following cytokine storm. Mental health experts believe that although every case and personal experience of patients are different, issues associated with Covid are taking a toll on the mental health of those who have encountered the virus. “There is no study to prove that Covid has direct impact on mental health but the kind of challenges people are facing, it obviously triggers anxiety, depression, panic attack and even suicidal tendencies at times,” said Dr Nishant Goyal, assistant professor of psychiatry at the Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP). Ruling out the issue of brain fogging, which is being associated with Covid, Goyal said it has no medical explanation but is related to anxiety. Acknowledging rising cases of mental health even during the first wave, CIP launched several helpline numbers in association with the district administration to cater to patients. Although the footfall at the OPDs of both CIP and Rinpas has reduced because of movement restrictions and lockdowns, the helpline numbers remain busy all through the day. “We receive around 100 calls every day on the helplines but it is difficult to identify how many of them are related to post-Covid complications,” Goyal said while adding that around 40% of the calls that he personally attends are related to Covid. The state mental health authority (SMHA), which decided to constitute a tele-psychotherapy committee at Rinpas back in December 2019, also underlined the need for tele-counselling at this point of time. The committee that was ultimately constituted on April 3 this year is still to float a helpline number though. Dr Sinha, who is also a member of the committee, admitted that Covid-related anxiety has precipitated into psychotic conditions in some individuals. “Isolation, social ostracisation, fear of complications and uncertainty of medical attention because of lack of beds and facilities coupled with financial constrains have affected a large population,” he said. “Anxiety often leads to severe clinical conditions like panic attacks and suicidal tendencies,” Sinha said, adding many people turn up to cardiologists as they experience palpitations, cold sweats and uneasiness. Admitting that awareness about seeking medical help from experts is still low, Sinha said personal counselling and medication at times can help to a great extent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/post-covid-mental-health-issues-on-rise/articleshow/83268453.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Chandigarh||Salute to empowered citizen warriors in times of pandemic: Lt Gen K J Singh (retd)||As India limps back to a semblance of normalcy, some heartwarming stories shine through the pall of gloom and despair. Three examples of administrators readily come to mind: Iqbal Singh Chahal in Mumbai, Gagandeep Singh Bedi in Chennai, and Dr Rajendra Bharud in Nandurbar, who decided to take responsibility and discover their legacy. In Army parlance, they chose to be COs and ‘Tigers’ of their domains. Mantra in LBS Academy has to be: “Each DC to be Tiger”. The challenge, of course, is whether politicians will allow them space? The sheer magnitude of the endeavours by selfless Covid yodhas (warriors) requires many more columns to document them. Stories of oxygen langars, gold donations for medical facilities, and such initiatives keep up the flagging faith. For the present, a collective reverent salute to them will be in order. It will be most appropriate to objectively introspect our priorities: do we need more statues and religious shrines? Or should we first fix health, skill-building, and education? It was indeed heartwarming when after the tsunami on December 26, 2004, the then Indian PM announced that India will not accept foreign aid for disaster relief. The statement was an affirmative articulation of intent to be a net provider of security and disaster relief, in regional context. It specifically resonated with our generation because we had observed compulsory, weekly ‘skip a meal fast’, at an impressionable and tender age of 10 years. It was former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri’s call, as the nation was facing a food grain crisis and was literally on ‘ship to mouth’ existence. As aid once again pours in from all over, it is a stark and rude reality check. It is ironic that statement post-tsunami was made by probably one of the humblest PMs. This assertion was followed by a quest for the UN Security Council seat, dalliance with groupings like BRICS and often punching much above our weight class. Primarily, fuelled by our own unscientific ‘jugaads’, more importantly, hope and wishful thinking, substituting for policy and strategy. Event management and acronyms have distracted us from meaningful hard work. While families desperately searched for beds, oxygen, and even decent last rites, we saw the most distressing exposure of profiteering and shameless racketeering. Who are they and why do they survive? Most are so-called ‘fixers’, propped up by our politicians and their ilk. Can a nation aspiring to be ‘Vishwa Guru’ (world leader) allow such corruption and degeneration of our moral DNA? Will they ever be fixed? Not till every Indian decides to be ‘Jagruk Hindustani’, or conscious and responsible Indian. Zero tolerance and social ostracizing of profiteers is the way forward. Post-mortem of the government is warranted, but more important is introspection and collective audit by RWAs (resident welfare associations) and panchayats to rebuild our social capital. Spiritual gurus should resurface and tamper their teachings with good science, evidence-based inquiry, and social service. Time to be ‘Karma Yogis’. The concept of citizen warriors got highlighted in our fight to defeat Pakistan’s design to spread the arc of terrorism from LoC, beyond Akhnoor to stretch till Gurdaspur, on Punjab border. The diabolic plot is to include districts of Jammu, Kathua, and Samba (in the former state of Jammu and Kashmir). Pakistan chooses to classify this settled stretch of 193km of the International Border (IB), as a working boundary on the pretext that the entire erstwhile state of J&K is unsettled. This riverine corridor with a shallow depth of 12-20 km provides avenues for infiltration and high visibility target on NH, linking Kashmir to the mainland. Multiple streams with tall grass and tunnels are a nightmare scenario for a counter-infiltration grid. All this while, logical suggestion to shift focus to depth lateral of Dhar-Udhampur languishes. It will be interesting to watch the alignment of new Delhi-Amritsar-Katra highway. Will it avoid vulnerable corridor, or spirituality and lobbies will override strategy and geography? Pakistan has orchestrated multiple attacks against security establishments in Samba, Sanjuwan, Janglot, and Kathua in this stretch. Infiltration has also transgressed into the IB sector with attacks on Dinanagar and Pathankot. The hero of this story is a simple carpenter, code named ‘AK’ from a border village just 8km from IB. He saw three suspicious-looking strangers sitting near a culvert during his early morning milk delivery routine. While most will avoid such situations, AK went to the nearest Territorial Army unit and volunteered to guide them on his bike. This resulted in a fierce encounter at Arnia on November 26 and 27, 2014, and neutralization of four dreaded terrorists, headed for Samba, for greater mayhem. AK, a true CW (or nagrik yodha), is now in uniform. This action inspired initiatives like WhatsApp group of sarpanches to report such activities to security grid. Another vigilant railway employee averted an accident by diverting a train when he discovered that track had been tampered with by terrorists, who later attacked Dinanagar police station. Both AK and the railway employee earned well-deserved Army Commander’s Commendation. It will be appropriate to flag another story, of a soldier from the RR battalion, on leave near Samba. NCO, while collecting sweets for a relative’s wedding in early morning, gave a lift to two terrorists, in his van. He did report but only in the evening, giving time to terrorists to go into the safe hideout. These terrorists, part of a group that attacked Rajbagh police station in Kathua, later targeted Samba military station, next day. The bottom line is one doesn’t need a uniform to be a citizen warrior. The mandatory caution is in order. Such initiatives are complementary to law enforcement and not an excuse to form vigilante groups like anti-Romeo squads. The challenge is not to transgress, the thin line between the two. ‘Hosh’ in all cases has to override misplaced ‘Josh’.

With this, Nagpur zilla parishad will become the first in the country to implement this technique in rural and tribal areas. The decision was taken in a meeting held between minister of animal husbandry and dairy development Sunil Kedar and administrative officials on Saturday. Developed by Neeri scientist Krishna Khairnar and approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the technique uses simple method of gargling to take RT-PCR samples. “It was very unfortunate to witness a large number of people dying of Covid-19 in villages during the second wave. It is challenging to collect samples from villages and tribal areas as trained healthcare professional and special infrastructure is not available. The saline gargle technique allows collecting samples without the need of trained health care professionals. The requirements too are basic,” said Rashmi Barve, the ZP president. Adding that the technique will prove to be a game-changer for rural areas, Barve said, “Testing is a most important aspect for mitigating COVID-19 pandemic. The one-step RNA extraction method also speeds up the analysis of samples and provides quick results. As a president, I wish to ensure that we are well prepared for third wave in advance, so that precious lives can be saved.” In Nagpur, the technique was first implemented at the Regional Police Training School over a week back by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) which became the country’s first civic body to implement it for RT-PCR testing. Now, the civic body is carrying out trials at other collection centres too. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “A trial run was held at a collection centre at Satranjipura. On Sunday, Hanuman Nagar and Dhantoli centres too will do the same. Samples will be sent to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) , Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS). After checking the results, we will take a call on further implementation.” While the commercial manufacturing of sample collection kits has started, the Neeri-designed one-step RNA extraction buffer substance is awaiting the approval of Drugs Controller General of India. “Till the manufacturing of the buffer begins, laboratories have an option to test the gargling samples using the existing RNA extraction kits. The other option will be to use the special buffer medium in which collected sample is mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and then heated for six minutes at 98 degree Celsius,” said officials. As reported by TOI earlier, the latter method will be faster and cost-effective compared to the existing RNA extraction process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/zp-to-ring-in-covid-testing-by-gargling-samples/articleshow/83269342.cms||Manka Behl

Director DR Bhagat has asked schools from the primary to the higher secondary level, including special schools, to provide the details by June 7. “Due to the sudden rise in Covid-19 cases recently, many children have been orphaned or have lost either of the parent due to the pandemic. The service providers might find it challenging to support children in institutions with psychosocial and mental health care needs, on these lines, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, New Delhi, have asked the department to submit the information, to be uploaded on the ‘Baal Swaraj Portal’,” said Bhagat. Officials said that the directorate of woman and child development is working with the education department to gather and upload the details on the central portal. The Bal Swaraj portal has been created with the purpose of tracking and monitoring children who need care and protection in real-time, digitally. The portal aims at tracking the children right from their production before the Child Welfare Committee, to their restoration to their parent, guardian, or relative, and the subsequent follow-up. The Commission will be able to get information about whether the child is getting his/her entitlements, benefits, and entitled monetary gains, through the data filled in the portal by the district officers and state officers for each child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/schools-asked-to-provide-details-of-kids-orphaned-due-to-covid/articleshow/83268279.cms||---

BJP saw a pattern in the move that comes close after a controversy over the “manipulated media tag” being attached to the “toolkit” tweets of several party leaders when they attacked Congress for tarnishing the image of PM Narendra Modi and India. Soon after Bhagwat’s account was de-badged, RSS member Rajiv Tuli tweeted, “As we are discussing the removal of blue tick from these three accounts, @DrMohanBhagwat’ s verification was also removed. This digital imperialism can’t be tolerated.” Twitter dropped the verified blue tick from the account of Bhagwat, RSS joint general secretaries Krishna Gopal and Arun Kumar, “sampark pramukh” Anirudh Deshpande and ex-general secretary Suresh ‘Bhaiyyaji’ Joshi. “You misuse neutral platform regulations with blatant partisanship. You refuse to abide by our laws. You are a foreign entity openly indulging in domestic political activism. What next?” said BJP national VP Baijyant Jay Panda. Right wing handles pointed to several verified accounts which were present on Twitter months after demise of users, including ex-President Pranab Mukherjee, Congress member Ahmed Patel and actor Irrfan Khan. There was no tweet from the account of Ahmed Patel for the past eight months. His daughter Mumtaz Patel updated the account name as “Ahmed Patel Memorial”, saying, “After he passed away, as his daughter I log into his account to archive tributes tagging him.” Last tweet from Irrfan’s account was on May 1 last year when family used it to share their grief with fans after the actor passed away. “Twitter is behaving like East India Company. Making profits from us but simultaneously supporting Bharat todo (break India) gangs challenging law of the land! It removes blue tick of nationalists but allows it to violators?” said VHP member Vinod Bansal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vhp-twitter-behaving-like-east-india-company/articleshow/83272862.cms||Akhilesh Singh

The GCET is held for entry to engineering and pharmacy degree programmes seats available in Goa. “GCET-2021, earlier scheduled to be conducted on June 15 and 16 is deferred. However, the dates shall be confirmed at least 10 days prior to the exam. The procedure and schedule of acceptance of application forms shall be notified on the DTE website by June 20,” the directorate of technical education has said. The schedule of subsequent activities related to admissions, like the admission rounds, shall be notified after conduct of GCET-2021, the DTE said. Around 3,000 students appear for GCET in Goa, each year. GCET is normally conducted in early May, each year. However, due to the pandemic and postponement of the Class XII exam dates, the GCET schedule was pushed to mid-June. As the Class XII exams have now been cancelled and the central as well as state boards are yet to finalise the scheme for tabulation of results for Class XII students, the GCET has been deferred further. For engineering and pharmacy programme admissions, Class XII scores are required and therefore the professional seat entry is directly linked to the schedule of declaration of the Class XII results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcet-deferred-further-to-now-be-held-on-july-27-28/articleshow/83268326.cms||---

The CM’s office has sought appointment with Union home minister Amit Shah, which is yet to be confirmed. Jagan is likely to discuss with Shah on the Centre’s vaccine policy. AP had floated global tenders for supply of vaccines but no bids were received by the state as its procurement policy is vested with the Union government. The CM also wrote to his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan, seeking ‘one voice’ with the central government on the vaccine policy. During his meeting, Jagan is said to have prepared a representation requesting Shah to give a free hand to the states to procure vaccines from different sources. The chief minister had earlier written two letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting extra doses of vaccine and sharing of Covaxin formula with other manufacturers to increase its production. He mentioned that the two companies manufacturing vaccines were not able to meet the country’s requirements and requested the Centre to encourage other eligible firms to manufacture the vaccines. Jagan will also ask the Centre to release pending funds for the Polavaram project. The Union government is yet to clear pending bills to the tune of Rs 16,000 crore which will speed up the rehabilitation and resettlement issues of project-displaced families.

---||Chandigarh||SC orders Punjab police to protect ‘live-in’ couple||CHANDIGARH: The Supreme Court has ordered the senior superintendent of police in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district to provide protection to a couple in a live-in relationship and whose plea for protection was turned down by the Punjab and Haryana high court after observing that such a relationship was not “morally or socially acceptable.” In its order, the apex court has specifically told the Punjab police to ensure protection to the couple who may be facing threats “in view of HC observations.” A single bench of the high court headed by Justice H S Madaan, in its order dated May 11, had refused to grant protection to the couple observing that the petitioners in the garb of filing the present petition are seeking a seal of approval for their live-in-relationship, “which is morally and socially not acceptable”. “… The SSP is required to act expeditiously in accordance with the law, including the grant of any protection to the petitioners in view of the apprehensions/ threats, uninfluenced by the observations of the high court,” ordered the top court. A Supreme Court division bench, comprising Justice Navin Sinha and Justice Ajay Rastogi, these orders on Friday while hearing a special leave petition (SLP) filed by Gurwinder Singh and Gulza Kumari from Tarn Taran district. The couple had approached the top court after their plea for protection was dismissed by the Punjab and Haryana HC on May 11. Couple’s plea: Threat to life increased after observations In their SLP before the apex court, the couple had argued that threat to their life had been increased after the HC observations regarding the status of their live-in-relationship. They had even submitted a representation to the Punjab police for protection but the same was denied in view of the HC observations and order dated May 11. The petitioner couple has been living together and intends to get married shortly. However, they apprehend danger to their lives from the woman’s parents. Their counsel also claimed that the woman’s Aadhar card and some other necessary documents were in possession of her family and that is why they could not get married. Both of them are adults, with the woman being 19 years old and the man 22 years old. Importantly, after finding some divergent views of different benches of the Punjab and Haryana high court regarding providing protection to the runaway couples in a live-in relationship, the matter has been referred to a larger bench of the high court. There has been a lot of debate in the legal fraternity on the issue of protection to the couples in live-in relationships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sc-orders-punjab-police-to-protect-live-in-couple/articleshow/83273009.cms||Ajay Sura

As face masks have become the biggest pollutants, a Vadodara-based NGO Caravan Classroom took up the task of cleaning the beach along with Daman Municipal Council (DMC) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Volunteers of the NGO, DMC and CPCB started the four-day long cleaning exercise on World Environment Day and will culminate on June 8, which happens to be World Ocean Day. “We wanted to clean a beach as oceans are getting polluted due to single-use plastic dumped on the beach since restrictions are still in place in Gujarat, we chose Daman,” said Rajeshwari Singh of the NGO. She added that on Saturday morning they were able to collect nine drums full of garbage in just three hours. “Six to seven of our volunteers, 25 workers of DMC and CPCB covered a stretch of 500 meters, and we could collect this much garbage,” she said. The team found used masks strewn around the beach along with PET bottles and plastic cutlery. “We did not initiate this drive to welcome tourists to a clean beach but make people conscious about the environment especially the ocean,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/4-day-drive-to-clean-daman-beach-starts/articleshow/83266667.cms||---

In addition, while the taxpayers with turnover above Rs 5 crore had to file their returns by June 4, which they would have otherwise filed by May 20, smaller taxpayers with turnover less than Rs 5 crore still have time till first week of July to file the returns without any late fee and interest,” according to a finance ministry statement. “The actual revenues for the month of May 2021, thus would be higher,” it added. Policymakers have been indicating that the impact on revenues would be less severe than last year due to the localised lockdowns, although some indicators had showed signs of a slowdown. The statement said revenues for May are 65% higher than in the same month last year. During the month, revenues from import of goods was 56% higher and the revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) were 69% higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year. “It is good to see that despite the aggressive second Covid wave, the GST collections have remained upward of the Rs 1 lakh crore mark. Also the dip was expected as these GST collections are for the supplies made in April, when part of the country was under lockdown,” said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consulting firm , EY. Economists expect receipts for June to be sluggish. The gross GST revenue collected in May 2021 was Rs 1,02,709 crore of which CGST is Rs 17,592 crore, SGST is Rs 22,653, IGST is Rs 53,199 crore and cess is Rs 9,265 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-collection-dips-in-may-but-is-still-above-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/83273041.cms||---

Bragta had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 13 and had recovered, but was admitted to PGI Chandigarh later after his health deteriorated. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who had visited PGI to enquire about his health on Friday, said Bragta was a mass leader whose contribution in development of the state, particularly in the horticulture sector, was immense and the void created by his death would be difficult to fill. Governor Bandaru Dattatreya also expressed grief, terming Bragta an honest and hardworking leader. He lauded his contribution in the field of horticulture development and his efforts towards the welfare of state, particularly Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly constituency. Thakur said Bragta’s passing away was a personal loss as he was a committed BJP leader. State BJP chief and MP Suresh Kashyap, council of ministers, MLAs, chairmen and vice chairmen of boards and corporations and other leaders also paid floral tributes to Bragta.

Cabral said he would submit a white paper to try and convince Sawant about the role that pre-marital counselling could play in reducing divorces. Cabral, who said that the final decision rests with chief minister Pramod Sawant, said he has no intention of troubling or harassing couples through the move. “As a minister, I am an educated person and as a minister I have certain privileges. I will put up a white paper to the chief minister to explain what I intend to do,” said Cabral. On Thursday, Sawant shot down the suggestion made by Cabral saying that the proposal had not gone down well. BJP’s state unit on Thursday morning had strongly opposed the move for pre-marriage counselling. State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade objected to Cabral’s proposal and said that the percentage of divorces in Goa is very low. “We want zero percent divorces in Goa. Even during the pandemic, there were 350 divorces. Every day there is a divorce and during the pandemic even with the courts closed there were divorce proceedings,” Cabral said. State BJP vice-president Dattaprashad Kholkar had referred to Cabral’s proposal as “irresponsible talk to grab headlines” which could “sow the seeds of separation” and “disturb the social fabric” . Cabral has said that against an annual average of 50-70 divorce cases five years ago, Goa recorded more than 350 divorce cases in 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-convince-cm-on-counselling-cabral-to-submit-white-paper/articleshow/83267716.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||Citing Rajasthan & Punjab examples, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri attacks Congress on vaccines||NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday sought a probe into alleged profiteering by the Congress government in Punjab by diverting Centre-allocated Covid vaccines to private hospitals and demanded that “heads should roll”. At a press meet, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri referred to questions earlier raised by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi about the central government’s vaccination policy and export of vaccines. He said the Punjab government’s decision to withdraw the controversial order shows that there was something “fishy” in the matter. Puri added: “Large doses of vaccines have been found dumped in Rajasthan, another Congress-ruled state,” he said and added, “Government profiteering should stop. There should be a probe to bring facts in the public domain and heads should roll”. He also sought to know the “nature of the fund” to which the money received by the state government from private hospitals was credited. Citing a Punjab government communication, he said it procured Covishield for Rs 412 per dose but sold it to private hospitals for Rs1000 and they, in turn, charged Rs 1,560 from the people. Two private hospitals in Mohali charged people Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,200, he alleged. While Congress is busy with the “cricket match” between Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu, this is what is going on in the state, he said. Under flak for “diverting” Covid vaccines to private hospitals, the Punjab government had withdrawn its order on Friday. Puri hit out at Congress for allegedly fuelling vaccine hesitancy as some of its leaders “questioned” the safety and efficacy of Indian-manufactured jabs, and wondered if this was because the party wanted imports of foreign vaccines for getting “commission”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/citing-rajasthan-punjab-examples-union-minister-hardeep-singh-puri-attacks-congress-on-vaccines/articleshow/83273202.cms||---

Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd (IPSCDL), the special purpose vehicle tasked with implementing the Smart City Mission, has constituted a 14-member apex committee which will help promote cycling and other green modes of transport in the state capital. “The committee shall review and monitor the development of a cycling plan and non-motorised transport policy for Panaji,” director of municipal administration Gurudas P Pilarnekar said. Headed by the transport secretary, senior officials from the PWD, TCP and transport department, IPSCDL, traffic police, CCP, Kadamba Transport Corporation and industry bodies have been appointed to the board. This move comes over three years after IPSCDL appointed UMTC to prepare a “low carbon comprehensive mobility plan” and a parking master plan for the city. The plan was submitted to former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s government, but never saw the light of the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/another-attempt-to-promote-green-transport-mode-in-city/articleshow/83267750.cms||---

Uddesh Biku Naik Dessai, a 22-year-old first-time councillor wanted to know why two registers — movement of files and movement of staff — are not being maintained. Instead of replying, Naik told Dessai to “get out” from the meeting hall. Another first-time councillor, John Dias, told Naik to avoid using harsh language. When asked about his outburst, Naik said, “I am strict. Dessai spoke without permission. Also, he was castigating me as though he is the chairman. I said those words with anger, but didn’t mean it.” Admitting that the registers are not maintained properly, Naik said that he will instruct the staff to do so in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cuncolim-reverts-to-rs-1/day-garbage-tax/articleshow/83267764.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘If Covid is war, then we’re still in the middle of it ’||The vast experience of veteran pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat treating SARS, swine flu, Zika and now, Covid-19 makes him an authority to speak on pandemics. In 2020, when the first nationwide lockdown was declared, he had made some predictions in an interview with TOI. Right from the second wave to job losses to psychological stress to vaccine availability, most of his predictions came true in the last 15 months. TOI revisited Dr Arbat as we are now gearing up for total unlock post the second wave. He says we need a strong exit strategy to avoid or at least delay one more wave, one more lockdown and many long-term devastating consequences. Excerpts from an interview... Q. Where exactly have we reached in this fight against Covid-19? A. If we consider Covid as a war then we are still in the middle of a strategic formation. We have reached here by defeating many big threats. But going back to normal from here is going to be the most important and tough task. Victory is assured, only if we bring our people out of the war field with complete safety. For this, we must have a meticulously planned exit strategy. The virus being an enemy will definitely mutate and come back, but we must have shields ready to avoid its next attack. Moreover, we must avoid self-destructing moves. Q. What kind of self-destructing moves should be avoided? A. As we were in dire need of beds, oxygen and drugs, we made some mistakes in a hurry. For example, mucormycosis has emerged as a parallel pandemic. This was not the case in the first wave. In the second wave, when conditions were beyond our control, we allowed oxygen beds at makeshift hospitals at places like marriage halls. Medical oxygen was the need of the hour and so it was catered to through industrial cylinders as well. It gave the fungus the opportunity to target people with low immunity. Now, we are using anti-fungal drugs to treat mucormycosis. We have no option but to use these injections for long periods of time. Ultimately, this is going to affect people’s kidneys in the next few months. So, it’s a crucial time for us to stay healthy and avoid infections to stay safe. Vaccine will definitely help but the overall health needs to be taken care of. Q. Should we have vaccinated more people before starting the unlock process? A. By the time we fully open up these restrictions, we would have vaccinated at least 35% of the population. But, we are still lagging behind. With vaccination, we must learn to treat the diseases by lowering the side-effects of the drugs. If Covid patients are cured and start suffering from mucor and mucor patients are saved and then they start facing kidney problems – it’s not going to be a victory at all. We need proper management of the treatment to bring life to normalcy. It will take time and we need to understand that it’s not over yet. Q. What kind of problems do you foresee post-unlock? A. Covid recovered patients are still facing issues like fatigue, weak lungs and most importantly, psychological problems. According to an estimate, 40% people will face psychiatric problems due to loss of a family member, money and Covid. Financially, it will take one more year to settle down, if we successfully avoid the third wave. The next big thing is going to be psychiatric problems like domestic violence, loneliness, professional burnout, post-traumatic stress and so on. Taking care of these problems is a must while unlocking. Q. Do you think there’ll be a third wave and if so, will we need another lockdown? A. A proper exit strategy from the present lockdown to normal life may skip the third wave. As far as the lockdown is concerned, I don’t think it stops the spread of the virus. It is only a short term pause to reduce cases and ramp up our health infrastructure. After learning from first and second wave, if people continue to follow the preventive measures like wearing masks, sanitization and physical distancing then cases may increase at a lesser pace and we will get more time to accelerate vaccination post-unlock. The outcome of the present lockdown is going to be very serious. We can’t afford another lockdown. Q. What is the likely outcome if a new mutant infects even the vaccinated lot? A. This is unlikely to happen. A vaccine provides a certain level of protection to every individual and we are experiencing its benefits while treating patients. The virus has kind of disappeared and the case curve is going down rapidly. This sudden decline in cases gives me a feeling that the virus may have adopted some new strategy and might emerge with a more lethal mutant. But if we protect a majority of the population from the present mutants through the vaccine then the new mutant might be restricted effectively. Q. There are claims that some medicines have cured Covid-19. A. Medicines like 2-deoxy-D-glucose by DRDO have been launched and the initial results are good. But the trials were done on a limited number of patients. It will take time to establish the efficacy of these drugs. Let them come into the market. If proved to be effective, such medicines can be game changers. Q. What precautions should people take ahead of the unlock? A. Unlock is just a beginning to move towards normal life. We still have a long way to go. Wear masks and wash hands regularly. Get vaccinated. If you can pay for it, please go ahead and pay because this will benefit the poor people who require it free of cost. Don’t avoid psychiatric problems, get them treated professionally. Maintain health, immunity, but avoid crowds, unnecessary travel and most importantly, community gatherings like weddings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/if-covid-is-war-then-were-still-in-the-middle-of-it-/articleshow/83268872.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Co-operation minister Govind Gaude issued them allotment letters confirming their services. However, the move has been opposed by some quarters who called it unexpected and said it would lead to further losses at Goa Dairy. The government had appointed a three-member administrative committee headed by chairman Durgesh Shirodkar who said that the regularised workers had been working at Goa Dairy for over seven years. He said that the staff were absorbed when vacancies opened up after several workers retired. Anup Desai, a former director of Goa Dairy opposed the move to regularize services of the temporary workers, stating that the financial situation of Goa dairy is “very weak” .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-dairy-regularises-23-workers/articleshow/83267786.cms||---

By involving students and teachers from multiple departments, the university has restored a part of the stream. On Saturday marking the World Environment Day, the stretch was declared as ecological experimental site. “Students of all the departments of Faculty of Science along with those from the Institute of Climate Change, departments of civil and electrical and electronics engineering and others can now study varied aspects of science and set up multidisciplinary nature of experiments,” said Dr Kauresh Vachhrajani, head of department of environmental studies. “A region of it is restored and in part newly developed ecosystem while the remaining region is undisturbed natural ecosystem. A comparison of this over the years will certainly tell us the success story,” he said. The faculty is also developing a waste disposal policy. On January 4, last year, students of the department had proposed ecological restoration of Bhukhi within the campus. Studies on different aspects of Bhukhi were carried out by students of botany department led by Dr Padamnabhi Nagar too joined the ecological restoration program. They constructed an ecowall along the botanical garden as a replacement of concrete wall for controlling soil erosion and damage to the bank area. The construction division helped in the structuring of the bank. “In last three months, this ecowall has well established and has withstood the impact of recent cyclonic rainfall. We are now replicating this in other parts along Bhukhi within the campus,” Nagar said.  Campaign to promote ‘giloy’ launchedVadodara: The national campaign to promote ‘giloy- the amrit of life’ was launched at M S University campus on Saturday marking the World Environment Day. The university’s Department of Botany had bagged the national project from the Ministry of Ayush, Government of India, to promote the plant that had shot to limelight during Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/area-along-bhukhi-stream-to-be-developed-as-ecological-site/articleshow/83266511.cms||---

A team of special operation group (SOG) arrested Jenish Kheni, his girlfriend Nikita Chodvadiya and their car’s driver Atul Patil from Abrama entry point in the city on Tuesday night. They had driven up to Kasol in HP in an SUV and returned with the consignment in flat 20 hours travelling 1,657 km. “We are in touch with senior police officials of HP including the state DGP and requested for support in nabbing those involved in supplying drugs to the arrested. HP police have assured us full cooperation,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar.  In the past too, traffickers nabbed with charas have revealed during interrogation that they got the narcotics from HP. “Charas available in HP is in high demand across India. After bringing it to the city, the accused mix it with other material and dilute it. They then sell it at a higher price,” said a police officer. Police arrested two more accused Jignesh alias Montu alias Masa Patel, 28 and Hardik Patel, 30, for alleged involvement in the charas racket. Investigation revealed that Jignesh and Hardik were to purchase 3 kg charas from the accused trio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/city-police-seek-hps-help-to-crack-charas-racket/articleshow/83266564.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

She first lost her job as schools shut during the pandemic and with the lockdown, her husband’s vend in Puttur shut down. Now, Chitralekha and her husband, Sundar Naik, both roll beedis to put food on the table. “We make about Rs 1,000 a week by rolling beedis,” she said. Their eldest son is a firstyear PU student, followed by a daughter in SSLC and a boy in Class 2 in a government school. The family lives in a small house some 50km from Puttur. The 37-year-old said she never imagined she would be rolling beedis after nine years of teaching English and science to young children. “Soon after completing DEd in 2012, I joined the education department as a guest teacher. I worked in many government schools in Puttur taluk, and thereafter at the government school in Balmatta, Mangaluru. I started working for an honorarium of Rs 2,500 per month in 2012 and my final salary after revisions was Rs 7,500. The first lockdown made me jobless with no salary thereafter,” said Chitralekha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-teaching-english-and-science-to-rolling-beedis-for-1000-a-week/articleshow/83273459.cms||Vinobha K T
---||Nagpur||State health dept allows 20% oxygen use for industries||Nagpur: The state public health department brought some relief to the industrial sector in the unlockdown phase by allowing 20% of the oxygen produced to be supplied to manufacturing plants and air separation units.Before the order, 100% oxygen was being supplied to hospitals to treat the Covid-19 patients. The burgeoning second wave had necessitated the authorities to issue directions in May to the oxygen plants to stop supplies to the industries. In the latest order issued on June 2, the health department directed oxygen plants to ensure that the production of medical oxygen continues uninterrupted. While extending the relief, the department stated that oxygen manufacturing plants have to give priority to the supply at hospitals, even if it is more than the proportion now decided (80% hospitals, 20% industries).Offering the rationale for its decision, the department said that industrial use was allowed considering the high recovery rate in comparison to the infection rate towards the end of May. The department also pointed to the reduced requirement of oxygen among Covid-19 patients.Sources in the district administration said the city’s current oxygen requirement had fallen to 40-45 metric tonnes (MT) from 145-160 MT during the peak between mid-April to mid-May. It’s reliably learnt that some of the oxygen plants have already started supplying their industrial clients after the state notifications landed, though the district collector is yet to issue a fresh notice modifying his earlier order of 100% supply of oxygen to the hospitals. Tarique Patel, owner of Jubilee Glass Works, said the demand and supply of oxygen at the hospitals had substantially dropped. MIDC industries’ association president CG Shegaonkar said discontinuation of oxygen supply had affected operations to a large extent, especially in the engineering and fabrications units. “The loss was substantial but cannot be quantified. Some had to adopt alternative means like use of steel cutters,” he added. Sachin Jain, secretary of the MIDC industries association, said several units had suffered economically during lockdown and many had to suspend their operations and shut down the plants. “The industries were already hit by the rising prices of steel in the last few months,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-health-dept-allows-20-oxygen-use-for-industries/articleshow/83268888.cms||Soumitra Bose

Any honest work done to earn money is honourable, feels the former PT teacher. Then again, having lost two jobs in quick succession, he has thought of ending his life, apprehensive about how he will feed the dozen-odd family members dependent on him. It has been a horribly rough ride for the 37-year-old, who until recently was PT teacher--cum-coordinator at Vardhi Public School at Mallanayakanahalli village, about 110km from Bengaluru. A graduate who received an honorary doctorate for his achievements in folk arts, Narasimha is currently out of work as the school is closed for the lockdown, and receives only part of his salary. Narasimha says he worked with various art troupes but it paid little so he joined the school. He became a mason soon after the school shut, and made about Rs 450 a day, working with a contractor in his village, Dommasandra village in Mulbagal taluk. After a fortnight, though, the construction work was stopped and that earning dried up too. He now plucks mangoes for a daily wage of Rs 300. “My aged parents and some 14 family members are dependent on me,” says the father of two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pt-instructor-to-mason-to-mango-plucker-in-less-than-a-month/articleshow/83273545.cms||K RANGANATH

TMC effected a few other changes in key leadership roles at its first organisational meet after the massive assembly poll mandate, making trusted Abhishek aide Kunal Ghosh its state general secretary, actor Saayoni Ghosh its youth wing chief (and Abhishek’s successor) and Barrackpore MLA and director Raj Chakraborty the head of its cultural wing.  The meeting did not take a stand on TMCto-BJP turncoats’ pleas to be taken back. “The CM will decide on this,” party secretary general Partha Chatterjee said. Mamata cautioned the TMC brass against using redbeacon cars, party seniors said. “She told the meeting that it was now time to work for the people,” Chatterjee said. But it was the 34-year-old Abhishek’s elevation to the national general secretary’s post — till now held by one of Mamata’s most trusted aides, Subrata Bakshi — that was the day’s talking point. It was “a recognition of his critical role” in TMC’s poll victory, party seniors said, referring to how Mamata’s nephew had been targeted as “bhaipo” by both PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamatas-nephew-named-tmc-national-gen-secy-in-major-post-poll-rejig/articleshow/83273602.cms||---
---||Nagpur||ZP to ring in Covid testing by gargling samples||Nagpur: The technique of collecting RT-PCR samples through gargling, an innovation of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), will soon be implemented outside the city. With this, Nagpur zilla parishad will become the first in the country to implement this technique in rural and tribal areas. The decision was taken in a meeting held between minister of animal husbandry and dairy development Sunil Kedar and administrative officials on Saturday. Developed by Neeri scientist Krishna Khairnar and approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the technique uses simple method of gargling to take RT-PCR samples. “It was very unfortunate to witness a large number of people dying of Covid-19 in villages during the second wave. It is challenging to collect samples from villages and tribal areas as trained healthcare professional and special infrastructure is not available. The saline gargle technique allows collecting samples without the need of trained health care professionals. The requirements too are basic,” said Rashmi Barve, the ZP president. Adding that the technique will prove to be a game-changer for rural areas, Barve said, “Testing is a most important aspect for mitigating COVID-19 pandemic. The one-step RNA extraction method also speeds up the analysis of samples and provides quick results. As a president, I wish to ensure that we are well prepared for third wave in advance, so that precious lives can be saved.” In Nagpur, the technique was first implemented at the Regional Police Training School over a week back by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) which became the country’s first civic body to implement it for RT-PCR testing. Now, the civic body is carrying out trials at other collection centres too. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “A trial run was held at a collection centre at Satranjipura. On Sunday, Hanuman Nagar and Dhantoli centres too will do the same. Samples will be sent to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) , Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS). After checking the results, we will take a call on further implementation.” While the commercial manufacturing of sample collection kits has started, the Neeri-designed one-step RNA extraction buffer substance is awaiting the approval of Drugs Controller General of India. “Till the manufacturing of the buffer begins, laboratories have an option to test the gargling samples using the existing RNA extraction kits. The other option will be to use the special buffer medium in which collected sample is mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and then heated for six minutes at 98 degree Celsius,” said officials. As reported by TOI earlier, the latter method will be faster and cost-effective compared to the existing RNA extraction process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/zp-to-ring-in-covid-testing-by-gargling-samples/articleshow/83269333.cms||Manka Behl

Scores of farmers also reached Tohana to court arrest and protest against the state government over filing of cases and arrest of farmers. Later, Babli approached the farmer leaders himself and offered to apologise, after which a meeting of the delegation of five members of the MLA with the delegation of 12 members of farmers was held and then the MLA released the video in which he is seen apologising. In this video, he has also indicated that he will forgive those with whom he had a confrontation on June 1. According to the matter, on June 1, protesters who had come out to stop Babli from inaugurating an X-ray machine at the town’s civil hospital pelted his car with stones and smashed its glass, injuring his private secretary, Radhe Bishnoi, and hurting two of their own. After this, SKM protested in Tohana on June 2 and the MLA had sought three days’ time. After this, Charuni gave an ultimatum till June 7 to the administration to register an FIR against the MLA and called off Wednesday’s protest. However, on the other side, Vikas Sisar, a local farmer activist, led a group to gherao the house of Babli in Badhai Khera village and the police arrested Vikas and Ravi and on June 3, another case was registered against them and both were sent to jail. In protest against this, a meeting was held by Tikait at Ramanay (Mayyar) toll plaza of Hisar in which the mass court arrest programme was announced for June 5. On Saturday, farmers first gathered in Tohana’s grain market and leaders like Tikait, Gurnam Charuni, Yadav and Jogendra Ghasiram also reached there. In the afternoon, the farmers headed to Tohana Sadar police station and surrounded the police station. But they were not arrested, as there was no duty magistrate present. Meanwhile, MLA Babli called Ghasiram and offered to apologise and withdraw the case. Government made laws to rob farmers: Tikait Earlier, addressing the public meeting, Tikait said the governments world over has made laws to prevent crops being less than the cost price, but the government here has made laws to rob farmers. He said the movement will go on until the government withdraws the black laws. “In 2024, the laws will automatically go back,” Tikait said. Jail agitation safest: Charuni Farmer leader Charuni said first he and Tikait will let themselves be arrested and later other farmers will also be arrested and this process will continue. He also added that the jail movement is the safest movement, the government will take it at sits own expense, and will give free food and medicine. “If the government does not agree to it soon, then we will sit in jail with family, expenses will also be borne by the government,” Charuni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mla-babli-apologises-after-farmers-gather-for-mass-court-arrest-in-tohana/articleshow/83269943.cms||---

The case positivity rate was at 13.7%, while recovery rate improved to 93%. Interestingly, for the third consecutive day the state recorded 17 deaths. Similarly, it had reported 39 Covid fatalities on May 25, 26 and 27. Of the total deaths on Friday, 10 died at the Goa Medical College, six at the South Goa District Hospital and one at a private hospital in South Goa. The mortality bulletin said none of the patients who died had been vaccinated. The average hospital stay of the majority of the patients was eight to 10 days, while few lasted for three weeks and more. A 39-year-old man from Ponda was hospitalised for over three weeks. He was admitted two days after he had tested positive, but succumbed to the virus. He did not have any comorbidities. Eight patients were below 60 and had comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. One suffered from liver disease. During the day, 102 patients were hospitalised and 99 discharged. Most centres are reporting a drop in cases and consequently there is a reduction in their active caseload, a health officer, said. The majority of them have 200-plus cases and need to tread with caution. The bigger centres barring Margao and Ponda — both with a caseload of 600 each — have 300 to 400 cases. On Saturday, Panaji’s caseload was 439, while that of Porvorim was 331. “We will need to be careful and take all precautions to keep ourselves safe. Even if the restrictions are lifted, the public will have to follow social distancing and wear face masks when stepping out. Those who have not got their vaccine shot, should not wait any longer wondering about this and that,” the health officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-sees-17-deaths-for-third-day-in-a-row-positivity-at-13-7/articleshow/83267977.cms||---

---||India||Punjab National Bank posts ₹586 crore profit in Q4||MUMBAI: Punjab National Bank reported a net profit of Rs 586 crore for quarter ended March 2021 as compared to a loss of Rs 697 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. For the full year, the bank reported a net profit of Rs 2,022 crore compared to Rs 336 crore in corresponding quarter last year. The amalgamation of Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India came into effect on 1st April 2020 and figures are not comparable. If the audited numbers of three banks were aggregated the loss for the third quarter in the previous year would stand at Rs 10,127 crore while the full-year loss would have been Rs 8,311 crore. Announcing the results, the bank’s MD CH SS Mallikarjuna Rao said the bank ended the year with a deposit of Rs 11,06,332 crore while advances rose to 6,74,.230 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-national-bank-posts-586-crore-profit-in-q4/articleshow/83273891.cms||---

The report will be discussed in a meeting of senior officials next week. Yashpal Garg, the nodal officer, said they had removed the quota system of private hospitals as the demand of oxygen had dipped. An audit of government and private hospitals started in May had observed that the consumption of oxygen decreased by 20-25% after sensitisation by a team of doctors in both government and private hospitals. A committee constituted by the administration had submitted its report to health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta The report said, “With these visits at different hospitals, it was observed that more than 20-25% oxygen consumption was decreased following sensitisation drive and this programme contributed tremendously to judicious utilisation of oxygen.” Garg said the central government has fixed the daily quota of 20 MT of medical oxygen for Chandigarh from INOX, Barotiwala. This medical oxygen was being utilised by Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32; Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16; and the Sector 48 hospital. The private health care institutions were also catered to from this quota. Additionally, three oxygen generation plants were commissioned recently in these hospitals, he added. Garg further said the efforts put in by the administration have resulted in smooth supply of oxygen. Presently, the administration is having sufficient oxygen cylinders to cater to the requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-nodal-officer-to-give-report-on-oxygen-taken-used-in-two-months/articleshow/83273867.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

At its first meeting held recently, the commission decided that it was necessary to compile data to help guide parents. “We are compiling data of all paediatric facilities, paediatricians, child psychologists, child psychiatrists, child care institutions, anganwadi workers and child development project officers,” chairperson Peter Borges said. Details of all NGOs working for children, including those with disabilities, will be part of the database. The commission is also assessing paediatric infrastructure in the state. “We assume people will be looking out for all child-related facilities and specialists during the third wave and we don’t want people to panic, which is why we are preparing a PDF document that we can share,” Borges said. The commission has already sought information on children who have tested positive, were hospitalised or passed away during the first two waves to be in a better position to tackle the next wave. It has also sought information from the government on parents who succumbed to Covid leaving behind young children. At its first meeting, the commission also took cognisance of the non-establishment of the Juvenile Justice Fund under Section 105 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, State Children’s Fund under Goa Children’s Act, 2004, and non implementation of the Sponsorship Scheme under Integrated Child Protection Scheme. In a letter to the government, the commission has asked for the immediate creation of the Juvenile Justice Fund for the welfare and rehabilitation of children under the act and State Children’s Fund so that emergency needs of children due to Covid-19 vulnerabilities may be prioritised and addressed. It also asked for the immediate notification of the sponsorship scheme under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/child-rights-bodys-guide-to-help-parents-tackle-3rd-wave/articleshow/83268017.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Loss of reproductive potential is one of the most distressing adverse consequences of successful cancer treatment and can affect the quality of life of cancer survivors. Therefore, oncofertility care has emerged as an integral part of cancer care from diagnosis to survivorship.Dr Sadhana Patwardhan, joint secretary of Fertility Preservation Society of India, said fertility preservation is not just preserving gametes (sperms/oocytes) and embryos but a complete ‘oncofertility care’ now.“Cancer diagnosis was seen as a death sentence some 40 years ago. Increasing and long-term survivorship in cancer has brought attention to addressing quality of life issues like the ability to create a family after cancer treatment and maintaining proper endocrine function,” said Dr Patwardhan.As per national cancer registry of India, 11.4 lakh people have some form of cancer at present, of which 30-75% of males and 40-80 % of females have problems with fertility at some point after completion of cancer treatment. Despite recent advances in the available techniques, fertility preservation services still remain underutilized, Dr Patwardhan said.“There are several barriers in implementation of comprehensive and equitable fertility preservation practice. Lack of referral pathways and model of care for oncofertility services, inequitable access based on cost, and lack of health literacy are the issues. There is a shortage of trained staff who can deliver these services,” said Dr Patwardhan.Currently, several options are available for fertility preservation in young cancer patients. However, the only established option for male patients is sperm cryopreservation. For women, both embryo cryopreservation and oocyte cryopreservation, are considered as well established methods.Ovarian tissue cryopreservation at the moment is offered in research setting but does predict a promising additional method for fertility preservation for future. It is the only option for pre-pubertal girls who want to preserve fertility before cancer treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/oncofertility-care-important-for-young-cancer-survivors/articleshow/83269233.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

On Saturday, primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar asked the Department of Pre-university Education to consider SSLC marks too in evaluating II PUC students, saying said it would help make it more reliable. The II PUC grades will be based on average score of Class 10 and I PUC exams. On Friday, the II PUC exams were cancelled and students were to be evaluated on performance in the I PUC exams held in February 2020. The DPUE has asked the SSLC Board to provide scores of students. The decision was received well by parents and experts in the city. ‘Counting SSLC marks for PU will help reduce students’ stress’Krishna Kumar, a parent, told STOI there was a discussion in a parents’ WhatsApp group about how students do not take their I PUC exams seriously and this would affect their grades in II PUC. “Most students take their SSLC exams more seriously. Higher the average, better it will be for students,” he said. Another parent Bhargavi P said it’s a welcome move, but requested the government to come up with plans and decisions at one go as daily changes add to their anxiety.“Every day, we wake up to an update. I appreciate the effort by the departments to ease our worry, but I hope there are concrete decisions, not constant changes,” she said. KR Venugopal, vice-chancellor, Bangalore University, also said statistically, the addition of Class 10 scores would give an average closer to reality and is better than considering only one performance. B Sadashive Gowda, principal, Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering, said the solution is appropriate as it helps reduce stress for parents and students. “The majority of students who perform well in Class 10 also do well in II PUC. It will help all of them,” he said, adding that a small percentage of students don’t perform well in Class 10 as it is remotely connected with their professional courses. Niranjanaradhya VP, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, National Law School of India University said: “The ideal way of assessing grades of these children is by considering Class 10 exam scores as the main criteria and I PU scores as supplementary. It’s because the learning of these students in I PUC has been uneven due to the pandemic and most students don’t take I PUC as seriously as II PUC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sslc-marks-will-also-count-for-ii-puc-grades-karnataka-government/articleshow/83273964.cms||---

The carcass was recovered in the same nullah where it had attacked Dr Ravikant Khobragade. Post-mortem confirmed that the beast had multiple injuries that had festered leading to the death. The four-year-old tigress was under observation since June 2 as it lay idle in compartment no. 327 of Doni forest in buffer zone. The foresters were keeping track of its movement even after it attacked the veterinarian. It did not move away from the nullah and died there. Senior Tadoba officers conducted inquest formality and moved the carcass to the transit treatment centre (TTC) in Chandrapur where a team of vets including Dr PM Kadukar, Dr Kundan Podchalwar and Dr SJ Bawane carried out the post-mortem in presence of PCCF representative Mukesh Bhandhakkar and NTCA representative Bandu Dhotre. CCF, TATR, Jitendra Ramgaonkar said the tigress died of hypovolemic shock resulting from internal haemorrhage due to severe external injuries. All its body parts were found intact, he said.The carcass were later incinerated at the TTC in presence of senior forest officials and representatives of PCCF and NTCA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/injured-tadoba-tigress-dies-in-nullah-where-it-mauled-vet/articleshow/83269256.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka government mulls CET ranking sans weightage to II PU scores||BENGALURU: Following the decision to cancel II PU exams, the state government is planning to do away with weightage to II PU scores to decide on a student's CET (Common Entrance Test) ranking this year. Rankings for CET are decided by allotting 50% weightage to a candidate's II PU scores and 50% to CET scores. CET is the gateway for admission to undergraduate engineering, technology, yoga and naturopathy, farm science and pharma courses. On Friday, the state government decided to cancel II PU examination and, instead, promote students based on their performance in I PU. On Saturday it said their performance in SSLC will also be considered for II PU grades. The grades for the students - A-plus, A, B and C - will be based on the range of their scores. On Saturday, minister for primary and secondary education, S Suresh Kumar wrote a letter to deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan, who is also the minister for higher education, asking him to change the way candidates are ranked in CET examination. Kumar suggested doing away with the weightage system this year and considering giving ranks to students based on just their CET scores. Narayan responded to Kumar's letter on Saturday evening and said the suggestion will be considered and a decision on the matter taken shortly. "Till now, getting minimum marks in II PU was set as a criterion for seeking admission to engineering and medical courses. But now, in view of the cancellation of annual examinations, this would not be possible. So, a new decision will be arrived at after discussing with educational experts and the officials concerned," said Narayan. Experts welcomed the suggestion, saying it will bring CET on a par with other competitive exams. KR Venugopal, vice-chancellor, Bangalore University told TOI that with II PU exams cancelled, this is the best option to keep CET competitive. "Students will have a fair chance at getting a rank if he or she has the right knowledge. They will have to work hard and put in more effort to get into institutions of higher education," he said. B Sadashive Gowda, principal, Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering, Mysuru welcomed the decision and said it is similar to JEE, where II PU marks don't determine ranking.  Students, however, seemed to be divided on this. Prajwal J, a student, said this does not seem like a good idea as they are not exclusively prepared for CET. Another student, Syed Kashif, though, was excited about the proposal. "Though we cannot prepare for II PU exam now, we can focus on CET. Even if our past marks are not good, we have a chance to get a rank," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-government-mulls-cet-ranking-sans-weightage-to-ii-pu-scores/articleshow/83274030.cms||---

Police arrested the man, who claimed himself to be a suicide bomber, on Friday at around 3pm. The man had covered his face with a cloth and entered the bank. At gunpoint he handed over a letter to a bank employee for the branch manager. In the letter, the man, identified by police as Yogesh Kubade, demanded Rs55 lakh claiming that he was seriously ill and would die within 40 days if he doesn’t get treatment. In the letter, Kubade said, “I am a suicide bomber and I have activated the bomb. You have 15 minutes to decided your fate, there is nothing in my life to lose, but your life is precious. Instead of informing police or raising an alarm, do it fast. Otherwise, it would blow everyone up.” The bank is situated in front of Sewagram police station. Two cops rushed there on getting an alert from the bank and nabbed Kubade. He tried to flee when police handcuffed him. “A small digital watch with six red-coloured pipe wires etc wrapped around the waist made it look like a connected bomb. There were no explosives in it. The plastic pipe was filled with POP,” said PSI Ganesh Saykar. PSI and investigation officer, Jitendra Thakur, said Kubade used POP powder, plastic bottles, wire to make it look like a real bomb but we identified it as fake. Cops confiscated a knife, an air pistol and other material from Kubade. “He owns a cyber cafe and had purchased all the items online. Kubade did the drama to repay a loan,” said Thakur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-claiming-to-be-suicide-bomber-demands-rs55l-at-bank-arrested/articleshow/83269260.cms||Balwant Dhage

Pointing out that Goa has a population just shy of 16 lakh, Khaunte said rapid vaccination is achievable within two months. The MLA has urged Sawant not to put temporary economic gains ahead of precious human lives and to instead focus on vaccinating as many individuals as quickly as possible. “The government should not lift the curfew till 100% of the people are vaccinated. I urge and plead with the government that whatever it does, call off the curfew only after Goa is entirely vaccinated. Only then will we have safety in the long run,” said the independent MLA. While acknowledging that continuing the curfew would have an economic impact, he urged the government to utilise funds, including the Rs 300 crore received from the Centre, to support those who have lost their livelihoods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khaunte-for-curfew-till-all-are-vaccinated/articleshow/83268039.cms||---

This is likely due to the flow of westerlies strengthening over the region and causing convection. Private forecasters and bloggers said that there are chances of rain before the formation of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal on June10. The IMD has forecast that the sky condition would be partly cloudy, maximum and minimum temperatures maybe around 36°C and 28°C. The average maximum and minimum temperatures in the city for the month of June are 37°C and 27.5°C. Maximum temperatures have dropped a degree or two below normal in the last few days but the humidity levels have increased due to the entry of easterlies. On Saturday, Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded 35.1°C and 36.1°C, which were 2.4°C and 1.8°C below normal. But the humidity levels in both the stations were 76% and 70%. As for the rainfall, an official said it is because of the strengthening of westerlies and the entry of easterlies likely to cause convection in interior parts of the state during the day. “The westerlies could push the rain clouds closer to the coast bringing rainfall to the coastal region. Some convective activity could also happen closer to the coast,” the official said. Skymet weather, in its online post, said a low pressure may form over the north Bay of Bengal on June10 and intensify into a depression the following day. “In all probability, the depression will cross the coast on June 12 and be consequential for the onset of monsoon over east India and some central parts,” the private forecaster said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/imd-forecasts-light-rain-in-chennai-suburbs/articleshow/83274014.cms||---

He also said that the state borders should remain shut, with stringent testing norms for those entering the state. “My personal feeling is that we should open all shops for economic survivability of businessmen. In this last one month the Covid-19 cases have reduced,” he said. Cabral said that it made no sense to reopen off-shore and on-shore casinos as Goans are not permitted to enter casinos. “When people are not going to come into the state, opening the casino does not make sense.

The highest 10,38,223 doses, which is 27.92% of Vidarbha’s total vaccination, have been given in Nagpur district. As per data of state’s public health department, 1,89,74,321 persons have taken first dose of Covishield and Covaxin in 35 districts of the state as on June 4. The total first doses given in Vidarbha account for 19.6% of state’s total. Four more districts of the region have given over three lakh doses. Amravati district has the second highest number of beneficiaries (3,80,065), followed by Yavatmal district (3,61,492), Buldhana district (3,54,889) and Chandrapur district (3,15,995). Number of beneficiaries is over three lakh in four districts — Akola (2,54,718), Wardha (2,37,750), Gondia (2,30,311) and Bhandara (2,20,843). Washim (1,90,004) and Gadchiroli (1,34,256) districts have inoculated the lowest number of beneficiaries. The number of beneficiaries in Nagpur district has increased in the last two days due to beginning of second dose to people in the 18-44 years age group who took Covaxin. On Friday, 4,318 took the jab in the district while 4,563 doses were given on Saturday. The number had dropped below 4,000 last week. Kingsway Hospital, the only private hospital in six districts of Nagpur division to start vaccination for all above 18 years, has inoculated 10,166 persons in six days. The hospital gave the shot to 1,930 persons on Saturday. Majority of the beneficiaries (10,037) are in the 18-44 age group. The state government had rolled out vaccination for 18-44 years age group on May 1. Inoculation was started in limited centres of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) but stopped on May 12 citing shortage of doses. The hospital has also given doses of Covishield to 129 persons from the 45-plus age group in the last six days. First and second dose for this age group are allowed and free of cost at NMC centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/37-19l-take-covid-vaccine-in-vidarbha-in-141-days/articleshow/83269267.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Surat||SMC’s work on curbing filariasis can be model for the country, finds study||Surat: The implementation of elimination of lymphatic filariasis (ELF) program by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) can become a model to develop guidelines and strategies to curb other diseases and infections including Covid-19 in an urban Indian setting. The findings of the study done by Dr. Anjali Modi, assistant professor of preventive and social medicine at Government Medical College (GMC), Surat, SMC and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine show that the SMC’s method of mass drug administration and the intensive surveys helped in bringing down positive microfilaria cases by over 63% during the program period from 2008 to 2016. A research article on the study was recently published in the UK-based Infectious Diseases of Poverty journal. The study finds that SMC’s method of conducting surveys of approximately 2,000 to 4,000 people per month around the year from across the city even if there was no prevalence of microfilaria and disease largely helped. “This survey was beyond what the World Health Organization (WHO) considered adequate,” said Modi. WHO’s recommendations are to carry out an annual survey of approximately 4,000 people from four fixed and four random sites. SMC’s staff of vector-borne disease control department covered all zones of the city right up to the ‘mohalla’ and household levels irrespective of prevalence of disease. During the day, while the peripheral health workers would conduct the door-to-door surveys to check filaria morbidity cases, at night, blood samples used to be taken from all these houses. During the blood test if somebody was found positive for microfilaremia, doctors would visit them and counsel them. “There was regular training, monitoring and field visits by public health experts which helped in not losing the focus,” said Modi, who also used to visit the positive patients. “This disease, if diagnosed at an early stage, can be cured and the surveys helped in this direction,” said Modi. “The same methods can be adopted for testing, tracking and treating of any other disease including Covid-19 and even for vaccination,” she said. Modi added that having a separate vector-borne control department in SMC added to the benefit. “But this activity should be continued over the years and not stopped otherwise the efforts go futile,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smcs-work-on-curbing-filariasis-can-be-model-for-the-country-finds-study/articleshow/83266537.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Their nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were collected by a team of veterinary doctors and sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) laboratory in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly for RT-PCR tests. Talking to TOI, zoo director Y K Das said, “Among the big cats screened on Saturday were leopards and lions. We have 21 big cats in the zoo and all of their swabs will be collected for Covid-19 tests.” The zoo, spread over 104 hectares, has nine tigers, eight leopards (including one black panther) and four lions currently. The screening for big cats in the zoo was held two days after Shiva, a 10-year-old male tiger, died of kidney and liver ailments on the night of June 4. The tiger, however, had a high fever and loss of appetite since May 31, causing the park management to suspect a possible Covid-19 infection. Swabs and blood samples of Shiva were sent to IVRI Bareilly for RT-PCR tests on Friday after he tested negative for Covid-19 in a rapid antigen test, the park management had said. The results of Shiva’s RT-PCR tests are expected in a week. Das said besides sanitizing the enclosures with antiviral drugs and screening the felines for Covid-19, all other species of animals, which are featured in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, will be put through an annual physical examination in June every year to look for symptoms of signs of possible serious ailments of kidneys, hearts, lung and other organs. Sloth bear dies in zoo Meanwhile, a 10-year-old female sloth bear died of injuries after she was attacked by a 12-year-old male sloth bear on Saturday. The incident happened around 4:30 pm in the bear enclosure. Das said the male bear, Chotu, attacked the female during mating. The female bear was brought to the zoo from Jamtara after being rescued from a Madari. However, given the fact that bears do turn aggressive during mating, questions are being asked as to why additional cage keepers were not deployed around the enclosure to prevent such an incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/samples-collected-from-11-big-cats-at-ranchi-zoo-for-covid-tests/articleshow/83267189.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||State to send samples of Cov victims to Odisha for genome sequencing||Ranchi: The state health department has decided to send samples of those who died from Covid-19 after April 1 to the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) in Bhubaneswar for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). The move is aimed at monitoring the spread of various mutants of the virus and detect any possible new strain and take appropriate steps in days to come. An order in this regard has been sent to all the sentinel surveillance sites across Jharkhand, which include the labs at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) in Ranchi, all state-run medical colleges, all state-run RT-PCR labs and the Intermediate Reference Laboratory in Itki. The nodal officers of these labs have been asked to ensure that the requisite number of samples, not less than 15 from each centre, is sent to ILS. The lab officials have also been asked to coordinate with the district surveillance officers for sending the preserved samples and for initiating epidemiological investigation of unusual events like large clusters, vaccine breakthrough clusters, reinfection clusters and death clusters. Talking to TOI, state epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn said, “WGS will help us in detecting the new strains, if any, and help us gauge how many deaths were caused by the new strains.” He added, “Once we get the mortality rate associated with a specific strain, we will be able to identify areas or clusters with that strain and take appropriate measures. As per our records, a total of 3,647 persons have died between April 1 and May 21 and all those samples will be sent for WGS. We have directed all the labs to get the SRF ID of all such patients from their respective district administration and send the samples to ILS within 48 hours.” Upon contact, the head of department of microbiology at Rims, Dr Manoj Kumar, said, “Earlier, we used to send the preserved samples which had a CT value of less than 25 for genome sequencing and although now we are sending the samples of Covid victims, we will send some samples selected at random in the near future. WGS will not only help us in detecting the number of deaths caused by the new strain, if any, but will also help us in planning timely intervention at specified clusters if we come across any cluster with a high caseload.” As per health department records, a total of 537 samples from across the state have been sent to ILS for WGS between March and April this year. Of those, 363 were processed, out of which, 29 have shown the UK variant and 272 had double mutants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-to-send-samples-of-cov-victims-to-odisha-for-genome-sequencing/articleshow/83267256.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Both Trinamool Congress and BJP leaders said Bera was a close aide of a TMC minister-turned-BJP leader. According to the FIR, Bera took Rs 2 lakh from Ashokenagar resident Sujit Dey in July-September 2019 and promised him a Group-D job in the irrigation and waterways department. The FIR claimed that Bera, along with another person, had entered into a “criminal conspiracy” with others over jobs that didn’t exist. The complainant alleged that the accused even showed forged appointment letters with state government stamps. Details of when the FIR was lodged and whether statements had been recorded were not immediately available. Police said there might be several similar complaints against Bera. A senior police officer said Bera was arrested for money embezzlement. “We were looking for him for sometime. He was arrested on Saturday. There is another person who is involved in this case and named in the FIR. We are tracking that person. More arrests are likely,” a source said. Police said they would seek details from the state irrigation and waterways department about Bera and whether he was employed by the department in any capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/senior-oppn-leaders-aide-arrested-on-fraud-charges/articleshow/83267805.cms||---

The plea will be heard at a special NIA court early next week. The NIA has hinted that it will oppose the move. Mahato’s plea has drawn a lot of interest among lawyers and political commentators, in the backdrop of the Calcutta High Court sending the four leaders accused in the Narada case to home confinement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chhatradhar-makes-house-arrest-plea/articleshow/83267813.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||BJP on damage-control as post-poll discontent brews||Bishnupur/Malda: Local BJP MP Soumitra Khan leaving the WhatsApp group of the party’s district media cell on a day Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh was holding an organisational meeting in Bishnupur has raised eyebrows, particularly when the MP stayed away from the said meeting. Khan is the first parliamentarian to have quit the party group, but he made light of the situation hours later. “This WhatsApp group was formed in May. My phone was swamped with messages and photographs. While trying to delete some of them, I accidentally quit the group. I am still there in the BJP’s original group,” he said. Asked why he skipped it, Khan said: “I am refraining from political activities amid lockdown. I will resume work once the lockdown is lifted.” Rumblings of discontent were also heard 100km away in Uttarpara, where defeated Trinamool-turned-BJP candidate Prabir Ghoshal said none among state BJP leaders had got in touch with him after bereavement in his family. “My mother is no more. Trinamool MP Kalyan Bandyopadhyay, Trinamool Uttarpara MLA Kanchan Mullick and above all, the CM’s secretariat sent condolence messages. Their support has given me strength to tide over my loss. No one from the state BJP called me,” Ghoshal said. The state BJP president contested Ghoshal’s claims. “Our mandal president accompanied Ghoshal during his mother’s last journey. Everyone knows that we have lost 36 party workers in post-poll violence. We are reaching out to families of every victim,” Ghosh said. In north Bengal, Malda zilla parishad member Dolirani Mandal — who had switched to BJP from Trinamool along with sabhadhipati Gour Mandal — has urged chief minister Mamata Banerjee to take her back. Some members of Ratua panchayat samiti are also keen on returning to Trinamool. Bengal BJP leaders sounded unfazed about the potential exodus of turncoats. “They came to our party on their own and may leave at will. The BJP is like an elephant; a few ants climbing up its back or going down won’t make any difference,” said state BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-on-damage-control-as-post-poll-discontent-brews/articleshow/83267811.cms||Falguni Banerjee

However, Latehar district data manager Ved Prakash, who is looking after the vaccination drive in rural areas, said that the team was late in reaching the village and as per protocol, they did not motivate the villagers to take the jab. “Although it is true that the villagers were not keen on taking the jab, the health team did not encourage them to take the vaccine, as per protocol. Instead they left the village in just 45 minutes when they should have stayed there longer,” Prakash said, adding, “The Latehar DC (Abu Imran) has been apprised of the situation and he is looking into it.” According to local sources, the health team was in a hurry and when they did not find anybody turning up for the vaccination drive, they gathered their things and returned to their camp in Bareysarn, located about 20km from Kujrum. Sources claimed that out of the 90 households in Kujurm, the health workers did not approach any of them for a door-to-door awareness session regarding the vaccination drive. The locals said that the team just reached there, sat under a tree on a mat and then packed up, whereas for vaccination, a health team has to persuade and motivate the beneficiaries for taking the jab. Meanwhile, the DC read out a 125-word appeal in tribal dialect Kurukh to the villagers in Lalgari, where a vaccination fair was organised, urging the villagers to take the jab. Later, as many as 20 beneficiaries took the jab at the fair, Latehar BDO Ganesh Rajak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/villagers-lack-of-interest-drives-vax-team-away/articleshow/83267198.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Abhishek Banerjee leads march of youth brigade in TMC rejig||KOLKATA: Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee was anointed the Trinamool Congress’s national general secretary on Saturday, underlining his larger role in the party as it convened for its first organisational meet after its massive assembly poll victory over the BJP. The Trinamool effected a few other changes in key leadership roles, making trusted Abhishek aide Kunal Ghosh its state general secretary, actor Saayoni Ghosh its youth wing chief (and Abhishek’s successor) and Barrackpore MLA and director Raj Chakraborty the head of its cultural wing. Bengal CM Mamata Ban-erjee delivered a stern “zero-tolerance” message against corruption, urged party lead-ers to shun “displays of pow-er” and proposed implementation of the one-leader-one-post formula. She also cautioned leaders against using red-beacon cars, party seniors said. “She told the meeting that it was now time to work for people. We are expecting high tides coinciding with the monsoon on June 11 and 26. Every leader has been asked to be with people and help them. Nothing else is a priority now,” party secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said. The party, however, did not take a direct stand on how to respond to Trinamool-to-BJP turncoats’ pleas to be taken back in the fold, leaving the decision to the party chief. “The CM will decide on this at the appropriate time. She may form a committee later,” Chatterjee said. MP Saugata Roy said the issue was discussed on Saturday and the CM would take a call. But it was the 34-year-old Abhishek’s elevation to the national general secretary’s post — held by one of Mamata’s most trusted aides, Subrata Bakshi — that was the day’s most-talked-about development. Abhishek’s elevation to the national general secretary’s post — held by one of Mamata’s most trusted aides, Subrata Bakshi — that was the day’s most-talked-about development. It was “a recognition of his critical role” in the Trinamool’s assembly poll victory, party seniors said, referring to how he was targeted by both PM Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah in the election season. He was also the person behind bringing in political strategist Prashant Kishor, “a move that paid off handsomely”, they added. The party also made Ritabrata Bandyopadhyay its trade union wing head, Purnendu Basu the peasants’ wing leader and Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar the party’s women’s wing chief besides elevating Saayoni and Chakraborty. “Watch out for 2024. Khela hobe and we are going to win it. Dilli-r masnade hawai choti (The hawai chappal will rule Delhi). Currently, I will give my 120% to politics and Mamata Banerjee,” Saayoni said. “I am pleasantly surprised by my appointment and will do my best to discharge my responsibilities in consultation with Didi,” Chakraborty, who was the chairperson of the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) in 2019 and 2020, said. Trinamool secretary-general Chatterjee said this was “a blend of the old with the new”. The Trinamool would also try to expand its national footprint, with party MPs Saugata Roy, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Derek O’Brien and Abhishek leading this initiative, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/abhishek-leads-march-of-youth-brigade-in-tmc-rejig/articleshow/83268982.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: TMC-BJP war of words over ‘boycott’ poster in Ghatal||GHATAL/KOLKATA: A poster asking shop owners not to sell anything to 18 BJP organizers of a Midnapore village sent shockwaves in political circles on Saturday reaching up to Delhi. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted against the way people were being “ostracized” in a Bengal village. “This is shocking. Would urge CM @MamataOfficial to see that ALL citizens in West Bengal are protected and not ostracised or denied the basics. Otherwise, a true shame,” Sitharaman posted. The tweet prompted the West Midnapore police to lodge an FIR suo motu after the poster was found in the Mahishda market area on Friday night. The poster asked villagers of booths 176 and 179 under Keshpur assembly constituency, where BJP had got a lead, to boycott its local organizers. It also asked shop and tea stall owners to stop selling items to 18 BJP karyakartas. The fatwa issued purportedly by the Mahishda Trinamool warned of a heft penalty on traders if they failed to comply with the orders without “consent of the party”. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta said: “The blacklist prepared by a local unit of the ruling party in Bengal isn’t unique. The idea is to break the morale and economic backbone of karyakartas.” BJP workers complained that similar leaflets were being distributed in Keshpur. “Trinamool is trying to create an atmosphere of terror in the Ghatal area. A party may lose an election, but that does not mean that people have to be ostracized,” said BJP Ghatal leader Tanmay Ghosh. Trinamool Ghatal MP Dev Adhikari, however, refuted the charges and said the poster was not issued by anyone from Trinamool. Mahishda Trinamool leaders also lodged a police complaint saying the party’s name used as header of the leaflets was incorrect and appeared to be the handiwork of amateurs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-bjp-war-of-words-over-boycott-poster-in-ghatal/articleshow/83267831.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Ranchi||DLSA starts Cov training prog for undertrial prisoners about to be released on bail||Ranchi:The District Legal Service Authority (DLSA) of Ranchi on Saturday started a three-day online programme for training undertrial prisoners on ways to protect themselves from Covid-19 after release on provisional bail under a special drive to decongest jails. As many as 215 prisoners lodged at Birsa Munda Central jail would undergo the training. The courts of Ranchi judgeship would consider their bail petitions and give the verdict soon. Notably, a high-powered committee formed to prevent Covid-19 among prisoners ordered to grant bail with the aim to check overcrowding in jails. The prisoners who get seven years or less punishment if convicted are being considered for bail. The training programme conducted by Art of Living (AoL) comprises modes of Covid appropriate measures, yoga exercises for increasing immunity, including pranayam and meditation, food habits and daily routine. Taking part in the inaugural session, judicial commissioner (in-charge) Sudanshu Shekhar Sashi said, “The training will not only save prisoners from Covid but also help them lead a tension-free and a healthy life.” DLSA secretary Abhishek Kumar said the undertrial prisoners are living in a secluded atmosphere where they are not fully aware about Covid and its impact. An orientation programme will help them face the situation outside. It would attach them to spiritualism and encourage them live cordially with others, he said. AoL trainer and expert mediator DLSA P N Singh said his organisation has trained prisoners of Birsa Munda Central jail in the past as well but guiding them on how to protect their lives from a pandemic is new and a matter of pride. He said, “Once the prisoners take to yoga and meditation their tendency to violate laws will also reduce. At the end of each programme, we are making them take a pledge to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and take vaccine when their turn comes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dlsa-starts-cov-training-prog-for-undertrial-prisoners-about-to-be-released-on-bail/articleshow/83267251.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Youths cut carbon footprint by composting food waste||VADODARA: A group of college students and young professionals have joined hands to tackle the problem of climate change in Vadodara. Under the banner of Vadaavaran Collective, these volunteers started a waste-to-value cycle model last year during the Covid-19 induced pandemic. The moniker is a combination of two words – Vad (meaning Banyan tree of Vadodara) and ‘Vataavaran’ (meaning the environment). In this drive, raw organic food waste from households and societies in Vasna, Alkapuri and Gorwa areas of the city is collected and then composted in a plot loaned by the Baroda Industrial Development Corporation (BIDC). After it is processed into decomposed nutrient rich compost, it is given back to the same households to support their own green environs. Vadaavaran had participated in the Gigatonne Challenge, a global response to climate action where over 20 teams from around the world had come together to reduce Co2 emissions in their respective cities. It was recently selected for the Swachata Saarthi fellowship, a government sponsored grant under the ‘waste to wealth’ mission of the Swacchhta Abhiyaan. The grant grant supports community waste-to-wealth initiatives with monthly funds across the country. “Within five months, we successfully collected over 2,000 kg of food waste, generated over 200 kg of compost and reduced over five tonnes of Co2e (greenhouse gasses) emissions,” said Rajasi Rastogi, one of the founding members of Vadaavaran. When raw food is mixed with plastic waste and goes to landfills, it releases harmful greenhouse gases and contributes to the larger problem of waste generation. “Every 400 kg of food waste composted can save up to one tonne of CO2e gases from being released into the environment,” said Rastogi, 26, who has studied industrial design from the University of Illinois. A third-year economics student from Symbiosis Pune, Kruti Nakum, who has been in the city due to lockdown said, “We wanted to create a waste-to-value cycle using discarded fruit and vegetable peels and turning these into manure for gardens and making people interested in growing organic vegetables. It, thereby, kills two birds with one stone!” Rastogi further said that the group wants to scale up this initiative to societies and organisations across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/youths-cut-carbon-footprint-by-composting-food-waste/articleshow/83266523.cms||Prashant Rupera

A potentially fatal fungal infection, mucormycosis spreads rapidly from the nose and sinuses to the face, jaw, eyes, and brain, entailing expensive treatment and long hospitalisation. Hundreds of families are shelling out lakhs on anti-fungal drugs, the prices of which have rocketed in recent weeks following a spike in cases. Health minister K Sudhakar said of 1,784 cases of mucormycosis reported in the state, 111 patients have died while only 62 have recovered. The rest are under treatment. "The government is contemplating a price cap on treatment in private hospitals and inclusion of mucormycosis treatment under Ayushman Bharat Arogya Karnataka scheme as several patients do not have insurance," he said. Treatment burden making patients flock to govt hosps: DoctorsThe cost of treatment, especially in private hospitals, can go up to Rs 3 lakh. Moreover, with the relatives of patients being told to bring the medicines on their own — mainly Liposomal Amphotericin-B and Amphotericin-B injections — medicine prices have surged, besides leading to blackmarketing and a price surge. Doctors say the burden of treatment is driving mucormycosis patients to flock to government hospitals which are already crowded. Neighbouring Maharashtra has already capped treatment cost for the fungal infection. In bigger cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur (A-category cities), it is Rs 4,000 per day for normal ward, Rs 7,500 for ICU and Rs 9,000 for ventilator. ENT (ear-nose-throat) surgeries are capped at Rs 38,000-65,000 in these cities. Sudhakar said 9,750 vials of Amphotericin B have been allocated to Karnataka by the Centre of which 8,860 vials have been received yesterday. In all, 18,650 vials have been received so far, of which 8,860 vials have been used by government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-to-cap-mucormycosis-treatment-cost-minister/articleshow/83274286.cms||---

Both Trinamool and BJP members confirmed Bera’s association with the said Bengal politician. According to the FIR against Bera, he had taken Rs 2 lakh from Ashokenagar resident Sujit Dey between July and September 2019, promising Dey a Group-D job in the irrigation and waterways department. The FIR alleged that Bera, along with another person, had entered into a “criminal conspiracy” with other persons and taken the money promising a job that was not there. The FIR alleged that the accused even showed fake appointment letters with Bengal government symbols and emblems to Dey. The complainant claimed that the accused neither provided him a job, nor returned his money. Police said that, prima facie, it was not just one complaint, but there could be several similar plaints against Bera. “We are trying to find out the other cases,” a police source said.

The official, part of the team prescribing the treatment protocol to the zoo authorities, said epidemiological research showed a mild replication of the virus among dogs, but was not being transmitted. For big cats, it could be spread by humans, mainly when feed is taken to the enclosures. Feed should be placed in the enclosures before the animals are released and social distancing should be maintained among lions and tigers, he said. On Saturday, head of the forest department S Yuvaraj visited the zoo and instructed officials to follow the treatment protocol. A zoo source said among the animals that tested positive, lionesses Kavitha and Buvana are responding slowly.

---||India||Poster asks shops to boycott Bengal BJP men; ostracisation, says Nirmala Sitharaman||GHATAL/KOLKATA: A poster asking shop owners not to sell anything to 18 BJP organisers of a Midnapore village sent shockwaves in political circles on Saturday reaching up to Delhi. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted against the way people were being “ostracised” in a Bengal village. “This is shocking. Would urge CM @MamataOfficial to see that ALL citizens in West Bengal are protected and not ostracised or denied the basics. Otherwise, a true shame,” Sitharaman posted. The tweet prompted the West Midnapore police to lodge an FIR suo motu after the poster was found in the Mahishda market area on Friday night. The poster asked villagers of booths 176 and 179 under Keshpur assembly constituency, where BJP had got a lead, to boycott its local organisers. It also asked shop and tea stall owners to stop selling items to 18 BJP karyakartas. The fatwa, issued purportedly by the Mahishda Trinamool, warned of a heft penalty on traders if they failed to comply with the orders without “consent of the party”. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta said: “ The idea is to break the morale and economic backbone of karyakartas, using the cover of media silence & police complicity.” BJP workers complained that similar leaflets were being distributed in Keshpur. Trinamool Ghatal MP Dev Adhikari, however, said the poster was not issued by anyone from Trinamool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/poster-asks-shops-to-boycott-bengal-bjp-men-ostracisation-says-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/83274501.cms||Sujoy Khanra
