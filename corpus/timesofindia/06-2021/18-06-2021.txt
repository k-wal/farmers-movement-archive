India is still quite behind China in terms of border infrastructure but “all-out efforts are being made to narrow the gap”, even as 50,000 to 60,000 troops continue to remain forward deployed along the frontier, say officers. Towards enhancing border connectivity, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday e-inaugurated 12 roads built by Border Roads Organization (BRO), which includes a 20-km Kimin-Potin double lane one and nine others in Arunachal Pradesh as well as one each in Ladakh and J&K. “India seeks peace but knows how to respond befittingly if anyone shows us an aggressive attitude,” he said, at the event in Lakhimpur district of Assam. The two-day Army commanders’ conference, chaired by General M M Naravane, also kicked off in Delhi on Thursday to discuss the operational situation along the borders with China and Pakistan. China has so far declined to complete the stalled disengagement process at Hot Springs, Gogra and Demchok in eastern Ladakh, let alone stop blocking Indian patrols in the strategically-located Depsang Plains. It has also upgraded infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control in terms of roads, troop accommodations, helipads and surface-to-air missiles positions, as was earlier reported by TOI. India, too, has cranked up its efforts. Overall, BRO has completed 1,200-km of “road formation works” and 2,850-km of “surfacing works” over the last one year. “Of the 1,200-km figure, just 162-km is in Rajasthan. The rest is distributed all along the northern border from J&K to Arunachal,” an official told TOI. There is also much-needed progress in the slow pace of construction of the 73 “strategically-important roads”, totaling 4,643-km along the China front, which were first approved way back in 1999. Of the 61 roads (totaling 3,323-km) roads with BRO, around 45 have been fully completed, while “connectivity” has been achieved on 59. “Seven of the last nine roads that will be left this year will be completed by March 2022, and the other two by March 2023,” said another official. Similarly, BRO has “completed” 74 permanent bridges and 33 bailey bridges over the last one year. “Some forward locations, like Yangtse in Arunachal, have also been connected,” he added. As for mountain passes in the higher reaches of Himalayas, several of them ranging from Zoji La, Lachung La and Shinkun La to Baralacha La and Nakee La have been opened much ahead of time this year. “The early opening of these passes has led to crores being saved on air sustenance efforts,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-cranking-up-border-infrastructure-to-narrow-gap-with-china/articleshow/83616608.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Row resolved, serial shoots to return to normal from Friday||KOLKATA: The controversy regarding shooting of serials has been resolved with the timely intervention of state minister Aroop Biswas who is also the chairperson of telly academy, chairperson of Trinamool Congress’ cultural cell Raj Chakraborty and actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee. On Thursday evening, they held a meeting with members of Welfare Association of Television Producers (WATP), Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) and channel heads. A decision was taken to resume normal shooting from Friday.  Problems came up when the FCTWEI blacklisted 20 serials - ‘Krishnakali’, ‘Titli’, ‘Aparajita Apu’, ‘Gramer Rani Binapani’, ‘Baran’, ‘Khelaghar’, ‘Jamuna Dhaki’, ‘Gangaram’, ‘Jibansathi’, ‘Mithai’, ‘Sanjher Bati’, ‘Khorkuto’, ‘Sreemoyee’, ‘Mohor’, ‘Desher Mati’, ‘Rimli’, ‘Ogo Nirupama’, ‘Felna’, ‘Dhrubotara’ and ‘Ki Kore Bolbo Tomae’ – for flouting norms while “shooting at home” and sought an explanation for the same from WATP. The Federation also refused to cooperate during the shooting of any new serials unless producers signed the MOU. Shooting of most of the blacklisted serials started on Wednesday with a skeletal unit. In some cases, few technicians who are FCTWEI members, also participated in the shooting. FCTWEI president Swarup Biswas declined to pass any comments about Thursday’s meeting. “It has been decided that all comments will be given by Aroop Biswas, Raj Chakraborty and Parambrata Chatterjee,” he said.  Comparing the industry to a big joint family, Biswas said, “Broadcasters, channels, artists and technicians are all part of that one big joint family. Everything can be resolved once we sit down and talk to each other. Most importantly, work needs to be done. We will have a series of meetings to thrash out all issues.”  Chakraborty told TOI that the chief minister had given responsibility to the three to sort out this issue. “She wanted the shooting of serials to resume immediately. That is what was decided after we spoke to all stakeholders. The next meeting will be on June 24 to streamline issues further,” said the director and Trinamool Congress MLA.  Chatterjee said it is “important” to hold on to “certain principals and structures”. “Objectively, both the sides have valid arguments and reasons to be miffed with each other. These things happen all the time. More so, during a situation like a pandemic. We have managed to negotiate and get the shooting started from Friday. The grievances on both sides remain and we will try to iron them out over the next two weeks,” he said. The actor-director added that Chakraborty and his active involvement in “grievance management” is aimed at rationalizing issues and achieving a “seamless communication between conflicting stake holders”.  Director Saibal Banerjee, who is the president of Welfare Association of Television Producers (WATP), told TOI, “Our proposal for normal resumption of shooting and lifting of non-cooperation by FCTWEI was accepted. However, we had no face-to-face meeting with FCTWEI. We will all start shooting on Friday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/row-resolved-serial-shoots-to-return-to-normal-from-friday/articleshow/83616460.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||World||Joe Biden signs bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday||President Joe Biden signed legislation Thursday establishing a new federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery, saying he believes it will go down as one of the greatest honors he has as president. Biden signed into law a bill to make Juneteenth, or June 19, the 12th federal holiday. The House voted 415-14 on Wednesday to send the bill to Biden, while the Senate passed the bill unanimously the day before. "This is a day of profound weight and profound power, a day in which we remember the moral stain, the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take," Biden said. Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas -- two months after the Confederacy had surrendered. That was also about 2 1/2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in the Southern states. It's the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created in 1983. One of the federal holidays, Inauguration Day, happens every four years. The US Office of Personnel Management, which is the human resources office for the federal government, tweeted Thursday that most federal employees will observe the new holiday -- Juneteenth National Independence Day -- on Friday since June 19 falls on a Saturday this year. Biden noted the overwhelming support for the bill from lawmakers in both parties. He had run for president promising to unite the country and work with Republicans, but his first major legislation to provide more Covid relief to American consumers and businesses was passed along party lines and he has struggled to unite lawmakers to support a major public works bill. "I hope this is the beginning of a change in the way we deal with one another," Biden said. Biden signed the legislation surrounded by members of the Congressional Black Caucus as well as the lead sponsors of the legislation in the Senate, Sens. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and John Cornyn, R-Texas. He was introduced by Vice President Kamala Harris, the nation's first African-American vice president. "We have come far and we have far to go, but today is a day of celebration," Harris said. The White House moved quickly to hold the signing ceremony after the House debated the bill and then voted for it Wednesday. "Our federal holidays are purposely few in number and recognize the most important milestones," said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. "I cannot think of a more important milestone to commemorate than the end of slavery in the United States." Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, speaking next to a large poster of a Black man whose back bore massive scarring from being whipped, said she would be in Galveston on Saturday to celebrate along with Cornyn. "Can you imagine?," said Jackson Lee. ``I will be standing maybe taller than Sen. Cornyn, forgive me for that, because it will be such an elevation of joy.'' The Senate passed the bill Tuesday under a unanimous consent agreement that expedites the process for considering legislation. It takes just one senator's objection to block such agreements. The vote comes as lawmakers struggle to overcome divisions on police reform legislation following the killing of George Floyd by police and as Republican state legislators push what experts say is an unprecedented number of bills aimed at restricting access to the ballot box. While Republicans say the goal is to prevent voter fraud, Democrats contend that the measures are aimed at undermining minority voting rights. Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus went to the floor Wednesday to speak in favor of the bill. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., said she viewed Juneteenth as a commemoration rather than a celebration because it represented something that was delayed in happening. "It also reminds me of what we don't have today," she said. "And that is full access to justice, freedom and equality. All these are often in short supply as it relates to the Black community." Some Republican lawmakers opposed the effort. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., said creating the federal holiday was an effort to celebrate "identity politics." "Since I believe in treating everyone equally, regardless of race, and that we should be focused on what unites us rather than our differences, I will vote no," he said in a press release. The vast majority of states recognize Juneteenth as a holiday or have an official observance of the day, and most states hold celebrations. Juneteenth is a paid holiday for state employees in Texas, New York, Virginia and Washington. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said he would vote for the bill and that he supported the establishment of a federal holiday, but he was upset that the name of the holiday included the word "independence" rather than "emancipation." "Why would the Democrats want to politicize this by coopting the name of our sacred holiday of Independence Day?," Higgins asked. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., replied, "I want to say to my white colleagues on the other side: Getting your independence from being enslaved in a country is different from a country getting independence to rule themselves." She added, "We have a responsibility to teach every generation of Black and white Americans the pride of a people who have survived, endured and succeeded in these United States of America despite slavery." The 14 House Republicans who voted against the bill are Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Ronny Jackson of Texas, Doug LaMalfa of California, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Tom McClintock of California, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Mike Rogers of Alabama, Matt Rosendale of Montana, Chip Roy of Texas and Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-to-sign-bill-making-juneteenth-a-federal-holiday/articleshow/83616860.cms||---

---||India||Mehul Choksi remanded to state prison in Dominica, but to remain in hospital: Lawyer||NEW DELHI: A magistrate court in Dominica on Thursday moved businessman Mehul Choksi from police custody to a state prison, his lawyer in India said, but added that he would continue to remain in hospital as his medical condition "deteriorated". "Yes, (Choksi's) police custody has been changed to prison custody but he shall remain in hospital as his medical condition has deteriorated," lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said. His legal team had submitted a medical certificate from doctors at the Dominica China Friendship Hospital, where Choksi is undergoing treatment, of "mental stress" and elevated blood pressure. The change in custody is being seen as a ray of hope for India which has approached the Dominica High Court seeking to be impleaded as a party in the case filed by lawyers of Choksi whose bail plea was earlier rejected. Choksi is wanted in India in a case of loan fraud worth about Rs 13,500 crore in the state-run Punjab National Bank. The CBI and the Ministry of External Affairs have sought to be impleaded in the habeas corpus matter, which seeks return of Choksi to Antigua and Barbuda, by filing two affidavits in the Dominica High Court, officials said here. The central agency is likely to focus on establishing criminal culpability of Choksi, fugitive status, pending warrants against him, Red Notice and charge sheets while the Ministry of External Affairs will argue that Choksi continues to be an Indian citizen, they said. The affidavits, if admitted by the high court, will pave the way for noted lawyer Harish Salve pleading India's case in Dominica, they said. The fresh development seems to indicate that India stands a chance to be heard and make a legal attempt to bring the fugitive diamantaire back to the country and face a trial. The CBI had on Wednesday filed a supplementary charge sheet against him alleging him of having prior knowledge of the impending Enforcement Directorate (ED) enquiries against him in 2017 which triggered him to plan his escape from India and cover his tracks by concealing evidence. The CBI in its supplementary charge sheet has invoked Section 201 of the IPC among other charges which pertain to the destruction of evidence by a suspect as part of criminal conspiracy. Choksi has been admitted at the Dominica China Friendship Hospital since May 29 after being held by the authorities of the Caribbean island country for "illegal entry" on May 24, a charge denied by him. His lawyers in Dominica have contended that Choksi was removed from Antigua and Barbuda, where as a citizen he enjoys rights to approach the British Privy Council as the last resort in cases on his citizenship and extradition, to Dominica where these rights are not available to him. "The aim was to remove him from Antigua to Dominica was to diminish his protection under the law. Choksi has ongoing proceedings in Antigua in regards to attempts by the Prime Minister to remove his citizenship, the only citizenship that he possesses, and to extradite him to India," his lawyer had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mehul-choksi-remanded-to-state-prison-in-dominica-but-to-remain-in-hospital-lawyer/articleshow/83617731.cms||---

The 67-year-old Romania guided Churchill to a fourth-place finish in the 2018-19 season and was later replaced by Spaniard Fernando Varela, who has since moved to I-League debutants Sreenidhi FC. Varela was on the cusp of glory and almost handed Churchill their third title until they lost their way and were forced to settle for the second spot on the final match day. Gigiu will now have to work from scratch with all four foreigners having left the club. “These were really good (foreign) players we had. However, they couldn’t extend their stay due to personal reasons. We have retained most of the Indian players and the process to identify new foreigners has already started. We have already appointed coach Petre Gigiu,” Churchill CEO Valanka Alemao told TOI on Thursday. Churchill will surely miss centre-back Hamza Kheir who was adjudged as the Best Defender in I-League. He has returned to Lebanon where he joined AFC Cup champions Al Ahed. “It was the first time Hamza played out of Lebanon and he had promised us that he would play only for Churchill Brothers in India. Hopefully, we will have a stronger side this season as well,” said Valanka. Churchill will also miss the services of star forwards Slovenian Luca Majcen (11 goals) and Honduran Clayvin Zuniga (8 goals) who set the league on fire in the initial stages until injuries slowed them down. The pair had scored 19 of the club's 22 goals. Meanwhile, captain and defensive midfielder Bazie Armand has moved to Libyan outfit Abu Salem SC. “We thank you all for helping us mount a serious title challenge and almost helping us clinch our third title. You’ll will always be part of the red machine family and we wish you’ll good luck in your next chapter,” the club said in a social media post||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/petre-gigiu-returns-to-coach-churchill-bros/articleshow/83617888.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||World||Joe Biden elevates energetic critic of Big Tech as top regulator||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Tuesday installed an energetic critic of Big Tech as a top federal regulator at a time when the industry is under intense pressure from Congress, regulators and state attorneys general.  The selection of legal scholar Lina Khan to head the Federal Trade Commission is seen as signaling a tough stance toward tech giants Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Khan was sworn in as FTC chair just hours after the Senate confirmed her as one of five members of the commission on a 69-28 vote.  Khan has been a professor at Columbia University Law School and burst onto the antitrust scene with her massive scholarly work in 2017 as a Yale law student, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox." She helped lay the foundation for a new way of looking at antitrust law beyond the impact of big-company market dominance on consumer prices. As counsel to a House Judiciary antitrust panel in 2019 and 2020, she played a key role in a sweeping bipartisan investigation of the market power of the tech giants.  At 32, she is believed to be the youngest chair in the history of the FTC, which polices competition and consumer protection in industry generally as well as digital privacy.  "Lina brings deep knowledge and expertise to this role and will be a fearless champion for consumers," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has called for tech industry breakups, said in a statement. "Giant tech companies deserve the growing scrutiny they are facing, and consolidation is choking off competition across American industries. With Chair Khan at the helm, we have a huge opportunity to make big, structural change by reviving antitrust enforcement and fighting monopolies that threaten our economy, our society and our democracy."  Khan also was a legal adviser to Rohit Chopra, an FTC commissioner, and was previously legal director of the Open Markets Institute, an organization that advocates against corporate concentration.  "It is a tremendous honor to have been selected by President Biden to lead the Federal Trade Commission," Khan said in a statement. "I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect the public from corporate abuse."  Biden said as a presidential candidate that dismantling the big tech companies should be considered. He also has said he wants to see quickly crimped the social media companies' long-held legal protections for speech on their platforms.  Biden in March appointed Tim Wu, also an academic expert on antitrust and industry critic, as a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy within the National Economic Council. Wu, like Khan a Columbia law professor, has been a senior adviser to the FTC and a senior enforcement attorney in the New York attorney general's office.  The tech industry, once lionized by lawmakers and presidents as an engine of innovation and jobs, has seen its political fortunes eroded in recent years. Calls have been rising to break up the Silicon Valley giants.  Lawmakers of both parties champion stronger oversight of the tech industry, arguing that its massive market power is out of control, crushing smaller competitors and endangering consumers' privacy. They say the companies hide behind a legal shield to allow false information to flourish on their social media networks or to entrench bias.  Last fall the Trump Justice Department, joined by states, filed a ground-breaking antitrust lawsuit against Google, accusing the search giant of abusing its market dominance to stifle competition. That was followed in December by another big antitrust suit against Facebook, brought by the FTC and an array of states.  Amazon and Apple are under scrutiny by antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department, now in Biden's purview, and the independent, bipartisan FTC. Twitter has joined Facebook and Google in facing frequent run-ins with lawmakers over its policies for moderating content on its platform.  A bipartisan group of House lawmakers, animated by the results of the Judiciary panel investigation of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, proposed sweeping legislation Friday to rein in Big Tech, possibly forcing the giants to break up their businesses while making it harder for them to acquire others. Those kinds of mandated breakups through a legislative overhaul would be a radical step for Congress to take and could be a bridge too far for some Republican lawmakers.  Some Republican lawmakers have denounced the new school of antitrust thought, championed by Khan and Wu and gaining currency among Democrats, that looks beyond the impact of big-company market dominance on consumer prices to its broader effects on industries, employees and communities.  The school is called "hipster antitrust" by its detractors. With this approach, Democrats are seeking to use antitrust law not to promote competition but to advance social or environmental goals, the Republicans contend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-elevates-energetic-critic-of-big-tech-as-top-regulator/articleshow/83618068.cms||---

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) gave details of the evaluation policy formulated after consulting experts to a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari and said Class 12 results would be out before July 31. While 14.5 lakh Class 12 students appear for the CBSE board, nearly 1 lakh take the exams conducted by CISCE. Attorney general K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, and solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBSE, told the court that the academic performance of each student in Classes 10 (best three) and 11 as well as the marks or grades obtained in unit and term examinations in Class 12 and practicals would be taken in a graded weightage — 30% each for Class 10 and 11, and 40% for Class 12. Keeping in mind the disruptions in Class 12 assessments due to Covid-19, schools have been given leeway in deciding whether to take all assessments (unit tests, mid-terms, pre-boards) or just the pre-boards into account or a combination. This would be done by a "results committee" in every school. Senior advocate Janakalyan Das informed the bench that the CISCE will consider the performance of students in the past six years in awarding marks and grades for Class 12. The entire mechanism appears to favour consistent performers rather than those who display a surprise sparkle in the board exams though the policy attempts to provide avenues for students who changed boards or are taking them for the first time. Read AlsoRoad to college just got trickier than everThe Union education ministry and University Grants Commission are going to revive the discussion on the Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) next week.The boards explained that just taking into account Class 12 results may not reflect the potential of students taking online exams in an unfamiliar setting. So, using the Class 10 board results was useful as it was the only public exam the current Class 12 students had taken. The Class 11 exams were held in pre-Covid times and on the basis of the prescribed senior secondary syllabus. Read Also30:30:40 formula (X, XI &amp; pre-boards) for XII marks?Students of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class XII are likely to have their results based on their performance in the finals of class X and XI exams and class XII pre-board tests. Principals told TOI that the CBSE-appointed 13-member committee to recommend the criteria to evaluateThe SC bench noted its in-principle acceptance of the scheme after every petitioner conveyed that they had no grievance against the evaluation mechanism. The bench warded off senior advocate Vikas Singh's plea for conducting a physical board examination for Class 12 students and asked the two boards to finalise the scheme and notify it after incorporating a grievance redressal mechanism for students after declaration of results. Read AlsoShadow of Class XI over boards irks students in DelhiStudents of government and private schools alike are unhappy about Class XI marks being included in the final assessment formula for Class XII, board exams for which were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Their argument is that in Class XI, they are introduced to new subjects and in adjustingVenugopal informed the court that the CBSE has made a provision for holding physical examination for those students who want to improve their marks later when the situation normalises and that such scores would be final for those who decide to take the option. He said the dates for the physical examination would be announced after the declaration of results, subject to the prevailing pandemic situation. The bench said, "After perusing the scheme, prima facie we have no reservation in accepting the same and permit the boards to proceed on that basis. However, the scheme must incorporate a provision for a dispute resolution committee in case some students have grievances against the marks/grades awarded to them after the final results. The boards will also incorporate in the scheme a timeline for declaration of results and the optional improvement physical examination." Under the CBSE evaluation scheme, a five-member "results committee’ will be constituted in each school under the principal and will consist of two senior-most PGTs from the same school and two PGT from neighbouring schools. The committee has been given liberty to prepare the results by following the policy. Given the varied internal evaluation system for Class 11 and 12 in schools, ranging between the strict and the liberal, the CBSE said it would adopt a moderation mechanism to minimise the advantage to a section of Class 12 students who study in schools known for their liberal marking systems. "As marks of Class 11 and Class 12 components will be awarded at school level, they will strictly not be comparable across schools due to the variations in the quality of question papers, the evaluation standard and processes, the mode of conduct of exams etc. Therefore, to ensure standardisation, each school will have to internally moderate the marks to account for school level variations by using a reliable reference standard," the CBSE said.

The pre-submission meeting of the Indian vaccine maker with WHO officials is now planned for June 23 as per the latest WHO EUL guidance document dated June 16, uploaded on the WHO website. However, Covaxin’s dossier would be complete and taken up for review by WHO only after the company submits the entire phase-3 clinical trials data, a senior Bharat Biotech official told TOI. An interim analysis of Covaxin’s Phase-3 trials, conducted on 25,800 volunteers across India, had indicated an overall efficacy of 78%. Bharat Biotech is now conducting a phase-3 study on 4,500 volunteers in Brazil and will be conducting a trial in the US as well as part of its decision to take the Biologics Licence Application (route) for that market.

The pharmaceuticalWHO’s seal of approval would be a major booster for the desi vaccine that has found itself mired in controversy ever since the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) granted an emergency use nod on January 3 this year while its phase-3 trials were under way. A WHO EUL would open the doors of several countries for the desi vaccine and put to rest concerns about travel restrictions being imposed on those who have taken jabs not yet approved by WHO. Several countries have been mulling the vaccine passport concept, with Israel and seven European Union (EU) nations — Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece and Poland — already putting in place vaccine passport systems, even as EU is gearing up to implement the system from July 1. “We’ve been in discussions with the WHO prequalification team and they know exactly what we are doing and what status we are in,” said the top official at Bharat Biotech, which had earlier said that it expects the EUL in the July- September quarter this year. He indicated that based on the first feedback that the company received from WHO, a nod may not be a long-drawn process as the cell line and a majority of the company’s facilities, including filling lines, have already been audited and approved by WHO for other vaccines like Typhoid, Polio and Rotavirus. “The good thing is that we already have several WHO prequalified vaccines. It’s not like a new company going for WHO prequalification. All our QC, QA, everything is audited already for our other vaccines… so when they come, they make an assessment of everything, almost. They look at the quality management systems, quality control, engineering, warehouse, everything,” the official said. “The vero cell line that we are using for Covaxin is the same line that we use for the Rotavirus vaccine also. WHO has already seen it and our QC labs, water systems, everything has been audited and approved by WHO (for the other vaccines),” he added.

The NIA claims to have recovered some cash, documents and illegal arms and ammunition. Read AlsoEx-junior-turned-rival key to Sharma’s arrestMUMBAI: Encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma is close to several influential politicians in Maharashtra and the Centre, but none could save him this time. It is believed that Sharma’s former junior officer-turned-rival played a crucial part in unearthing his role in the Antilia explosives case whichWhile seeking custody, special NIA public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves told the court the role of Sharma has now surfaced, hence they have arrested him. He said they want to ascertain the deep-rooted conspiracy in the case. The court rejected Gonsalves’ request to disallow the media inside the court as it was a sensitive case. According to the NIA, on March 4, dismissed policemen Sachin Waze and Sunil Mane handed over Hiran to four accused — Santosh Shellar, Anand Jadhav, Satish and Soni at Hotel Hill View at Ghodbunder Road in Thane. The four took him in a Tavera car, smothered him to death and dumped his body in the creek at the behest of Waze and Sharma. Shellar and Jadhav, both Malad residents who were arrested last Saturday, have also shown the place where they dumped Hiran’s body, NIA claimed. The killers spoke to Waze and Sharma before and after the crime, the NIA said. Gonsalves said the key accused need to be confronted with each other, without which investigations cannot be completed. “There are other people also involved in the larger conspiracy, hence we want 14 days’ police custody.” The vehicle laden with explosives was found on February 25, and Hiran’s body was found in a creek in Mumbra on March 5. NIA sources said Sharma is accused of attending conspiracy meetings held at the police headquarters on March 2 and 4 between him and Waze and two other officers. Another meeting also took place at Sharma’s office in Andheri, where Mane is believed to have handed over a SIM card to be used in the crime. After Hiran’s murder, one SIM card was active up to the point of Sharma’s house at J B Nagar, NIA said. All the accused were in touch with Sharma before and after the crime. Sharma is also accused of procuring gelatin sticks from a Thane-based businessman, who is his friend. Judge Sitre asked NIA officials why they didn’t arrest Sharma if they had unearthed a conspiracy when they had arrested police inspector Sunil Mane. On the judge’s demand, NIA superintendent of police Vikram Khalate showed him the case diary. Gonsalves told the court, “We had information about Sharma’s role in the crime but then he was just a suspect and we were collecting evidence. He is an ex-police officer who knows how to dodge the investigating agency. He is a tough nut to crack and in fact, he initially misled the agency. We have got traces of DNA samples collected from the Tavera, which belonged to Jadhav. A lot of money has been distributed to the accused by Waze and Sharma, which needs to be ascertained. There are a few more people involved who are to be arrested.” Sharma’s lawyer Sudeep Pasbola argued there was no material evidence to link his client’s role in the case and said he has been cooperating with the agency whenever summoned. Sharma sought permission to speak, and the court asked him to come into the witness box. Dressed in blue jeans and a white shirt, Sharma said, “Sir, I am not involved in the crime. I have been made a scapegoat in the fight between two lobbies in the police department. I don’t know these two people who have been arrested along with me. If I was involved, why would I be sleeping in my house, I would have run away. I only know Santosh Shellar as he has been my informant for 12 years. I run an NGO, PS Foundation. There are unknown people who come and pose for photographs with me, and as far as seizure of the revolver is concerned, it was gifted to me by former police commissioner Subhash Malhotra. Its licence has expired and I forgot to renew it.” With this, the number of persons arrested in the case is 10. Earlier, NIA arrested four other policemen: Waze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane and former constable Vinayak Shinde. Sources said Sharma’s role cropped up after Shellar and Jadhav spilled the beans before the NIA. In fact, when Shellar and Jadhav were produced before Judge Shitre at his house on Sunday for remand, Jadhav reportedly told them Sharma was part of the conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/encounter-specialist-pradeep-sharma-held-in-antilia-hiran-case/articleshow/83618855.cms||Ahmed Ali

But the mighty lake - a linchpin in a system of aqueducts and reservoirs in the arid US West that makes California possible - is shrinking with surprising speed amid a severe drought, with state officials predicting it will reach a record low later this summer.  While droughts are common in California, this year's is much hotter and drier than others, evaporating water more quickly from the reservoirs and the sparse Sierra Nevada snowpack that feeds them. The state's more than 1,500 reservoirs are 50% lower than they should be this time of year, according to Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California-Davis.  Over Memorial Day weekend, dozens of houseboats sat on cinderblocks at Lake Oroville because there wasn't enough water to hold them. Blackened trees lined the reservoir's steep, parched banks.  At nearby Folsom Lake, normally bustling boat docks rested on dry land, their buoys warning phantom boats to slow down. Campers occupied dusty riverbanks farther north at Shasta Lake.  But the impacts of dwindling reservoirs go beyond luxury yachts and weekend anglers. Salmon need cold water from the bottom of the reservoirs to spawn. The San Francisco Bay needs fresh water from the reservoirs to keep out the salt water that harms freshwater fish. Farmers need the water to irrigate their crops. Businesses need reservoirs full so people will come play in them and spend money.  And everyone needs the water to run hydroelectric power plants that supply much of the state's energy.  If Lake Oroville falls below 640 feet (195 meters) - which it could do by late August - state officials would shut down a major power plant for just the first time ever because of low water levels, straining the electrical grid during the hottest part of the summer.  In Northern California's Butte County, low water prompts another emotion: fear. The county suffered the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century in 2018 when 85 people died. Last year, another 16 people died in a wildfire.  Walking along the Bidwell Canyon trail last week, 63-year-old Lisa Larson was supposed to have a good view of the lake. Instead, she saw withered grass and trees.  "It makes me feel like our planet is literally drying up," she said. "It makes me feel a little unsettled because the drier it gets, the more fires we are going to have."  Droughts are a part of life in California, where a Mediterranean-style climate means the summers are always dry and the winters are not always wet. The state's reservoirs act as a savings account, storing water in the wet years to help the state survive during the dry ones.  Last year was the third driest on record in terms of precipitation. Temperatures hit triple digits in much of California over the Memorial Day weekend, earlier than expected. State officials were surprised earlier this year when about 500,000 acre feet (61,674 hectare meters) of water they were expecting to flow into reservoirs never showed up. One acre-foot is enough water to supply up to two households for one year.  "In the previous drought, it took (the reservoirs) three years to get this low as they are in the second year of this drought," Lund said.  The lake's record low is 646 feet (197 meters), but the Department of Water Resources projects it will dip below that sometime in August or September. If that happens, the state will have to close the boat ramps for the first time ever because of low water levels, according to Aaron Wright, public safety chief for the Northern Buttes District of California State Parks. The only boat access to the lake would be an old dirt road that was built during the dam's construction in the late 1960s.  "We have a reservoir up there that's going to be not usable. And so now what?" said Eric Smith, an Oroville City Council member and president of its chamber of commerce.  The water level is so low at Lake Mendocino, along the Russian River in Northern California, that state officials last week reduced the amount of water heading to 930 farmers, businesses and other junior water-rights holders.  "Unless we immediately reduce diversions, there is a real risk of Lake Mendocino emptying by the end of this year," said Erik Ekdahl, deputy director for the State Water Board's Division of Water Rights.  Low water levels across California will severely limit how much power the state can generate from hydroelectric power plants. When Lake Oroville is full, the Edward Hyatt Power Plant and others nearby can generate up to 900 megawatts of power, according to Behzad Soltanzadeh, chief of utility operations for the Department of Water Resources. One megawatt is enough to power between 800 and 1,000 homes.  That has some local officials worrying about power outages, especially after the state ran out of energy last summer during an extreme heat wave that prompted California's first rotating blackouts in 20 years. But energy officials say they are better prepared this summer, having obtained an additional 3,500 megawatts of capacity ahead of the scorching summer months.  The low levels are challenging for tourism officials. Bruce Spangler, president of the board of directors for Explore Butte County, grew up in Oroville and has fond memories of fishing with his grandfather and learning to launch and drive a boat before he could drive a car. But this summer, his organization has to be careful about how it markets the lake while managing visitors' expectations, he said.  "We have to be sure we don't promise something that can't be," he said.  Low lake levels haven't stopped tourists from coming yet. With coronavirus restrictions lifting across the state, Wright - the state parks official for Northern California - said attendance at most parks in his area is double what it normally is this time of year.  "People are trying to recreate and use facilities even more so (because) they know they are going to lose them here in a few months," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/drought-saps-california-reservoirs-as-hot-dry-summer-looms/articleshow/83619028.cms||---

The private agency had billed the health department Rs 3.8 crore, with a majority of the bills on behalf of testing conducted by Nalwa Laboratories in Hisar, said Dr Arjun Singh Sengar, Kumbh Mela health officer. Talking to TOI, Dr J P Nalwa, owner of Nalwa Lab, said that no one from the lab had gone to Kumbh. "We had cancelled our MoU in April with Max Corporate Services.

Even though most children have less severe Covid infection than adults and are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, those with pre-existing conditions have more severe manifestations and poorer outcomes, say the guidelines issued by the Centre for Operationalisation of Covid Care for Children and Adolescents. While Pfizer’s vaccine has been approved outside India for use in children, India is readying its own pipeline of jabs for use in kids between 12-18 years of age. While Zydus Cadila is already testing its vaccine candidate on children, Bharat Biotech is also set to initiate trials. Serum Institute of India has also expressed interest to conduct trials with Covovax in children. The Centre’s calculation is that around 25 crore doses are required for vaccinating 13-14 crore children in this age group. While 2-3% of infected children are estimated to need hospitalisation, the guidelines also suggest states and districts to prepare for additional bed capacity for paediatric care. The guidelines also suggest that an indicative projection of 5% children needing hospitalisation should be considered. Though the proportion of less than 20 years’ old is less, the sero-positivity survey showed not much of a difference in prevalence of antibodies among adults and children, indicating kids are as susceptible to infection, but most are asymptomatic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-once-a-jab-gets-nod-kids-with-co-morbidities-to-get-priority/articleshow/83619218.cms||Sushmi Dey

Findings of the study show sero-prevalence was 55.7% in the less-than-18-years group and 63.5% among adults of age 18 years and above. “The SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rate among children was high and comparable to the adult population. Hence, it is unlikely that any future third wave by prevailing Covid-19 variant would disproportionately affect children two years or older,” said a pre-print of the study published in medRxiv. The study was conducted in five selected states with a total sample size of 10,000. Data of 4,500 participants from four states were taken for midterm analysis, whereas more results are likely to come in the next two-three months. The study findings show that irrespective of the age-groups, rural sites had lower sero-positivity compared to urban areas. Within the rural sites, children had slightly lower sero-positivity compared to adults. “However, this differential prevalence was not observed in the urban sites,” the study said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/third-wave-unlikely-to-hit-kids-disproportionately-sero-study/articleshow/83619609.cms||---

However, the story of Covid deaths in June is a little complicated. In the 17 days of the month so far (with Thursday’s deaths added), the country’s coronavirus toll has increased by 52,538. Of these, at least 19,329 (37% of total) are “backlog” deaths — fatalities from a previous period added to the toll in June. Many of these deaths had occurred during April-May, or even earlier, and are being acknowledged only now. In official records, there were over 1,19,000 fatalities in May (the highest Covid toll in any country for any month) and around 48,700 deaths in April. The backlog deaths are an acknowledgement, at least by some states, that the toll in these months was even higher than these numbers. Maharashtra has declared by far the highest number of backlog deaths so far — at least 21,585 since May 17, of which 11,427 have been in June. Bihar has added 3,951 old deaths, all declared on June 9. Uttarakhand has announced close to 800 backdated deaths, most of these in May, and Punjab has added 163 between May 13 and 31. India recorded 62,331 fresh cases and 1,182 deaths on Thursday, in addition to 400 old fatalities announced by Maharashtra. The daily numbers do not include data from Jharkhand, which couldn’t be accessed till past midnight. The day’s toll was the lowest recorded in the country in over months since April 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/june-covid-toll-tops-50000-with-37-backlog-deaths/articleshow/83619768.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

It is believed that Sharma’s former junior officer-turned-rival played a crucial part in unearthing his role in the Antilia explosives case which culminated in his arrest. The officer, during his stint with state anti-terrorism squad, which first investigated the murder of Mansukh Hiran, helped the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in gathering some of the crucial evidence that culminated in the arrest of assistant police inspector Sachin Waze and now Sharma. A senior police officer said Sharma always believed that he was a ‘supercop’ because of the support extended by some officers. “But later some of the seniors dumped him when they realised that it was not in their interest to be associated with him,” the officer said. In the late 90s, Pradeep Sharma was at his peak when he gunned down gangsters in encounters. He first courted controversy for the custodial death of Ghatkopar bomb blast accused Khwaja Yunus. He escaped unscathed. In 2009, Sharma was arrested for the 2006 fake encounter of Chhota Rajan gang member Ramnarayan Gupta alias Lakhan Bhaiya. He was acquitted in the case, but in the intervening period, the state government dismissed him for his alleged underworld links. He was later reinstated following a court order. In 2014, Sharma’s NGO, PS Foundation, put up several posters of him in Andheri after he decided to contest the election from the Andheri (E) assembly constituency. He met then BJP president and home minister Amit Shah for a party ticket. But BJP, Sena, and RPI(A) contested the election jointly and the seat went to Sena. He then filed his nomination as an Independent candidate but later withdrew the nomination. In July 2019, Sharma resigned from the force to try his luck in politics. Shiv Sena denied him a ticket from the Andheri constituency, but gave him a chance to contest from Nalasopara . He lost, but decided to remain with the party. Sources said Sharma helped Sena to keep a close watch on its party MLAs during the uncertainty over the formation of the state government after the 2019 Assembly election results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ex-junior-turned-rival-key-to-sharmas-arrest/articleshow/83620067.cms||Vijay V Singh

While Pakistan’s National Assembly had recently approved the ordinance enacted to facilitate the review, India said it didn’t create the “machinery” for carrying out the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the ordinance, now Bill, invited municipal courts in Pakistan to decide whether or not any prejudice had been caused to Jadhav on account of the failure to provide consular access. This, he said, was clearly a breach of the basic tenet that municipal courts cannot be the arbiter of whether a state fulfilled its obligations in international law. “Not only this, it further invites the municipal court to sit in appeal, as it were, over the judgment of the International Court of Justice,” Bagchi said, recalling that the IC had ruled that Pakistan was in breach of its international obligations because of the failure to provide consular access to Jadhav. The MEA said the bill approved by the National Assembly only codified into law the earlier ordinance “with all its shortcomings”. Responding to queries on Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s letter to the UN on alleged efforts to carry out demographic changes in J&K, Bagchi said J&K would remain an integral part of India and Pakistan needed to stop its support to cross-border terrorism. Read AlsoIndia, Pakistan resolve the contentious visa issue for nowIndia and Pakistan pulled back Wednesday from the precipice of yet another setback to bilateral ties with the 2 countries approving the pending assignment visas for diplomats and other staff members after 2 years of strife over the issue. “The Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. No amount of questioning can change the reality. Also, cross-border terrorism is unacceptable and no amount of justification can make it acceptable,” the official said. He also confirmed that India and Pakistan had approved all pending visas for diplomats and other staff members on June 16, as first reported by TOI on Thursday. The simultaneous approval by both sides saw close to 30 Indian diplomats and other staff getting visas. India also approved all pending visas for Pakistani officials. Sources said Pakistan had been reluctant to issue assignment visas for over two years. The approvals on Wednesday followed India’s decision to recall staff members without waiting more for visas for their replacements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fix-shortcomings-in-jadhav-review-trial-bill-india-to-pakistan/articleshow/83620281.cms||---

The committee, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, has summoned several social media giants, including Facebook and Twitter, on issues related to misuse of the platforms and protection of citizens’ rights. According to a notice of the standing committee meeting on June 18, its agenda is to “hear the views of representatives of Twitter followed by evidence of representatives of electronics technology on safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social/online news media platforms, including special emphasis on women’s security in the digital space”. A senior member said there were numerous violations on Twitter as harassment of women had been reported several times. While the Centre has withdrawn Twitter’s ‘intermediary’ status and has brought it under the purview of Indian laws, the micro blogging site and the Centre have been at loggerheads on several issues for the past few months.

The good news is that, unlike in the past, none of the states or union territories for which data is available recorded an SRB – the number of girls born for every 1,000 boys born – of less than 900. The bad news is that many recorded lower ratios than in 2018 or 2017. In fact, with most states that had a low SRB in previous years showing an improvement, there seems to be a convergence towards a middling level. Assam is one of the few states where an already low ratio of 921 in 2017 has fallen steeply to 903 two years later. The data is from the annual report of the Civil Registration System for 2019. Though tribal communities have traditionally had better sex ratios than the rest, Chhattisgarh, a tribal state, has recorded the highest fall in SRB, from 968 in 2017 to 931 in 2019. In the same period, among larger states, Telangana has recorded the biggest improvement, from 915 to 953, followed by Uttarakhand, where the SRB went from 929 to 960. The World Health Organisation estimates that the natural sex ratio at birth is about 952 females to every 1,000 males. There are six states, including three from the northeast, where the SRB is higher than 952. Arunachal Pradesh had the highest ratio of 1,024 – though this was a steep fall from 1,047 – followed by Nagaland and Mizoram, which recorded 1,001 and 975 respectively, a significant improvement from 948 and 964 in 2017. In Kerala, though the SRB was still a high 960, it has worsened from 965 in 2017. Similarly, in Himachal Pradesh, it has been steadily worsening and is now 918. Punjab and Chandigarh, notorious for sex selective abortions, showed significant improvement as did Odisha, where it went up from 930 to 947. Data for Delhi was not available for 2019, though it showed an improvement between 2017 and 2018. CRS annual reports till 2016 reported SRB based on all birth registrations during the year. This tended to distort the picture because of births that had taken place in previous years but had been recorded later. As a result, the SRB is now calculated only after excluding births registered more than a year after the event. The result of this change has been that the SRB is not available for states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra or Uttar Pradesh since the data on delayed registration was not submitted by these states. However, a look at the ratio of male and female births registered in these states shows that barring Jharkhand, where it is just 881, it is well above 900 in the rest. Since registration of births after more than one year are largely of males for passports, jobs and so on, excluding such registrations is only likely to improve the sex ratio. Hence, it seems safe to assume that with the possible exception of Jharkhand, the SRB is over 900 for all states. Even Jharkhand just may have an SRB over 900. Its level of birth registration is just 84% and lower registration levels typically indicate even lower registration of female births.

Despite getting bail from the HC on Tuesday, the trio, who had been arrested in May last year under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the northeast Delhi riots conspiracy case, had to remain behind bars with Delhi Police raising a red flag on verification of address of the accused and Aadhar cards of the persons who stood surety for them. At one stage, the prosecution claimed a cop will go to Assam by train Thursday evening from Delhi, verify the permanent address of one of the accused and return to apprise the court. Teams also had to go to Jharkhand for the purpose. But a bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani made it clear in the morning session itself it expected trial judge Revinder Bedi to decide with “promptitude” and “expeditiously” the issue of the release of the three from jail. Just after being freed from the jail, Kalita told the press, “The government is trying to suppress the voice of people and dissent… it (delaying the trio’s release) shows the desperation”. Tanha said, “I hope this judgement will serve as an important precedent. Our fight against CAA, NRC and NPR will continue”. Narwal said, “the order restores our faith in the Indian judiciary that they would stand for the rights of the people and democratic dissent in this country”. The matter had reached the HC again Thursday as the jailed students moved an urgent plea saying that even after 36 hours of passing of the bail orders it is not being implemented. Since the trial court was to also take up the matter, the HC asked the counsels for the accused and police to appear before the trial court at noon and apprise it of HC’s directions. The bench said it would take up the plea again at 3.30pm. Meanwhile, the trial court ordered immediate release of trio, noting that delay in the verification process by the police cannot be a plausible reason for the accused to be kept imprisoned. Additional sessions judge Revinder Bedi also pulled up police for delay in verification of addresses and sureties noting that "this by itself cannot be a plausible reason for the accused to be kept imprisoned till the time such reports are filed". Taking note of the undertaking given by the counsel of the accused that their client will not leave the jurisdiction of the national capital, the court sent the warrant to the superintendent of the Tihar Jail for their immediate release. A day after HC ordered immediate release on bail, police had moved an application seeking more time from the court to verify their addresses, sureties and authenticity of the Aadhaar cards before releasing the accused on bail. Dismissing the prosecution application, the judge directed them to verify the addresses of the accused in Delhi and submit the report on Thursday itself by 5pm. ASJ Bedi cited the high court’s observations that once the incarcerated have been ordered to be released on bail and furnished the bail bond with sureties, they ought not to remain behind bars "even for a minute". The court said that the "State should ensure the infrastructure necessary for such verification process within minimum possible time and there cannot be any reason, sufficient enough to deny such a person his liberty." Later in HC, the lawyers informed the bench that the trial court has ordered "'immediate release" of the accused. The HC re-iterated "once the trial court has issued release orders to the jail superintendent, that is the end of the matter. Nothing more needs to be done."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-activists-walk-free-on-hcs-prod-48-hours-after-bail-order/articleshow/83621606.cms||Abhinav Garg

The court also took cognizance of the fact that the prosecution’s case didn’t say “possession or transmission was for commercial purposes”. “Of course, child pornography is a very serious issue warranting a firm approach. But I would make a distinction between a one-time consumer and those who transmit or propagate or display or distribute in digital domain,” said Justice G R Swaminathan, granting anticipatory bail to an engineer P G Sam Infant Jones, who is currently doing his PhD. According to Madurai-Tallakulam all-women police station, Infant Jones downloaded pediophilic material on June 27, 2020, and shared them with a friend through Facebook messenger. The offence was flagged by the international NGO National Center for Missing &Exploited Children, which maintains a cyber tipline. It tipped off National Crime Records Bureau in India and NCMEC, US. Based on the alert, Tallakulam police registered a case. The judge said viewing pornography privately does not constitute an offence. “As per definition in Section 40 of IPC, offence is an act that is forbidden by law and made punishable. As on date, there is no provision prohibiting such private acts,” he said. Noting that there are a few who even elevate it as a right to free expression and privacy, he clarified that child pornography falls outside this circle of freedom. Section 67-B of IT Act, 2000, penalises every kind of act pertaining to child pornography. It covers anyone who publishes or transmits material in any electronic form which depicts children engaged in sexually explicit act or conduct; or creates text or digital images, collects, seeks, browses, downloads, advertises, promotes, exchanges or distributes material depicting children in sexually explicit manner. Justice Swaminathan chose to grant relief to Infant Jones, saying he had “not come under adverse notice” since the first offence and had also extended his cooperation to the probe. On the digital alert that landed Infant Jones in the child pornography net, the judge said, “It is obvious that the moment one steps into digital space, one comes under the surveillance of the state or those manning the social networking sites. If one is zealous about privacy, the only option is to stay outside such networks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/one-time-child-porn-accused-gets-hc-relief/articleshow/83621864.cms||Kaushik Kannan

There were no immediate reports of casualties from the strikes, which were reported by local media and could be heard from Gaza City. Israel also carried out airstrikes early Wednesday, targeting what it is said were Hamas facilities, without killing or wounding anyone.  Earlier, Israeli police used stun grenades and a water cannon spraying skunk water to disperse Palestinian protesters from Damascus Gate in east Jerusalem, the epicenter of weeks of protests and clashes with police in the run-up to the Gaza war.  After the crowds were dispersed, Palestinians could be seen throwing rocks and water bottles at ultra-Orthodox Jews walking in the area.  Calls had circulated for protesters to gather at Damascus Gate in response to a rally held there by Jewish ultranationalists on Tuesday in which dozens of Israelis had chanted "Death to Arabs" and "May your village burn." The police had forcibly cleared the square and provided security for that rally, part of a parade to celebrate Israel's conquest of east Jerusalem.  In a separate incident, a Palestinian teenager died Thursday after being shot by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank during a protest against a settlement outpost, the fourth demonstrator to be killed since the outpost was established last month.  The Israeli military said Wednesday that a soldier stationed near the wildcat outpost in the West Bank saw a group of Palestinians approaching, and that one "hurled a suspicious object at him, which exploded adjacent to the soldier." The army said that the soldier fired in the air, then shot the Palestinian who threw the object.  The Palestinian Health Ministry said Thursday that Ahmad Shamsa, 15, died of a gunshot wound sustained a day earlier.  Settlers established the outpost, which they refer to as Eviatar, near the northern West Bank town of Nablus last month and say it is now home to dozens of families. Palestinians say it is built on private land and fear it will grow and merge with other large settlements nearby.  Nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers live in some 130 settlements across the occupied West Bank. The Palestinians and much of the international community view the settlements as a violation of international law and a major obstacle to peace.  Israeli authorities have evacuated the outpost on several occasions. They appear reluctant to do so this time because it would embarrass Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and other right-wing members of the fragile government sworn in over the weekend.  Palestinians from the nearby village of Beita have held several protests in which demonstrators have hurled stones and Israeli troops have fired tear gas and live ammunition. Four Palestinians have been killed since mid-May, including Shamsa and another teenager.  The Israeli military also shot and killed a Palestinian woman on Wednesday, saying she had tried to ram her car into a group of soldiers guarding a West Bank construction site.  In a statement, the army said soldiers fired at the woman in Hizmeh, just north of Jerusalem, after she exited the car and pulled out a knife. The statement did not say how close the woman was to the soldiers, and the army did not release any photos or video of the incident.  The family of Mai Afaneh insisted she had no reason or ability to carry out an attack.  In recent years, Israel has seen a series of shootings, stabbings and car ramming attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians in the occupied West Bank. Most have been carried out by Palestinians with no apparent links to organized militant groups.  Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups say the soldiers often use excessive force and could have stopped some assailants without killing them. In some cases, they say that innocent people have been identified as attackers and shot.  The Palestinians seek the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority exerts limited self-rule in population centers, as part of a future state along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Israel captured all three territories in the 1967 war and says Jerusalem is indivisible. There have been no substantive peace talks in more than a decade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-strikes-gaza-after-hamas-fires-incendiary-balloons/articleshow/83621887.cms||---

---||World||Officials: Man in boy road rage killing admitted firing gun||SANTA ANA: A Southern California man charged with killing a six-year-old boy in a road rage incident last month told police he pulled out a gun and fired at a car on the freeway after he got angry with a driver who made a rude gesture, prosecutors said. Orange County prosecutors wrote in a court document filed Wednesday that murder suspect Marcus Eriz, 24, told police on June 6 that he grabbed the loaded gun, rolled down the window and shot at the car driven by a woman who gestured toward him on a freeway while he was on his way to work on May 21. The shot killed 6-year-old Aiden Leos while he sat in a booster seat in the back of his mother's car on his way to kindergarten, prosecutors have said. Days later, a co-worker told Eriz that authorities were looking for a car similar to the one he used with his girlfriend, Wynne Lee, 23, who since has been charged with being an accessory after the fact, the court filing said. Eriz then hid the car in a relative's garage and instead started using a red truck, shaved his beard and began pulling back his hair, prosecutors said in the document, while calling Eriz an "extreme danger" and asking the court to deny him bail. Eriz and Lee are scheduled to be arraigned Friday in the case that has drawn outrage in the county of 3 million people, where many people, like Leos, rely on freeways to get to work and school. The pair were arrested outside of their Costa Mesa apartment on June 6. Eriz was charged with murder and shooting at an occupied vehicle and with enhancements and has been held on $2 million bail. Lee faces the accessory charge and a charge of illegally carrying a concealed firearm and is being held on $500,000 bail. Eriz's attorney, Randall Bethune, and Lee's attorney, Tom Nocella, declined to comment before the arraignment. In the court document, prosecutors said Leos' mother was driving on the freeway May 21 when she was cut off by a car driven by Lee and Eriz, to which she responded by holding up her finger rudely. She then heard a loud bang and her son say ``ow'' and she pulled over and saw he was bleeding from his chest, the document said. Days later, prosecutors said Eriz brandished a gun at another driver on the freeway. ``This brazen act of threatening other commuters with a loaded firearm shows this Court that the Defendant cannot control his emotions and the smallest event can set him into a deathly rage,'' prosecutor Whitney Bokosky wrote in the filing. Prosecutors said Lee is also a flight risk and suggested that her bail remain at $500,000. In the weeks after Leos' death, authorities offered a reward for tips leading to an arrest and said they received hundreds from the community. They said the couple's car, a white Volkswagen Golf SportWagen, was relatively rare and that helped investigators track it down through surveillance footage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/officials-man-in-boy-road-rage-killing-admitted-firing-gun/articleshow/83621967.cms||---

The victim, Mukesh Kumar of Kasar village, succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Bahadurgarh around 2.30am on Thursday. The police have registered a murder case against the four suspects for allegedly getting Mukesh drunk before the crime. One of the accused, Krishan Kumar, has been arrested.  The victim’s brother, Madan Kumar, told reporters that his family received a call on Wednesday night about the attack on his sibling and rushed to the site to find him lying there with critical burn injuries. Madan said his brother had gone to the border protest site for an evening stroll. Tony, sarpanch of Kasar village, alleged that residents staying in the vicinity of the protest site were facing harassment due to the continuing farm protest. Rubbishing attempts to link the crime with the protest site, farm leader Satnam Singh Ajnala said the agitation against the farm laws had nothing to do with the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jhajjar-villager-burnt-to-death-by-4-near-tikri-protest-site/articleshow/83622041.cms||Sat Singh

While stating that the state has ensured that the sugar mills make the payments in time, he said the government is keeping a close watch on four sugar manufacturers — Bajaj Hindustan, Modi, Simbhaoli and Yadus — which he said have been laggards in clearing the cane payments to farmers. He said the government won’t hesitate to take action against them. “We have issued recovery certificates to these groups. Upon direction from the chief minister, we are keeping a close watch on these groups, be it Modi, Simbhaoli and Bajaj Hindustan. We are taking regular action against them,” Rana told reporters in a web based meeting. Rana said so far the mills have cleared nearly 67% of the cane payments to the farmers for the current sugar season. Less than Rs 10,000 crore cane dues are yet to be cleared by mills and most of this is due to these major players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rs-1-4-lakh-crore-paid-to-cane-farmers-in-4-years-lens-on-4-laggard-companies-up/articleshow/83622080.cms||---

The faction led by Chirag Paswan termed the election “unconstitutional”. A letter issued by Chirag said a physical meeting of its national executive would be held in Delhi on Sunday to discuss all issues. He has expelled the five rebel MPs led by Paras from LJP.

Former LJP MP Surajbhan Singh said Paras was elected national chief unopposed as no other nomination was filed against him. “Altogether, 71 members extended their support to Paras at the meeting,” he added. However, only four of the five rebel MPs were present at the meeting held at Surajbhan Singh’s residence in Patna. Samastipur MP and Chirag’s cousin Prince Raj was conspicuous by his absence.

Two students debate itFORCombination of entrance, school marks gives digitally disadvantaged a chance- U Sai Sruti Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, there has been much debate as to whether entrance exams or 12th-grade final board results should be considered for college admissions. Recently, another choice has emerged, with discussions about considering both these criteria. Students have been drawn into heated debates on the costs and benefits of each method. In my opinion, taking both into consideration would indeed be the more equitable way to deal with the admissions process. Let me explain why. It is necessary to understand why the only other alternative offered in place of this method of the admission process, which is to solely consider the 12th board results, will prove to be not only exclusionary but also unfair and even prejudiced. Firstly, let us take a look at the alternatives. The 12th board results will be tainted, because students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds continue to not have access to the resources needed to do well. This puts them at a disadvantage. It is imperative to acknowledge that students from marginalised backgrounds have not had, and still do not have, consistent access to high-speed internet and digital gadgets. This puts them at a disadvantage as online exams have proven to be exclusionary for them. Even if we ignore the fact that many schools were not able to have proper online classes, the reality remains that of the online classes that were held, several students including those who are neuro-divergent and those living in abusive environments at home were not able to benefit from them. What’s more, students who have had to work to sustain their families after their parents lost their daily wage jobs, and the ones who have had to share one smartphone with four siblings in the house, have not been able to profit from these online classes. The pandemic, which has caused and increased the mental health issues of students, has also impaired their ability to perform well in their examinations. The aggregation of these circumstances has affected their grades and has made the long-standing admission process unjust. Thus, the best option for them currently would be to have partial weightage given to the entrance exam and the rest to their class 12th board results. This gives students poorly affected by a lack of resources a better chance at making it to their dream college than just having their class 12 marks to be taken into consideration. As to entrance exams, there are several reasons as to why they are not the only solution. Let us look at this in the context of the two ways in which they can be executed. Firstly, if entrance exams are to be conducted online, then it would be truly exclusionary and oppressive for those who come from economically and socially marginalised backgrounds and do not have access to the facilities needed to participate in this test. On the other hand, if these exams are conducted offline, it would lead to a catastrophic third wave of the Covid-19 virus as lakhs of students from all over the country would be appearing for these exams. The fact that most of the student populationin the country has not been vaccinated yet, adds to the danger. Either way, it is clear that making entrance exams the only selection criterion is highly unreasonable. Keeping the above points in mind, it is not a far reach to conclude that an exclusive system is not only going to be unfair but also biased against the underprivileged sections of the nation and therefore, should not be adopted. It is more reasonable to use a combination of both criteria as the basis of admission. This will ensure that the lack in one of these areas can at least be compensated in the other. Entrance exams along with the class 12 results will offer a second chance to the students when it comes to their college application. In the present circumstances, I admit that this alternative is not an ideal option. In this situation, there is no ‘ideal option’; it is only the most unbiased and fair chance that any student can get in these extraordinary times. The writer is a student of Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar AgainstA single hasty high-stakes exam is not fair to diverse students across boards-Ahana Basu The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken the world. Things that seemed constant in our lives disintegrated and one of those things turned out to be students’ plans. With entrances being postponed indefinitely, board exams being cancelled, and college options abroad becoming difficult to pursue, a Common Entrance Examination seems like the most logical solution. Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong. Entrance exams like JEE, NEET and CLAT have been around for years for engineering, medical and law aspirants. It takes time, effort, trial and error to develop such an exam. With boards being cancelled in June, and colleges starting in September, one cannot help but wonder: are three months enough to develop, administer, and evaluate an exam that will decide the future of lakhs of students? Another issue is the syllabus of these common entrance exams. India is a diverse country with a diverse curriculum. Every state has its own board, and there are national boards like CISCE and CBSE. International boards like IGCSE and IB are also gaining popularity. It is, therefore, extremely difficult to come up with a syllabus that will reflect what is taught in all these boards, in such little time. Another problem arises: the reduction of the syllabus done in 2020. When the pandemic hit in early 2020, all the boards rushed to reduce the syllabus for the 10th and 12th grade. This was a welcome initiative because online schooling was uncharted territory. But again, there was little to no uniformity between all the boards. This leaves us with the same problem of a syllabus that is not uniform enough to conduct a common exam with. If you have interacted with a student preparing for JEE, NEET or CLAT, you know how much work goes into it. Some students have been preparing since they were in 8th grade, because these exams are highly competitive. If a Common Entrance Examination is established for 2021, lakhs of students will register, which will boost the level of competition to those of the other exams. This will force the students to throw themselves into a frenzy of preparation over the next few months. Those who can learn faster will have a natural edge. This will make for a skewed result. Would it be fair for a life-changing exam to be sprung upon the students out of nowhere, with little to no time to prepare for it? It goes without saying that the pandemic will make it hard for students to appear for these common entrance exams. The boards were cancelled with the students’ health in mind. It would not make sense if one set of exams were cancelled and the alternative was to hold another exam. With lakhs of students appearing and no guarantee of safety, it would inevitably trigger another onslaught of fresh cases, this time among the youth. An online exam would have been a more concrete option, but not everyone is privileged enough to have access to the internet and devices. Another thing to take into consideration here is the set of subjects that a student opts for in their 11th and 12th grade. There are hundreds of subjects and thousands of students who have opted for different combinations of these subjects. Whatever the syllabus of the Common Entrance Exam may be, it is possible that there will be students who have not opted for those subjects. It would be unfair to expect them to learn the subject in a few months and appear for an exam which they never meant to take. Students pick their subjects with careful consideration of their future, including any entrances they might have to take. Springing an exam like this upon them could derail their plans for good. The CET is a good option only in theory. Practically, there are still many hurdles to cross in order for it to be a form of assessment which will do right by the students. So far, the best bet we have is assessing them based on their school’s exams, which they have actually studied and appeared for. Although they might not have performed to their fullest potential, the CET will not solve that issue either. For most students, it will just be another competitive exam that they did not have enough time to prepare for. Maybe someday, when more thought and work goes into planning this exam, it will be a good option. For now, it is hasty at best, and damaging at worst.

---||Allahabad||‘Cluster plan’ to cover rural, slum population from July 1||Prayagraj: In an attempt to cover a maximum number of people in rural and slum areas, the officials of the health department have chalked out a “cluster plan” to reach out to each and every recipient in villages, blocks and slums of Prayagraj district. The plan will be implemented from July 1 in all 23 blocks of the district. Interestingly, the health department is also mooting a proposal to send ‘bulawa parchi’ (invitation slips) to every eligible recipient in villages and blocks, appealing them to reach a particular Covid-19 vaccination centre and timing of the convenience of the recipient. These measures are being initiated to increase vaccination in rural areas after witnessing low turnout of recipients in rural vaccination centres — community/primary health centres(CHCs/PHCs) — in the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive. Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO), Dr. Teerath Lal told TOI, “The cluster plan would be implemented from July 1 in all 23 blocks of the district. Under the plan, at least 10 to 12 medical teams would be covering a cluster of villages in rural areas and slums in urban areas and administering vaccines to eligible persons.” He, however, said that the department is also mulling a plan to send ‘bulawa parchi’ to eligible recipients where details like vaccination centre and timing would be mentioned. The department has also planned to rope in mobilization teams comprising ANM/ ASHA workers, pradhan, aganwadi workers and teachers who would be promoting vaccination in villages concerned. The ACMO said, “Entire 23 blocks and slums would be divided into clusters and cluster vaccination groups would be asked to cover the assigned cluster within stipulated time. The department aims to cover all clusters within July.” Under the cluster plan, the date of immunization and vaccination venue would be announced in advance and there would be an on spot registration facility. Spots like panchayat bhawan, primary schools and gram sabha would be selected after calculating the number of eligible recipients. Moreover, quick response teams and cluster response teams would also be deployed to deal with any untoward incident. As many as 7,04,747shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, including those above 45 years and between the age group of 18-44 in the district till June 16. While 5,78,588 beneficiaries had taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,26,159 recipients had also received the second dose of the vaccine. Figures of the health department revealed that on an average, over 9,000 to 10,000 vaccine doses were administered to beneficiaries daily of all age groups, including 45 plus and recipients between the age group of 18-44 years in the district.

To be executed on a private public partnership (PPP) model, the project will cost Rs 250 crores. While one tower will accommodate 44 government offices, the other will be totally commercial to generate revenue for the project and maintenance. “After the appointment of the architect for the ICC project and preparation of initial design, a presentation was given before the state government for approval and the same was received in the first week of June. The project cost, which was initially estimated at around Rs 171 crores when a two 17-floor buildings had been proposed in January, is now estimated to be around Rs 250 crores,” divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal told TOI on Thursday while sharing the animated design of the proposed twin-tower building with TOI after receiving it from the architect. He added, “As the government nod has been received, work for preparing its DPR has been started and is expected to be completed by June-end.” “As the project is based on the PPP model, the government will not have to spend money from its own exchequer,” said Agrawal, adding that as per the final design, each building of the twin-tower will be ground+18 floors. Each tower will have a double floor basement parking facility. One tower will be completely commercial while 44 government offices will run in another tower, which will also house commercial establishments at a floor to bear the maintenance cost. The commercial tender will be floated for the construction of the proposed buildings after finalisation of DPR, he said adding, a Nagpur based firm has been appointed as transactional advisor for the project. “The twin towers will come up in an existing commissioner office compound spread over 6.44 acre. Almost 3 acres of land will be utilised for their construction. The first skywalk of the state will be at the top floor of the twin buildings,” he added. For better coordination between different government offices associated with the divisional commissioner and also to avoid inconvenience for people coming from neighbouring districts of the division, the ICC was sanctioned for the PM’s parliamentary constituency and Gorakhpur, the home turf of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, in the pilot project. Agrawal said, “Following the state cabinet nod to set up ICCs in Gorakhpur and Varanasi as a pilot project, a government order was issued which was received here in January. Later, the basic exercise of site selection, tentative expenditure on constructing ICC building and arranging budget on PPP model instead of depending on the state government for funds, were conducted. It was followed by the appointment of a transactional advisor for this project. Currently, offices of 12-13 departments are running in their own buildings while others are being operated at rental accommodation where their maintenance is also very poor. Only the regional sports office will not come to the ICC as the RSO office can run from the stadium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/state-govt-clears-twin-tower-icc-buildings-dpr-to-be-ready-soon/articleshow/83616325.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The 32-year-old who delivered a girl on May 19 after testing Covid-19 positive had to be put on ECMO support as her condition deteriorated. She recovered from the severe infection and was finally reunited with her newborn after about three weeks after the delivery. Chowdhury, who works for State Bank of India, started developing Covid-19 symptoms like fever and anosmia (loss of smell) at home on May 16. Thirty-three weeks into her pregnancy, the Garia resident was taken to Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra (EDF) in Jodhpur Park where an RT-PCR test confirmed the infection. With the disease getting the better of her, doctors decided to conduct a C-section and delivered the girl on May 19. “We were so excited at the prospect of becoming parents. But Covid-19 dampened it. Luckily, our daughter tested negative. But my wife’s condition kept sinking despite being put on ventilation support. After consulting doctors, we shifted her to Medica Superspecialty Hospital so that she could be treated under ECMO support,” said Chowdhury’s husband Sakya Singha Maiti, an engineer with CESC. At Medica, doctors found her oxygen saturation dangerously low — below 80% — despite full ventilation. She was put on ECMO support on May 21. Other parameters, like her cardiac function, had also gone for a toss with the ejection fraction having gone down to 35% due to myocarditis. Even while on ECMO support, doctors would encourage her husband to make video calls, showing her their newborn, to instil a mental booster to fight off the infection. “It brings immense joy to see this 32-year-old mother reuniting with her newborn. She recovered after being on ECMO support for eight days. Such cases encourage our team to strive further,” said ECMO specialist Arpan Chakraborty, whose team treated the new mother. Chowdhury had to be in hospital for another eight days after the ECMO support and was sent home a couple of days ago. “We could celebrate our parenthood and rekindle the excitement only after she came back home. Apart from the doctors, we are indebted to our friends, colleagues and relatives who stood by us in our difficult times with morale and financial support. Though my wife’s organization bore the major treatment cost, many others had pooled funds for her treatment,” said Maiti. Now, Chowdhury is trying to make up for the time she had lost by keeping herself busy with her girl. Doctors said that keeping engaged with the baby should also help Chowdhury heal the residual impact of the infection to a large extent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-mom-beats-cov-to-reunite-with-baby-3-weeks-after-delivery/articleshow/83616304.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Business||Insurers want more people under social welfare cover||Mumbai: With claims under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) exceeding premium collections, insurers are calling for expanding the insured population. At the end of FY21, the cumulative enrolments under the scheme were 10.3 crore, against which 2,50,351 claims were reported. With claims outstripping premium, insurers have to find ways to bridge the gap. This is becoming tougher at a time when reinsurers are hardening their stance on term insurance in India and some even pulling away from the Indian market. “The current experience is that claims are 160% of risk premium. One of the options to increase the sustainability of the scheme is by reducing the solvency margin and mandatorily increasing the participation under the scheme as the principle of insurance is based on the law of large numbers,” said IndiaFirst Life Insurance MD & CEO R M Vishaka. According to her, life insurance can be made mandatory for accountholders or at least those who avail of loans and, to reduce the burden, the premium can be collected each month so that the instalment is less than Rs 30. “Just like wearing a helmet is mandatory for driving a two-wheeler, life cover should be mandatory for breadwinners,” she said. Insurers also said that, while they have for long been calling for an increase in the premium under the social welfare schemes, they also feel that it may not be the right time for higher rates given the fall in incomes. At the same time, the relatively low premium and absence of margins make it difficult to spend on increasing awareness through promotions. The Confederation of Indian Industry had also called for making this cover universal. However, the cover cannot be provided without the consent of the deposit holder. The PMJJBY scheme was launched in 2015 and it provides insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh to every bank accountholder for a premium of Rs 330. To ensure universal coverage, all adults up to 50 were covered without any exclusion and consent could be given through a form, through text or online. The pricing was devised calculating the mortality in the age group assuming around 1.2 deaths per 1,000 + 0.2% stamp duty. However, the experienced rate is over 2. So far under PMJJBY, about 4.7 lakh claims have been paid Rs 9,307 crore. Since the beginning of the pandemic, that is, April 1, 2020 onwards till date, 1.2 lakh claims have been paid amounting to Rs 2,403 crore. Last week, the government indicated that it wants to streamline the process of claim settlement. The idea is to integrate systems so that when family members come in for closure of accounts following the death of the account holder, the process is automatically initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurers-want-more-people-under-social-welfare-cover/articleshow/83619851.cms||Mayur Shetty

This fourfold increase is to ensure tap water supply in every rural home by 2023. In Kerala, 44.14L households lack provision of tap water supply. According to data released by the water resources ministry during the launch of the Jal Jeevan Mission in August 2019, of the 67.14 lakh households, only 16.64 lakh (24.78%) households had tap water supply. In the last 22 months, 6.36 lakh households in the state have been provided tap water connections. As of now, 23 lakh households (34.26%) in the state have tap water connections. However, increase in tap water supply coverage in the state has been less than 10% against the national average of 22%, it said. Under Jal Jeevan Mission, the state has planned to provide tap water connections to 29.37 lakh households in 2021-22, 6.68 lakh in 2022-23 and 5.54 lakh in 2023-24 to achieve the goal of every household with assured tap water supply. The Jal Shakti ministry has expressed its concern about the slow pace of implementation as only 4.04 lakh households were provided tap water connections in 2020-21. Under the mission, water quality monitoring and surveillance activities are to be given top priority, for which anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, members of self-help groups are being trained so that they can test water samples for contamination by using field test kits (FTKs). Of the total 52 water testing laboratories in the state, only one lab is National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accredited. The ministry has asked the state to expedite the up gradation of these water testing laboratories and secure their NABL accreditation. These labs should be open to the public so that they can get their water samples tested at a nominal cost. A communication from the ministry said that in 2020-21, Rs 404.24 crore central grant was released to Kerala but the state could draw only Rs 303.14 crore and surrendered Rs 101.06 crore meant for tap water supply in rural areas of the state. The Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has written a letter to the chief minister urging him to review the mission implementation in the state every month to expedite the planning, approval of schemes, tendering process and implementation of the water supply schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fourfold-rise-in-centres-grant-to-state/articleshow/83616434.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The decision to refund was announced by the bank in a public notice published in newspapers. Last month, the bank was fined Rs 10 crore by the RBI for selling GPS systems to car loan borrowers. “HDFC Bank will be refunding the GPS device commission to auto loan customers who availed of such device as part of the auto loan funding during the period FY14 to FY20,” the bank said in its advertisement. The bank said that the refund would be credited to the customers’ loan repayment bank account as registered with the bank. According to sources, the total amount the bank would be refunding would be less than Rs 50 crore. The GPS devices were estimated to cost between Rs 18,000 and Rs 20,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-to-repay-gps-gizmo-fees/articleshow/83619919.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: CBSE assessment formula for Std XII strikes a chord||PUNE: Schools in the city have reacted well to the Central Board of Secondary Education’s assessment criteria which the Supreme Court approved on Thursday. The board has informed the apex court that the Std XII results will be based on the students' performance over three years starting for std X and the results will be announced by July 31. Most colleges in the city have already conducted online pre-boards and other internal assessments. The practical examinations were also conducted at a later stage in a stepwise manner, many principals said. Meanwhile, most parents and students are happy that the evaluation criteria is out, ending the uncertainty, but many expressed reservations on the 30% weightage given to class XI marks. As per the method submitted, the practical marks will be calculated based on the actual practical examination conducted by the school this year. The theory component, which is generally 80/70/60/50/30, will be calculated using 40% of the Std XII marks scored in pre-boards or unit tests, 30% based on theory marks obtained in Std XI final exam and another 30% from the best-of-three subjects in the Std X board exams. Jayshree Venkatraman, principal at SNBP International School, said, “The CBSE has done for Std XII what it followed for Std X evaluation pattern. Considering the situation, it is a fair decision. We have conducted all pre- boards. We conducted a fourth pre-board in April just to ensure the students are prepared. We are also done with all our practical examinations and the one which was not taken up because one of our teachers was unwell with Covid 19, was conducted at a later stage.” Bharti Bhagwani, principal of GG International School, said the concern that giving weightage to Std XI marks is not justified. “There will be criticism of all decisions. But, the CBSE has taken suggestions and then devised a method. Students need to take all exams seriously, and not just the board exams for a better understanding of the subjects. Schools keep telling them this and there are students who prepare well too. Lastly, the process of results needs to be completed on time, so that students can move on to higher education, without any hassles.” Lakshmi Kumar, founder director of The Orchid School, said while there are many negatives in the assessment criteria, especially considering unequal access to education during the pandemic year, differences in the individual assessment of schools, quality of online practicals etc, there is no other alternative to fall back on. “The benchmarking of this assessment process is challenging and even the reliability is questionable. But then everyone knows this has been a Covid year and we need to move on. But, we must be better prepared for the next year. We need to ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page when a decision is taken and we need to reform the evaluation model keeping in mind a possibility that the academic year 2021-22 can also be washed out by the pandemic. Hence, we need a system in place and we need to train the teachers well in advance so that there is uniformity and fairness in evaluation,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cbse-assessment-formula-for-std-xii-strikes-a-chord/articleshow/83616398.cms||Ardhra Nair

There has been no decline in the cases of road accidents, even as cops have added 14 new accident-prone areas on state/national highways connecting four districts of the range—Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Fatehpur and Pratapgarh. Statistics revealed by Prayagraj range police on Thursday claimed that a total of 623 persons, including 228 people in Prayagraj, 151 in Pratapgarh, 158 in Fatehpur and 86 in Kaushambi, have lost their lives between January 1 and May 31.

Ironically, Prayagraj district has minimum 18 black spots on national/state highways and the city roads have recorded maximum deaths in the last five months. Inspector general of police (Prayagraj range) KP Singh told TOI, “Cops have launched a road safety exercise to minimise cases of road accidents in all four districts of the range.” He added that traffic policemen of all four districts have also been instructed to chalk out a concrete road safety programme to check cases of fatal and non-fatal category. Ignorance to traffic norms and violation of speed limits were two prime factors behind rising number of road accidents in every district, he said. If the five-year graph of road accidents was to be analysed, years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 recorded 926, 1243, 1,276, 906 and 1,062 cases of road accidents respectively between January 1 and May 31. Similarly, year 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 also recorded 501, 660, 654, 461 and 623 deaths respectively in the same period. In the month of May alone, the range police recorded 135 cases of road accidents, including 49 in Prayagraj, 23 in Pratapgarh, 26 in Kaushambi and 37 in Fatehpur.

Shops selling clothes, footwear, utensils and ornaments in Khetan Market, Rajdhani Market, Hathwa Market, and Lalji Tola are witnessing a huge rush of customers. Many of them can, however, be spotted without face masks. Heaving a sigh of relief, Anup Agarwal, a salesman in Khetan Market, told this reporter on Thursday, “Our business is picking up the pace now. We hope the sales will increase further.” Prakash Ranjan, a sales manager at an apparel store in Hathwa Market, claimed, “Customers have started pouring in. We are, therefore, ensuring that they follow social distancing norms and wear masks.” Although he seemed happy with the relaxation in lockdown restrictions, an auto driver, Ranjeet, pointed out, “Finding passengers is not difficult as offices have reopened. However, most of them violate the safety norms.” Echoing similar views, two youngsters, Neha Sinha and Samiksha Ghosh, said, “Neither customers nor shopkeepers are wearing masks in public places.” Asked about the action being taken against reckless people amid the pandemic, Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh replied, “Altogether 433 people have been caught without masks in public places and a sum of Rs 3,15,000 has been realised from them in the last two days. Besides, 10 shops have been seized for violating Covid protocols.” During the same period, challans were issued to 50 motorists for stepping out during the night curfew and Rs 1 lakh was collected as fine from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/as-covid-cases-drop-safety-protocols-go-for-a-toss-in-patna/articleshow/83614111.cms||Faryal Rumi

The deputy CM later handed over the same to Bihar Medical Service Corporation Limited managing director Pradeep Jha. Ministers and officials of the state thanked Tashkent India Club president Ashok Kumar Tiwari, who talked about the demands for the state’s silk, sugar and other food products. Tiwari said though they had a very small population of people from Bihar in Tashkent, all are ready to extend help. Baba Siddiqui, on the other hand, came to Patna to provide help to his natives.

Dark clouds were hovering in the skies since morning and it suddenly began pouring at about 12.30 pm. The downpour accompanied by strong winds brought traffic to a halt in most areas of the city. Commuters were seen scurrying for cover, but many youngsters even hit the roads for a long drive. Many also headed towards Sindhrot and Pavagadh Road to enjoy the rains. District administration said that the city received 35mm of rain. The heavy downpour, though, kept the firemen and civic officials on their toes. “About 200 trees were uprooted in different areas of the city due to the rains accompanied with strong winds in two hours,” said a fire official. A huge signboard near Ratri Bazaar also came crashing down apart from another one at Soma Talav. But no one was injured in the incident. Some cars parked below the signboard were damaged. Firemen were busy removing the fallen trees and clearing the roads throughout the day. An hour of rain also left many roads waterlogged in the city. Apart from Raopura Road, Mandvi and Dandia Bazaar, roads in western parts like Alkapuri, Akota, Gotri and Subhanpura too were waterlogged for some time. There were also complaints of power cuts in some areas. Padra taluka also received about 40 mm of rain on Thursday afternoon. The weather department had predicted rainfall on Thursday and Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/200-trees-uprooted-in-2-hrs-as-rains-lash-vadodara-city/articleshow/83611829.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Micro containment-zone barricades come up in North 24 Parganas, Howrah pockets||KOLKATA/HOWRAH: Police and local civic authorities on Thursday set up barricades around localities that had been designated micro-containment zones due to the presence of multiple Covid cases. Neighbourhoods in Lake Town, Bangur and Kestopur, as well as areas around Howrah Maidan across the river, were cordoned off to restrict movement of people in a bid to stop the infection from spreading. The state health department is keeping a close vigil on Covid-positive patients residing in these hot spots and who are currently undergoing treatment at home. These areas, under two districts, were chosen as micro-containment zones after repeated occurrence of Covid-19 cases. So far, 14 micro-containment zones in North 24 Parganas and 18 micro-containment zones in Howrah have been declared after a state advisory reached the District Magistrates to identify local Covid hot spots and accordingly create micro-containment zones. Kestopur’s Rabindrapally locality near Pragati Sangha Club, which falls under Ward 26 of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, was declared a micro-containment zone on Thursday after several Covid cases were reported from the area. Other areas in south Dum Dum municipality’s jurisdiction that have already been brought under micro-containment zones include Shyam Nagar Road near Dum Dum Park Bazar, which is a part of Ward 27 under Dum Dum police station and Bangur Avenue, B Block, Radhakrishna Mandir Gali, which is a part of Ward 29 under Lake Town police. Apart from imposing restrictions, the district administration and south Dum Dum municipality are engaged in a mass vaccination programme for the localities falling in the bordering areas of the containment zones. In Kolkata, the civic body and Kolkata Police are working together to set up micro-containment zones in areas where the Covid-positive cases are on the rise. A KMC health department official on Thursday hinted that several areas in south and south suburban Kolkata were under their watch. Though Lalbazar denied any formal meeting or stock-taking with the KMC health department, several ward coordinators are said to be in touch with local police stations to brief the officers about the actual Covid graph of particular neighbourho-ods which are known to be Covid sensitive. The city reported as many as 337 fresh cases on Thursday, most of them from south Kolkata. “We are in discussion about the apartments rather than stand-alone buildings where chances of Covid spreading are lower. At present, we are looking at complexes which have over 30 flats and where there are at least five active cases. The zones will be demarcated at a micro level and only the specific apartment will be brought under containment. If possible, we might only announce containment for a single block. The food and other essentials will be supplied by both local police and the KMC,” said a police source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/micro-c-zone-barricades-come-up-in-n-24-pgns-howrah-pockets/articleshow/83616237.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Only one-tenth of the quantity could reach wholesale markets, so retail markets got a meagre amount. At many places, even vendors could not turn up,” said Kamal Dey, president, West Bengal Vendors’ Association. “A van is shared by a larger number of vendors to distribute the higher cost of transportation. In a week, vegetable prices rose almost 100%. On Thursday, prices rose by Rs 10-Rs 20 a kg,” said Anees Mohammed, secretary, Watgunge Market Vendors’ Association. The price of pointed gourd on Thursday rose to Rs 70 a kg from Rs 60 on Wednesday while brinjal was sold at Rs 80-Rs 90, ridged gourd at Rs 70 a kg and capsicum at Rs 150 a kg. But later, vendors indulged in distress sale, said Gour Ghosh of Barisha retail market. “We are trying to figure out the quantum of loss due to this rain,” said Dey. “We have at least 10 to 12 poultry shops outside the market. Today, only two managed to set up stalls,” said Swapan Roy, a member of the traders’ association in College Street. “Stalls were shifted outside the market due to the pandemic. But the place was flooded and none could set up shop till 10am on Thursday and had to wrap up by 11am,” said an officer bearer of traders’ association of Maniktala market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-waterlogging-push-veggie-rates-up/articleshow/83616386.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

There was demand from art and drawing class associations to continue awarding grace marks to students this year too although the elementary and intermediate exams were not held last year. A notification was issued by the state government to award marks according to the previous exam. These extra marks help many students score 100% in the SSC exams in the past. Secretary of the Kala Adhyapak Sangh, Sunil Borole, and other art teachers associations in Maharashtra have been insisting that students get the extra marks as they have been taking efforts for more than three years. Borole said, “Students have submitted their proposals to their respective schools for extra marks since January. Many students have also passed intermediate and elementary exams much before. Every year, students get the marks based on their grades. However, it was not possible to conduct the exam last year due to Covid-19 restrictions.” The associations have also been insisting on conducting the examinations so that students are not at a loss in future. Minister of higher education, Uday Samant, said, “The students who have appeared for elementary or intermediate exams before SSC will get the benefit of extra marks. They will not lose out on the provisions of the state board.” Marking scheme As per the scheme, students who learn classical dance, drama and singing for at least five years and pass at least five exams from a government-approved institution will be given 15 marks in the board exams. Those who pass three exams will get 10 marks, whereas students who win national or state-level tournaments and scholarships in classical art are entitled to receive 25 marks.

WRD sources said that water discharge through the Valmikinagar barrage had fallen to 2.21 lakh cusec at 5 pm on Thursday from 4.12 lakh cusec recorded at 12 noon on Wednesday. “Only light rainfall in the range of 2.5 mm to 12.5 mm was received in western Nepal on Wednesday. This vastly reduced the water inflow into the Gandak river, as a result water discharge fell substantially,” a WRD source said. WRD sources also said that there was no forecast of heavy rainfall for the coming days. The state has received 92% more rainfall than the normal between June 1 and 15, as the actual rain received was 111.2 mm against the normal of 57.8 mm. The daily flood news released by the WRD state headquarters said that the embankments were safe. Further, the water levels of Kosi, Mahananda and other rivers were still very low. However, the damage caused in the Gandak basin has been tangible. Flood waters from parts of Bagaha town in West Champaran district is also receding. One Subodh Sahani from Bhilorawas tola in Piprassi block had ventured out into the river on Thursday to fetch a log of wood, but is traceless. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team is trying to locate him. In another case, the body of an unidentified person was found in a ditch along the Ghaghawa-Khalaspati road, and has been sent for autopsy, Dhanaha police said. A large number people from Thakaraha, Bhitaha, Madhubani, Piparassi, Jagapati, Nautan and Bairia blocks have shifted to higher places. Dozens of families of Shera Nawakatola and Jiganahi under Bhitaha block have taken shelter on Piparassi-Pipra embankment. In Majhaulia block of West Champaran district, flood water of Shikarahana river has been eroding its bank fast near Bathana, Gadditola and Kumbhar tola. Majhauli circle officer (CO) Suraj Kant visited the site and has written a letter to WRD to check the erosion with immediate effect. Gandak is eroding forest land situated on the left bank, falling under Madanpur forests range in the Valmiki Nagar Tiger Reserve (VTR) area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/water-discharge-through-valmikinagar-barrage-falls/articleshow/83612837.cms||Abhay Singh

While the initial shock of the pandemic led to a 51% decline in downloads in January to March 2020 when the pandemic first hit followed by a 3.3X surge until January to March 2021 as companies aggressively began to capitalize on the contactless world. More than 80% of finance app installs in India were for financial services as the market continues to be dominated by wallet apps and other payment services. The rise of both stock market investment apps and loan apps also led to the upswing in India in a year when contactless services were rising.Global surge in demand for these apps led marketers to invest nearly $3 billion to acquire new users in 2020, and India commanded over $146 million of the total global budget.Aditya Maheshwari, head of customer success, AppsFlyer India, says the country being home to a large unbanked population and having fastest-growing mobile-first populations has led to the surge in use of finance apps. Fewer face-to-face interactions leading to decreased physical transactions aided payment apps, and heightened activity in booming stock markets led to explosive growth in investment apps, he added.Fintech apps also enjoy a high retention in India as overall 41% of finance app installers in India registered within the first 30 days post-install, especially in lending apps where this stood at 44%. Day-30 registration rates stood at 33% in North America, 36% in South East Asia and 27% in Western Europe.“These registration rates are much higher than any other vertical in the Indian app economy,” Maheshwari said. “Most people who are looking for a loan in India download multiple apps to see what is the maximum amount that they can get, at what interest rate, and at what terms. This is also a reason for a very high registration rate in loan apps,” he added.AppsFlyer’s analysis notes that finance apps in India have helped ease the registration process by building better experiences like Auto fill OTP, e-KYC, Auto fetch details using Aadhar card etc.However, app frauds continue to remain a concern, and particularly for loan apps, the fraud rate in India stood at 67% for January-March 2021 whereas it touched 40% in the same quarter for the overall category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-149-crore-india-leads-in-financial-app-installs-globally/articleshow/83616965.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Kolkata||New hallmark rules ensure gold purity at small shops||Kolkata: Customers who purchase gold jewellery from smaller shops will now get hallmarked ornaments of 14, 18 and 22 carat, assuring them of the exact quality they are paying for. Jewellers have also welcomed the step as it will boost customer confidence. Implemented from June 16, the new rules of hallmarking that cover shops with annual turnover of Rs 40 lakh or more bring into their ambit many more shops than earlier. Sanosh Tikadar, a resident of Dum Dum and ex-serviceman, has been buying jewellery for his son’s wedding for the past few months. “There are many like us who do not understand the nuances of gold purity. There was also no way to know if a jeweller was selling 20 carat hallmarked jewellery and charging us for 22 carat. The new system will ensure that the quality is not compromised,” he said. Now, if jewellery made of 14, 18 or 22 carat gold is sold without the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) hallmark, the jeweller could be penalized five times the cost of the item or imprisoned for up to a year. “Also, if a customer buys a non-hallmarked ornament weighing 2g or below and finds the quality not up to the mark, the jeweller can be penalized,” said Tagar Poddar, general secretary of Bangiya Swarna Shilpi Samiti. BIS director general Pramod Kumar Tiwari said jewellers not registered with BIS will not be able to sell hallmarked items. “There are times when the customer wants to change the size or shape of the jewellery. So, there is a relaxation of up to 2g of decrease or increase in weight. But the responsibility of purity lies with the jeweller,” Tiwari said. “Themandatory registration with BIS includes those with business of around 750g gold annually. The new rules will ensure customers get assurance of purity even at local shops,” said Rupak Saha, zonal member of Gem & Jewellery Trade Council of India. Under the new system, the process of hallmarking at the assaying facility will be automated, which will weed out fake hallmarking,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-hallmark-rules-ensure-gold-purity-at-small-shops/articleshow/83616267.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Surat||Surat: Political differences divide AAP councillor from husband||SURAT: Differences in political affiliation led to the divorce of a young engineer couple in the city, in which the woman is a municipal councillor of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The couple signed a mutual divorce agreement recently over differences. Councillor Ruta Dudhagara, 26, is now exploring legal options against husband Chirag, 28, in a bid to recover her valuables including her personal belongings like school and college marksheets, identity documents, documents related to her councillorship, besides her moped and laptop. “Since my husband was unemployed for the past few months, I paid him Rs 7 lakh and he also took my gold jewellery over 90 grams. I consider the cash as payment was for separation, but will definitely explore legal options to get hold of my documents,” said the diploma engineer in information technology. Dudhagara got 54,754 votes and won the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) election with the highest lead of over 34,000 votes against the BJP candidate from ward 3, Sarthana-Simada, in February. She worked as a brand promoter till June 2020 and later joined AAP. “I had no political exposure but started taking part in welfare activities with AAP. They offered me a ticket in the municipal election and I won with the highest margin,” said Dudhagara, who married Chirag, a computer engineer, around three years ago in an arranged relationship. The couple has no children. “I had differences with my husband for over a year but we were managing. But within a few weeks of my victory, my husband started to put pressure on me to join the BJP. He must have received an offer of crores for this, but I am not going to leave AAP,” Dudhagara told TOI. “I was also thrashed by Chirag in April in this dispute after which I decided to get separated. He is still issuing threats to me and did not return my documents too. I am, therefore, exploring legal options now,” said Dudhagara, who also alleged that she is receiving offers from a few men acting on behalf of the BJP leaders to join the party. She has turned down their offers, she added. Despite several attempts Chirag was not available for his comments, but replied a chat message that the allegations levelled by Dudhagara are all lies. AAP had won 27 seats in Patidar-dominated areas of the city against BJP’s 93. Ahead of the upcoming election of Nagar Prathmik Shikshan Samiti (NPSS), which manages municipal schools, the situation is politically volatile. For the 12 seats AAP proposed two candidates while BJP will field 11. “The need for election arose after one more candidate joined the fray after BJP fielded 10 and AAP two. BJP is now trying to buy our councillor to secure the 11th seat,” said Dharmesh Bhanderi, leader of opposition in SMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/political-differences-divide-aap-councillor-from-hubby/articleshow/83613149.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Business||HDFC Bank to move to new digital bank IT platform||MUMBAI: HDFC Bank on Thursday unveiled its longer-term digital banking plans. These involve building a new digital bank, rather than limit the solution to scaling up systems, and increased monitoring to address glitches. Earlier, HDFC Bank had said that it had drawn up short-, medium-, and long-term action plans to address digital banking outages for which it was pulled up by the RBI. The bank is moving from traditional core banking to a new architecture that involves ‘hollowing out’ the core. This will enable a lot of functions to be done outside the core banking architecture. Operations too are being moved to the cloud so that things can be scaled up on demand during festivals and big sale days. The bank has added 50 people as part of its ‘enterprise factory’ and ‘digital factory’ initiatives that aim to address glitches in the present system and parallelly build a new system for the future. Addressing the media, HDFC Bank chief information officer Ramesh Lakshminarayanan said, “The core banking system was monolithic, they had one database where transactions took place. There was very little you could do to replicate them. Payments, balances, statements — everything sits on a monolithic architecture.” He added that under the new age core banking, the bank will have a loosely coupled architecture of microservices payments. “We are slowly getting to the situation where we will be hollowing out the core,” said Lakshminarayanan.Last year, after repeated outages of digital banking services, the RBI barred HDFC Bank from launching additional digital products and on-boarding new credit card customers until it fixed its IT issues. Lakshminarayanan did not give any timeline on when the embargo would be lifted, stating that the bank had done all it had promised to do, and he did not want to second-guess the regulator. The new architecture would also enable the bank to shift payments between any of the exiting rails like real-time gross settlement and other platforms. “We are also decoupling the front end so that mobile banking and net banking are not the only assets to log into, just like today. Just like you can access your balance through GPay or PayZapp, you will be able to have multiple access to your account,” he said. Lakshminarayanan said that what the bank is doing now in the short term is working to prevent outages by automating the switchover to disaster recovery and at the same time working toward the transformation. The migration, he said, would be in stages and once the critical transactions like payments or hot-listing are migrated, a lot of pain would get addressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-to-move-to-new-digital-bank-it-platform/articleshow/83619637.cms||Mayur Shetty

These teachers were appointed by the panchayati raj institutions or civic bodies between 2006 and 2015. Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary told this newspaper on Thursday that the Patna high court had asked the state vigilance department to verify the certificates and documents of all the teachers appointed in 2016. “The certificates of nearly 3.75 lakh teachers were examined by the vigilance department,” the education minister said. He, however, regretted that the certificates of only 2.5 lakh teachers could be made available to the vigilance department. “The certificates of remaining teachers have not been sent to the vigilance department either by the teachers or the recruitment authorities concerned despite several reminders from the education department and the state vigilance department,” he said. However, the state education department has created a special online link and asked all the remaining teachers appointed during the said period to submit the soft copies of their certificates latest by July 20. “A notification to this effect, bearing the names of such teachers, will be published in the newspapers soon,” he said, adding that if the documents were not made available even then, suitable action would be taken against them as per the law. According to the sources, most of these ‘defaulters’ have been recruited on extraneous considerations and do not possess relevant certificates. “About 10 to 15% teachers have reportedly submitted forged documents,” sources said. The state education department had recently initiated steps for appointment of nearly 1.25 lakh elementary and secondary teachers in the state after the high court lifted its stay on the recruitment process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lack-of-certificates-1l-bihar-teachers-face-job-loss/articleshow/83613536.cms||B K Mishra

This makes it the largest such deal in 2021. The Carlyle arm has mandated Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to execute the deal on Friday, sources said. According to the term sheet, CA Rover Holding is selling about 4.8 crore shares in a price band of Rs 1,002-1,041.3 per share, translating into discounts of between 4.7% and 1% to the Thursday closing price of SBI Cards at Rs 1,051 on the BSE. This is the second block deal in SBI Cards in 2021. In March the same Carlyle arm, the largest non-promoting shareholder in SBI Cards with an 11.6% holding as of that month, had sold 3.9% for about Rs 1,000 crore. Earlier, the Carlyle Group had bought 26% in the then unlisted SBI Cards from GE Capital. After that, it had sold 10% during the payment services company’s initial public offering in March 2020. The March 2021 block deal was the second partial exit for the PE major from the SBI subsidiary. The latest SBI Cards deal is set to be executed through the accelerated book building process. Under this, the broker managing the deal, after the close of the day’s trading, sends out the term sheet to large institutions to express their interest to buy shares from the block to build the book for the deal. Once the book is built, the shares change hands the next day on the bourses in large blocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/carlyle-eyes-rs-5000cr-from-sale-of-5-of-sbi-cards/articleshow/83619230.cms||---

While some are not satisfied with the board’s final strategy, others have accepted it as they are not willing to write exams amid the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the evaluation strategy, 30% weightage will be given to the performance of students in classes X and XI and 40% to their marks in the Class XII unit test, mid-term exam or pre-boards. Not happy with the CBSE’s decision, Notre Dame Academy student, Lovely Sharma, told this reporter on Thursday that the final marking criteria would affect the overall Class XII results. Ayush Kunwar from Loyola High School, who is also not satisfied with the marking scheme, said, “A lot of students usually do not fetch great marks in Class XI because they are introduced to a completely new curriculum.” Another student, Prerna, echoed similar views, saying, “This strategy will definitely reduce our chances of being part of prestigious institutes.” On the contrary, Sumit Kumar, a DAV Public School student, expressed satisfaction over the board’s decision. He pointed out, “It was not possible for us to write the exams amid the pandemic. Those who did well in all the three exams will surely get good marks.” St Dominic Savio’s High School’s Rohit Agarwal said students’ safety was far more important that an exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/some-decry-cbses-scoring-plan-others-heave-sigh-of-relief/articleshow/83612798.cms||Faryal Rumi

The domestic currency opened 33 paise lower at 73.65, firmed up marginally to 73.57 and finally closed at the day’s low as the dollar gained against all currencies globally. While all emerging market currencies closed lower, the rupee was the second-worst hit after the Korean won. The last two months had seen the domestic currency gain significantly after a 113 paise fall on April 7 to 74.56 — the sharpest in 20 months on fears of the second wave of the pandemic. Since then, the rupee had steadily recovered. The rupee moved in tandem with the equity markets where the sensex closed 179 points lower at 52,323 due to fears of a US rate hike taking place earlier than expected. Banking and finance stocks fell the most, while IT stocks gained, fuelled by a weak rupee which would beef up their export earnings. US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell had said that the bank was ready to alter policy if it sees signs inflation moved “materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal” of 2%. An RBI-published report said that the forex reserves, which crossed $600 billion earlier this month, was enough for 15 months of imports. According to DBS Bank head (treasury) Ashhish Vaidya, the dollar strength is part of its global move against all currencies and was overdue. “The rupee has been supported by capital flows into new issues and private equity investments. I see 75-75.50 as the outer limit for the rupee as structurally nothing has changed for the dollar,” he said. Given the level of inflation in India, Vaidya said the current short-term real rates are negative and when central banks keep interest rates controlled, the macro imbalances get corrected through currency adjustments. The pressure on currency brings into focus the RBI’s determination to keep yields low. “Controlling the yield curve when real rates are negative risks stoking inflation because in India demand will grow because of demographic reasons, unlike the West where there is deflation because of the ageing population. Also, the yield curve as a public good needs to be seen in the context of both manufacturers and savers, especially as we do not have an evolved pension system safety net and controlling the yield curve over a long period may not be a good idea,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-falls-most-in-2-months-on-us-rate-hike-fears-breaches-74/articleshow/83618984.cms||---

Besides, he will also be given benefits of other schemes as per his eligibility. After chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday announced that the state government will bear the cost of the child’s nurturing and provide benefits of government schemes to the rescuer, district magistrate Ghazipur MP Singh along with a big band of officials visited Chawdhary at his house near Dadri Ghat of Ghazipur on Thursday to know his details. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal on Thursday said, “DM Ghazipur personally enquired about the financial condition of Chawdhary. It has been found that he owns a house. Therefore, it has not been found eligible for benefit under the housing scheme. As it also came to light that he operates the boat of some other persons to earn livelihood, the administration has decided to recommend that he be given a boat.” On his part, Chawdhary demanded construction of a ‘pucca’ road up to his house and was assured by the officials the matter would be taken up soon. Due to the pathetic condition of the approach road leading to his house, the officials had called Chawdhary to meet at a temple campus near Dadri Ghat. Officials said that Chawdhary will be given benefits of all government schemes for which he would be found eligible. On June 14 afternoon, Chawdhary had found a wooden box floating in the Ganga at Dadri Ghat under the limits of Kotwali police station. When Chawdhary opened the box, he found a baby lying inside it. The box was decorated with red cloth and photos of Goddess Durga and Lord Vishnu while a horoscope containing date and time of her birth and also name — Ganga — was found inside. The girl’s waist was tied with a ‘chunari’. After the matter came to the knowledge of Kotwali police, they sent the baby to the special neonatal care unit of Government Women’s Hospital and completed legal formalities as per Juvenile Justice Act. The CM had on Wednesday announced that the government will take care of the girl’s upbringing and the boatman will be rewarded for his feat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/govt-to-reward-boatman-forrescuing-baby-girl-from-ganga/articleshow/83616342.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Principal secretary of environment, forests and climate change department, Dipak Kumar Singh, said the tiger was spotted at Madhubani village under Chiraiya block in the morning and it was tranquilised in the afternoon. “The tiger is being taken to VTR, where it will undergo medical examination before being released in the forests,” he said. Singh said the tiger was rescued from a spot 40km away from the spot where it was first spotted on Tuesday. “The tiger could have either gone to VTR or forest areas in adjoining Nepal and we would have allowed it to go on its own. However, we were apprehensive that it could get into conflict with locals. Hence, we decided to tranquilise it,” he said. The tiger was first spotted on Tuesday in a mango orchard at Dumarbana village near Pakaridayal. Officials said the tiger was on its way back to VTR on Wednesday and it was spotted 15km northwest of Pakaridayal on Thursday morning. A team of 40 members from forests department led by East Champaran DFO Prabhakar Jha had cordoned off the area and launched rescue operation started in presence of Gyan Prakash, sub-divisional magistrate of Sikrahna. According to sources, the full-grown tiger had been wandering since June 12 and battling hunger. “A team of forest experts spent more than 60 hours to track and trap it. The tiger had not caused any harm to humans or livestock,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tiger-straying-in-champaran-rescued/articleshow/83612762.cms||---
---||Business||Insurers want more people under social welfare cover||Mumbai: With claims under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) exceeding premium collections, insurers are calling for expanding the insured population. At the end of FY21, the cumulative enrolments under the scheme were 10.3 crore, against which 2,50,351 claims were reported. With claims outstripping premium, insurers have to find ways to bridge the gap. This is becoming tougher at a time when reinsurers are hardening their stance on term insurance in India and some even pulling away from the Indian market. “The current experience is that claims are 160% of risk premium. One of the options to increase the sustainability of the scheme is by reducing the solvency margin and mandatorily increasing the participation under the scheme as the principle of insurance is based on the law of large numbers,” said IndiaFirst Life Insurance MD & CEO R M Vishaka. According to her, life insurance can be made mandatory for accountholders or at least those who avail of loans and, to reduce the burden, the premium can be collected each month so that the instalment is less than Rs 30. “Just like wearing a helmet is mandatory for driving a two-wheeler, life cover should be mandatory for breadwinners,” she said. Insurers also said that, while they have for long been calling for an increase in the premium under the social welfare schemes, they also feel that it may not be the right time for higher rates given the fall in incomes. At the same time, the relatively low premium and absence of margins make it difficult to spend on increasing awareness through promotions. The Confederation of Indian Industry had also called for making this cover universal. However, the cover cannot be provided without the consent of the deposit holder. The PMJJBY scheme was launched in 2015 and it provides insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh to every bank accountholder for a premium of Rs 330. To ensure universal coverage, all adults up to 50 were covered without any exclusion and consent could be given through a form, through text or online. The pricing was devised calculating the mortality in the age group assuming around 1.2 deaths per 1,000 + 0.2% stamp duty. However, the experienced rate is over 2. So far under PMJJBY, about 4.7 lakh claims have been paid Rs 9,307 crore. Since the beginning of the pandemic, that is, April 1, 2020 onwards till date, 1.2 lakh claims have been paid amounting to Rs 2,403 crore. Last week, the government indicated that it wants to streamline the process of claim settlement. The idea is to integrate systems so that when family members come in for closure of accounts following the death of the account holder, the process is automatically initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurers-want-more-people-under-social-welfare-cover/articleshow/83619848.cms||Mayur Shetty

Altogether 161 patients turned up for consultation in different departments, including 25 each in medicine, orthopaedic and physiotherapy departments, 21 in gynaecology department 14 in eye department on Thursday. NMCH medical superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said as the principal secretary of health department had given permission for resumption of OPD services only on Wednesday, most patients of adjoining localities were unaware of it. “The number of patients may increase in a few days. All other services like admission of non-Covid patients and surgeries will also be resumed,” he said. The number of Covid patients at NMCH has dropped to 35 and all these patients have been shifted to mother and child health (MCH) building, which has a capacity to accommodate 94 patients. The Junior Doctors’ Association of NMCH had also demanded resumption of non-Covid treatment at the hospital. Five mucormycosis or black fungus patients are also undergoing treatment at the ENT department of the hospital. Meanwhile, the NMCH administration has decided to expedite the much-awaited project of setting up an eye bank which remained affected due to the surge in Covid cases. “We have requested the director in chief of health department to appoint ophthalmic assistants at the hospital to collect cornea from the donors. A separate eye building is ready and the required equipment have also been installed,” Dr Binod said. Dr Rajesh Tiwari, head of eye department, said the eye bank, being set up by the state government, would have modern facilities. “The quality of cornea collected from donors will be tested before transplantation,” he added. Dr Tiwari said the hospital would appoint counsellors from among the postgraduate students for motivating the kin of terminally ill patients or those declared as brain dead. “The cornea must be removed within four hours of the death of a person who had registered for donation of eyes. The hospital will have two separate lists of registered donors and recipients,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nmch-resumes-treatment-of-non-cov-patients-after-2-months/articleshow/83613695.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Pune||Gang robs cash, valuables worth Rs 66 lakh from Lonavla paeditrician’s bungalow||PUNE: Seven men carrying sharp weapons robbed Rs 50 lakh and ornaments worth Rs 16.7 lakh from a 73-year-old paediatrician’s bungalow at Pradhan Park in Lonavala, about 65km from the city, during the early hours of Thursday. The intruders did not harm the paediatrician, Heeralal Khandelwal, and his wife (66) but threatened them into submission to secure the keys of their locker. They collected the cash and the valuables after tying up the couple and left. Three of the paediatrician’s caretakers, hired to look after his childcare clinic, were sleeping on the ground floor of the facility. They did not hear any commotion or noise from the couple’s first floor bedroom because it was raining, the Pune rural police said. “After the robbers left, the couple managed to use an intercom to alert the caretakers, who set them free,” said senior inspector Padmakar Ghanwat of the Pune rural police’s local crime branch. A case of dacoity has been registered with the Lonavla City police. Khandelwal told TOI, “My wife and I stay alone on the first floor of our bungalow. One of my children is in the USA and another is in Surat. My hospital is on the ground floor. From last August, I have closed it because of the Covid-19 pandemic. I only take few referrals.” He said someone woke him up from his sleep around 2.30am on Thursday. “I was shocked to see around seven men in our bedroom. They were brandishing sharp weapons. They threatened me and my wife. Before tying our limbs with bedsheets, they asked for our cupboard keys. I told them not to harm us and gave them the keys. They took all the cash and the gold ornaments, and fled,” he said. Khandelwal said the suspects entered the first floor from a window. “We have sliding doors to the windows. One of them has a mesh for ventilation in the house. The suspects cut that mesh and gained entry inside,” he said. “There were 11 men, seven inside my house and four waiting outside. We have the CCTV footage. All of them were in their 20s and conversing in Hindi,” Khandelwal said. Inspector Ghanwat said, “The complainant told us that he did not go to the bank to deposit the money earned from his practice for over a year owing to the pandemic situation, and so there was much cash and valuables at home. The paediatrician and his wife suffered from Covid-19 in August last year. His caretakers, too, were affected. So, he did not send them to the bank. The complainant told us that he was thinking to use that money somewhere else.” He said the police were probing the case from all angles. “We are investigating if any insiders had given tip-off to the suspects. As it was raining in the night, the CCTV footage is not clear,” Ghanwat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gang-robs-cash-valuables-worth-rs-66l-from-lonavla-paeditricians-bungalow/articleshow/83616443.cms||Mihir Tanksale

NIA opposes ‘vague’ petition||MUMBAI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA), in an affidavit before Bombay high court opposed a “vague” quashing petition filed by an Elgar Parishad case accused, Shoma Sen who is relying on an US-based forensic lab report that indicated planting of evidence on the laptop of her co-accused, Rona Wilson. Sen’s petition said her incarceration is on “basis of fraudulent evidence to falsely implicate critical dissenting intellectuals…by slapping cases under stringent laws against public justice’’. The NIA’s reply on Thursday, by a superintendent of police, said, “I stoutly deny the report of M/s Arsenal Consultancy and also the report of the American Bar Association.” The independent forensic report of a “malware” attack on his computer, “cannot be looked into at this stage” said the NIA, adding that it came into the picture, in January 2020 when the probe was transferred to it from Pune police. The case had been registered by Pune’s Vishrambaug police station in January 2018. The chargesheet was first filed in November 2018 and additional chargesheets followed in February 2019 and October 2020. The trial court has taken cognisance of the chargesheet and her petition now would only cause delay of the trial, the NIA said.  Sen, 62, lodged at Byculla women’s prison in Mumbai, is a professor of English at Nagpur University. She was arrested on June 6, 2018, weeks before her retirement. She has a number of serious ailments, she said. The NIA said she has been charged for her role and involvement in larger CPI (Maoist) conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-evidence-planted-in-elgar-case-nia-opposes-vague-petition/articleshow/83620955.cms||---
---||Pune||Govt allows admission in classes IX, X without transfer or leaving certificates||Pune: The school education department has directed all government, local government and aided schools to allow admission of students in Std IX and X even without a transfer certificate/ leaving certificate (TC/LC) from the previous school, this year. As per the government resolution issued on Wednesday, schools can get the birth certificate of the student and give age-appropriate admission to the applicant. However, an aided school principal has said it will allow students to easily default on the pending fees in the previous school and get admission to the next school as TC is no longer mandatory. “Every child has a right to education and at the school of their choice. It has come to our notice, in the current extraordinary situation, more students are transferring out of schools due to financial reasons and some are being denied transfer/leaving certificates. Not giving admission to a new school due to lack of TC/LC would be a miscarriage of justice. It is also a violation under the RTE. So, the government has decided to provide a solution. Students whose TC/LC is delayed or are unable to produce it may be given admission on a provisional basis by the new school. While schooling till Std VIII already provides for this under the RTE, this rule will also apply to Std IX and X,” school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said in her tweet. Explaining the GR, her tweets added, “Principals/administrators should ensure admission is not denied for want of TC/LC. Strict action will be taken against such schools for denying admission. For academic continuity, the birth/age proof of such a student has to be deemed sufficient to give admission to a class appropriate to his or her age.” Shivaji Daundkar, secondary education officer of PMC, said, “Till now, we would ask for the TC/LC and the previous year’s mark list. But now the government has ordered not to ask for TC/LC as many children are changing schools and nobody should be denied admission. All PMC schools and aided schools under PMC will adhere to these norms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-allows-admission-in-classes-ix-x-without-transfer-or-leaving-certificates/articleshow/83616438.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Kochi||Ongoing investigations a farce, says oppn leader||Kozhikode: Opposition leader VD Satheesan said that the illegal tree felling scam probe was a farce and only a judicial probe or high court-monitored investigation can bring the real culprits to book. Addressing the media in Wayanad after leading UDF’s delegation to various locations and tribal hamlets in Muttil South village where large scale felling of rosewood trees had taken place, Satheesan asked why there was no mention about the political and administrative leadership that were responsible for the controversial revenue department order which had led to the mass felling of trees in the FIR registered by Crime Branch. Satheesan said the controversial order was issued with the knowledge of the CM and CPI’s state secretary Kanam Rajendran was now taking a stand in support of the timber mafia. He said the CM, ministers and former ministers were justifying the controversial order on a daily basis to divert the investigation from the conspiracy behind the order. “There is a clear conspiracy behind issuing the order which was aimed to help the timber mafia. It was issued in violation of the decision at the all-party meet called for making changes in the law to enable felling of trees by farmers in assigned land. Instead of making amendments, an order was issued to help the timber mafia,” he said. Satheesan added revenue department order was deceptive as while it mentioned a part of section 6 of the Kerala Promotion of Tree Growth in Non-Forest Areas (Amendment) Act, it intentionally omitted the second part of the same section which said that reserved trees in assigned land cannot be felled. He said that cases are now being filed against farmers and tribesmen from whose land the timber mafia had felled trees by duping them and added that it was a move to help the real accused. FIR mentions conspiracy  Meanwhile, FIR registered by CB deputy SP in Thiruvananthapuram has said that there was a conspiracy involving officials, contractors and others to illegally fell protected trees like rosewood and teak under the pretence that there was a government order to enable tree felling in government patta, forest and puramboke lands without required documents or permissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ongoing-investigations-a-farce-says-oppn-leader/articleshow/83616470.cms||---

This means that the number of teaching posts up for grabs will increase by at least 13. Also, there is a possibility of reshuffling in the reservation status of various posts. LU had issued advertisements for recruitment on 180 teaching posts in September last year. However, the appointments were delayed and in the meantime new selection guidelines were issued by the chancellor of the state universities Anandiben Patel, who is also UP governor. As a result, LU decided to cancel the earlier advertisement and re-advertise the post after incorporating the new selection norms. According to officers, about 10 more teaching posts have fallen vacant since September because of superannuation of a few teachers and death of some faculty members due to Covid-19. "We had advertised 180 teaching posts last September, but now decided to include posts that have fallen vacant in the next advertisement," said LU vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai. Candidates who had applied earlier need not to apply again. However, they will get an opportunity to update their records when the recruitment portal opens for accepting more applications. As per the government norms, the university will be taken as a unit to apply reservation roster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/varsity-to-add-more-teaching-posts-in-fresh-advertisement/articleshow/83620883.cms||---

The police identified the medicine supplier as Kamlesh Bafna (32). The 53-year-old pharmacist was rescued within three hours of his abduction on Wednesday. The pharmacist operates from the premises of a private hospital in Wakad. “Bafna would supply medicines to his pharmacy. He was aware that the victim was earning good money. So, he wished to take over the shop and had even approached the hospital regarding it. However, the hospital had turned down his proposal,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. Bafna then hatched a plan to threaten the victim as well as the hospital owner. “Bafna took the help of one Siddharth Gaikwad (32), who is the Pimpri Chinchwad president of Solapur-based social group,” he said. The commissioner said, “Gaikwad would often visit police stations under the guise of social activities. He and his accomplices posed as the police and abducted the victim by claiming that he was selling banned medicines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/business-takeover-intention-behind-wakad-abduction/articleshow/83616478.cms||---

The consumption of CNG in Kochi, which was around 31,000kg a day in January 2020, has come down to just 2,500kg in May 2021 and the Indian Oil Adani Gas Private Ltd (IOAGPL), which had plans to increase the number of CNG outlets by 100%, has kept the expansion project in abeyance. As of now, there are 10 CNG outlets in the district and the authorities were planning to roll out 10 more outlets. “We had brought the materials for constructing 10 more outlets. But we have to defer the plan due to low demand,” said IOAGPL general manager Ajay Pillai. “Though the consumption dipped to 2,500kg per day in January 2021, it had again picked up to touch 22,000kg in April 2021. Again, it started to decline, and the lowest consumption was recorded in May 2021. However, the demand is slowly picking up and it touched 12,000kg on Wednesday,” he said. Meanwhile, the number of vehicles being converted to CNG from diesel and petrol has increased. “Many autorickshaws in the city have been converted to CNG. There are auto stands in the city with CNG autorickshaws alone,” an official with the city gas project said. “The number of CNG buses in the city is 22. Eight more buses are being converted. We held talks with the bus operators for converting their buses into CNG. But their major concern is steep fall in the number of passengers. Once the bus service is back on track, many of the owners have agreed to convert their vehicles to CNG,” the official said. There are some units in the areas like Kalamassery where diesel/petrol buses are being converted into CNG. The combined dispensing capacity of ten CNG outlets in Kochi and suburbs is around 2.4 lakh kg a day whereas the peak demand ever recorded in the city is 31,000kg a day. “This points out that the market is yet to be ripe for increasing the number of outlets. Each of the ten outlets is having a capacity to dispense 1000kg of CNG an hour,” an official with IOAGPL said. The price of CNG is around Rs 56 a kg and it gives an additional mileage of 25-30% compared to the fossil fuels. Another advantage of the CNG is that it is greener fuel. Being thinner than the air, CNG rises up and dissolves into the sky. So, chances of accidents are least. Government offers an additional of five years validity to the commercial vehicles which ply on CNG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pandemic-derails-cng-expansion-plan-in-district/articleshow/83616508.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

In Virar, three buffaloes grazing nearing an overflowing nullah were washed away. While the fire brigade rescued two of them, a search is on for the third. A yellow alert has been issued for Friday with heavy rain predicted at isolated places. The deceased, identified as Dilip Varma, was rushed to Agarwal Hospital in Mulund where he was declared dead. Local MLA Mihir Kotecha said the area had received consistent downpour owing to which the wall may have weakened and crashed. Intense cloud echoes were heard over parts of the suburbs on Thursday morning. Andheri, Kandivali, Borivali and Vile Parle saw a continuous downpour. In the 12 hours ending at 8.30pm on Thursday, the IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 66.2 mm rains, while the Colaba observatory recorded 19.6 mm rains. Weathermen said a cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea along with strong westerly winds was leading to good rains for the city.  Thane and Navi Mumbai experienced intermittent rains since the early hours of Thursday with the intensity picking up by evening. The IMD has said heavy rains are expected to continue at isolated places in the city and adjoining areas like Thane, Palghar and Raigad till the weekend.IMD’s Colaba observatory has recorded 552.6mm rainfall so far for June, while Santacruz has recorded 757.7 mm— 307.9mm and 540.6 mm above normal. Despite the heavy spell, lakes supplying water to Mumbai have not recorded a rise in levels. The total stock in the seven lakes is 1.8 lakh million litres or 12.6% of the required stocks. Last year, the total stock on the same date was around 1.7 lakh million litres. The lakes need to have over 14 lakh million litres till the end of monsoon to avoid a water cut in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-dead-in-wall-crash-as-rains-lash-city-yellow-alert-today/articleshow/83618925.cms||Richa Pinto

Things would become clear once the suspect is traced,” said assistant commissioner of police Sushma Chavan on Thursday.“We have contacted the neighbouring district police authorities, like Satara, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Pune rural police, requesting them to inform use if they find a body of a man (the deceased woman’s husband) or they see him,” Chavan said.Different police teams are studying footage of CCTV cameras located at Swargate Chowk and on Satara Road, where the man walked after parking the SUV near Market Yard.“We spoke to the family members and found that the relationship between the husband and the wife (35) was quite congenial,” said Chavan.When TOI tried to interact with the relatives and friends of the family on Thursday, they said they would speak after a few days.The Bharati Vidyapeeth and the Saswad police on Thursday handed over bodies of the boy (7) and his mother (35), respectively, to their relatives.

---||Lucknow||Average vax rate drops by 24%||Lucknow: After a bumper start in the first week of June with over 23,000 shots in a day on June 4, the average Covid-19 vaccinations daily in the ongoing mega drive has dropped by 24% to 15,000-16,000 in the past few days. The reason: Experts believe that the sense of urgency for getting vaccinated among people visible earlier has now declined as the Covid-19 cases and deaths have now substantially declined. Besides, many are finding it difficult to get slots. Also, as the gap between two doses has increased, less people are coming to get the second shot. TOI reality check at several booths also found that the lack of urgency coupled with the emphasis of officers on reducing wastage of vaccine has led to low number of vaccinations, particularly in the 45 years and above age group for whom the walk-in jab facility is available. Though the timings are from 9am to 4pm, TOI found that the vaccinations at many places drop post lunch. Ten people can be vaccinated with a vaccine vial, hence centres open a new one only when the required number is around. As footfall drops post lunch, people coming for the jab are told to wait till the prospective beneficiaries are 10 or at least six. A senior officer deployed for vaccination at the centre in RMLIMS said, "In other vaccinations, margin of wastage is up to 10%, but in Covid only 1% is allowed. Therefore, we don't inoculate persons coming for vaccination in a final hour till the number reaches at least six." Ashok Pradhan (48), who went for the shot at SPM Civil hospital, said “When I reached the centre at 3pm, there were five people. We were asked to wait for the number to reach 10. I waited till 4pm. Three more people arrived, but by that time two had left. As a result, we were told to come the next day. I was amazed to see that the people who were earlier so eager to get vaccinated and waited for hours are now not willing to wait for just 15 minutes.” Anshu Chaudhary (49) had to visit BRD Civil Hospital for three days when he finally got inoculated. “For two days, when I reached post lunch, the number of people was less than 10,” he said. People in the 18-44 age group have to book slots for vaccination. “Earlier, my friends used to try desperately to book a slot, but now after trying for a couple of days, when they find that slots are not available, most defer the plan to get the jab for next week,” said Ritu Shukla (22), a college student. Head, medicine department, KGMU, Prof Virendra Atam said that people should not relax thinking that the pandemic is over. “Vaccinations now will help us stop the third wave,” he added.

Metro extensions have been proposed on Shivajinagar-Hadapsar-Loni Kalbhor and Saswad road. The DPR is being drafted by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. The PMRDA is already constructing a Metro line from Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar and has been working on the development of more lines in and around Pune. The proposed Shivajinagar-Hadapsar-Loni Kalbhor line will connect the city’s Western and Eastern parts. A possibility of extending the Metro line up to Saswad road is also being explored, considering the proposed international airport ahead of Saswad. The extension towards Saswad can be from Hadapsar. “We are expecting the study report in the next few days. We will plan further after studying the report,” Suhas Diwase, PMRDA chief, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dpr-of-metro-extensions-expected-soon/articleshow/83616497.cms||---

The images, first shared on Facebook by Chellanam Karshika tourism development society president K X Julappan, are like the ones that were seen after Cyclone Ockhi in 2018. In a memorandum submitted to Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), the society sought scientific expertise in understanding why such a sand accumulation is seen in the area. It said that the sand dune covers an area almost as big as Kumbalanghi. “It looks like a lot of sediment has piled up. The location is almost in the area where Cochin port was dumping dredged sand. The initial indications are that it is underwater because it is in the shipping channel and if not, it would have hit ships. We will get experts to investigate it. It is almost 20km off the coast and we will need a ship to look at it and conduct tests,” said KUFOS VC Riji John. He said that a meeting of coastal engineering and scientific experts will be organized on Saturday to discuss Chellanam sea protection issues. Scientists from the national coastal research centre in Chennai and engineers and officials with coastal development corporation will be among the participants. “We will submit the details at the meeting. Because of Covid restrictions and cases in the region, we are unable to conduct field tests. We hope that we will be able to send out teams soon,” John said. Kerala’s coast and Chellanam has been witnessing sea erosion and intrusion for a few years and it has worsened following the consecutive cyclones in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bean-shaped-sand-formation-found-off-kochi-coast/articleshow/83616574.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

While three were rescued using the Coast Guard ship, 13 were rescued using two helicopters as the rough sea and heavy rain created obstacles for the ship. Raigad additional superintendent of police Sachin Gunjal said on Wednesday, around 5.30pm, M V Mangalam, while navigating towards Revdanda port, drifted away due to low tide. “Later, it got stuck in sand around 3km from the shore. As the vessel could be seen from Revdanda shore, JSW officials informed Raigad police. I coordinated with ICG commandant Arun Kumar Singh at Murud unit and communicated with the vessel captain,” he said. “The situation was normal, and the captain was waiting for high tide, so that the vessel could navigate to the port. But after 11.30pm, the weather turned bad. On Thursday morning, due to high tide, water gushed into the vessel and it started sinking. Crew panicked and contacted us for help. An ICG team set out for the rescue,” he said. Revdanda police provided first-aid to rescued crew. The crew were stranded at sea for around 17 hours, and raised an alarm only on Thursday morning, after the vessel started sinking. Capt C J Lepande, regional port officer, Maharashtra Maritime Board, said second officer Mantap Raj of M V Mangalam informed the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Mumbai that the captain, S Debnath, was planning to abandon the vessel as crew were panicking. MRCC staff requested them to stay onboard and told them an ICG ship from Dighi port was going to rescue them. Lepande said, “Two ICG helicopters were pressed into service from ICG air station at Daman. The ICG ship reached the vicinity of the vessel around 10.15am. The team used rubber boats to reach the vessel. Three crew were taken on the boat to Revdanda.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-coast-guard-rescues-16-from-sinking-vessel/articleshow/83618980.cms||George Mendonca
---||Kochi||Dweep: HC dismisses PIL||Kochi: The high court on Thursday dismissed as premature a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a directive to Lakshadweep Administrator not to implement the revised Covid protocol and draft ‘Goonda Act’. A division bench comprising Justice SV Bhatti and Justice Murali Purushothaman considered a PIL filed by KP Noushad Ali, a Congress leader from Malappuram. He had challenged the revised Covid protocol, the draft ‘Goonda Act’ (Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-social Activities Regulation), disengagement of casual labourers of the society for tourism promotion and part-time teachers, and order to close dairy farms, including those for bulls and calves, run by the department of animal husbandry. Further, the petitioner had sought a directive not to implement Draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation, Draft Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, and Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation. In the judgment, the court pointed out that the challenge to the revised Covid protocol has already been dismissed by the high court in another case. The court said examining the legality of the draft regulation on prevention of anti-social activities is completely premature. The challenge to the disengagement of labourers and part-time teachers also cannot be considered as it is settled law that service matters cannot be considered as a PIL, the judgment said. Regarding the challenge to the order on procedure for auctioning of livestock (alleged order to close dairy farms) in Lakshadweep, the court said the petitioner, in the name of PIL, cannot expand the consideration with inchoate knowledge about the inhabitants of the island and the island. Challenge to implementation of three regulations were also repelled by the court. The three regulations are in draft stage and the challenge is premature, the court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dweep-hc-dismisses-pil/articleshow/83616597.cms||---
---||Pune||ZTCC develops QR code to ease process to pledge organs||Pune: The Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) has developed a QR code to reach out to people during the pandemic, spread awareness about organ donation, and meet the huge gap in demand and supply. “The aim is to revive and reinforce the drive, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. The QR code is another way to tide over the constraints regarding personally meeting people, holding rallies and camps. Besides, we hope to rekindle our connection with youngsters through the initiative,” said Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator, ZTCC, an apex body that oversees allocation of donated organs.Making a pledge does not force a person to donate organs but helps raise awareness about the issue. Once people know about organ donation, at the time of death, they can make a decision easily, Gokhale added.Pune ZTCC was registering an average of 500 pledges every year prior to the pandemic. “The number has dropped to just 50 pledges now. We hope to increase the donor base through the QR code,” the coordinator said.ZTCC officials plan to ensure wide publicity by displaying the QR code on stickers, posters in hospitals waiting areas, public places, shops, eateries, and mass media to reach out to maximum citizens.“Once a person scans the code using a mobile camera, a pledge form window is opened where s/he can add a name, age, address, blood group, and mobile number before submitting it. After submission of the pledge, the person will get a soft copy of a donor card immediately,” Gokhale said.Delhi-based All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences released a QR code for organ donation in 2019. “About 10,000 people in Delhi and surrounding areas have used the QR code to make the pledge. We also aim to reach similar numbers with our QR code,” Gokhale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ztcc-develops-qr-code-to-ease-process-to-pledge-organs/articleshow/83616621.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Nagpur||No plasma therapy study as Nagpur GMCH not giving samples, Neeri tells high court||NAGPUR: Not able to initiate the retrospective study on plasma therapy even over a month after Nagpur bench of Bombay high court issued orders in this regard, the CSIR-Neeri has filed an affidavit squarely holding Nagpur Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) dean Dr Sudhir Gupta responsible for the delay. Dr Gupta refused to comment on the allegation claiming he has “submitted his response to the court”. In its affidavit dated June 16, the research institute has sought HC directives to retrieve the RT-PCR samples of Covid patients who were part of the Project Platina study held at GMCH last year. On June 7, TOI had highlighted the impasse and quoted officials saying the study would now need a push from the HC. The GMCH dean has allegedly been sitting idle despite two reminders from the divisional commissioner to provide the samples to a three-member expert panel since May 21. Dr Krishna Khairnar, head of environmental virology at CSIR-Neeri, virologist major (retd) Dr Milind Bhursundi and pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik are the panel members. The research institute too had sent multiple reminders during this period, but to no avail. During last week’s hearing in sou motu PIL 4/2020 with 10/2020 based on TOI reports, the HC had asked Neeri about progress of the retrospective study. In response to the query, Neeri filed this affidavit disclosing that it was yet to receive the samples and it was not feasible to conduct the study under such circumstances. Neeri also stated that the GMCH dean, on one occasion, refused to accept official letter and turned back the Neeri staffer carrying the letter. Officials said the medical college had informed the department concerned which red-flagged sharing the samples over confidentiality issues. “The patients’ data can’t be shared to a third party without their consent. Before the study, a confidentiality agreement was signed between the principal investigator and patients. If the court issue order in this regard, the principal investigator will call the patients and take their consent. If the patient agrees, it can be given,” they claimed. The study on plasma therapy shall entail genome sequencing of samples of Covid patients who received the experimental therapy under ‘Project Platina’. The expert panel would be looking for possible mutations in the novel coronavirus in samples of plasma recipients collected on first, seventh and 14th day. Timeline May 12 | HC asks CSIR-Neeri to submit a report after conducting a research on use of plasma and its possible effects on accelerating the mutations in Covid-19 virus May 21 | Divisional commissioner writes to GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta, requesting him to provide RT-PCR samples collected from patients during Project Platina trial to Neeri June 11 | As samples remain pending, again a reminder was sent to GMCH dean for the same June 12 | Neeri staffer who reached GMCH to deliver another letter to the dean allegedly snubbed.

However, the students of the remaining years or semesters will be promoted on the basis of internal examination marks. The date of examination is yet to be decided. The decision was taken in the examination committee meeting held on Thursday. The examination of final-year/semester will be held on a multiple-choice question pattern. The question paper format will depend on respective courses. For promotion of other students, departments and colleges which could not hold internal examinations due to the pandemic have been asked to organise online tests and upload marks on the LU examination portal. In case examinations were held but a student couldn’t appear, departments and colleges will hold an online test for such students again. The state government had recommended that all state universities and their associated colleges conduct examinations for second- and final-year students of UG courses and for final-year students of PG courses. Those in other years/semesters were to be promoted. However, the government had given freedom to universities to decide on the pattern of exam and promotion. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “With regard to the promotion of students, if colleges and departments have not been able to hold semester exams due in June, they will have to organise online internal exam at their level and upload marks on the LU exam portal. Students will be promoted on the basis of internal assessment of this year/semester.” With regard to final-year/semester students, he said that examinations will be held in the offline mode. “We have announced the question paper format and time duration. Examination schemes will be announced later,” he added.

Shivam along with the gangster was allegedly involved in gunning down eight policemen, including deputy superintendent of police Devendra Kumar Mishra in Bikru village of the district on the night of July 2 when they had gone to arrest them in connection with an attempt to murder case lodged at Chaubeypur police station by a local Rahul Tiwari. It was the first action under the NSA against the accused of the Bikru massacre. Under the NSA, a person can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if the authorities feel he or she is a threat to national security or law and order. “Shivam, who was booked under sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 307, 394, 120 b of IPC and 7 CLA Act and 3/25 Arms Act with regard to Bikru shootout on July 2 & 3 night, was arrested by Special Task Force on July 23 from Chaubeypur,” said the police. ASP, STF, Vishal Vikram Singh had then stated Shivam was present on the day of the ambush as per electronic evidence and also the statements given by other members of the gang arrested earlier. Shivam was arrested from near a detergent factory close to Chaubepur police station of the district. Shivam had also taken shelter at his maternal aunt’s place in Hardoi. The double-barrel gun used by him to attack the cops was also seized from his possession. ADG Bhanu Bhaskar said, “District magistrate (Kanpur Nagar) on Thursday ordered slapping the National Security Act against Shivam Dubey, one of the accused in the Bikru massacre case.” A senior police official told TOI that going by the findings, Shivam, a cousin of Vikas, was a very close aide of the latter. “Shivam was a terror in Bikru and used to look after fish ponds of the slain gangster in the village,” he said and added, “Soon after the Bikru incident, the police had declared a reward of Rs 50,000 on his arrest.” To recall, eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were ambushed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur when they were going to arrest the gangster and fell to bullets fired from rooftops shortly after midnight on July 2.

At least 50 farmers will be trained in every fruit belt at a time. This will help growers take better care of the crop and also increase its export as the pre-harvest and post-harvest management is a must to produce good quality mangoes.  The export of mangoes from UP is very less compared to its production. On Wednesday, the UP state horticultural co-operative marketing federation (HOFED) organised a virtual mango buyer and seller meet to discuss ways to increase the export of the mangoes from the state. The government has taken measures to popularise varieties like Chausa and Langda and also increase their export. The mango exporters from UP, Uttarakhand, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Guwahati participated in the meet along with the mango growers from different mango-producing districts of UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mango-growers-to-get-horticulture-training/articleshow/83621005.cms||---

The process includes identification of telecom-electric cables and water-sewer pipelines under the ground and their shifting-diversion as needed. Usually, these utilities are identified through manual excavation but here in Kanpur, UPMRC is using the state-of-the-art technology of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to identify utilities (telecom-electric cables and water-sewer pipelines). Through GPR technique, underground utilities are identified using Radio Waves. Radio Waves are sent below the ground and they identify the obstacles beneath. Through the frequency received at the receiver, it is decoded that, which type of obstacle is there. In Kanpur, UPMRC is using 200-400 MHz frequencies to identify them precisely even at greater depths. Managing Director, UPMRC, Kumar Keshav said, “Usually, utilities like cables and pipelines are located up to two meters depth below the ground, but Kanpur is an old planned city, so there is a possibility of finding these utilities even at greater depth. UPMRC wants to ensure that the tunnelling work in the future won’t get affected due to these utilities and people won’t have any inconvenience. GPR ensures it can locate and image the utilities, up to 10 meters depth below the ground”. The start of Utility identification annd diversion process is part of second leg of phase one of Kanpur Metro project between Chunniganj and Nayaganj. In between these two ends, there will be four metro stations - all of them would be underground. Since the stations would be underground, metro authorities is now engaged in identifying utilities (telecom-electric cables and water-sewer pipelines) and shifting/diverting them, if needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/utility-identification-process-on-underground-metro-corridor-starts/articleshow/83616394.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fraudsters also held vax drives for two film production houses||MUMBAI: Just a day before the fraudulent vaccination camp at an upper crust Kandivali society, former hospital employee Rajesh Pandey had organised a similar camp at a film production house in Andheri where 150 people were vaccinated. A Kandivali police team visited the production house and gathered details of the camp. Bollywood producer Ramesh Taurani too said Pandey had organised a vaccination camp for his staff and colleagues on May 29, the same day as the camp at the other production house, as well as on June 3. Till late on Thursday, no FIR was registered. Police said they are awaiting the BMC's technical report before proceeding further. Pandey used to work at the Kokilaben Ambani Hospital and has since been sacked. A producer attached with the Andheri based production house said they were acquainted with Pandey for three years and trusted him implitcitly. "Pandey would help us get appointments out of turn with the best doctors or organise beds if someone from our staff or families needed hospitalisation. He was our go-to man for all medical needs. So, when the authorities gave a go-ahead to private hospitals to carry out vaccination camps in societies and corporate offices, we approached Pandey," he said. On May 21, Pandey texted the producer to ask how many people were to be vaccinated. The production house gave him a list of names, Aadhaar numbers and Co-Win registration numbers of 150 people. These included some of their crew, residents of the housing society where their office was located and support staff like watchmen, drivers and helps. On May 29, the vaccination camp was carried out and Pandey dropped in for sometime to check if everything was fine. He told the producer that the beneficiaries' data would be entered online by their back office later. When the certificates were not generated, the producer inquired with Pandey. Later, a few beneficiaries received certificates issued by a Vile Parle based hospital that was not involved in the vaccination camp. Pandey had charged Rs 1260 per person for the shots and asked for the money to be transferred online into a current account. "It was only after Hiranandani Heritage residents approached the police and Pandey was picked up for questioning did we realise that our vaccination camp was fraudulent as well. We are very worried as to what have our crew and society residents been injected with and whether it could harm them," said the producer. We immediately got our crew to undergo RT-PCR tests to rule out Covid infections," he said. A bunch of film producers had planned to pool in money and get Pandey to organise vaccination for an entire slum colony. They are glad the scam came to light before they could do so. Taurani too said they trusted Pandey as he was a Kokilaben Ambani Hospital staffer. "A vaccination drive was carried out on May 29 and June 3 for our staff, film unit colleagues and workers and we are still waiting for certificates. When my office contacted Pandey, he said the certificates will come by Saturday. Over 350 of our people were vaccinated and paid up Rs 1200 per person plus GST.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp rejects vigilance probe into pongala waste mgmt||Thiruvananthapuram: The demand of BJP for vigilance probe into Attukal pongala waste management was rejected through voting during the special council held here on Thursday. Fifty-four councillors opted against vigilance probe while 33 councillors of BJP were in favour of probe. Thirteen councillors of UDF did not take part in voting. BJP demanded a special council after an agenda came up in the last meeting about ratifying the anticipatory sanction given by mayor Arya Rajendran for taking 21 trucks on rent at a cost of over Rs 3 lakh for cleaning works related to Attukal pongala. Mayor Arya showed assertion and authority in the chair as she picked on each of the opposition councillors and flagged contradictions in their statements. While the usual norm has been to reserve the mayor’s comments for the final minutes of the council, Arya broke the pattern and took the opposition councillors head on and cornered them by openly contradicting their statements.Veteran BJP councillor P Ashok Kumar sensed the danger in mayor’s move and he said that such interruptions could upset the rhythm of speech and this was unprecedented. Arya was quick with the retort. “I have the right to intervene, if you mislead the council I will exercise that right. Don’t tell me about my experience, you can use some other venue for that,” she said. When BJP councillors rose with the clamour that one of their women councillors Simi Jyothish was being taunted, Arya again stepped in. “You seem to have no qualms targeting people without any regard for their age or gender. Why would it concern you now?” she asked. Arya who has been in the thick of the storm over allegations in waste management of Attukal pongala was being trolled for her young age with comparisons that corporation administration was not a child’s play. BJP mainly centred their allegations around two demands — there should be a vigilance probe into the waste management during pongala and that the agenda may be passed only after clearance from local fund audit department. BJP councillor Karamana Ajith said that the contractor who had entered into an agreement with corporation for waste management could not be traced. The ruling council which was able to brush aside the demand for vigilance probe however faced questions regarding mismanagement of vehicles in corporation’s garage. BJP councillors alleged that corporation promoted private vehicles for money and hence did not manage its own vehicles. The mayor said that contrary to the allegation that only 60 workers were deployed on pongala day, there were 395 workers in various health circles on duty. The city corporation is yet to clear the pending bills and it will be processed after a report is received from the health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-rejects-vigilance-probe-into-pongala-waste-mgmt/articleshow/83616689.cms||---

Shivam along with the gangster was allegedly involved in gunning down eight policemen, including deputy superintendent of police Devendra Kumar Mishra in Bikru village of the district on the night of July 2 when they had gone to arrest them in connection with an attempt to murder case lodged at Chaubeypur police station by a local Rahul Tiwari. It was the first action under the NSA against the accused of the Bikru massacre. Under the NSA, a person can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if the authorities feel he or she is a threat to national security or law and order. “Shivam, who was booked under sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 307, 394, 120 b of IPC and 7 CLA Act and 3/25 Arms Act with regard to Bikru shootout on July 2 & 3 night, was arrested by Special Task Force on July 23 from Chaubeypur,” said the police. ASP, STF, Vishal Vikram Singh had then stated Shivam was present on the day of the ambush as per electronic evidence and also the statements given by other members of the gang arrested earlier. Shivam was arrested from near a detergent factory close to Chaubepur police station of the district. Shivam had also taken shelter at his maternal aunt’s place in Hardoi. The double-barrel gun used by him to attack the cops was also seized from his possession. ADG Bhanu Bhaskar said, “District magistrate (Kanpur Nagar) on Thursday ordered slapping the National Security Act against Shivam Dubey, one of the accused in the Bikru massacre case.” A senior police official told TOI that going by the findings, Shivam, a cousin of Vikas, was a very close aide of the latter. “Shivam was a terror in Bikru and used to look after fish ponds of the slain gangster in the village,” he said and added, “Soon after the Bikru incident, the police had declared a reward of Rs 50,000 on his arrest.” To recall, eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were ambushed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur when they were going to arrest the gangster and fell to bullets fired from rooftops shortly after midnight on July 2. Vikas was killed in an encounter in the morning of July 10, when a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur met with an accident and he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti area in Sachendi, the police had said. Prior to Dubey’s encounter, five of his alleged associates were killed in separate encounters, while 36 including two cops and four women were arrested and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/nsa-invoked-against-bikru-massacre-accused-shivam-dubey/articleshow/83616412.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BSP chief Mayawati raps Akhilesh Yadav again, tries to drive a wedge in SP||LUCKNOW: BSP chief Mayawati on Thursday made a fresh attempt to drive a wedge in the Samajwadi Party camp by accusing party president Akhilesh Yadav of not taking his own cadre on board while inducting defectors from Opposition parties. “It seems the SP chief cannot repose faith on his local leaders. He is so desperate to steal the limelight that he’s embracing discarded and uninfluential leaders of other political parties,” she tweeted. Mayawati’s barb at Akhilesh comes a day after the SP boss inducted Amar Pal, former BSP MLA from Sahibabad assembly seat. Pal had contested from Ghaziabad in 2007 as an Independent and managed to garner only 9.5% votes. His political presence drew the attention of Mayawati, who decided to field him from Sahibabad in 2012, which he won. He, however, soon lost the confidence of the BSP supremo, who denied him a ticket in 2017 assembly elections. Pal switched to Congress and managed to secure 26.50% of votes. With Congress struggling to find a foothold in UP, Pal is learnt to have begun hobnobbing with the SP, ahead of the assembly elections next year. BSP chief’s fresh attack on Samajwadi Party brass comes two day after few suspended party MLAs — Mohammad Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel, Aslam Ali, Hargovind Bhargav, Mohammad Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind and Vandana Singh — met Akhilesh, in what was seen as a realignment of regional political leaders to take on BJP in the 2022 UP assembly elections. Mayawati had suspended the MLAs on charges of opposing party’s official candidate, Ramji Gautam, in 2020 Rajya Sabha elections. The meeting of suspended BSP MLAs with Akhilesh triggered a sharp riposte from Mayawati, who claimed SP chief’s decision to induct suspended BSP lawmakers would stoke dissent in his ranks and many are “waiting” to walk into BSP fold. BSP sources said, her statement signalled a deft strategy of driving a fissure in the Samajwadi Party, which put up a formidable challenge to BJP in the recently concluded rural local bodies’ polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-raps-akhilesh-again-tries-to-drive-a-wedge-in-sp/articleshow/83621047.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Left protests against hike in fuel prices||AURANGABAD: Local left leaders on Thursday staged a protest against the government over rise in fuel prices and its alleged anti-public policies. Gathered under the banner of Communist Party of India (M), the protesters raised slogans against the government before handing over a memorandum of demands to the district administration. Advocate Sachin Gandale said the state government should come forward and offer relief to the common man, suffering due to rise in prices of fuel as well as edible oil. “All left parties have planned a state-wide protest against the government from June 17. Instead of engaging in a blame-game, the Centre and the state government should offer immediate relief to the citizens from inflation,” he said. The party also demanded an audit of milk societies in Maharashtra. “Milk societies, both cooperative and private, reduced purchasing price of milk citing the pandemic. However, it remains to see whether there was an actual drop in demand for milk. We demand an audit of milk procured and supplies by these societies,” Gandale said. Citing issues faced by the farmers, left leaders have demanded smooth supply of seeds, fertilizers and other essentials required for agricultural purpose during the ongoing Kharif season. “There is need for waiver in power bills, especially those of farmers during the ongoing pandemic,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/left-protests-against-hike-in-fuel-prices/articleshow/83611873.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||40,000 vaccines in stock with AMC||Aurangabad: Amid the reducing footfall of beneficiaries, the stock of vaccine with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had increased to around 40,000 by Thursday. The civic authorities said vaccinating those above 18 years of age is being mooted after official approval from the state government considering the slow pace of vaccination among citizens above 45 years of age. “While citizens used to wait for vaccines earlier, now our health staffers at vaccination sites are waiting for beneficiaries. Besides, the increased gap in two doses, the reduced momentum of vaccination can be also attributed to reluctance from a section of people to take the vaccine,” said AMC health officer Neeta Padalkar. The AMC is receiving a supply of vaccine in batches of 5,000 to 6,000 regularly. As per official data, around 1,888 vaccinations had taken place in the past week in Aurangabad by Wednesday. “While the Centre has recently stated that online registration is not mandatory for anyone above 18 years to avail the vaccine, the state government is expected to ratify the stand shortly. We are expecting an official order from the states to resume vaccination for those above 18 years,” she said. AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey, who had earlier contemplated action against eligible beneficiaries for not taking the vaccine, said on Wednesday that he was in favour of such a step if the need arises. Balasaheb Mule, a 79-year old resident of Garkheda area, said “I may be wrong, but I have still not overcome the fear of vaccination. My children and grandchildren tried to convince me to take the vaccine, but I am still against it.” As per official data, the municipal limits of Aurangabad have witnessed a total of 3,33,405 vaccinations so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/40000-vaccines-in-stock-with-amc/articleshow/83611909.cms||Prasad Joshi

A meeting held on Thursday among some of the colleges was inconclusive. While most affiliated colleges will follow the admission process decided by the university, autonomous ones have the liberty to adopt their own methods, said an MU official. A majority of colleges choose to use the board scores every year. However, this year, with the board exams cancelled, many of the autonomous colleges were in favour of entrance exams or some screening process. Many sought after colleges such as Jai Hind, Ruia, Xavier’s, Mithibai, NM, Podar are among the 42 autonomous colleges in the city. The problem these colleges face is the number of applications is much higher than the seats available, said a government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/autonomous-colleges-await-maharashtra-state-directive/articleshow/83619481.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra rains: Panchaganga river overflowing, 58 barrages submerged||KOLHAPUR: The heavy rainfall over the past three days across the district and in the catchment areas of the dams has caused the Panchaganga river to overflow at the Panchaganga ghat. The water level of the river on Wednesday was 13 feet at the Rajaram barrage. By Thursday evening, it had risen to 31.1 feet — an increase of almost 18 feet within a day. It is to be noted that the warning level is 39 feet. If the intense rainfall continues, then a further increase in the river water level is expected. The intensity of the rain lashing the district increased on Wednesday evening, and it continued incessantly till Thursday noon. Citizens got a little respite in the afternoon, but the rain started again by the evening. In 24 hours, Kolhapur district had received 104.3mm rainfall. The Gaganbawda taluka received the most (182.7mm), followed by Shahuwadi (127mm) and Radhanagari (119mm). The Rajaram barrage over the Panchaganga river was submerged disconnecting the Vadange, Nigwe, Pohale, Bhuye, Bhuyewadi and Kushire villages from the Kasba Bawda area of the city. Commuters to and from these villages had to take a long route via Shiye village or use the Shivaji bridge. As per the district disaster management officials, 58 barrages in the district were submerged due to swollen river waters. Seven barrages over the Panchaganga river, four over Bhogawati and Kumbhi rivers, six over Warna, three over Tulsi and Tamraparni rivers, 10 barrages over Vedganga river, eight over Hiranyakeshi river, four barrages over Ghatprabha, Dudhganga and Kasari rivers were among the barrages submerged affecting the traffic movement on both sides. A part of the bridge over a stream got washed away on the stretch between Chandre and Majgaon village on the Kolhapur-Gargoti route. Traffic on the Kolhapur-Gargoti state highway has been diverted via the Nidhori route and MSRTC buses to Gargoti from Kolhapur have been diverted via the Kagal-Nidhori route. Five district routes have also been inundated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/panchaganga-overflowing-58-barrages-submerged/articleshow/83611905.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Business||Company sells special eggs for vaccine, strikes it rich||MUMBAI: A vaccine producer has isolated a disease-causing virus, procured specialised raw materials and glass vials, and is set to start producing life-saving boosters. But how does it replicate the virus for mass-immunisation? Enter eggs. Viruses that are used for several vaccine production need host cells to grow. Fertile chicken eggs are an effective medium for virus replication and have been in use for over 70 years. Coronavirus: Live updatesIndia’s largest poultry producer Venky’s, which has almost 100% market share in the country for specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs and supplies to Serum Institute of India and Hester Biosciences, has seen demand going up but not due to Covid immunisation. “At present, SPF eggs are not being used for the production of Covid vaccines. However, research is going in this direction. The high demand is due to the rise in the cost of imported eggs and increased requirement of other vaccines, including for poultry,” Venky’s GM Prasanna Pedgaonkar told TOI. Of the 10 lakh SPF eggs being produced by us every month, a substantial quantity is used for the production of human vaccines for diseases like rabies and flu (including H1N1),” he said. For Covid vaccines which require virus replication, alternatives like cell culture are being used. “The price of SPF eggs depends on quantity & supply frequency. The price quoted by US-based producers is $2-2.5 per egg. The landing price in India will be higher because of freight & duty. Venky’s eggs are priced at around $1 per egg,” Pedgaonkar said. Venky’s completed SPF egg capacity expansion in October 2020, according to an exchange filing in May. The company said its capacity utilization was 63% in May 2021, and it is targeting 85% utilization of the annual capacity of 1.4-crore SPF eggs in FY22 and reach 90% in FY23. From being the first Asian company to make eggs for vaccine production in 1983, Venky’s has grown to become the world’s fourth-largest SPF egg producer. Venky's founder B V Rao, known as the father of poultry farming in India, started a poultry vaccine production facility called Ventri Biologicals in 1979. “To avoid dependence on imports, Venky’s signed a technology transfer deal with a US company in 1983 for local production of SPF eggs. Since 1988, India has been self-sufficient in SPF egg requirements,” Pedgaonkar said, adding that Venky’s also exports SPF eggs. Venky’s has virtually no competitors in SPF egg production in the country due to a complex and lengthy manufacturing process. “To produce an SPF poultry flock one has to select pure lines (pedigree stock) on the basis of characteristics like disease resistance, eggshell quality, feed intake, superior production, and maximum livability. These flocks then have to be cleaned against vertically and laterally transmitted poultry disease agents for three generations, which takes at least 6-7 years,” Pedgaonkar said. During their lifetime, the birds cannot be vaccinated nor can they be treated with antibiotics. According to Pedgaonkar, the birds’ blood samples are tested every week against 42 antibodies to confirm their SPF status. Any failure leads to starting from scratch. The flocks also have special requirements like filtered air positive pressure houses, pre-heated feed, filtered water supply, and strict biosecurity. Venky’s reported a profit of Rs 78 crore in the January-March 2021 quarter led by better realisations in the sale of chicks and broilers despite seeing some impact of bird flu in January. Its stock at Rs 2,618 is near its 52-week high level and has risen over 48% in 2021. Pedgaonkar added that the SPF division is important for Venky’s not just from a revenue perspective but due to its potential for diversification. “We are engaged in immunisation of SPF birds against human/poultry viruses with repeated doses. The antibodies produced are then transferred to egg yolks, which are purified & used for treatment, particularly in rotavirus infection in children (which causes severe diarrhea). Studies are also going on to use this technology for the treatment of snake bites, rabies, tetanus, etc,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/company-sells-special-eggs-for-vaccine-strikes-it-rich/articleshow/83622303.cms||Aseem Gujar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC starts collecting vaccine certs from society, no probe report yet||Mumbai: A day after initiating an inquiry into the allegedly fraudulent vaccination drive at Hiranandani Heritage Coperative Housing Society in Kandivli, the BMC sought copies of vaccination certificates from all those who took the jabs and started collating names of those who did not get certificates. So far, 151 residents out of 390 who were vaccinated have submitted copies of certificates. A building resident, Dinesh Zala, whose wife and brother were vaccinated, said his wife submitted a copy of the certificate. But Zala said he was upset no one appeared interested in finding out what was administered to the society residents. Local BJP MLA Yogesh Sagar said housing societies must insist on an MoU while conducting camps for their members. The BMC on Monday also in a circular insisted on an MoU which it said should have details like number of medical staff stationed at the vaccination site and ambulances in case of adverse effects. “Every private vaccination centre is given a registration number on CoWin, which should be checked by residents,” said Sagar, who initiated another drive in the same society on Wednesday in which 346 residents were vaccinated. Members of some housing societies said they have been careful while conducting such camps. Jayant Shetty, chairman of the 20-storeyed Raheja Heights Complex in Dindoshi said they went through three hospitals before deciding on Surya Hospital to inoculate their residents. Civic officials said drives conducted in many societies need no permission from BMC but an intimation needs to be sent to it.  AMC Suresh Kakani said he is yet to receive a preliminary report on the incident from the BMC. “There is a clause mandating an MoU. Societies should ensure it’s done and if required, check if the centre is registered with BMC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-starts-collecting-vaccine-certs-from-society-no-probe-report-yet/articleshow/83619144.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||Govt asks DMs to boost work generation under MNREGS||Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh generated a record 40 crore person days under the Centre’s flagship Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) in 2020-21, but it was good enough to create on an average 42 days of jobs to the needy families against the provision of 100 days. Highlighting this point in a letter sent to all district magistrates of UP, additional chief secretary (rural development), Manoj Kumar Singh, has asked them to step up efforts to boost the employment generation under the scheme to give a fillip to the rural economy of the state. The letter, dated June 15, also pointed out that the state stood at 17th position in the country when it came to employment provided to the physically challenged under the scheme. Singh said that improving the position was one of the key priorities of the state government. Even the participation of Dalits and women was also a cause of concern and demanded an immediate redressal. Singh said that to fulfill the objective of `Atmanirbhar Abhiyan’ and MNREGS it was essential to ensure that the needy are provided 100 days of employment. This, he said, would lead to an increased confidence of villagers towards the scheme and an increased income which is crucial for boosting the rural economy. The state government has now set the standard of providing employment under the scheme to 200 families in every gram panchayat of east UP region and 100 families of every gram panchayat in west UP. Singh has asked the DMs to send the list of selected families not to the MNREGS cell of the department but also ensure that the details of the families are made public at the development block level of every gram panchayat. Beneficiaries getting employment more than 90 days would be registered in UP Bhawan and Building and Other Constructions Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 so that they can get benefits of various government schemes. Data also show that SC accounted for 31.48% of active workers while the women contributed to 33.59% of the total person days of employment in 2020-21, which, officials said, also required a boost. In 2021-22 the state government has set the target of increasing the target of providing women 43.68% of the total person days of employment under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-asks-dms-to-boost-work-generation-under-mnregs/articleshow/83621112.cms||Pankaj Shah

Last month, the state government made a Covid negative certificate mandatory for people entering the state following directions from the high court. There are many tourists coming in mini-buses and cars, Shack Owners Welfare Society general secretary and Baga-Calangute resident John Lobo told TOI on Thursday. “There are so many tourists coming to Baga and Calangute and roaming openly. When we asked them, they said that there was no checking at the state’s border. None of the tourists had a Covid negative certificate,” he said. “The chief minister has announced that tourists will be allowed only when the positivity rate comes down to 5%. If the CM is so serious, how are the tourists allowed to come now? If they are serious about controlling the entry of tourists, then they should do the checking properly. We don’t want the third wave coming. Things are just beginning to improve in Goa, but allowing tourists without any checks will mean new mutants of the virus will enter Goa and we’ll have a major problem again,” Lobo said. Even though people are not allowed on the beach, stakeholders said tourists are seen roaming around on the beach. “The police only stop them at the main Calangute beach and Baga, but there are so many other places where they can go on the beach,” a Calangute panchayat member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/domestic-tourists-coming-sans-any-checks-at-border/articleshow/83619145.cms||---

Given the importance of the message, I called on the same number and the person speaking asked me some basic questions before asking me to download a mobile app to enable fee payment of Rs 10,” said the senior citizen, preferring anonymity. The retired bureaucrat tried to pay Rs 10 by using netbanking facility from one bank account, which failed. Following this, the unidentified person asked him to try another bank account. “The transaction towards payment of Rs 10 was successful in the second attempt and the caller told me that a link will be sent on my phone in a few minutes to submit Aadhaar details. While I was waiting for the link, I got a message from the bank that a further amount of money has been debited from my account, leaving me shell-shocked,” he said.

---||Lucknow||RSS’ Hindu Samrajya Utsav to invoke the valour of Shivaji||Lucknow: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh would celebrate the valour of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to invoke the Hindu pride through a week-long programme to mark the Hindu Samrajya Utsav, the first event in the Sangh’s annual calendar of six events that call for celebration of Hindu ‘sanskriti’ and ‘asmita’. The Sangh’s annual session starts from June. After a brief lull in the routine activities of the Sangh due to Covid-19 when most its working was happening digitally, the Hindu Samrajya Utsav would bring the organization back to its routine functioning as there would be discussions and lectures for workers and office-bearers. The Covid-19 protocol would also be followed. The Hindu Samrajya Utsav celebrates the day Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was crowned. Shivaji Maharaj had called it the day of the establishment of Hindu Swarajya. Stories of his valour and struggle would be shared with the `karyakartas’ and his sacrifice would be remembered. The coronation ceremony, as is in the annals, was held on the `shukl jeth trayodashi’ as per the Hindu calendar. This year it would be on June 23. The Hindu Samrajya Utsav is not the only event that celebrates the valour and sacrifices of Hindu Kings; several other events on RSS annual calendar, too, promote the relevance of Hindu festivals. The other events are Guru Purnima, Rakshabandhan, Vijay Dashmi, Makar Sankranti and Hindu Navsamvatsar. With the beginning of its annual session, the Sangh has also started meetings to plan the annual activities for its six regions (prants) in UP. The `yojna baithak’ for the Awadh Prant and Kanpur Prant is scheduled for June 19 and June 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-hindu-samrajya-utsav-to-invoke-the-valour-of-shivaji/articleshow/83621080.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Goa||Soon after Rao’s arrival, Cong witnesses threat of rebellion||Panaji: Congress desk in-charge for Goa Dinesh Gundu Rao’s four-day visit to Goa was meant to strengthen the party but barely minutes after landing, Rao found himself in the midst of an open rebellion and fisticuffs. With the party’s youth brigade publicly threatening to break away if state Congress president Girish Chodankar is dropped, doubts have surfaced about the party’s 2022 poll preparations. Officially, Rao is in Goa to reorganise the state unit and strengthen the party’s presence in all 40 assembly constituencies, but state party vice-president Sankalp Amonkar said it is too late to tinker with the party’s hierarchy. “Just over six months are left for the assembly elections and any new president requires at least a year to put the blocks in place. Now is not the time to appoint a new party president,” Amonkar told TOI. Amonkar said that AICC should have accepted party president Girish Chodankar’s resignation when he had resigned. “We have told Rao what we think about a change in the party leadership and if he listens to us, it is good. If he does not want to listen to us then we, who have worked on the field for the last two years, will take our own decision and chart our own course,” said Amonkar. Varad Mardolkar, Jana Bhandari, Amarnath Panjikar, Vijay Bhike and several other younger functionaries share Amonkar’s view which they conveyed to Rao when they met him. According to Panjikar, Rao assured them that there are no plans to change the party leadership. “We are doing a full review and discussion. I will be going to different constituencies,” Rao said. Amonkar’s ultimatum was not the only indication that all is not well within Congress. With tempers running high, senior Congress functionaries clashed and got into a physical altercation at the hotel at Fatorda where Rao is put up. The developments laid bare the discord within Congress ranks. Rao is slated to meet party MLAs at 7pm on Friday. “He is going to visit the blocks of the party,” said Chodankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-after-raos-arrival-cong-witnesses-threat-of-rebellion/articleshow/83619103.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh reaches out to ministers ahead of cabinet meeting today||CHANDIGARH: A day before the meeting of the council of ministers, chief minister Amarinder Singh met his cabinet colleagues, besides continuing with his interactions with party MLAs for the third day on Thursday. The interaction with the ministers was being seen as an attempt to pre-empt any resistance to the cabinet meeting agenda, including implantation of the 6th pay commission report, an item that was not brought up during the last meeting. A minister who attended the meeting later said the implications of the recommendations of the pay commission, including the burden on the state exchequer, were discussed. There are 26-odd agenda items for the cabinet meeting. The meeting not only comes amid talks of changes in the cabinet, but also at a time when a section of the party leaders, including some ministers, have raised questions at the style of functioning of their own government before the AICC appointed panel. Even though there have been reports that there is a move to appoint sons of two Congress MLAs on compassionate grounds as DSP and tehsildar, the matter could not be brought on the main agenda, said sources. The previous cabinet meeting was held under the shadow of the feedback exercise by the three-member Kharge panel, but a section of the ministers was not keen on attending and the agenda had to be truncated. The recommendations of the 6th pay commission were to be taken up in the last meeting. Meanwhile, pictures posted on the social media pages of the chief minister stated: “Had detailed meetings with my cabinet colleagues and also met our MLAs to discuss the ongoing work in their respective assembly constituencies.” Congress MPs Ravneet Singh Bittu (Ludhiana) and Gurjit Singh Aujla (Amritsar), besides MLA Raj Kumar Verka also met with the chief minister. Verka said he raised issues pertaining to Dalits with the chief minister and had assured to regularise sanitary workers working on contractual basis in the state. “He has given the orders and the item is likely to be formally approved in the cabinet meeting,” he said. Party circles have been abuzz with reports that the party high command could call the Punjab leadership for an interaction with Sonia Gandhi around June 20 to make Amarinder and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu bury the hatchet. However, there has been no confirmation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-reaches-out-to-ministers-ahead-of-cabinet-meeting-today/articleshow/83619089.cms||---

The minor, who is 16-year-old is from Uttar Pradesh while the other girl is a native of Maharashtra. An NGO had received information that a 16-year-old girl was brought to the city to be pushed into prostitution and its members approached the Mahila police station. “Along with this minor girl, police also found another young girl, who revealed that she and the minor were brought to the city by a man named Santosh, a native of Aligarh,” said Manoharsinh Jadeja, deputy commissioner of police, zone-2. Santosh has, however, fled and police have launched a hunt for him. Police said both girls were in the hotel for the past one-and-a-half-month. When NGO’s volunteers and cops from the police station raided the hotel, the minor girl was found alone in a room, but police also stumbled upon a prostitution racket run by Prabhudas Kakkad, a resident of Ramnagar, and Jaishree Chavda, who lives in Virat Society and hails from Vadodara. Along with the Kakkad and Chavda, police also arrested hotel manager Mehul Toralia, 30. Sources said some people linked to the hotel reportedly have affiliations with the ruling party. The duo used to run the racket with the help of a woman from West Bengal and charge Rs 2,000 from men. Police said that the woman and hotel used to be paid Rs 500 each and Kakkad and Chavda used to share the remaining amount equally. An offence was registered against Kakkad and Chavda under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act at Pradyuman Nagar police station. The minor girl is under trauma and the NGO will take her to Mumbai later where the local police complete the legal procedures and find out about Santosh, said a police official. Sejal Patel, inspector, Mahila police station, said the girl will be counselled in a day or two after the mental condition normalizes slightly. A separate offence will be lodged in this case once the girl speaks up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sex-racket-busted-during-raid-to-rescue-minor-up-girl/articleshow/83616807.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Udayanraje writes to CM with demands for Maratha youths||KOLHAPUR: Rajya Sabha MP Udayanraje Bhonsle has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray listing six demands for the Maratha community, which are more-or-less similar to the demands made by MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati. Sambhajiraje, meanwhile, held a meeting with Thackeray and senior ministers of his cabinet. It has been learned that the CM has accepted some of the demands and has accordingly asked the officials to issue orders to their respective departments. The demands include funds for the SARTHI institute and the Annasaheb Patil Arthik Vikas Mahamandal — the corporation formed to provide loans to youths to set up businesses. The demands also include immediate posting to over 2,000 Maratha youths in government jobs. These youth had passed the state public service exams, but their appointments had been halted after the Supreme Court turned down the Maratha reservation. Now, Udayanraje Bhonsle has sought additional seats in educational institutes, mainly medical and engineering, in a supernumerary manner to accommodate more Maratha students. He has set a July 5 deadline for the government to meet the demands and warned of agitations if the demands are not met. In his letter, Bhinsle wrote: “The government is neglecting the demands. If it continues to do so, then there will be an outbreak of agitations. The demands are under the jurisdiction of the state government. These demands will provide temporary relief to the Maratha community and the government must also focus on getting the reservation.” Recently, Udayanraje and Sambhajiraje, both descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, had met in Pune to discuss the demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/udayanraje-writes-to-cm-with-demands-for-maratha-youths/articleshow/83612018.cms||---

She also stressed the need for continuing the medical education and hence she said nothing should affect the academic sessions in the college.She also visited the ICU being set up exclusively for Covid treatment. “The 100-bed ICU is getting ready of which 50 beds are ready for functioning. The remaining beds will be ready within 10 days,” said the minister.She said the patient flow has reduced in the hospital and hence the non-Covid treatment will come to normalcy soon as earlier. The minister gave directives to ensure that there is adequate stock of all drugs, necessary equipment and surgical needs at the hospital. There should be adequate stock taking at regular interval and no complaints of shortage should be reported.For facing the third wave, she said at least six month stock should be there in the hospital. She also reviewed the stock of the oxygen and also visited the oxygen plant at the hospital. The minister said the government has sanctioned Rs 2.10 crore for developing 27 hospitals in the state.

---||Jaipur||Dungarpur No. 1 in Rajasthan, 93,000 have own houses||UDAIPUR: Dungarpur district has clinched the first position in the state and second in the country in providing roofs to residents under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana (PMAY-G). Against the sanctioned 1,00,054 proposals, the Dungarpur administration has disbursed funds for 93,128 persons and helped them realise the dream of owning their house. “The home construction projects continued unhindered even during the lockdown period and funds were timely disbursed. The people are owners of their homes now,” Anjali Rajoria, zila parishad CEO told TOI. The officer said each beneficiary was given Rs 1.20 lakh in three installments and as a bonus they were granted 90 days work under MGNREGA, which meant they were paid Rs 221 per day labour which proved to be an additional income for the target group. This way, each beneficiary received Rs 17,910. Dungarpur, being a tough terrain largely occupied by tribal population having marginal land and low literacy rate, it was a challenge for the district authorities to help the beneficiaries build homes for themselves. Around 1 lakh persons qualifying under the PMAY were identified, informed of the scheme and asked to begin construction on their land. “Those who didn’t have land, the administration identified plots for them. The first instalment amount of Rs 15,000 was released to beneficiaries on commencement of work, second installment of Rs 45,000 after construction at the chair level and final instalment upon completion of the roof,” Rajoria said. An additional Rs 12,000 was also disbursed for making toilets in the houses. “Our target was to cover the maximum possible persons under the PMAY so that they had their own homes before the monsoon. Rains wreak havoc every year and people living in huts suffer due to structural collapses. This year, the beneficiaries would have no such fear,” said Suresh Kumar Ola, Dungarpur collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dungarpur-no-1-in-state-93000-have-own-houses/articleshow/83619153.cms||---

Khaira said the Aam Aadmi Party’s "disillusioned" NRI (non-resident Indian) donors from the 2017 Assembly elections had first supported his Punjabi Ekta Party and now they will back the Congress. Khaira said: "The AAP removed us undemocratically with a tweet. It’s a party that scores self-goals frequently. It’s a one-man show of Arvind Kejriwal and I had made a wrong decision to join it. Look at the way the Congress has intervened to resolve its internal strife in Punjab." The three legislators have announced to join the Congress already by posing with Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh before he left for Delhi to meet the Kharge panel on June 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khaira-2-rebel-aap-mlas-meet-rahul/articleshow/83619150.cms||---
---||Goa||Pramod Sawant points to dip in crime rate, slams netas for denting Goa’s image||PANAJI: There has been an increase in the state’s crime detection rate while the crime rate itself has decreased, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Thursday. He also slammed politicians for “damaging the image of Goa” by criticising the government on social media platforms over issues such as law enforcement and Covid-19 management for political gains. “While the crime detection rate is in the hands of the police, the drop in the crime rate is not. Mere fear of the police does not help in bringing down the crime rate. Instead, the community can help greatly by working together and maintaining good relationships with one another,” he said after inaugurating Santa Cruz’s police outpost building. He exhorted MLAs, panches, community leaders and spiritual leaders to give good advice to the people. Pointing out that politicians tend to attack the home department if a law and situation arises, Sawant said, “I can understand if politicians take potshots at other politicians. But why are personnel of the home department being criticised? They work 24x7.” He used the recent kidnapping of a month-old boy from the GMC as an example and said the police were heaped with criticism when news of the crime spread, but none congratulated the force after it reunited the infant with his family within hours. “If a mistake is committed by the department, it should be brought to the notice of the DGP or me,” Sawant, who holds the home portfolio, said. “Most of the time, what we post on social media can damage the state’s image, but nobody thinks about this. They do it for political gains. People should show them their place,” he said, taking a swipe at the opposition ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. The chief minister said that although the government was criticised over education, tourism and Covid-19 management too, it was the first to have recorded Covid-19 deaths with 100% accuracy. Recalling the shortage of oxygen supply to hospitals last month, he said that while the state had not envisaged a demand of 20 tonne of oxygen, an exponential spike in Covid-19 infections saw the demand soar to even 40 tonne. He claimed that supply was stabilised within 48 hours but by then, Goa’s image had already been dented across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-points-to-dip-in-crime-rate-slams-netas-for-denting-states-image/articleshow/83619146.cms||---

---||Lucknow||In 3.5 years, UP govt bagged 98 investment proposals of Rs 13k cr||Lucknow: The state government on Thursday said it had received 98 investment proposals worth Rs 13,408 crore in the manufacturing sector during the past three-and-a-half years. This included 10 proposals worth Rs 4,250 crore from foreign investors. The remaining 88 are from domestic companies for setting up large manufacturing units in the state that will provide employment to more than 22,028 people. A state government spokesperson said that manufacturing is one sector that industrialists are most cautious about investing in. “They prefer to invest in this sector in only those states which have a conducive environment for investment compared to other states,” he said. Officials said that the sector got the required boost after the state government made policy changes to create a favourable environment for investments. The spokesperson said that the state government had provided land to 66 industrialists out of 88 for establishing manufacturing units. Most of these industrialists have completed the construction of their units and started production as well. Apart from this, 26 major industrialists are moving ahead with their plans to set up firms. According to officials, Covestro IP is setting up a plastic manufacturing unit in Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida) at a cost of Rs 800 crore. Similarly, UltraTech is setting up a cement factory in Prayagraj at a cost of Rs 600 crore. Sparsh Industries Pvt Ltd and Rimjhim Ispat have invested Rs 600 crore and Rs 550 crore respectively in Kanpur Dehat. Likewise, DCM Shriram is setting up a sugar mill in Hardoi at a cost of Rs 361 crore. Kent RO Systems Ltd has invested Rs 300 crore in Gautam Budh Nagar whereas PTC Industries Ltd has invested Rs 205 crore in Lucknow. Besides, MM Forgings Pvt Ltd has invested Rs 150 crore in Barabanki and Password Papers has invested Rs 351 crore in Meerut. Silverstone is setting up a paper mill in Muzaffarnagar at a cost of Rs 180 crore. All these companies have also started production. Besides, Kanodia Group is investing Rs 1,200 crore in Amethi and JK Cement Ltd Rs 650 crore in Aligarh to set up a cement factory. According to the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), the transparency of the state government’s policies is the main reason for rising investments in the state. “The launch of a single window system for facilitating various clearances and certifications by the state government to expedite setting up of factories has made the task of industrialists hassle-free and much easier,” the spokesperson said. Officials said that no objection certificates have been given to 3,52,098 industries in three-and-a-quarter years through the Nivesh Mitra portal. Ficci state chief Amit Gupta said that industrialists have shown full faith in the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-3-5-years-up-govt-bagged-98-investment-proposals-of-rs-13k-cr/articleshow/83621149.cms||---

The payment, he said, was twice that made by the BSP government and 1.5 times more than the SP government. Cane farmers were paid Rs 52,131 crore during the BSP government and Rs 95,215 crore during the Akhilesh regime, the minister said. Rana said the Yogi government has also cleared arrears worth Rs 10,661 crore, pending during the Akhilesh government, to cane farmers. Sugar mills that got shut during the previous governments were revived by the Yogi government and UP now ranks first in sugar production in the country, the minister said. Rana added the state government’s initiatives have changed the fate and face of sugarcane farmers and industry. Along with giving boost to the dying sugar industry, the government has turned the tables around by setting a new record of payment to sugarcane farmers. UP government has crushed more than 4,000 lakh tons of sugarcane and produced record 476 lakh tons of sugar in the four crushing seasons. In another record production, a total of 280 crore litres of ethanol has been produced in the state through 54 distilleries between 2017 and January 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-makes-record-payment-to-cane-farmers-minister/articleshow/83621205.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Farmers see hope in biofloc fish farming||Thiruvananthapuram: Biofloc fish farming, which has set trends in the pisciculture industry, has started gaining popularity among the rural farmers in the district. M S Rafi, a ward member of Madavoor panchayat and a farmer, has launched biofloc fish farming in connection with the Janakeeya Matsyakrishi project of the state government. The biofloc farming has been set up on 10 cents. The profitable method of fish farming is being practised in four tanks which are of four diameter size. By rearing 1,000 fishes each in a tank, Rafi rears a total of 4,000 genetically improved farmed (GIFT) tilapia fish. According to him, the culture period of farming is six months. “After six months, we expect to harvest fish weighing 400-500g each. Probably, we will be selling the yield in the local market,” said Rafi. “Besides the family support, officials of the fisheries department provide essential regulations to be followed in the farming,” said Rafi. “As it requires less water, land and feed, Biofloc farming technology is the best option for people aiming at commercial fish farming,” he added. Biofloc farming system, promoted by the fisheries department, is considered sustainable and eco-friendly. Mostly in aquaculture, the farmers find it difficult to meet certain costly factors, including the availability of land, water and high-quality feeding. Biofloc farming poses solutions to all these issues faced by the farmers. The farming system, which facilitates recycling and reusing of nutrients in the culture medium, is benefited by the limited or zero water exchange. Most importantly, the system reduces the utilization of protein-rich feed and the cost of standard feed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/farmers-see-hope-in-biofloc-fish-farming/articleshow/83616847.cms||---

Singh equated Gehlot to the Congress party in Rajasthan and stressed that the latter would continue as CM for the entire term of the present government. “Gehlot is Congress and Congress is Gehlot in Rajasthan. Under no circumstance can Gehlot be changed as CM; there is no need to even think about it,” Singh told reporters at a press conference in Sikar. Subhash MeelThe independent legislator, who won as a Congress rebel from Khandela in Sikar district, said he did not revolt against the party on being denied assembly ticket but fought the election as local people asked him to do so. Singh was asked if people tell him to support former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, would he do that too. “I will do what I like,” he replied. Singh acknowledged Pilot’s contributions as Congress state president in the run up to 2018 state elections but said the party adequately rewarded the latter. “Congress made him an MP in 2004, union minister in 2009, PCC chief in 2013 and deputy CM in 2018. He was given abundant opportunities to work in government and organisation,” Singh said. He added, “Pilot should not be doing what he is doing right now. He should have worked shoulder to shoulder (as Dy CM with Gehlot); he was given a chance for five years.” Countering Singh, Pilot loyalist Subhash Meel, said, “I would like to ask the MLA where his commitment to Congress was when he contested assembly election against the party candidate in 2018.” Meel, as Congress candidate from Khandela, had finished third against Singh. In a related development, BSP state president Bhagwan Singh Baba attacked the six legislators who were elected on his party ticket but later merged with the Congress. The six MLAs, who are Gehlot backers, had questioned Pilot supporters’ loyalty to the Congress in attempting to topple the party government in Rajasthan. “The six MLAs who are accusing some Congress MLAs of being traitors, are the biggest traitors themselves. These are the same people who left BSP and joined Congress out of greed for posts. How can any other party expect loyalty from those who did not remain faithful to their parent party?” Baba said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-is-cong-no-one-can-replace-him-as-cm-ex-min/articleshow/83619175.cms||---

The group had gone fishing in the reserve forest on Wednesday evening. This is the second such incident of a tiger mauling a man to death in the dense Nighasan range of DTR in two months. Camera traps have been installed around the place where the skeletal remains were found. Forest department officials believe a tigress with two cubs is behind the attack. Anil Patel, divisional forest officer, DTR (buffer), told TOI, “We had already warned the villagers that a tigress has been sighted in this area with two cubs but they continue to ignore our warning. This is the second such incident in nearly two months inside the reserve forest area.” Sources said victim Shivkumar, a resident of Khamaria Dumera village, had gone fishing along with few other locals inside the dense Nighasan range. When the group was returning home, a tiger attacked them, and dragged Shivkumar away. The other members of the group could not muster the courage to chase the tiger away and ran towards their village. The forest department was informed about the attack around 11 pm but the rescue operation could not be carried out as it was too dark. Shivkumar is survived by his widow, six daughters and a son. On April 7, Om Prakash of Dumera Majhra village, had entered the forest area and was killed by a tiger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-goes-fishing-in-dtr-killed-by-tiger/articleshow/83614664.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Udaipur||Udaipur: Parents died in mishap 10 months ago, six kids fending for themselves||UDAIPUR: A day after the District Legal Services Authority reached the home of six orphaned children at Kalbeliya Magra basti in Badgaon block adjoining the city, voluntary organisations rushed to help the kids on Thursday. The parents of the kids were killed in an accident at Debari on September 18 last year. Follwoing DLSA chairman RP Soni’s instruction, secretary Kuldeep Suttrakar went to the basti on Wednesday and met the children. The children’s father, Narayan (35), and mother Rekha (33) were ragpickers. After their death, the children were looked after by their grandmother Gama Devi (70) who received senior citizen pension of Rs 1,000 per month. Since the money was not sufficient for a household of seven members, the eldest boy also became a ragpicker. The other kids are aged 3, 5, 6 and 9 respectively. The only girl is 14 years old. Their grandmother, too, passed away a month ago and since then their lives have been unmerciful with no one to take care of them. When the DLSA team asked the youth if he would like his siblings to be sent to a state shelter home, he refused and said that he would take care of them by any means. The team also observed that the youth was in a state of depression and shock after finding himself responsible for his siblings. The children received no help from any department or the district administration. After starving for some days when the ration stock was exhausted, the eldest, who was over 18 years old, started picking rags to earn money. The children said their parents had taught them not to beg for money and hence when their brother could not make money any day, they would all sleep without food. The DLSA secretary questioned the tehsildar, education and social welfare department, on not reaching out the kids to help or enroll them under the Palanhar yojana, but the official said they did not have any information about these children. Sutrakar appealed to people to call the DLSA helpline number 08306002022 if anyone comes across such children in need of help. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/parents-died-in-mishap-10-months-ago-six-kids-fending-for-themselves/articleshow/83619215.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Centre must rethink MSME schemes, says Telangana minister KT Rama Rao||HYDERABAD: Telangana’s IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao has written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman expressing disappointment at the ‘failure’ of the Rs 20 lakh crore Atmanirbhar package and has urged the government to have a hard look at its strategy to help ailing MSMEs survive the Covid-19 crisis. “As the minister for industries in Telangana, I have focused hard on ensuring that MSMEs benefit from the package. However, one year down the line, I regret to mention that the impact of the package has been minimal for this sector that has really faced the brunt of the pandemic,” he said in the letter. KTR said over 80% of Telangana’s MSMEs have been negatively impacted, with 25% losing significant revenues due to the lockdown and overall pandemic impact. As part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, the ‘Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme’ for MSMEs was announced and Rs 3 lakh crore was allotted. “In Telangana at least, the MSME units did not find anything specifically attractive in the scheme…Every MSME has unique challenges, and a ‘one size fits all’ kind of scheme hardly is the answer …,” he said. Instead, a financial grant that takes care of all the losses that MSMEs have suffered due to the pandemic, would be more beneficial, he said, pointing out that MSMEs continue to face supply chain disruptions and severe shortage of labour. “There are two other schemes targeted at MSMEs in the Atmanirbhar relief package. One of them is meant for stressed MSMEs and the other for innovative MSMEs. Unfortunately, these have been complete nonstarters not just in Telangana, but as data reveals, in the entire country,” he added. KTR said that the subordinate debt scheme for stressed MSMEs offered a meagre loan and it has been an uphill task for MSMES to apply for it because they need to convince the authorities about the commercial viability of their unit, which seems impractical during the pandemic. The guidelines of the corpus fund scheme meant for innovative MSMEs too have not been released yet. He proposed that the PLI scheme for different sectors and large units should be extended to MSMEs as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-must-rethink-msme-schemes-ktr/articleshow/83619217.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), which had met Sawant and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar recently, had said that the state government would reopen the hospitality sector fully only after the Covid-19 positivity rate drops below 5%. “The TTAG has put forth some demands which are under consideration. We are not starting tourism in Goa till the state’s eligible population receives the first dose of vaccine,” the CM told reporters on Thursday. He said the state government has set a target of July 30 to complete the first dose of inoculation to all people who are 18 years and above. “We are getting good response from the public,” he said. TTAG president Nilesh Shah had recently said that the association insisted that tourism be started at the earliest with all protocols in place, and that tourists who are vaccinated be allowed entry into the state freely. He had also said that others may be permitted entry on production of a Covid-19 negative certificate, and that kiosks could be set up through private bodies to let those who wish to visit get tested at the entry points. Recently, Sawant had said that Goa is a preferred tourism destination, both in India and internationally, and that even during the pandemic tourists have preferred it. The state will always welcome tourists, he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-nod-only-after-entire-state-gets-first-jab-cm/articleshow/83619253.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Compensate Kalyan Nagar Society, pay market rate, says high court to Telangana||HYDERABAD: Coming down heavily on the successive governments for failing to protect 38 acres of land belonging to Kalyan Nagar Cooperative Housing Society in Yousufguda, the high court has directed the Telangana government to pay the society prevailing market value and also slapped costs of Rs 2 lakh. The current market value of the land could be anywhere between Rs 1,500 crore and Rs 2,000 crore and the state was asked to cough up this amount and pay it to the society within two months. The court has also directed the state to take the provisions of the 2013 Land Acquisition Act while calculating the market value. A bench of Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar pronounced this order while setting at rest a nearly six-decade-old legal tussle. Kalyan Nagar Cooperative Housing Society was registered in 1963 with 350 members from the lower middle class and middle class families. It had purchased 38 acres and 2,121 square yards of land at Yousufguda in survey No.128/1 and 128/10 in January, 1964 from a few persons. On March 1, 1978, the director of town planning and then Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (now GHMC) had even approved the layout of the Society. However, sale deeds could not be executed in favour of the members/allottees in view of the prohibition under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. The society’s land was exempted from the purview of the Land Ceiling Act in February, 1988. However, the damage was done by then. Due to the huge delay caused in the process, the land was encroached upon by 503 persons with the help of the then-local MLA P Janardhan Reddy. After hearing the petition filed by the society, all 503 occupants of the plots were declared by the land grabbing prohibition court as land grabbers on September 19, 1989. The order was not challenged by the so-called grabbers, and hence this order attained finality. However, the society’s real problems began from then. The then-government never bothered to implement the court order. On the other hand, they asked the society to buy it from the grabbers. The poor society was ready to do that as well. Even that was not done. The state said it would give alternative land. That was also not done. The bench found fault with the state governments for dodging the issue for two decades even after recognising the need to compensate the housing society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-t-compensate-kalyan-nagar-society-pay-market-rate/articleshow/83619210.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Sena-BJP clash a sign of things to come ahead of BMC polls’||Mumbai: The latest Shiv Sena-BJP clash near Shiv Sena Bhavan in Dadar (west) despite Covid-19 restrictions being in place is an indication that strong-arm tactics could mar the Mumbai civic elections that are due next year, said political analysts on Thursday. The Shiv Sena-BJP, which parted ways after the 2019 state assembly election, will be locked in a bitter poll combat to come out tops in the country’s richest municipal corporation. Nearly 15 civic bodies across the state, including Thane, Vasai-Virar and Navi Mumbai, are likely to go to the polls early next year if the pandemic recedes by then, it is learnt. Saamna, in a front page report on Thursday, gleefully claimed that the Sainiks had given a good “pasting” to “bogus” Ram devotees. Many in the Mumbai BJP, especially, the GenNow workers, are of the view that the party needs to change its jaded image and its pro-mercantile leanings to cut into the Sena’s Marathi vote bank. They feel the BJP should counter its former poll ally’s aggressive brand of politics, which is known as ‘rada’ in the city's lexicon. Viewed in this context the BJP youth wing’s morcha assumes significance, said a party legislator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-bjp-clash-a-sign-of-things-to-come-ahead-of-bmc-polls/articleshow/83621309.cms||Ambarish Mishra

The eldest of them is a 13-year-old girl who has been doing odd jobs to look after her young siblings aged 12, 10 and 8 years old. Even heartrending was to know that the second boy went to work as a labourer in Ahmedabad and sends Rs 500- Rs 1,000 each month. Member of the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) Dr Shailendra Pandya received information on Wednesday night that four kids were living all by themselves for many years in a dilapidated hut situated on a hillock in Kauja village of Nathara gram panchayat under Sarada block of the district. Pandya informed the district authorities and went to visit the children on Thursday. Taking the narrow path from Nathara to Kauja, the team walked 2km to reach the children's home. Lali (13), Suresh (10) and Radha (8) (all names changed) were found alone in the hut. Lali told the team that their father Banshilal Meena (48) died 6 years ago and after a year, their mother left them to marry someone else under the Nata system. The relatives, too, left the kids to live on their own and since then Lali has been doing odd jobs and looking after her siblings. The second child, Ramesh (12), went to Ahmedabad and has been working there for some time now. Pandya asked the kids if they would like to be sent to a shelter. The children agreed on the condition that someone would look after their hut and ensure that no one encroached it as it was the only asset they had. The team members were moved seeing the children’s situation. The officials directed the sarpanch to arrange for Ramesh's return from Ahmedabad while the three children were produced before the Child Welfare Committee which sent them to Asra Vikas Sansthan, the state aided shelter home. Bhojraj Singh of the home said the children would be admitted in a school and taken care of until they are able to look after themselves. Pandya also asked the administration to take immediate action on receiving information of orphaned/ vulnerable kids in need of special protection and care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/rights-body-rescues-four-children-struggling-for-survival-in-udaipur/articleshow/83619245.cms||---

Also, there were no cases of local people with travel history reported in the past week.”According to the health official, the cases reported in the past few days were of primary, secondary and tertiary contacts. “It is obvious that the transmission chain is being broken at various points.

It turned out to be an abandoned horse that fell into around eight-foot deep sludge in Aji river near Raj Rajeshwari temple in the vicinity of Vora Bridge in Rajkot. Temple priest Balvant Gosai saw the distressed animal and immediately called up Ranjit Mundhwa, a local leader, for help. Mundhwa called up the fire brigade personnel, who unmindful of the risks literally waded deep into the mess to save the poor animal’s life. The victorious rescue mission was fraught with danger not only for the animal, but for the humans as well, as they had to combat both sludge as well the toxic effluents of the Aji river. The perils of the 45-minute rescue operation ended up in joy and tears literally, with the horse happy to be alive, but the architect of the mission, fireman Shailesh Khakkhar, getting hospitalized for the rashes he got from being exposed to the toxic waste. “The horse must have been grazing around the river bank before it fell into the sludge and got stuck in the 8-foot deep mud and couldn’t come out on its own. It was a difficult operation for the personnel as the horse is heavy and in the process, the rescuer too may get stuck in the sludge. Khakkar, with the help of the tube used in water rescue operations, managed to slide towards the desperate animal and somehow tied it with a rope and pulled him out,” Mundhwa told TOI. Khakkhar, meanwhile, had to taken to the civil hospital from the rashes he acquired in his brave attempt, where he received treatment and is doing well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/firemen-override-perils-to-rescue-horse/articleshow/83616933.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Boxer from Lucknow hopes to pack a punch in Russia event||LUCKNOW: Digari Mahesh, 25, a young professional boxer from Lucknow, is set to take on Russian champion Tigran Ujlyan in the Winline Boxing Night International Championship to be held in Sochi, Russia on June 25. Son of a retired army man, Pushkar Singh, Digari is the first professional circuit boxer from Lucknow to participate in an international event. Currently, he is undergoing training at a special camp in Bangalore under his coach Mujtaba Kamal. “Like my father, I have a passion to make my country proud. I am a bit aggressive by nature so I decided to channelize my energy towards boxing. My journey began in 2009 when I started training at KD Singh Babu Stadium under Abhishek Kumar Dhanuk. I continued here till 2014 and then moved to professional boxing and went to Bangalore for training,” said Digari, a resident of Nilmatha. As boxing was his first love, his studies were affected. He did his early schooling from Kendriya Vidyalaya, Gomtinagar, but had to leave the school after failing twice in Class 9. Thereafter, he continued his studies as a private candidate. “Digari is a very strong contender. He holds second position in the ranking of Indian professional boxers in the light weight category. Keeping in view his energy and strength, we decided to send him to take on the Russian champion,” said Mujtaba Kamal, Digari’s coach at Grassroot Boxing Promotions & Management, Bangalore. “Tigran is the national champion of Russia. There will be only one match of eight rounds. Though my practice sessions got affected due to the coronavirus pandemic, my coach made special preparations for me. He has played a crucial role in my preparations. I hope that I emerge victorious and make my country proud,” Digari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/boxer-from-lucknow-hopes-to-pack-a-punch-in-russia-event/articleshow/83621260.cms||Fazal Khan
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Mohammed Azharuddin slams group of five, alleges all their acts illegal||HYDERABAD: A day after a group of five members of the Hyderabad Cricket Association's Apex council sent a showcause notice to Mohammed Azharuddin, the president hit back on Thursday saying that everything the group has been doing in the last few months is illegal. The group comprises vicepresident K John Manoj, secretary R Vijayanand, joint secretary Naresh Sharma, treasurer Surender Agarwal and councillor P Anuradha. In their notice giving him seven days to reply pending suspension, they had alleged among other things that Azhar’s role as a mentor of Northern Warriors — a T10 team in the Abu Dhabi League — was conflict of interest, and that he had informed of his retirement from the game only in 2019, which does not allow him to be the president if the cooling off period of five years is taken into consideration. “They have no right to give me showcause notice because I’m elected by the general body. The apex council has no right to suspend or ban anybody,” said an amused Azharuddin, when it was brought to his notice that TV channels have started showing that he's been removed as HCA president. To a pointed question as to who runs the association given that both camps claim they are right, Azharuddin said: “I am controlling the association. They are all tainted and are being inquired upon by the ombudsman. They should all resign on moral grounds because without the president they cannot do anything. They can’t hold meetings without my concurrence, not even if they are five and in majority. Even in majority you have to do the right thing.” Asked for his course of action, he said: “I’ve already written to the ombudsman, Justice Deepak Verma. They’ve already been served notices. It’s for the ombudsman to decide because I can’t throw anyone out.” The appointment of ombudsman has been contested by the group. While Azharuddin claims Justice Verma is the ombudsman, the group claims to have appointed Justice Nisar Ahmed Kakru at the AGM, which continued after Azharuddin closed the meeting and left the venue. The group also appointed Suneel Kante as the CEO without the president’s consent. Azharuddin attending the BCCI SGM — pipping N Shivlal Yadav, who was the group’s choice — seemed to have queered the pitch further. “If they don’t recognise Justice Verma as the ombudsman, it’s their problem. And what does it mean if the board allows me to attend SGM,” he questioned and added that BCCI is fully aware of what’s playing out in HCA. “When they appointed the CEO, the BCCI president messaged me asking if it was done with my concurrence. I’m the constitutional head, I have to inform the board,” he said, and added it is for the board to decide if they want to have a panel to run the association like they did in the case of Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association. Azhar also said that he’d never compromise with people who indulge in blackmailing tactics. “I won’t be cowed down by these people. It probably worked with others but not with me. I’m ready for elections also. I’ll fight it out. Things have to fall in place, if not now, it will never happen.” He also dismissed the charges levelled against him as frivolous. “If the T10 league is an issue, the board would’ve acted against me. And the very fact that I’m attending board meetings is indication that I’m not a player anymore,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/azhar-slams-group-of-five-alleges-all-their-acts-illegal/articleshow/83619239.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Tribals, mostly kids, in Utnoor hit by kidney disease, says NIMS||HYDERABAD: Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) nephrologists have discovered that kidney dysfunction has hit eight per cent of tribals, mostly children in the 6-10 agegroup, in Utnoor of Adilabad district. The biggest cause of renal dysfunction was chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown aetiology (cause). This was unlike general population. Diabetes was not found in many of them. NIMS study has thrown light on health profile of tribals in Utnoor. NIMS nephrologists Dr Gangadhar Taduri, Bukka Vijay Chander and others presented a paper ‘Prevalence of Renal Dysfunction in Primitive Tribal Groups in Utnoor of Telangana’ at ISN World Congress of Nephrology, and it was published in ‘Science Direct’. In their paper, the researchers said: “Renal dysfunction among tribals in Utnoor is 8%, with maximum prevalence among those of aged between 6 to 10. This is not high prevalence when compared to general population. Percentage is more in general population. CKD-U being the most common cause of renal dysfunction followed by hypertensive nephrosclerosis and sickle cell anaemia, with the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy being low.” The health screening was done for vulnerable tribal groups in the Utnoor Agency area. NIMS, head of department, Dr Gangadhar, said, “CKD is one of the growing causes of mortality. We have studied the prevalence of renal dysfunction in primitive tribal groups, residing in areas that come under ITDA Utnoor. It was to find out general health profile. The causes are different from general population. Usually, in general population, diabetes is the reason, but in tribals it was mostly non-diabetic. It could be due to water issue or abuse of painkillers.” “Even sickle cell anaemia was high. Some times sickle cell anaemia also causes kidney diseases,” he added. NIMS doctors had screened 14,041 tribals and of them 1,108 were found to have renal dysfunction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nims-tribals-mostly-kids-in-utnoor-hit-by-kidney-disease/articleshow/83619252.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh: New grass species found in Anantapur forest||HYDERABAD: A new grass species has been discovered in the Nigidi forest of Anantapur district. The grass species has been named after reputed botanist Dr PV Prasanna, scientist G, Botanical Survey of India (BSI). Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board research scientist Dr Kothareddy Prasad, who discovered the new species, said: “The new grass species belongs to the genus ‘Lophopogon’ and rice family. It is named as Lophopogon prasannae.” Dr Prasanna is a grass taxonomist and head of office, Deccan Regional Centre, BSI. Lophopogon — a genus of Indian plants in the grass family — is endemic to dry parts of India such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. It consists of two species only and the recently discovered species is the third species. While working on grass diversity at the Nigidi forest between 2017 and 2019, Dr Prasad noticed a unique grass population belonging to Lophopogon. “This population occurs in isolation from other two species of the genus. Efforts were made to identify the collected material and realised that it was an undescribed grass,” he said. He said Lophopogon prasannae is considered endemic to the Nigidi forest. Lophopogon prasannae has been assessed as ‘critically endangered’ based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s ‘red list’ criteria. Dr Prasad said four new species have also been discovered in the Nigidi forest recently. However, he expressed concern over disturbance caused to the forest. “The Nigidi forest is disturbed due to anthropogenic activities such as man-made forest fires, grazing and tourism. It needs effective conservation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-grass-species-discovered-in-anantapur-forest/articleshow/83619257.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Chandigarh||Punjab BSP unhappy over seat ‘quality’||JALANDHAR: Brewing discontentment in hushed tones within Bahujan Samaj Party over ‘quality’ of seats which the party has got in alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal is now getting audible publicly. BSP workers held a meeting, also attended by former BSP state president Rashpal Singh Raju, at Garhshankar on Thursday and they demanded that seat sharing should re-worked so that BSP gets the Garhshankar seat in its kitty. All those who attended the meeting supported the alliance but said that BSP did not get a fair deal in ‘quality’ of seats as some seats in Doaba region, where the party is quite strong, have not been given to them. After attending and addressing the meeting, Raju later told the media that all the workers present at the meeting supported the alliance and expressed their happiness but they were concerned as some good seats have not been given to the party. “In Doaba region, where we have strongest presence at Balachaur Nawanshahr, Banga, Phagwara, Phillaur, Adampur, Garhshankar, Chabbelwal and Sham Chaurasi. In all these assembly segments, we got over 20,000 to 30,000 votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “In Banga and Adamapur assembly segments, our candidates even got lead while in Phillaur assembly segment our party was second and got over 40,000 votes. If BSP contests all these seats, we can win for sure and ultimately we shall add to the strength of the alliance and SAD would also get that strength,” Raju elaborated. “Our workers today demanded that Garhshankar seat was won twice and even third time we lost with a very thin margin. We appeal to party supremeo Mayawati that seat sharing should be re-negotiated and Garhshankar should be given to BSP,” said Raju, who was state president during the 2019 elections but was later replaced by Jasbir Singh Garhi. He appeared to be taking a subtle dig at the Punjab BSP leadership stating that the alliance was decided by the party supremo but the specific seat allotment was worked out by the party in alliance with its partner. When asked, Garhi said that every decision about seat sharing was taken by the party high command and it was final. Notably, SAD has its MLAs at Banga, Adampur and Phillaur while Phagwara, Kartarpur and Nawanshahr have been given to BSP, party cadres are peeved that at least four more strong seats were not given to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bsp-cadres-unhappy-over-quality-of-seats-it-got-in-alliance-with-sad/articleshow/83619256.cms||IP Singh

---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Dairy farmers dump milk on road, seek better prices||NASHIK: Dairy farmers from across the state staged protests on Thursday by pouring milk on roads to protest ‘low’ procurement rates by cooperatives and private dairies. The stir was organised by Dudh Utpadak Shetkari Sangharsh Samiti (DUSSS) and All India Kisan Sabha. Chief of DUSSS, Ajit Navale, said that the stir was a success as large number of farmers from north Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Marathwada took part in it. “As a part of the protest, these anguished farmers spilled milk on the roads. The state government must intervene to ensure the dairy farmers get proper procurement rates,” said Navale. According to him, dairy farmers would get Rs 35/litre in the pre-Covid period from the cooperatives and dairies. “Once strict curbs were imposed during Covid, the farmers were paid just Rs 20/litre. This amount does even cover the production cost that the dairy farmers incur,” he said, adding that the state government must also tackle the issue of milk adulteration. A dairy farmer of Ahmednagar, Somnath Pawar, said they poured milk on road to draw the attention of the government about the desperate plight of the farmers on procurement rate issue. Last year too, dairy farmers had staged a protest seeking better procurement price for milk. Dairy business has taken a hit as their bulk consumers — sweet manufacturers, ice cream makers and hotels have reduced demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dairy-farmers-dump-milk-on-road-seek-better-prices/articleshow/83612278.cms||---

An official source said the water level in the Pillur reservoir had touched 97ft against its full capacity of 100ft on the day following continuous rainfall in the catchment areas. On Wednesday night, 106mm rainfall was recorded in the upper Bhavani region. “As the inflow to the reservoir has increased anywhere between 10,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs) and 12,000cusecs, public works department officials have released about 10,000cusecs water from the reservoir on Thursday noon. While 6,000cusecs of water is released through the two hydropower projects that generates about 50 megawatts power per hour, another 4,000cusecs water is released through four sluice gates of the reservoir,” the source said.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: 100 days of Tirath govt marked by controversial statements and rollbacks||DEHRADUN: Tirath Singh Rawat completed 100 days as chief minister of Uttarakhand on Thursday with his tenure being marked by controversial statements, rollback of his predecessor ‘s decisions as well as a few initiatives taken during the Covid pandemic. Rawat’s tenure kicked off with remarks on women wearing ripped jeans, declaration that no RT-PCR was required for Kumbh, equating PM Narendra Modi with god and declaring that US, not Britain ruled India for 200 years. He also made statements regarding his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat's key decisions such as making Gairsain a commissionerate and also assured priests that the Devasthanam Board would be reviewed. Further, over 80 minister-level rank holders in the state who were appointed during Trivendra’s tenure were shown the door by Tirath. The 100 days saw some positives too -- the state was successful in setting up oxygen plants in all 13 districts during the massive Covid wave. The Vatsalya Yojna to provide assistance to children who have lost their parents has also been cited by the Tirath government as a major initiative. Speaking at an event on Thursday where a booklet was released to mark 100 days of his government , the CM said, “It was a tough time when I took charge. Soon after, I, too, was tested Covid positive. However, I ensured that the meetings with officials were held on time and projects implemented on the ground. Now, we are ready to face the third wave.” Meanwhile, opposition Congress called Tirath’s tenure a “disaster”. Suryakant Dhasmana, the party's state vice-president, told TOI, “The BJP has admitted its mistake by replacing Trivendra with Tirath in the election year. The Kumbh Mela has proved a disaster. Now, it is in the public domain that there were gross anomalies in conducting tests.” Commenting on the CM’s performance, political analyst Jay Singh Rawat said, “A period of 100 days is too short a time to judge a CM’s work. Tirath has less than a year to swing things in BJP's favour. Trivendra’s removal did not send a positive message among the people. So, it is important that Tirath acts fast.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/100-days-of-tirath-govt-marked-by-controversial-statements-and-rollbacks/articleshow/83614712.cms||Kautilya Singh

The third accused in the case is still at large.Police identified the accused as K Sameer, 25 and M Shihabuddin, 27, both natives of Palakkad district. “The two, along with the third accused M Moideen Kutty, 40, also from Palakkad district, were running a bakery in a village near Annur.”An investigation officer said the woman, along with her husband, had come down to the district from Trichy on May 15 to work in the bakery. “The three allowed them to stay in their rental house.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: For seniors, an arduous wait for vaccines||COIMBATORE: Around 6am on Thursday, S Jayanthi, 63, a resident of Vellakinar, along with her 68-year-old husband rushed to the city corporation’s elementary school in their locality to get inoculated. By then, people were found waiting in two long queues. While waiting for some time patiently, one of the staff members informed them to visit on Friday as there was no stock of vaccines. For the second time in the last two days, the couple returned without taking the jab. Now, they have decided to visit the school on Friday a little early as they are due for their second dose. “We took our first dose of Covishield in March at a private hospital. When we were due for our second dose in May, we had visited multiple primary health centres and waited for several hours. Around the same time, the government has increased the gap duration between two doses of Covishield to 12 to 16 weeks. Now we are due again,” Jayanthi said. “Since my daughter is on Twitter, she informs me about vaccine camps. After she alerted me, my husband and I visited the school around 7.30am on Tuesday. By then, they had placed a board saying that token distribution was over. So, we visited a school at Thudiyalur, but we returned after seeing a long queue. Again, we visited the school around 6am on Wednesday. But all went in vain,” she said. This is not a lone case in the district. For many people, getting vaccinated is not an easy task and they had to visit multiple centres and wait for hours before taking one. If only the vaccination drive is streamlined, and a systematic approach is followed, a lot of discomforts could be avoided. People requested officials to follow uniform timings in all the centres. A resident of Vadamadurai M Madhankumar said, “Most of the time, we receive no updates and whenever we check the CoWin website, it says no available booking slot. We also don’t know whom to contact for information,” he added. His father took the jab on his third visit to Thudiyalur school on Monday. He visited the centre around 5am, waited till 8am to receive a token and then took the shot around 10am. Now, Madhankumar is in the process of visiting multiple centres to take a jab. Jayanthi said that she does not have any social media accounts and there are several people like her. “If the vaccination details are uploaded only on government Twitter pages, how will people like me access the information?” she asked. “The government should take efforts and publicize the location and timings of the camps in advance. So, we will not have to visit vaccination centres multiple times,” she added. When contacted, a corporation official said that they have directed all the centres to distribute tokens in prior to avoid crowding at the centres. He said that steps would be taken to adopt uniform timings in all the centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/for-seniors-an-arduous-wait-for-vax/articleshow/83617023.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The value had skyrocketed to 232 parts per billion (ppb), the highest across the country. GIFT city authorities had contacted the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune, which maintains the SAFAR system to know the reasons. In a press release, GIFT city has claimed that IITM, Pune, has claimed that there was a breakdown in the ozone monitoring sensor of the SAFAR air quality monitoring system on June 13 and as a result it was displaying “irregular information.” On June 15, TOI had published a report ‘Gift city had most polluted air in India on Monday. GIFT authorities have further claimed, “Air quality of an area is judged on annual arithmetic mean of minimum 104 measurements in a year at a particular site, taken twice a week, 24 hourly, at uniform intervals ; as per regulatory guidelines. In this process, such break down incident is not accounted.” It further clarifies that, “…as all instruments have limited operation and at times eruption results take place due to influence of external factors.” The authorities clarified that as the SAFAR program is monitored remotely by using IOT based techniques, any breakdown in the system takes time to be reinstated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-ozone-level-was-gift-of-faulty-sensor/articleshow/83617037.cms||---

If chief minister Amarinder Singh’s hoardings had recently come up at strategic locations across Punjab recently, now there is show of support for cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu and Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa. The banners of all three factions have been put up close to each other at an intersection at Faridkot. While hoardings backing the Amritsar East MLA, claiming ‘Sara Punjab Sidhu Naal 2022’ (whole Punjab is with Sidhu), have surfaced in Amritsar, those of Bajwa have been put up in Faridkot district’s Jaito and Kotkapura towns. Sidhu’s hoardings/banners have pictures of Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and his wife Navjot Kaur but not of Capt Amarinder and PPCC president Sunil Jakhar. Jaito and Kotkapura in poster“The posters could not have been installed without the consent of Sidhu, even though he may have been quiet on Twitter for the past 17 days or so,” said a senior Congress functionary. Sidhu had last posted a tweet on June 1. Sources also pointed out that no matter what one may say about this — a public outcry, Twitter war or poster war — the brunt would eventually be borne by the Congress party in this “tussle of power” between Amarinder and Sidhu. Sonia had invited Amarinder for discussions on June 20 and some decision would be taken, added sources. “But it is very difficult to maintain a balance between the two leaders or make two parallel power centres in Punjab polity. In any case, the ball is in the court of Sonia Gandhi, who will call the shots,” they said. Commenting on the emerging scenario, senior Congress leader Raman Bakshi said, “Kuch leaders apania wafadaria dikha rahay nay.

The online classes are meant to engage students and support them until the schools reopen, the circular read. “On the commencement of regular classes, the teachers will cover up the entire syllabus for the academic year 2021-22 so that no student is left out.” “Till such time the schools reopen, the teachers should prepare worksheets and lectures and reach out to students not connected via online means, in addition to carrying out the online teaching,” the directorate stated, adding that this shall not apply to schools in containment zone, teachers residing in containment zone and schools taken over by the Disaster Management Authority.

---||Dehradun||Modernisation of tribals tricky debate, but can’t use that to deny them rights: Uttarakhand high court||NAINITAL: “Modernisation” of indigenous communities is a tricky subject, but the debate can’t be a reason to deprive them of human rights, the Uttarakhand high court observed on Wednesday while staying the eviction of a group of nomadic Van Gujjars from a forest in Tehri. The state has been asked to “take the issue seriously” and prepare a report on where the state’s tribal communities live, their lifestyle and their customs. The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma was hearing a bunch of petitions on the problems faced by the Van Gujjars, who form a nomadic pastoralist community which spends autumn in the lower reaches and migrates uphill in the summer and rainy seasons. In March, the high court had widened the scope of the petitions and tagged it with others dealing with tribal issues in the state. When the subject of the living conditions of the Van Gujjars came up on Wednesday, state advocate general SN Babulkar said, “There are several tribal groups who want to continue with their way of life. Many of them do not even want to live in a permanent house.” The court, in response, said the state’s tribal population also has the right to education, roads, clean environment, health and electricity. “These are human rights issues,” the court said, and a “balance needs to be struck” between preserving tribals in their natural state and providing them with modern infrastructure. “Modernisation of tribal population is a very ticklish issue for the simple reason that sociologists and anthropologists tell us if you modernize them you will lose the tribal way of life. The other side of the coin is the constitutional rights and fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution,” the chief justice said, adding that the government needs to deal with these issues very seriously. In April, the court had been informed by Arjun Kasana, a human rights activist, that 40 Van Gujjar families in the Narendra Nagar forest division had been asked to vacate the forest land by a ranger from Shivpuri forest range. “Respondents are directed not to evict the members of the Van Gujjar community from the land in question during the pendency of this petition. The Registry is directed to list this case along with other PILs dealing with the issue of tribal population staying within the State,” the bench said on Wednesday. The next hearing is on July 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/modernisation-of-tribals-tricky-debate-but-cant-use-that-to-deny-them-rights-ukhand-hc/articleshow/83614778.cms||Prashant Jha

The buddies, who picked the hockey stick in their teens to earn a pair of shoes and new clothes, are now set to fly to Tokyo as part of Indian women Olympics hockey squad. They are among 13 players from Indian Railways, who are part of the 16-member squad. While Neha is posted in Northern Railways division, Delhi, Nisha is a senior clerk in Prayagraj division of North Central Railways along with her colleague, Gurjit Kaur, 25, who hails from a farmer’s family in Amritsar. “We come from very humble backgrounds, but had a passion for sport. We began playing under the guidance of former Indian captain and Arjuna award recipient Pritam Rani Siwach, who gave us a pair of shoes and clothes for free. It was an incentive that lit the fire to perform. Siwach saw potential in us and trained us hard,” said Neha, youngest of three siblings in her family. “My alcoholic father rarely extended any help and he died four years back. It was my mother, Savita Devi, who backed me in my endeavour. She would work at a metal wire binding factory and earn Rs 1,500 to fund my studies. She would insist on a good diet so that I could play the game well,” said the mid-fielder, who has been part of Asian Games, World Cup, Commonwealth and other tournaments. Alumni of Tikaram School, Sonipat, Neha and Nisha are currently mid-fielders in the Indian squad. “Since childhood, we were always in sync. On the field, we don’t even share a glance while placing the ball to dribble past our opponents. Our biggest strength is our bond of sisterhood,” said Neha, who is currently in Bengaluru preparing for Olympics. Speaking to TOI, Nisha said, “I followed Neha and took up hockey. We are like one big family. Even though I hail from a conservative Muslim family, my father, Sohrab, always backed my passion for the game. I’m thankful to our coach Pritam Rani Siwach, who saw our talent and trained us. Even the Railways supported us to reach here.” Nisha is second youngest among four siblings. Her colleague, Gurjit Kaur, a defender in the Indian squad said, “Nisha is an excellent mid-fielder. One can gauge her talent from the fact she hasn’t played a major tournament, but is part of the Olympics team.” Gurjit’s elder sister Pardeep Kaur too is hockey player, but only Gurjit could make into the Indian team for Olympics. Gurjit is known for scoring in Asian Games, Common wealth and World cup tournaments. Her goals took Indian teams to finals in Asian Games held at Jakarta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/childhood-buddies-catapult-to-fame-now-part-of-women-hockey-squad-for-tokyo-oly/articleshow/83621344.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Students unable to get visa slots are applying under other categories. Candidates have been in a rush to get visa appointments for processing visas and they need to take into account time to quarantine themselves abroad before they can enter campus. For candidates who need to start college in Fall, most are trying to reach US by early August. With the rush to get a visa slot, students are applying under “emergency” services. The consulate requested students to not do so. “Need an earlier student visa appointment? Do not despair. We will add additional July appointments soon. Please do not submit an emergency appointment request. We cannot accommodate the volume of requests,” it said. Students continued to request the consulate to unfreeze their accounts. “Students who have early and mid-August start dates are seeing slots in late July/August. Please consider, most of us have to quarantine for seven days on arrival in US and also be able to book flights on time,” said a candidate who sought additional slots for June too. A frustrated candidate tweeted: “Pls book appointments for us by yourself. It's damn difficult, like launching a rocket!” US visa appointment slots opened on Monday and thousands had a tough time to book visa appointments. Most candidates tried for hours in the hope to book a slot, but the website crashed and students who kept refreshing were locked out for “suspicious activity” for 72 hours, raising anxiety levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-extra-july-slots-for-us-student-visas/articleshow/83612487.cms||Hemali Chhapia

With a roll call of nearly 1 lakh before they submit the report to the state government, the district officials have their task cut out. “The team is making up to 400 calls every day. We also plan to visit some of the mentioned addresses. We believe that the investigation will be completed in time,” Haridwar DM C Ravishankar told TOI on Thursday.  Earlier this week, TOI had reported that a 1,600-page investigation by the state health department had found that nearly a lakh Covid test reports issued during the mela period in April had forged phone numbers and addresses. Students and residents of Rajasthan had been shown as sample collectors.  Commenting on the need for another investigation, the Haridwar DM said, “Ours is a separate inquiry from what has already been conducted by the health department. We will be revisiting everything from a fresh perspective.”  A district official who is part of the investigation told TOI that involvement of state government officials and Kumbh Mela administration in the scam is also being probed. The Kumbh Mela administration is a separate entity created during the festival to take decisions pertaining to the mela area.  “A scam of this scale is not possible without the involvement and knowledge of certain people. There is a standard operating procedure for empanelment of labs. They have to be accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) and must have approval from the Indian Council of Medical research (ICMR),” the official said. The official added, “Also, what was the need to hire a third party — in this case, the private agency — when labs could have been directly roped in to carry out testing.”  TOI had reported that the district administration had rejected the private agency’s proposal of interest but it inked a contract with the mela administration later. According to mela officer Deepak Rawat, “An FIR has already been filed in the matter and those responsible will be punished.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-officials-to-call-up-1l-people-named-in-fake-tests/articleshow/83614852.cms||Prashant Jha

The map will help the DDA envisage their 2041 master plan for the national capital. According to an MoU inked between IIT-R and DDA, the institute's civil engineering professor Kamal Jain will be the ‘master consultant’ in developing the GIS mapping. The DDA has sanctioned a budget of Rs 7.5 crore for IIT-R to complete the project. Talking to TOI, Jain said, “Under this project, a GIS portal will be developed that will show a map of 1,500 square kilometres of Delhi. The map will show a 3-D image of every structure, land, road, drainage, river or other water channel and public encroachments in Delhi. High-resolution drone cameras will be used for this purpose. Through the portal, the residents will also be able to check the status of their property and other relevant taxes.” According to the DDA website, the master plan will be carried out in seven phases. Earlier this month, the DDA gave its preliminary approval to the master plan draft for Delhi in 2041. The draft was made available on the DDA’s website and objections and suggestions were invited from the public. “We have been doing field and aerial survey work in Delhi for the last six months,” added Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/iit-r-scientists-to-develop-gis-based-portal-to-facilitate-ddas-2041-master-plan/articleshow/83614901.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police said the accident occurred on state highway-86 between Saraiyya and Jaitpur. Two other occupants of the car somehow swam to safety. According to police, the five were returning home from Mungauli village in Saraiyya where they had gone to attend a marriage function.

SHO of Saraiyya police station Ram Binod Yadav said the victims were identified as Pritam Kumar (22), Niki Kumar Sharma (20) and Rajan Kumar (21), all residents of Madhopur Buzurg village under the Deoria police station area in Muzaffarpur. “The three remained trapped in the car. The police reached the spot within minutes. However, by the time the police personnel pulled them out of the car with the help of villagers, they were dead. The two youths who swam to safety were identified as Siyaram Kumar Sharma (22) and Raman Kumar (21), residents of Dharphari village under Deoria police station,” the SHO added. “Pritam, who was driving the car, probably lost control over the vehicle while negotiating a sharp turn while approaching the bridge. The car, according to preliminary investigations, was being driven at a high speed,” the SHO said. He, however, added Pritam’s father Ravindra Sah has lodged a complaint with Saraiyya police station, alleging that another vehicle had dashed the car driven by his son. “We have begun an inquiry into the accident.

The DGP said, an elaborate SOP and sufficient riot gear have been provided to districts to deal with law and order situations, but the Unnao police force was ill-equipped. Four policemen: SHO Sadar Kotwali Dinesh Mishra, police outpost in charge Akhilesh Kumar and constables Ramasrey Yadav and Vijay Yadav have been suspended. Kulkarni told TOI that on Tuesday, two men on a bike — Rajesh and Vipin —died in a road accident and the next day, families told police they would cremate the bodies. “However, some members of Bhim Army incited the families and they placed the bodies on the Rae Bareli-Unnao highway, blocking the arterial stretch to the city. They also demanded Rs 20 lakh as compensation. When police reached the spot to pacify them, members of Bhim Army started pelting stones at police. In the ensuing attack, a few cops sustained injuries. The situation was brought under control when senior police officers reached the spot,” said Kulkarni. He added, 43 people had been arrested and on basis of photographs and CCTV footage and police were tracking down Bhim Army members to book them under stringent IPC sections.

Kahar filed an application in the court requesting it to direct the police to conduct investigations against seven others. “After the alleged rape, Dishant and Nazeem Mirza left the girl’s house. Late the girl was in contact with her friends and colleagues. She committed suicide two days after her alleged rape. Why is the police not probing the reason behind her suicide?” questioned Dishant’s advocate, Sohail Godia. “The police aren’t questioning the girl’s friends and colleagues and their role before she ended her life,” Godia said, adding court on Thursday rejected further remand of the accused duo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/accused-seeks-probe-on-girls-colleagues-pals/articleshow/83611883.cms||---

The court made the observation while granting anticipatory bail to a man named P G Sam Infant Jones who was booked for downloading and transmitting child pornographic material through his email and Facebook account using his phone.Justice G R Swaminathan observed that viewing pornography privately would not constitute an offence. Some even say it falls within one's right to free expression and privacy. But child pornography falls outside this circle of freedom. The judge said Section 67-B of the IT Act penalises every kind of act pertaining to child pornography. Section 43 of the Pocso Act mandates the Centre and state government to take measures to spread public awareness about the provisions of the statute. But this alone may not be sufficient.“The system also may not be able to prosecute every offender. Therefore, it is only through moral education that there can be a way out. It is only the Bharatiya culture that can act as a bulwark. The menace of child pornography can be tackled only if all of us inculcate the right values,” observed the judge.The judge said that well-known writer Nanjil Naadan while referring to a Thirukkural had stated in an article that the expression ‘children’ need not be confined to one’s own but should encompass all children and that we should ensure that no child is sexually exploited. “I only wish the petitioner, who ironically has been named as ‘Infant’, reads the above essay and imbibes the sentiments expressed therein,” observed the judge.The judge further observed that unless necessary, arrest should be avoided in pandemic times. “Of course, child pornography is a very serious issue warranting a firm approach. But I would make a distinction between a one-time consumer and those who transmit or propagate or display or distribute in the digital domain,” observed the judge. Taking into consideration the fact that the petitioner, who completed ME degree and is currently pursuing PhD, had handed over his mobile phone, sim card and was cooperating with the investigation, the judge said that custodial interrogation was not warranted in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-moots-moral-education-to-tackle-child-pornography/articleshow/83619417.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The plan delineates functions of various departments and agencies for the operational responsibility for marine incidents which could result due to spillage of oil in sea water.As per the plan, all the state governments with coastal areas should constitute a state-level oil spill crisis management groups. The plan also mandates to constitute district-level and local groups.He stated that even after the Ennore oil spill incident in 2017 and the recent oil spill incident at Thiruvanathapuram in Kerala which is close to the coastal area of Kanyakumari district, no steps were taken by the government to constitute such groups in Tamil Nadu.Thirumurugan stated that oil spill incidents would have a deadly effect on the marine species and would also affect the livelihood of the fishermen.

We did goondagiri for the Marathi pride. Mumbai is a part of Maharashtra only because we did goonadagiri against the Centre in the days of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement,” he said. Raut warned the BJP Yuva Morcha that Shiv Sena would react exactly as it did on Wednesday outside the Shiv Sena Bhavan even if it were not in power. He said that no one should protest near the Shiv Sena Bhavan. “Whoever came to attack the Sena Bhavan, Shivsainiks have given them ‘prasad’ in this way and should not force us to serve ‘Shiv Bhojan Thali’,” he said. The BJP youth wing had been protesting at the Shiv Sena headquarters in Dadar (west) against Raut’s comment that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should give an explanation following allegations of a scam in the Ayodhya land deal. Speaking to the media on Thursday, Raut said the Shiv Sena Bhavan was not only the party office but the pride of Maharashtra and Marathi. “Will Shivsainiks sit quietly if someone comes to attack the Sena Bhavan? They should understand that the Shiv Sena has written in Saamna and said that an investigation is required following the allegations about the Ram Mandir land purchase deal, as it is a matter of faith ... and if someone tries to defame the Ram Mandir Trust through allegations, then action should be taken against them. What’s wrong in this?” he said. CM Uddhav Thackeray reportedly said to a delegation of Shiv Sena MLA Sada Sarvankar, former mayor Shraddha Jadhav and some party members from Dadar, who had gone to give a cheque of Rs 1 lakh to the CM Relief Fund, that no one should behave in a way that disturbs law and order. On polls, Raut said miracles could happen if the Shiv Sena and NCP contested the next assembly election together as the BJP and the Congress had both declared their intention of going solo. An editorial in the Shiv Sena organ Saamna even raised the question: “Are there mid-term poll plans in the state?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sainiks-certified-goondas-says-raut-after-clash/articleshow/83621435.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Lucknow||AFT grants ‘war injury pension’ to WWII jawan who died 6 months ago||LUCKNOW: The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) here has ordered the defence ministry and the Indian Army to grant ‘war injury pension’ to a World War II jawan, who passed away six months ago. The court apparently had not been informed about his demise. Now, the lawyer of the deceased jawan is now moving court to recall the order. Rifleman (retired) Govind Singh Rawat of Third Royal Garhwal Battalion of British Army was less than 20, when he was sent to Italy to fight in World War II for Allied forces. He suffered a splinter wound in a grenade attack in his right knee on September 6, 1941. In 1947, he was invalided out from the service due to his injury, just five months before the Independence of India. After retirement, his disability pension helped him take care of his family and himself. Till last year, he was getting around Rs 6,700 per month. However, according to his nephew, Captain (retired) GS Rawat, the family approached the regional Lucknow bench of AFT last year in March for ‘war injury pension’. The court ordered in his favour on June 4. However, Govind passed away in December 2020 at 99. Information about his demise was not brought before the court. His lawyer Virat Anand Singh is now going to move court to recall the order. Speaking to TOI, Govind’s nephew Captain Rawat said, ``We had moved AFT for war injury pension in March 2020, as we were informed that war injury pension is more than double the amount (Rs 17,000) of disability pension.” According to the AFT order, “Govind, the infantry soldier was discharged from the British army service on April 6, 1947 as he was medically unfit (category E) for the service as per medical records...further the ministry of defence argued that Govind was not entitled to war injury pension, as the policy is not applicable to jawan injured in pre-independence time that is World War II. The policy (dated February 1972) only allows pension to disabled veterans wounded during wars and operations of 1971, 1965 and 1947-48.” "From the medical opinion and material available on record, it appears that the disability suffered by Govind during World War-II is war injury, therefore he is entitled to receive war injury pension as it has been assessed that his disability was attributable to military service in field area," the AFT said. It also cited the case of CB Khanduri vs Union of India & Others. In this case the applicant was in receipt of disability pension and had pleaded for war injury pension which on adjudication was granted along with arrears. “With the help of the regimental center of Garhwal rifle in Lansdowne, the family managed to get all service and medical records of Govind from Allahabad-based Principal controller of defence account. Later, we moved to AFT for a rightful war injury pension for Govind and we won, but unfortunately he was not alive to see this victory,” said petitioner counsel Virat Anand Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aft-grants-war-injury-pension-to-wwii-jawan/articleshow/83621444.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The elderly man also alleged that his son is the reason behind the sudden demise of his wife as he often used to beat her. He has also shared a video in which the son could purportedly be seen thrashing his mother. Police have slapped section 307 (attempt to murder) along with 457 (house trespass for committing a punishable offence), 380 (robbery), 447 (criminal trespass), 427 (committing mischief), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult) in this case and the accused were summoned by police for questioning. Mohan Singh Dayal works at AIR Rampur. In the video, he alleged that his wife died on April 30 due to continuous harassment and ill-treatment by his son. Dayal also shared two videos which purportedly show his son and daughter-in-law thrashing his wife. Dayal claimed that despite his complaint having been lodged at Premnagar police station earlier this month, police didn’t take any action against the accused. Dayal also shared a note allegedly left by his wife that her son, his wife and relatives would be responsible for her death as they had attempted to kill her multiple times. After the video was widely shared on social media, police called Dayal and assured him of necessary action. Superintendent of police (city) Ravindra Kumar told TOI, “The complainant’s daughter-in-law had registered a dowry complaint against him but she had not named her husband in the complaint. We are investigating this case and trying to ensure that this is not a case to counter the previous complaint.

These youngsters, dubbed‘Team Sai Covid Suraksha Kavach’, had roped in Dubbak BJP MLA Raghunandan Rao to flag off their drive to distribute 8,000 kits at a programme held last week in Malkajgiri. The team, over the next few days, would distribute 8,000 Suraksha Covid Kavach kits in the Malkajgiri and Secunderabad Cantonment assembly constituencies free of cost under ‘Seva Hi Sanghattan’ programme, social worker and team leader P M Sai Prasad told TOI. “We did seek any donations, but have spent Rs 9 lakh of our own money for the materials, including tablets, face masks, sanitisers and vaporisers and prepared Kavach kits. In fact, we have noticed that many families, mainly those below the poverty line, found it difficult to buy medicines during the pandemic. Our team has decided to help such people,” Sai Prasad explained. Apart from this initiative, the team had also sanitised 63 law and order and 26 traffic police stations all over the city. The team, which consists of 100 youngsters, carried out the sanitisation programme as per the schedule fixed by respective police stations. “We have also taken up sanitisation of police vehicles, including patrolling,” Sai Prasad added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/youth-provide-poor-suraksha-kavach/articleshow/83617162.cms||Sunil Mungara

Although officials promised that the expansion work would be completed in a week or two, it has been dragging on even after a month of starting work. The civic body is spending Rs 90 lakh to increase the capacity of both the crematoriums which have two gasifiers each.Put together, they handle up to 100 bodies a day if operated round the clock. The civic body decided to increase the capacity by introducing two more gasifiers at Thathaneri and one more at Moolakarai as the number of bodies handled rose up to 90 a day at the peak of the second wave. The civic body had also ordered operation of the crematoriums round the clock so that relatives don’t have to wait the whole night for cremation in case a patient dies in the night.Officials inspected the work on May 13 and assured that it would be over in a week, but the work soon lost steam. Officials now say that it will take at least one more week to near completion. Madurai Corporation officials say that the extended lockdown has slowed down the work as they faced issues in procuring and transporting the required materials. Moreover, urgency has also come down since the number of deaths has also dipped. Both the crematoriums receive less than half the number of bodies compared to that at the height of the second wave.“Any work of Madurai corporation involves floating of tender and choosing the appropriate firm to ensure fair selection process. That itself is a time-consuming process. Work is progressing well and it is being monitored periodically,” said an official from the engineering wing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/as-cases-fall-capacity-augmentation-work-of-crematoriums-slows-down/articleshow/83619456.cms||V Devanathan

Job crisis in the private sector due to the pandemic had turned more people towards government jobs. Most of the aspirants would target ground 4 exams, which is a relatively easier test to crack given the sheer number of recruitments. Exams have not been conducted ever since the pandemic broke out last year. G Mailainathan, an aspirant from Madurai city, said that there is confusion among aspirants on the syllabus to be followed for the group 4 exams. If the government cleared the air at the earliest, it would help them to confidently prepare for the exams.

It promised to hand over online learner’s licence after “clearing” the test for candidates. Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said he got a FIR registered against the firm on Thursday. The transport department has brought out a circular warning RTO agents, cyber cafes, e Seva Kendras, driving schools and other entities “helping” candidates give online learner’s test, and said FIRs will be registered against offenders. It will also issue show cause notice to licence applicants and conduct inquiry with threat of permanent cancellation of licence. “Nobody can give tests on behalf of candidates. This is illegal. An FIR has been filed against this agency and we will check if there are similar operators/agents in the state,” he said. The incident has however exposed the ‘loophole’ in online learners licence system launched by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday. So far, 16,920 applicants have gone online and got the learners licence in Maharashtra, sources said. The ‘loophole’ has also highlighted the need to improve software security and in-built checks to make it foolproof. “We will come out with some technology solution to avoid this. We are in talks to upgrade the software and ensure such incidents don’t recur,” Dhakne said. Another official said there is urgent need to tighten software security to keep tabs on the person giving the test — like use of cameras (photo clicking of applicant before test), OTP message on phone and IP address check of applicant sitting for the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fir-filed-as-dummies-offer-to-clear-online-driving-test/articleshow/83621480.cms||Somit Sen

---||Kolhapur||OBC community agitates for political reservation||NASHIK: Hundreds of activists from Other Backward Class (OBC) communities staged a rasta roko agitation at Dwarka on Thursday afternoon, demanding political reservation. The agitation was led by the Akhil Bhartiya Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad along with members from other OBC organisations. “The Supreme Court rejected the review petition by the state government meant for political reservation for the OBC community in the local self-governing bodies. The SC rejected the petition because the central government did not give the empirical data to the apex court,” Dileep Khaire, district unit president of Samata Parishad, said. Addressing the community members, he said the central government should care for the people who were fighting for their just demands and appealed to the elected representatives to join the movement in the interest of the citizens. Khaire expressed fear that if the community members did not raise their voice against this injustice at this time, it could lead to the community losing the reservations in job and education as well. “Many members of the community neither have land nor business. Hence, education is the only mean that was helping the community members to prosper. As far as the political reservation is concerned it is important to ensure the representatives of the community are able to represent it in the respective local self governing bodies — especially from the areas where the community has a larger presence,” Khaire said. Meanwhile, district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the state would request the Supreme Court to order the central government to provide the empirical data required to establish reservation for the OBC community across the country. Speaking to the media about the agitation, Bhujbal said, “The central government had collected the data during the 2011 census. Due to the pandemic it is impossible for state or central government to collect such data. The only option now with the government is that we will request the SC to order the central government to submit the data.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/obc-community-agitates-for-political-reservation/articleshow/83612496.cms||---

The accident on May 6 had left one Bahrain coast guard policeman dead and two others injured.The four were engaged in illegal fishing on Bahrain waters ignoring a ban when their boat was chased by a coast guard speed boat resulting in a collision between the two. The fishermen — boat captain R Rajesh from Pudukottai, K Kannathasan of Thanjavur, G Bakiyaraj and S Navanesh from Ramanathapuram — fled but were detained by enforcement agencies along with their Bahraini employer on May 7. Rajesh called his wife Tamilselvi a few times and asked her not to worry and that he will be back soon. Bakiyaraj’s wife Ilangaidevi, a mother of three two girls and a boy, is worried about her husband as punishments in the Gulf are harsh. The women have urged the state government to prevail on the central government and Indian Embassy in Bahrain to ensure speedy release of the men and their safe return.“They were produced before the court which directed them to be produced again on June 23,” V Kalidas, organiser of Meenavam Kapom Makkal Iyakkam who is coordinating efforts for their release, told TOI. On Wednesday, representatives of the movement petitioned fisheries minister Anitha R Radhakrishnan and Tuticorin MP K Kanimozhi seeking their intervention in the matter.

---||Delhi||Delhi high court gives us a lot of hope, says student activist Natasha Narwal||NEW DELHI: Student activists Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal were released from Tihar Jail on bail around 7.15pm on Thursday. Kalita, wearing a traditional Assamese skirt, emerged from Gate No 3, with Narwal in a blue kurta following behind. Both smiled brightly when met outside the prison by a crowd that heartily raised slogans like ‘Saare pinjron ko todenge, itihaas ki dhaara modenge’. TimesViewThe Delhi Police’s plea that it needed time to verify the addresses of the jailed student activists stretched credulity considering that they have been in jail for over a year. What kind of investigation was being conducted if even the addresses of the accused have not been checked out for such a long time? It is good that the court saw through what smacks of a ruse to keep the students incarcerated for a few more days, but unfortunate that it took close to 36 hours after the High Court granted bail for them to be released.Ten minutes later, the third student held in the northeast Delhi riots case, Asif Iqbal Tanha, was also released from Tihar Jail. Kalita and Narwal were lodged together in women’s jail No 6. “We survived one year in jail because of the support we received from so many people,” said Pinjra Tod activist Kalita to the media. “Maybe the women who came out on the streets during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act prayed for us and that is why we are out of jail today.” Kalita claimed not to have read the bail order “but our family and friends have said it is a fantastic order and we would like to thank Delhi High Court”. She went on, “It is really important for courts to come out with such orders because people like us and many others are languishing in jail only for protesting against this government, which is the very basis of democracy.” Addressing the media, Narwal said she realised their release had been challenged in the Supreme Court, but “the kind of order that came from Delhi High Court really gives us a lot of hope and strength and restores our faith in the Indian judiciary”. She said, “We now know the judiciary will stand up for the rights of the people and uphold democratic dissent.” She also spoke of her father, Mahavir Narwal, and how he succumbed to Covid-19 while she was in jail. “My heart goes out to everyone else who has lost dear ones to the coronavirus,” she said. Pinjra Tod welcomed Kalita and Narwal “with great love, joy, solidarity and tears” and “with tight hugs and tears of happiness”. A statement released by the students’ collective said, “It has been over a year of their wrongful incarceration under the extraordinary Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and their release tonight is a day of tremendous strength and support.” Pinjra Tod noted that the activists’ release came two days after they were granted bail by Delhi High Court and only upon the issuing of the release warrant by the Karkardooma district court at 11am on Thursday. “Even as we welcome their bail order and see them walk out free today, we remind ourselves that the struggle is far from over. We remember the countless others who continue to be incarcerated and reiterate our demand for the release of all political prisoners,” the statement said, adding that Pinjra Tod was hopeful of the Supreme Court upholding the Delhi High Court bail order when hearing the special leave petition filed by Delhi Police. The third student released, Tanha, in a media statement, said, “I am grateful to almighty Allah and thank all supporters, my lawyers and all people fighting for the freedom of others. I hope that all political prisoners, everyone who is imprisoned due to their ideology or identity, are released soon.” Tanha’s statement said, “Our fight is against the discriminatory Citizenship (Amendment) Act and not against people of any faith. I am glad that the honourable high court has asserted that our peaceful and democratic protests had nothing to do with the riots. I hope that this judgment serves as an important precedent. We have full faith in the fairness of the judiciary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-high-court-gives-us-a-lot-of-hope-says-natasha-narwal/articleshow/83617226.cms||---

During the awareness session at Vavurla, the commission found that only one person, a balwadi worker among the 35-odd households, was vaccinated. A team from the commission, two doctors and a panch member trekked through the hilly terrain to interact with the villagers and educated them about the severity of Covid during the second wave and a possible third wave and how this can affect children too. They told the villagers both senior citizens and youth who were present that the vaccine can save lives especially those of the younger generation. Chairperson of the commission Vidhya Gaude said the primary reason the population there was not vaccinated was due to lack of access to the vaccination centres. “They told us they were ready to get vaccinated but they didn’t have easy access to the vaccination centre and had to travel a very long distance to take their jab. After we found this out, the local MLA and deputy chief minister arranged a session for accessible to them,” she said. “We are now identifying other remote areas where people haven’t been inoculated in Canacona and Sanguem. We have also asked sarpanchs to keep informed of areas where awareness sessions are needed,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/we-will-educate-more-people-from-remote-areas/articleshow/83619880.cms||---
---||Delhi||Shadow of Class XI over boards irks students in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Students of government and private schools alike are unhappy about Class XI marks being included in the final assessment formula for Class XII, board exams for which were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Their argument is that in Class XI, they are introduced to new subjects and in adjusting to these new studies, their test performances aren’t optimal. Parents too shared the same concern, but most school principals said there couldn’t have been a better method and expressed confidence that this formula wouldn’t put any student at a disadvantage. Riya Mukherjee, a commerce student at Delhi Public School, said, “It would have been ideal if CBSE had considered either only Class XII tests or given 30% weightage to Class X marks and 70% to Class XII because both these are board exam classes. Read AlsoSupreme Court accepts CBSE’s 30:30:40 formula for Class 12, results before July 31The Supreme Court on Thursday ended the suspense for over 15 lakh Class 12 students over marking for the cancelled board exams by approving an evaluation formula framed by CBSE and CISCE which factors in the Class 10 board result, Class 11 score and Class 12’s unit, mid-term and pre-board outcomes.I don’t find any rationality in including the Class XI performance, being a year when students change their selection of subjects. When I moved up to Class XI, all subjects barring economics and mathematics were new to me. In that light, it isn’t fair to include Class XI marks.” Vivek Pandey, a science student at Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, had a similar observation. “I scored well in my Class X exams, so I have no problem with that being included for assessment. But the board should understand that in Class XI, students concentrate on other imperatives too, like preparing for entrance exams or engaging in extra-curricular activities. Read AlsoRoad to college just got trickier than everThe Union education ministry and University Grants Commission are going to revive the discussion on the Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) next week. It is only when we are promoted to Class XII that we begin studying for the board exams.”While it is difficult to come up with a formula that pleases everyone, including Class XI marks is problematic, agreed Divya Bhatia, principal, Amity International, Saket. “Class XI is when the students take up specific streams and subjects. During the course of Class XI, students often change subjects and streams too,” noted Bhatia. “So, 30% weightage to Class XI is quite high. Ideally, 20% to X and 80% to XII would have been ideal. If at all XI had to be considered, a 20+10+70 for X , XI, XII would have worked better.” CBSE, however, has held that Class XI exams were conducted in the offline mode without deviation from the scheme and conducted just a year ago and are, therefore, indicative of a student’s current capability. However, only the practicals marks of Class XII will be considered, not of the two earlier classes.  Manoj Sharma, whose daughter is a humanities student, wondered why CBSE is only considering the theory marks. “Why aren’t they taking the overall marks for Class X and XI?” Sharma asked. “Practical tests are undertaken with external examiners, so why not include these marks in the assessment? If the practicals aren’t of much value, then why did they start practicals even for subjects like history and literature? I don’t know what to make of this.” But Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal, Springdales School, Pusa Road, described the evaluation formula as “balanced”. “The Class X board exams were validated by CBSE and the Class XI exams were completed before the pandemic. The teachers have been moderate and compassionate with the assessment for the various Class XII exams,” said Wattal. The Indian School principal Tania Joshi too thought the decision was a sound one. She said, “In Class X, 90% of the students do well. For Class XI, it would have been detrimental to take the entire year’s various exams, but in the final exams, 50-60% of the students. A moderation of +/-5 marks has also been provided.” There are some who felt the weightage of Class XI marks could have been lesser. “There is stringent marking in Class XI in government schools, so this may affect some students,” explained AK Jha, principal of a government school in Rohini. Jyoti Arora, principal, Mt Abu Public School, Rohini, disclosed, “CBSE’s 30:30:40 formula was achieved after rounds of consultations and dialogues with all Sahodayas, or regional groups of CBSE schools.” There is unanimity, however, on the non-inclusion of practical marks for Class X and XI. Said one principal, “Practical marks are a bit dicey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shadow-of-class-xi-over-boards-irks-students/articleshow/83617372.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Lucknow||Higher vaccine coverage can maximise Uttar Pradesh defence against third wave||By: Dr Praful Bharadwaj The third wave could be more lethal than the second one… Children may also suffer in the third wave… New variants of coronavirus may surface as well... These and many more conjectures around the anticipated third wave scare everyone. But while scientific community brainstorms and finds answers to these and many more questions that pop up in one’s the mind, one thing is certain—the importance of the coronavirus vaccine. Indications are clear that better levels of vaccination in the community could lessen the impact of the third wave. With a huge population of over 23 crore, UP is always at the risk of facing bigger losses on account of epidemics. This makes better preparedness and prevention pertinent to limit the number of those who suffer, and save lives. In case of the ongoing pandemic, vaccination along with proper adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is the only effective tool the system can rely on. Almost five months into the vaccination drive since its launch on January 16, only 15% of the target population has received the first dose and a mere 3% are fully vaccinated. This is among the lowest vaccination coverages in the country. Apart from low coverage with the first dose, the dropout rate between the two doses remains a key concern. Apprehension around vaccine administration has played a key role, leading to low uptake of the vaccine. There have been misconceptions and concerns around the safety of the vaccine right from the beginning, which were exacerbated during the second wave of Covid-19 due to poor adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviours. Apart from this, the threat perception related to Covid-19 is low in rural areas and therefore, a strong need for vaccination is not felt. While this has slightly changed after the second wave, it continues to be the prevalent sentiment in rural areas. This drive has also been seriously affected by the digital divide as large proportions of the population are unable to use the digital platform for registration. The initiatives being taken by the government, especially the cluster approach under its new strategy, promise to change the picture. Trusting that the UP state government will arrange for an adequate number of vaccines for July and August, the target of vaccinating 10 lakh people per day could be in reach. The efforts will pay dividends when the anticipated third wave strikes the state. In fact, better vaccination coverage will maximise UP’s response to the third wave.

The litigation and registration of an FIR against members of previous executive committee of the trust were triggered by a forensic audit of the trust’s accounts. In this case, Khoja Shia Isna-Ashari Jamat, Kera got a new executive committee in 2018 with Fazale Abbas Khoja as its secretary. Suspecting irregularities in financial transactions by the earlier body between 2008 and 2018, the new members decided to get Jamat’s accounts audited in December 2020. Vadodara-based Shah Sanjeev & Associates conducted forensic audit and pointed to financial irregularities of Rs 2.02 crore, sources said. On the basis of the forensic audit, the Kutch police booked four members of the previous executive committee — Rajabali Ghulam Hussain, Aslam Ali, Nazar Abbasali and Mohammed Fakirmamad — for cheating and breach of trust and abetment. Meanwhile, the waqf board on April 3 issued a public notice dissolving the present body and announcing appointment of an administrator. This notice was challenged by the new body before the high court on April 20. On the same day, the board suspended the public notice saying that since it was the holy month of Ramzan, it would be deferred. The HC has issued notice to the board in this regard and the hearing is now adjourned to July 1. The members of the previous committee have also approached the HC for quashing of the FIR registered with Mankuva police station after the forensic audit report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-moved-over-irregularity-in-trust/articleshow/83617241.cms||---

Environmentalists fear this will cause ecological imbalance in the Western Ghats area in the district. The district administration has begun a probe over the illegal tree felling in CHR lands. Idukki district collector H Dinesan told TOI, “Large-scale tree felling may have taken place in CHR lands. Based on a complaint, I have sought reports from Upputhara and Elappara village officers. If large-scale tree felling is found we will take steps to cancel the title deeds of the concerned CHR lands. The title deed holder has no power to fell trees from CHR lands without permission.” “Vediplavu, chorakkali, cheeni, kurangatti, chandanavayamp, red sandal, karana are major rare trees found in CHR lands. But now a rare vediplavu tree has vanished from the CHR lands. If tree felling occurs in CHR lands it will affect the ecological balance of Western Ghats. An area of 334sq mile has been declared as Cardamom Hills Reserve (CHR) and notified as reserve forest in 1897 by the then maharaja of Travancore. The mahararaja declared the CHR area as a reserve area to ensure environmental protection,” said a r forest official. The government of maharaja of Travancore issued guidelines for CHR land in 1935. “If any tree is felled in contravention of this rule, double the value of the timber as assessed by the commissioner shall be levied by way of damages. It shall also be open to the commissioner, Devicolam, when felling have been extensive to recommend that the land be resumed by the government. If wanton destruction of the tree growth is established, government may order the resumption of the land from the assignee without any liability to refund tharavila paid by him at the time of assignment. Government may also order the recovery of any amount by way of damages as may deem fit,” said the document. Environmentalist MN Jayachandran said, “The CHR lands play a pivotal role in managing the ecological balance in Western Ghats. If the trees from CHR area are destroyed it will cause climate change issues in Idukki and Ernakulum districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/greens-worried-over-tree-felling-in-cardamom-hills/articleshow/83603096.cms||Sandeep Thomas

They said that while many private schools have already started online classes, government schools are forced to wait for the start of digital classes. They said that the state should at least start classes for higher classes immediately. “It is unfair to extend summer vacation once again. Why is the state not conducting online classes? As the situation is not favourable to conduct physical classes, the state should think of starting digital classes at least for higher class students,” said Nagati Narayana, president, Telangana Parents Association. He said that at the time when corporate and private schools have already started conducting online classes, making government school students sit idle at home is not acceptable. “At least from June 21, digital classes for government students should be started,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-unhappy-with-extension-of-holidays/articleshow/83617216.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand sees significant jump in cyber crimes during pandemic||DEHRADUN: There has been a significant rise in cyber crime cases in the state since last year's Covid-19 outbreak, according to data of Uttarakhand police's Special Task Force (STF). While there were around 1,800 complaints received and 200 FIRs registered in 2018, the complaints rose to over 3,600 with 261 FIRs in 2019. The cases increased exponentially in 2020 with 6,333 cyber fraud-related complaints received while 420 FIRs were registered. Significantly, even the United Nations reported a 350% rise in phishing websites during the pandemic. Till May 31 this year, according to officials, STF received around 2,860 complaints and almost 350 FIRs have been filed in cyber crime-related cases. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) STF, Ajay Singh, said, "Cyber crimes are expected to rise with expansion of digital space. Everything is connected to the internet. We should also understand that with the increase in awareness about cyber crimes, there has been a rise in reporting of such crimes." Moreover, if the current trend continues, Uttarakhand will witness over 6,800 cyber crime cases by the year-end, as per the STF's estimate. Out of these, "around 4,500 will be financial fraud". Of the total complaints received by the cyber police station - which operates under the STF's supervision - over 65% are of financial frauds, the STF data states. "In a majority of cases, the motive of cyber crime is to extort money, while in some cases it is personal animosity," Singh added. Moreover, the latest cybersafe report of the Union home ministry has placed Dehradun fifth in the country in terms of number of victims of such a crime. The report states at least 3,056 in Dehradun district fell prey to cyber crimes from August 1, 2019 to May 31, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-sees-significant-jump-in-cyber-crimes-during-pandemic/articleshow/83615043.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) civic officials admitted that the mess of overhead cable in Salt Lake was a big problem which they have been trying to sort out for a long time by laying underground cable ducts. “Accidents can occur specially during the night as these snapped overhead cable lines could not be seen properly at that time,” said Sankhadeep Roy Chowdhury, a resident of AE Block. “It is specially inconvenient for motorists after evening as any time this could lead to accidents. Some of these could also be electrical lines. These should be removed immediately,” said Kawshik Dutta, a resident of BD Block. BMC had earlier planned to follow the NKDA way to set up underground cable ducts. “The underground duct plan could not be implemented but it is in our plan,” said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-reels-under-snapped-cable-mess/articleshow/83617279.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Met officials said it might take a few more days for the monsoon to arrive in Delhi while light rain is predicted over the next four days. India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday tweeted that large-scale atmospheric conditions are not favourable for further advancement of monsoon into Rajasthan, remaining parts Punjab, Haryana and Delhi.

Seven hours later, sub inspector Neeraj Kathait ran into Roorkee MLA Pradeep Batra and his family, taking a stroll. Kathait issued him a challan, for not wearing masks properly and for defying curfew, and Batra, in anger, threw the challan amount at him — all captured in a video that was later shared widely. On Thursday, Kathait was transferred. “The sub inspector’s transfer was ordered by the SSP’s office,” Mussoorie circle officer (CO) Narendra Pant told TOI. Kathait is now going to take over his duties in the small town of Kalsi, about 40km from Dehradun. In the video, Kathait could be heard asking the MLA, “How are you roaming around without masks and no social distancing? Roaming around is not allowed.” Batra asked him to “be polite” and said he and his family had their masks on the entire time. His son is then heard saying they on their way back to the hotel. Kathait said Batra would have to pay a challan of Rs 500, after which Batra flings the money at him and walks away. On Sunday, CO Pant had said, “The officer was simply following instructions. However, we have launched an inquiry into the matter to check if there was any misconduct on either side.” On Thursday, he said, “The officer had completed three years in Mussoorie and was already due for a transfer.” As news of his transfer spread, locals rallied behind him — both online and offline. The Mussoorie Traders’ Association submitted a memorandum to the chief minister supporting Kathait and met the tehsildar with a request to stop his transfer. “The MLA violated the law. The cop took action and should be applauded, not punished,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of the organisation. WhatsApp groups were quickly formed and messages exchanged on the transfer order. “This would demoralize the police force. They would refrain from taking strict action against violators in the future,” a local posted in a group. Another wrote, “Police must first enquire whether the person is a MLA before issuing a challan to any violator.” On the ground, opposition Congress said it would launch an agitation if Kathait was not reinstated. “We urge the government to revoke the sub inspector’s transfer. It was the MLA who was violating the rules by not wearing a mask and by venturing out on the Mall Road during curfew hours. The policeman merely did his duty,” added Gaurav Agarwalla, president of the party’s Mussoorie unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-cop-challans-mla-for-not-wearing-mask-transferred/articleshow/83615090.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Satellite school expelled 28 RTE students, Parents||AHMEDABAD: Parents created an uproar at Anand Niketan School in Satellite, alleging cancellation of admission to students under Right to Education (RTE) Act. According to allegations by parents, the school expelled 28 students who were given admission under RTE Act. The issue came to fore when some students were not able to participate in online classes. The school management, however, denied all allegations. A parent said, “These 28 students were also removed from social media groups meant for online teaching. We, parents, rushed to the school but were not allowed to enter the school premises. We were told that the admissions of the children had been cancelled.” Bhumika Patel, a parent whose child took admission under RTE, told mediapersons that the school had started online education for the new academic year but she along with few other parents were removed from the school group for online studies without any intimation. “We took admission under RTE but we haven’t been given admission receipt. Our children’s admission was confirmed by adding us to the online education group,” she said. Meanwhile, the parents have made a representation before the district education officer. ‘’My daughter was admitted to the school under RTE last year. We were admitted to the regular online class since the academic work started last year. Two days ago, the new academic work started but she was expelled from the group,” said Gaurav Presswala, a parent. However, the school management denied allegations that the students had been expelled. “No admissions from the school have been cancelled. We had written to the education department in the past about some parents enrolling their children under RTE by producing false documents,” said Kamal Mangal, managing trustee of Anand Niketan. “However, due to Covid-19, it took time to investigate. We have asked parents to co-operate in the investigation and have asked them to wait for a week till the investigation is underway. If the documents submitted by them are genuine, the admissions will not be cancelled. But we will take action against those who have submitted false documents,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/satellite-school-expelled-28-rte-students-parents/articleshow/83617283.cms||---

In a representation to chief minister M K Stalin, executive director of the organisation I Pandiyan said at least 15 major incidents of atrocities were unleashed against dalits during the lockdown over the last one month. Their key demand is convening vigilance and monitoring committee according to Rule 16 of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995.“The committee is chaired by the chief minister, with the adi dravida welfare minister, chief secretary, home secretary, director general of police and MPs as members. It should have met at least twice a year, in January and July. While 52 meetings should have been convened over the last 26 years to prevent atrocities and action taken on perpetuators, only four were conducted till date,” Pandiyan said.District-level meetings supposed to be held quarterly under the chairmanship of the collector are also not held as scheduled, he added.The outfit urged the CM to formulate a fresh committee and convene the meeting next month. It also said that 13 states including Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh have state commissions for SC/ST.A commission will be an independent body where affected people can easily approach. Setting up a commission would help register more cases under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. The state planning commission should also have a framework to empower SCs and STs through sub plans, Pandiyan added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govt-urged-to-hold-vigilance-meetings-form-sc/st-panel/articleshow/83619584.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh’s Cluster Model promises ease of vaccination in villages||LUCKNOW: There is no doubt that it is a humongous task to vaccinate 13.6 crore people, especially when more than 50% of them live in villages. That’s the target Uttar Pradesh is chasing in its battle against the pandemic virus. The progress so far shows that the state has to walk miles before the target is achieved. According to data from the CoWin portal, 2.46 crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in UP since the launch of the programme in January. In terms of population, 2.06 crore people in the state have got at least one dose. This translates to about 15% achievement. However, if the target of herd immunity is to be achieved, the number of fully immunised persons has to be increased. So far, about 40 lakh people, living in cities and peri-urban areas of the state, have taken the two doses. This is barely 3% of the target on board. Incidentally, less than 40% of these people belong to rural UP. Internal assessments indicated that villages are especially laggard in this race against the pandemic virus and also time. To note, with the current pace of progress—of about 4 lakh vaccinations per day—UP will not be able to vaccinate its total target population by December 2021. As a result, chief minister Yogi Adityanath wants that 10-12 lakh people are covered daily from July. In the wake of the challenge, the Uttar Pradesh government has tweaked its strategy and adopted the cluster model of vaccination. “The beauty of this model is that instead of waiting for the people to come forward for vaccination, it will be calling out to the eligible persons on its own. This (strategy) has worked very well with UP on several counts, especially in polio eradication,” explained additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal. Besides, the model promises a certain ‘ease of vaccination’ which is a much needed force multiplier in case of villages. Two key elements integrated in the strategy will deliver this promise. The camps will now be held inside the villages instead of near them—even primary and community health centres are 15-30 kilometres away from many villages. The second key advantage is that it eliminates the step of registration for vaccination through line listing of the eligible persons like for electoral rolls. This helps eliminate the digital divide which had been a deterrent in villages. “While hesitancy surely prevents people from trying a new thing, logistical issues like distance from home to the vaccination centre, dependency on someone to transport women or elderly to the centre, lack of sources to clear doubts, etc, are crucial contributors,” explained a health department officer engaged in the vaccination programme. The massiveness of the exercise may be gauged from the fact that UP is home to 97,000 villages. Therefore, a dry run of the actual plan began in four blocks of selected districts to study possible teething troubles and weed out glitches. Regular features like arrangements to address adverse event following immunisation in the form of quick response teams and deployment of advanced life support ambulances for transportation in case of crisis have been made. Sources in the Union ministry of health and family welfare shared that the model has already become a talking point in official quarters. The state government has also made presentations on the cluster model before Niti Aayog and government of India officials. Experts are of the view that the model will be a game-changer and it will be picked by other states soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-cluster-model-promises-ease-of-vaccination-in-villages/articleshow/83621530.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Of these, 1,320 doses were available with Madurai Medical College, 790 in government hospitals, 8,410 in PHCs and 9,400 with regional vaccine centres. As many as 4,18,901 people had been vaccinated in the district till Wednesday. After an intense activity in May, vaccination drive had come to a standstill due to non-availability of vaccines. But, even when there were only a few doses in hand, people continued to turn up at PHCs and government hospitals for their dose. On June 15, the available doses of vaccines were 2,970 and on June 14 the district had 9,150 vaccines in hand. Now, with vaccine availability going up, camps were being conducted at many places. The free vaccination drive held at Raja Muthiah Mandram was inaugurated by commercial taxes minister P Moorthy on Thursday. Veera Kaliamman Residents Welfare Association president T Nagarajan said 926 people got the jab at a camp they organized at a local school. People who had been given dates for the second dose in the first week of June have been anxious as it is getting delayed. Sources from the Public Health department said they were giving first doses and second doses now, as there are sufficient doses available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/drive-picks-up-pace-in-madurai/articleshow/83619579.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rain dampener on office attendance, app-cab surge pricing adds to woes||Kolkata: A day after government and private offices reopened with 25 per cent attendance, it was back to work from home for many people due to heavy overnight rain, waterlogging and absence of public transport. Those, who managed to reach office either by car-pooling or connecting auto rickshaws on Wednesday, logged in from home on Thursday. Several commercial establishments too remained shut and those that were open, owners and employers were seen busy draining out rain water from them. The government has eased some restrictions, allowing offices to reopen with 25% employees, bars and restaurants to open with 50% capacity and extended hours for community markets and standalone stores. Public transport however remains shut till the end of this month. “Yesterday I shared a vehicle with a colleague but today he called up to say that the stretch in front of his house was deluged and he couldn’t bring out his vehicle. I requested my supervisor if I could work from home and he granted the permission,” said Amit Kedia, a resident of Rajdanga in Kasba. A few who attempted to book cabs after they surfaced around noon found fares that had gone through the roof. “I needed to go to College Street on Thursday. But both Ola and Uber apps showed unavailability of cabs for this direction. I finally managed a metered cab after agreeing to pay thrice the metered amount,” said Anirban Gupta, advertising agency employee. But bike taxis saved the day for many attending emergency appointments. “I got a bike taxi, who readily agreed to ferry me to Salt Lake braving the waterlogged road. I gave him Rs 50 as tips,” said New Alipore resident Salil Mustafi, a businessman, who had an urgent appointment at the KMDA office. But throughout the day, cab fare had a record rise. “From Tollygunge to Howrah station, the fare was showing Rs 1,257. When I contacted the cabby, he asked for Rs 250 extra. The fare on a normal day would not exceed Rs 250,” said Arup Roy, who had reservations for Jan Shatabdi Express. Roy gave it a miss after finding no reasonable transport. People, who were to go to IT offices at Sector V, were shocked to see metered taxis refuse to ferry them from south Kolkata in less than Rs 1,000. Even auto rickshaws that had started plying on Wednesday, ferrying office-goers, disappeared on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-dampener-on-office-attendance-app-cab-surge-pricing-adds-to-woes/articleshow/83617375.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The deceased has been identified as Jayachandran, 65, of Dharmasastha apartment in Muniyandipuram near Vilachery. He had been into a transport business until a few years ago. Police said he had not married and had taken care of his sister Subbulakshmi, 55. Police said that he could have died at least a couple of days ago since his body had started decomposing. Unaware of her brother’s death, Subbulakshmi resided in the house, cooking her own food. The incident came to light after Jayachandran’s relative learnt about the incident and alerted the police. Police sources said Jayachandran’s relative Soundararajan, who lives in Erode district, had been trying to contact him over the phone. As Jayachandran could not be reached, Soundararajan grew suspicious. He called up a former maid and requested her to check. She visited the house on Thursday morning and informed Soundararajan about his relative’s death. Soundararajan alerted police. A team from the Subramaniyapuram police station reached the place and shifted the body to Government Rajaji Hospital for postmortem.

At least four companies from Gujarat have filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for IPOs. The Gujarat-based companies which have filed papers with the capital market regulator are Nirma Group backed Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Limited, Rajkot-based Rolex Rings Limited, Tatva Chintan Pharma (Vadodara) and Ami Organics Limited from Surat. Data compiled by the primary market tracker Prime Database shows that as many as 21 companies have either filed or refiled offer documents with Sebi for IPOs or FPOs (follow-on public offers) from April to the second week of June 2021. As many as four IPOs are currently open for subscription. “With people spending only on essentials due to Covid-19 induced uncertainties, they have more savings at hand. This money is flowing into the secondary and primary market as investment,” said Vaibhav Shah, MD, Monarch Networth Capital, a city-based financial services company. Shah added that investor sentiment is currently strong with equity markets reaching new highs. “Liquidity in the hands of investors, attractive valuations and fund requirements by companies as well as the right timing have prompted companies to plan their IPOs,” said Venkatraghavan S, MD and head of equity capital markets, Equirus Capital (P) Ltd. Past IPOs have also yielded good returns to investors. “So far, 20 IPOs have come to the market in the calendar year 2021. All except four have delivered positive returns to investors. Good returns are luring retail investors to invest in IPOs,” added Parth Parekh, fundamental research analyst at Prudent Corporate Advisory. “All-time high equity markets are also attracting retail investors to the primary market. Unless the markets correct massively on account of rising inflation concerns in the United States, we believe more IPOs will continue to hit the market in 2021,” added Parekh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cos-make-beeline-for-ipos-as-market-rallies/articleshow/83617382.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: More attendants allege sexual harassment in Jamnagar||RAJKOT: More attendants at Jamnagar’s state-run GG Hospital went public with allegations regarding sexual harassment by supervisors with one male attendant even alleging that his room was used to exploit the women. The three-member probe panel formed following directions of chief minister Vijay Rupani recorded statements of eight women and the male attendant Nilesh Batvar. Later, talking to media persons, Batvar alleged “My room was used by the supervisors without my knowledge.When I came to know, I told them this is unacceptable. As I objected, I was mentally tortured. I could not represent this issue before the authorities because the person wields a considerable clout. Now, I am saying this publicly because everything is in the public domain.” On Thursday, the attendants also organized a protest in the hospital campus, demanding that their stalled salaries be paid immediately. They also expressed this grievance to the inquiry committee. “Many of us have been terminated all of a sudden without any reasons being assigned. Some women were physically harassed and I got to know some others even got marriage proposals. We are from poor families, please don’t exploit our financial condition,” a woman attendant told the media.  The probe report is expected to be submitted within two or three days. The team had recorded video statements and written statements of the girls. When contacted, Aastha Dangar, the sub-divisional magistrate heading the committee said, “The girls had given their consent for recording and we have assured them that their statements won’t be leaked. ” When asked about the statements, she said “It’s premature to say anything but we will try to submit the report within two or three days.” The committee is also collecting corroborative evidence of the allegation and looking for mobile phones of victims and supervisors besides checking CCTV footage. Jamnagar collector Ravi Shankar said, “Once I get the report along with evidence, I will submit the same to the home and health departments. Based on the instructions of the government, we will lodge the FIR. If any victim wants to come forward to lodge the complaint, we are ready and we are taking these allegations very seriously.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/more-attendants-allege-sexual-harassment/articleshow/83617388.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||PSL cricket betting: One held in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: The city crime branch on Wednesday nabbed a man from the Naroda area who was found to be inviting bets on a cricket match of the 2020 Pakistan Super League using two different gambling applications. A crime branch cop said that the agency raided a house in Sattva Sharda Society near Haridarshan Crossroads in Naroda late on Wednesday night following an input about the betting racket. The cops said that they found Hardik Patel, 28, a resident of house number 403 in Sattva Sharda Society, was using two cellphones on which he was inviting bets on a match between Multan Sultans and Quetta Gladiators. A police officer said that the live score was running on the cellphone and betting odds were displayed on two different apps. He said that Patel told him that he got one of the apps from a man from Surat named Aarif Ghanchi and another app was given to them by two other men named J D Bhavnagari, a resident of Bavla in Ahmedabad district, and Shital Kathi, a resident of Bhavnagar. Patel told cops that Ghanchi, Bhavnagari and Kathi were running the racket and used to get his share in the betting. Crime branch registered a complaint under the prevention of gambling act and began an investigation.

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Attackers not known to me, police making up stories’||MEERUT: Lying on a cot with prayer beads in his hands, the 72-year-old Bulandshahr man who was allegedly assaulted by a group of men in Ghaziabad’s Loni area said that he didn't know the accused unlike what the police have claimed. He added that he was indeed forced to chant Jai Shree Ram as he was being thrashed. Abdul Samad Saifi told a group of media persons at his home Bulandshahr’s Anupshahr area on Wednesday night -- whose recording is with TOI -- that "four men had kidnapped him, one of them caught his hands while the other put a gun on his head. They then started beating him up". Asked if he knew his attackers, Saifi replied, “No I don’t know who they were. No one knows them here. The ‘taveez’ (amulet) theory is also wrong. People can cook up any story." The alleged attack took place on June 5. Samad’s son, Babboo Saifi, has also rejected the police claim. He has told TOI earlier over phone, “The entire police narrative is concocted. We have nothing to do with magic or ‘taveez’. We are Saifis and have been working as carpenters for generations. The police statement that Muslims, too, were involved in the assault is false.” Ghaziabad police have maintained that the attack was the result of personal enmity. They said that the ‘taveez’ (amulet) given by Samad didn’t prove lucky for the accused so they assaulted him. SP (rural) Iraj Raja had said, “We have phone call records to prove that main accused Pravesh Gujjar and Samad were known to each other, and on the day of incident Gujjar had sent a bike to fetch Samad. Samad is an amulet seller and Gujjar had bought one from him. He was told it will ward off evil forces. But Gujjar believed the amulet had an adverse effect on his life and blamed Samad for that.” This came even as Bulandshahr police on Thursday booked a local SP worker and 100 others who had visited Samad’s house on June 7. Ummaid Pehelwan Idrisi had broadcast a live Facebook session with Samad, which police said gave the incident a communal colour. An FIR against Idrisi and “90 to 100 others” was filed on Thursday under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (spreading the infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignantly doing an act likely to spread disease) and under relevant sections of Epidemic and Diseases Act. Idris had also claimed that he went to Loni border police station with Samad to lodge a case on June 7. But it was not registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/attackers-not-known-to-me-cops-making-up-stories-elderly-bulandshahr-man/articleshow/83615223.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra State mulls 30:30:40 formula to assess Class XII students||Mumbai: With both the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) ) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) looking at evaluating Class XII students based on their scores from 2018-19 onwards, the state is consulting college heads to determine if a similar methodology can work for Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) students too. CBSE and CISCE on Thursday submitted their marking methodologies to the Supreme Court, which was hearing a PIL filed by parents seeking cancellation of CBSE Class 12 exams. The court accepted the methodologies and asked the boards to go ahead with their schemes. TOI was the first to report on June 16 about CBSE’s plan to opt for the 30:30:40 formula for Class 12. CBSE has proposed to give weightage to the theory marks of Class X, XI and XII in the 30:30:40 ratio. In this marking system, only the final theory marks of Class X and Class XI (best of 3 out of 5 subjects) will be considered. For Class XII, weightage will be given to internal tests, mid-term tests and pre-boards, in addition to actual marks obtained in the final practicals. The state has been waiting for CBSE’s assessment methodology. College heads are being consulted on whether state board students can be similarly assessed on Class X, XI and XII marks. At some meetings, suggestions were also sought on considering Class IX marks. Principals and lecturers/professors of state colleges, however, are in favour of Class XI and XII marks only. “SSC students are forced to study subjects they may not like. When they branch out to science, commerce and arts streams, they choose subjects of their choice,” said a junior college professor. Some CBSE and CISCE school principals said the best available methodology has been adopted by the two boards. A CISCE principal said the methodology may not go down well with all students as they know their performance in the three years. CISCE schools are yet to receive communication on the marking system from their board. A CBSE school principal said, “The scores in grades 11 and 12 are still not the most objective evaluation. At this point there is no such thing as fair.” Students had their reasons to be upset with the marking formula. A Class XII CBSE student said she was hoping to be evaluated based on the current year only. “My Class 10 and 11 marks were not up to the mark. In Class 12, I improved my performance. Now I am worried about my final results,” she said.HSC students are also anxious about the possibility of Class XI marks being included for evaluating them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-mulls-303040-formula-to-assess-class-xii-students/articleshow/83621692.cms||Sandhya Nair

According to a KMC health department official who is associated with the functioning of the civic dog pound, incessant rain had resulted in complete inundation of the dog pound and the animals were to be rescued by providing them an elevated wooden platform within the kennels. According to a civic official, the operation theatre for the strays was also flooded. “It was a tough job for us to save the lives of so many stray dogs. Our security guards were keeping a vigil on the dogs throughout the night and from early morning we started to shift them to a safer place. While we have been able to save lives of the dogs undergoing treatment, we fear an outbreak of an infectious disease among them as the filthy drain water which flooded the pound complex also entered the kennels,” said a KMC official. The civic body’s health department source said despite pressing into service the portable pumps, the stagnant water didn’t recede for hours on Thursday morning. “As our dog pound is located in a low-lying area, water from EM Bypass which is relatively on a higher plane gushes in and floods our complex. Since we have no underground drainage network at the dog pound, we suffer the worst every monsoon,” said a KMC official. The official said a proposal was sent to the KMC headquarters for infrastructure development of the dog pound.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-concerns-after-dog-pound-flooding/articleshow/83617400.cms||Saikat Ray

Two of his colleagues fell unconscious, while trying to help him, but later recovered at the hospital, even as police registered a negligence case against the employer of the victims. At around 8 pm, Narasimha Reddy, 42, a plumber working for Faber Sindoori Facility management services went to the arrival area at the airport along with his colleagues to clear the clogged drainage line. Reddy alone entered the opening of the overhead duct containing various pipes, including the drainage line, near belt number 4 of the arrival terminal. "Reddy opened a hatch of the drainage line and poured acid to clear the blockage. Fumes enveloped the spot and Reddy fell unconscious due to asphyxiation. As there was no response from Reddy for some time, two of his colleagues, Zakeer and Ilyas climbed the ladder and rushed to help Reddy. They too fell unconscious after inhaling the fumes," Shamshabad deputy commissioner of police N Prakash Reddy said.

---||Dehradun||Dehradun: ICFRE marks World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought||DEHRADUN: A webinar was organised on Thursday by Indian Council for Forest Research and Education (ICFRE) authorities in which experts spoke about the importance of soil and the need to tackle fast degrading land in the country. The experts, in the webinar, said that globally, 23% of the land is no longer productive and 75% has been transformed from its natural state, primarily for agriculture. Speaking on the occasion, DG ICFRE, Dr AS Rawat, raised concerns about fast depletion of productive land. “As per the latest estimates, 96.40 million hectares [29.32% of total geographical area] of our country is undergoing land degradation, out of which 82.64 million hectares falls under dry lands. Land degradation is increasingly becoming a major concern in India,” Rawat said. He also emphasised that India has thousands of hectares of barren degraded lands due to surface mining and mine overburden dumps, posing serious threats to environmental stability. Accordingly, FRI prepared a road map for plantation work in such areas and developed a package of practices for restoration of coal mine overburden dumps in Dhanbad and Singrauli and trained 400 officials of Coal India Ltd.“Suitable restoration models and their package of practices have been developed for degraded hills, waterlogged areas and desert sand dunes stabilisation in western India,” Rawat added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/icfre-marks-world-day-to-combat-desertification-and-drought/articleshow/83615298.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), the nodal agency for Delhi-Meerut Rapid Rail Transit System (RRTS), has inked a deal with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to explore opportunities in the area. NCRTC spokesman Puneet Vats said, “The tie-up aims to generate at least 40% of the energy requirement of Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor through green energy. This will result in the generation of 10MW of green power.” For this, all elevated RRTS stations and depots will be equipped with solar panels. Apart from harnessing solar energy, RRTS rolling stock will also be provided with a state-of-the-art regenerative braking system which converts train’s kinetic energy into electrical energy. The corridor will have a total of 24 stations. It will be elevated for around 70.5 km and 11.5 km of its stretch will be underground. Civil construction work is in progress on the entire stretch of the 82-km-long corridor. The 17-km-long priority section between Sahibabad and Duhai of this corridor is scheduled to commence operations in 2023. The entire corridor will be opened to the public by 2025. The RRTS corridor will originate from Sarai Kale Khan station in Delhi and Modipuram in Meerut will be the last stop. In the first phase, the Meerut-Ghaziabad-Delhi corridor will be completed with a cost of Rs 30,274 crore by 2025. NCRTC is mandated to design, construct, finance, operate and maintain RRTS in NCR and works under the administrative control of the Union ministry of housing & urban affairs. NCRTC is a joint venture of the Centre (50%) and state governments of Haryana (12.5%), NCT Delhi (12.5%), Uttar Pradesh (12.5%) and Rajasthan (12.5%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/delhi-meerut-rapid-rail-plans-to-fulfil-40-of-its-power-needs-through-green-energy/articleshow/83615272.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Delhi||Decide for 2022 now to avoid delay: Sisodia||New Delhi: Welcoming the Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) assessment criteria for tabulating Class XII marks this year, education minister Manish Sisodia said it was time to decide the improved assessment criteria for 2022. “While we have made detailed evaluation criteria for this year’s board exams, owing to these unprecedented conditions, we similarly have to look at developing a criteria for assessing the students in board classes in 2022,” said Sisodia. Observing that normal conditions may not prevail anytime soon, the deputy chief minister said that to avoid this year’s situation in the next session, “we should start developing a plan taking into account online exams and the modalities to conduct assessments and projects, if schools have to open partially”. To avoid any delay like this year, he added, everyone needs to accept the “reality of the pandemic and understand that it might linger for a longer period of time”. On admissions to colleges under Delhi government, Sisodia said, “Admissions will be conducted based on the marksheets of students, put together by CBSE, at the end of July.” The minister also said he was hopeful that alternatives to entrance examinations would be worked out. On this year’s evaluation criteria, Sisodia, said, “The decision to cancel the board exam was a welcome one, keeping in mind the safety and security of our 1.5 crore Class XII students. The evaluation criteria that we had suggested — of looking at student performance in classes X, XI and XII — have been taken into account and implemented by CBSE.” He said it would have been good if a decision was also taken for children who want to physically take the board exams later. The board examinations, he added, should have been cancelled long ago instead of waiting for the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter. “It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court and the state governments had to intervene and protest for cancelling the board exams. If our central government had adopted a more humane approach and heard the plea of our students, we could have managed the situation better,” said Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/decide-for-2022-now-to-avoid-delay-sisodia/articleshow/83617436.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Satya Nadella elevated as Microsoft chairman||BENGALURU: Satya Nadella has been elevated as chairman of Microsoft, a recognition of how dramatically he has transformed the world’s largest software maker as chief executive over the past seven years. He will continue to also hold the CEO position. This makes it the first time since 2000, when co-founder Bill Gates stepped down as CEO, that the same person is holding both positions, demonstrating the company’s confidence in Nadella’s ability to take it into the future. In February 2014, when Nadella was appointed CEO, Microsoft’s flagship Windows business was weakening, and the company was struggling with its failures in the mobile phone and internet search markets. Nadella, who grew up in Hyderabad and joined Microsoft in the US in 1992, refocused the company around cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and instilled a greater sense of ownership among employees — moves that paid off handsomely. The company’s share price has risen nearly 600% since 2014. And since the fourth quarter of 2018, Microsoft has frequently been the most valued publicly listed company in the world, with Apple the only other contender for that spot. On Nadella’s appointment as chairman, Microsoft said in a statement, “In this role, Nadella will lead the work to set the agenda for the board leveraging his deep understanding of the business to elevate the right strategic opportunities and identify key risks and mitigation approaches for the board’s review.” Nadella, 53, succeeds John Thompson, a former CEO of Symantec who took over as chairman when Gates stepped down from that post in 2014. In December, in a filing to the US stock market regulator SEC, the board heaped praise on Nadella for the way he navigated the company through the pandemic, and the manner in which he had transformed the company’s culture. “During fiscal year 2020, Microsoft increased revenue by 14% year over year, while facing unprecedented constraints due to Covid-19 in the second half of the year. Under Mr Nadella’s leadership during 2020, many of Microsoft’s products achieved significant growth…,” it said. The board, the filing said, had asked Nadella to create additional focus on the culture of the organisation for fiscal year 2020 and is very pleased with the results that were achieved. “Based on poll data, 95% of employees feel proud to work at Microsoft. The board credits Mr Nadella for his tremendous progress driving cultural change across the organisation,” it said. Nadella was born in Hyderabad. His mother was a Sanskrit lecturer and his father an IAS officer. He attended the Hyderabad Public School, and went on to do a Bachelor’s in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology in Karnataka. He then went to the US to do a Master’s in computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. He worked briefly with Sun Microsystems before joining Microsoft in 1992.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/satya-nadella-elevated-as-microsoft-chairman/articleshow/83622685.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Man in vegetative state. Bombay HC appoints wife legal guardian||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday appointed the wife of a man who is in a vegetative state as his legal guardian after a medical panel from the state-run JJ Hospital confirmed his condition. A bench of Justices Suresh Gupte and MakarandKarnik also allowed her to sell a jointly owned flat at Nerul “in the special facts and circumstances of the case”. The order was passed on a petition by Reshma Kondkari, filed through advocate Tejesh Dande, to appoint her as the legal guardian of her husband, Abdul (68), a Sewri resident, and to authorise her to take decisions regarding movable and immovable properties that are in his name. Her petition said there is no law in India for appointing guardians for patients lying in comatose or vegetative state. As interim relief, she sought the sale of the Nerul flat to pay Rs 1.4 lakh for the monthly expense of his treatment and medicines besides Rs 70,000 towards household expenses. The couple’s four children include a son and daughter who are studying. In an unusual order, the high court had on May 19 directed the dean of JJ Hospital to constitute a team to visit and examine Abdul and submit a report regarding “his present condition”. The three-doctor panel’s report was submitted to the court by the state’s advocate, Jyoti Chavan, saying that “it is a sad situation”. The report said that Abdul had suffered from hypertensive cardiac arrest on November 12, 2017. He was revived at a hospital, but had suffered “hypoxic/ischemic brain injury” that was confirmed by MRI. Since then he has been at his residence in a vegetative state. The report said Abdul is conscious with his eyesopening but he cannot speak or understand. He cannot move his limbs on his own or sign and is totally dependent oncaregivers. He also has a tracheostomytube for breathing, urine catheter and gastrostomy tube for feeding. “In viewof this report, we feel there is a case for appointing the petitioner asguardian of her husband,’’ the judges said in the order, allowing her petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-in-vegetative-maharashtra-state-hc-appoints-wife-legal-guardian/articleshow/83619761.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Road to college just got trickier than ever||NEW DELHI: The Union education ministry and University Grants Commission are going to revive the discussion on the Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) next week. After both CBSE and CISCE cancelled the Class XII board exams in June, a majority of the states have followed suit, giving rise to concerns over evaluation and admission to undergraduate courses in colleges. While central universities are keeping their options open for conducting the 2021-22 admissions, Rajeev Gupta, dean of admissions at Delhi University, said, “The assessment policy will not affect our admissions because it seems that the Class XII results will be determined in percentage and we use percentages for deciding the admission cutoffs.” Ramanujan College principal S P Aggarwal reiterated, “The new assessment formula will not have much of an effect on DU’s admissions.” DU’s dean of admissions, however, wasn’t sure of CUCET. Gupta said, “Until the education ministry declares the exam, we cannot say anything.” Meanwhile, a UGC source confided, “Whether CUCET is implemented from the 2021-22 academic session, as intended earlier, will depend on the inputs from the central universities and the education ministry.” But for the moment, there is concern over possible disparities in how the Class XII performance of students will be evaluated in the absence of exams. According to a government official, “The Class XII exams were cancelled due to the situation created by the Covid pandemic. However, that raises questions about the disparity in Class XII results because they will be based on assessments at the school level. The education ministry is going to take up the matter with the UGC and with the vice-chancellors of central universities soon. UGC itself is also internally discussing the matter.” Educationist Meeta Sengupta suggested, “Universities should not wholly depend on school marks for admission. A test or viva could be included. For this year, colleges can also give only online admissions, to be converted to full admissions after a test when conditions improve and regular classes start or subject to students clearing their first semester.” CUCET, once cleared, will be conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), which also conducts competitive exams such as the engineering entrance JEE (Main) and medical entrance NEET-UG and several other admission tests for universities. According to an NTA official, work on the university entrance test had begun before the Covid lockdown and directives from the ministry are awaited. As for the feasibility of conducting the test for this year’s admissions, the official said, “It will take at least two months to prepare. That and the fact that two exams, JEE (Main) and NEET-UG, are pending have to be taken into account while planning CUCET.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/road-to-college-just-got-trickier-than-ever/articleshow/83617655.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

The ownership of this mecca of cricket lovers in the state capital – which once hosted MS Dhoni, Virender Sehwag and several other bigwigs – was recently shifted from the Forest Research Institute (FRI), an institute under the central government, to the state government. The state government’s not-so-impressive track record in the upkeep of Uttarakhand's sports infrastructure has left many sports lovers concerned. Raj Kanwar, Doon-based historian and writer, said, “The state government was after this place for a long time and they wanted to make it the administrative building of the state forest department, but it didn’t happen since several residents, including me, opposed it heavily. But now that they have got it, I think they will turn it into a shoddy place with some concrete structure and another open space in the city will be lost forever.” The 90-year-old journalist-turned-author added, “Back in the 1950s, we used to play cricket matches and organised proper local club tournaments. Then St Thomas also used to organise some of their events here. Back then, there also used to be a women’s club which used to hold its fair as well. The permission was given quite easily by the FRI.” The ground has been witness to several memorable cricket matches. The state’s most famous cricket tournament, the Gold Cup, has been held on the Rangers’ Ground since 1981. The state government has not made a formal announcement on what it intends to do with the cricket ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fate-of-doons-iconic-rangers-ground-hangs-in-balance/articleshow/83615325.cms||Mohammad Anab

Former leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira, and MLAs Jagdev Singh and Pirmal Singh met Rahul Gandhi at his residence along with AICC Punjab incharge Harish Rawat. The three MLAs had joined Congress in the presence of chief minister Amarinder Singh on June 3, in what was widely seen as a boost for the CM ahead of his meeting with the AICC committee constituted to discuss dissidence in the state. The three MLAs said they were merging their outfit Punjab Ekta Party with Congress. Speaking to reporters, Khaira slammed AAP founder Arvind Kejriwal, saying he was running a one-man show and had never taken any review of the Punjab unit. Khaira said he had to quit AAP despite working hard for the party. He said there had been a strong mobilisation of NRIs from across the world in favour of AAP but they were all completely disillusioned with Kejriwal. He alleged that the NRIs had given strong financial support to AAP for 2017 Punjab elections but nobody knows where that money went. “I urge all the NRIs to join hands with Congress in the coming days,“ he said. No reaction from AAP was available in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-rebel-punjab-aap-mlas-meet-rahul-join-congress/articleshow/83617527.cms||---

Now, with the spread of Covid-19 across the Hills, Subba has made it his mission to ensure that his fellow villagers get their medicines on time. Subba (31), a teacher of Lingsey High School, has taken up the strenuous task of travelling to Kalimpong, around 70km away, to procure medicines for the villagers. The school teacher recounted that he was helpless when his father had been suffering from cancer and eventually, succumbed to it because of the poor healthcare facility. “I realised that in most rural areas like Lingsey, there are no pharmacies or a health centre to get medicines during emergency. I have lost my father because of this,” said Subba. Lingsey is regarded as the last village of Kalimpong, which shares borders with Sikkim, Bhutan and China. Lingsey High School. Every Saturday, Subba, the eldest of three siblings, travels via the Bengal route to Kalimpong on his two-wheeler, despite the roads being in a bad shape there. He collects the list of medicines required by each villager along with the money. “At the moment, around 20 families are availing of my service. I visit the houses of villagers and enquire what they require. In fact, many people, on hearing the horn of my two-wheeler, also come to the main road to hand me their lists of medicines required,” Subba said. Villagers see Subba a godsend to them in the present trying times. “Lingsey is a remote area. There are no hospitals or health centres. We were helpless in the beginning but what he is doing is a blessing for us,” said DK Subba, a resident who suffers from arthritis pain and requires regular medication. “Many of us cannot travel long distance because of old age issues. We appreciate that Subba has spared a thought for us to help,” said Janaki Moktan, an elderly resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schoolteacher-reaches-out-to-people-in-remote-hills-village-with-medicines-during-pandemic/articleshow/83617544.cms||Deep Gazmer

While Tirath on Thursday was quick to “indirectly” shift the blame on his predecessor, saying the matter was reported before he took charge, Trivendra, on the other hand, demanded a probe by a sitting high court (HC) judge which he said will “bring out the correct facts”. Reacting to the scam, Tirath told mediapersons on the sidelines of an event to mark 100 years of his government on Thursday, “I took charge as chief minister on March 10. This matter is before that time. On taking charge, I immediately ordered a probe into the matter. It is being thoroughly investigated and strict action will be initiated against all those found guilty. Nobody will be spared.” Interestingly, the Kumbh’s official duration was from April 1 to 30 and the notification for the religious congregation was issued only in the last week of March. The Covid tests in question were also conducted during the official duration of the festival in April. Meanwhile, reacting to the testing scam, former CM Trivendra Rawat told TOI, “This is a serious crime which I believe should be taken cognisance of under section 307 [attempt to murder] of IPC. Those involved should not be spared. I welcome the CM's decision for a probe, but at the same time I strongly advocate a judicial probe by a sitting HC judge. The reason is that people may believe that a probe by government authorities may not bring out the entire truth.” He added that “if there has been any wrongdoing, people of Uttarakhand need to know the time when the crime was committed and why no action was taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tirath-vs-triendra-on-kumbh-covid-testing-scam-cm-says-matter-not-of-his-tenure-ex-cm-demands-probe-by-sitting-hc-judge-to-bring-out-correct-facts/articleshow/83615366.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Hyderabad||Covid spur? Telangana pharma companies get bigger; 93 firms seek ecology nod||HYDERABAD: After a sharp surge of Covid-19 cases in April and May in Telangana, several pharma companies in and around Hyderabad are now on an expansion spree, indicating a boom in the drug manufacturing business. In just two months, the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority had received 93 proposals for the expansion or setting up of new units of bulk drug and formulation units. Most of the units are coming up in Nalgonda, Siddipet, Kamareddy and Mahbubnagar districts — within striking distance of Hyderabad. As per the latest guidelines, any new pharma unit will have to be set up outside the outer ring road (ORR) limits to check environmental pollution. Elaborating on the boom in the industry, Pharmaceuticals Exports Promotion Council of India DG Ravi Uday Bhaskar said pharma exports had increased by 15 per cent in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20. Last year’s pharma exports were to the tune of $23.7 billion and out of the top nine companies globally, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Aurobindo Pharma are Hyderabad-based,” he said. Bhaskar said after agriculture, pharma sector is doing a good business in the pandemic time. “The Centre had announced product-linked incentive schemes with an objective to decrease API dependency on China. Formulations are also given incentives now.” According to the global data, almost 85 per cent of India’s annual active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) requirement is imported with China making up 65-70 per cent of this. Agreeing that the pandemic situation has spurred the demand for drugs, Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association executive director P Eshwar Reddy said: “So far, 10 to 12 bulk drug manufacturers have got permissions for expansion outside the ORR. The National Green Tribunal has ordered that 1 per cent of total turnover should be paid as a corpus fund. However, big pharma companies are facing problems due to this clause.” Hoster Labs Private Limited had applied for expansion of an API bulk drugs and intermediates manufacturing unit at Chityal in Nalgonda district. Harika Labs in Siddipet, Sheetal Chemicals Ltd at IDA Bollaram, Sangareddy, Optrix Labs at Yadadri, Selmar Labs at Kazipally, Dasha Life Sciences at Narsapur, Sri Sujala Drugs at Chityal, Atulita Labs at Chityal and VNR Biosciences at Kamareddy were among several firms that had applied for expansion and obtained environmental clearance (EC). Piramal Enterprise Ltd has already obtained the EC in February for expansion of its bulk drugs manufacturing unit. Salus Laboratories Ltd, Hepa Pharma and MKR Pharma were issued ECs for manufacturing units at Choutuppal, Sangareddy and Chityal respectively.

After cancelling the exams, the state board on Thursday said it will use students’ performances in Class 12, Class 11 and Class 10 exams in a 25:25:50 ratio. The state education board’s announcement came hours after the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) said it will use students’ performances in Class 12, Class 11 and Class 10 exams in a 40:30:30 ratio. “Due to the pandemic, many students, especially in Gujarat’s rural areas faced difficulties in attending online classes and many would not have been able to participate in internal exams for Class 12. Last year, Class 11 students were given mass promotion. Hence, keeping in view the scenario in the state, we decided to give more weightage to Class 10 performance so all students can get a fair chance,” said a GSHSEB official. While Class 10 board results will be given 50% weightage, Class 11 first and second internal examinations will carry 25% weightage. In the case of Class 12 performance, students will be evaluated based on their marks for the first unit test and the internal examination held in 2020-21. Schools have also been instructed by the Board to upload the marks of students online. The marksheet and certificate will be issued by the Board to regular students of Class 12. As per the methodology announced by the Board, the result of the students will be finalized by the schools from June 19 to June 25.  The process of uploading the results prepared by the schools on the board’s website will be held from June 25 to July 21. The results for Class 12 science stream students will be declared online by the board in the second week of July. For Class 12 general stream students, the results are expected to be declared online in the third week of July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/50-weightage-to-ssc-marks-in-hsc-results/articleshow/83617561.cms||---

There was a strange reluctance on the part of FM (Nirmala Sitharaman) to name the finance minister who was in office during 2011-12 and who presented the Budget for 2012-13. I wonder why?” Chidambaram said on Twitter, while referring to her comments in an interview to Times Now. Without naming Manmohan Singh, Sitharaman had blamed “the very eminent economist”, who ran UPA-2 for the retrospective amendments. However, the finance minister, just like her party, while attacking UPA’s management of economy between 2004-2014, has chosen not to focus on the role of Mukherjee’s role as finance minister. In fact, Mukherjee was conferred Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honour, during Narendra Modi government’s term.  Chidambaram’s tweet, seeking to pin the retrospective taxation decision on Mukherjee, instantly revived the memories of his tense equations with the former President. While Chidambaram had been FM between 2004 and 2008, he shifted to the home ministry after the 26/11 attacks and returned to the finance ministry after Mukherjee became president in 2012. During his stint as finance minister, Mukherjee decided not to pursue several initiatives pushed by his predecessor, such as a new Direct Taxes Code.  Responding to Sitharaman’s comments on inflation being as high as 12.4% during UPA’s tenure, Chidambaram also emphasised that inflation under UPA was highest during Mukherjee’s tenure as FM. “Under UPA II, the worst year of inflation was 2010-11. Average WPI reached 9.6% but declined year after year to 6% in 2013-14,” the former FM said. Mukherjee, who died last year, has largely been seen as among the key drivers for the policy change that has resulted in severe criticism globally. While BJP had criticised the policy at that time, the Modi administration has now appealed against rulings against it by international tribunals, arguing that tax policy is a sovereign issue and cannot be determined by tax treaties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retro-tax-chidambram-takes-dig-at-bjp-for-not-naming-pranab/articleshow/83622733.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Anticoagulants help Hyderabad hospitals keep mucormycosis at bay||HYDERABAD: As experts in the country try and decode the exact reason behind the surge in mucormycosis infections among recovered Covid-19 patients, there are some treatment facilities in Telangana, without a single case of black fungus among its patients. While there have been case of patients who were never on oxygen support and recovered in home quarantine contracting the dreaded fungal infection for misuse of steroids, city doctors say use of anticoagulants and vasodilators medicines might have been the key to prevent mucormycosis. “We have been discharging our patients with vasodilators and anticoagulants like asprin and haven’t seen a Covid patient discharged by us return with mucormycosis. We believe these medications have a role in preventing the fungal infection.” said Dr K Prashanth Kumar, consultant physician Sunshine hospital. “While mucor is present in environment, it is invading our bodies due to the decreased immunity levels. Covid-19 is severely decreasing the immunity levels and with the fungus entering the body through the nose, it causes thrombosis in the blood vessels around the nose, cheeks and eyes,” he added. In fact, surgeons operating patients affected with black fungus say that the extent of damage within two days of onset of pain in the cheek is such that the entire cheek bone can get infected. “Once the infection reaches the eye, within no time it can reach the brain and the patient dies. However, with better awareness levels we are seeing cases early one and can save many patients,” said Dr Manish Gupta, ENT surgeon and associate professor, government ENT Hospital Koti. Confirming that the hospital has not seen a single mucormycosis case in Covid recovered patients on anticoagulants and saying that it might be a preventive measure, Dr LM Chandra Sekhara Rao, consultant head and neck oncologist, Basavatarkam Indo-American Cancer Hospital and Research Institute too recommended anticoagulants. “While in other diseases immune suppression is transient, in Covid-19 the impact of the virus is present from the two weeks to even four months. The virus is causing blood clots at the micro level due to which extensive damage is seen in mucormycosis patients. Anticoagulants can work as a preventive measure,” said Dr Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/use-of-anticoagulants-vasodilators-helping-hospitals-keep-black-fungus-cases-at-bay/articleshow/83618279.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Dehradun||Dehradun: CBSE's objective criterion gets a mixed response||DEHRADUN: The CBSE told the Supreme Court about the "objective criterion" during a hearing in Delhi on Thursday. It stated that the students will be evaluated on the basis of a 30:30:40 formula in which 30% of the weightage will be given to the student’s performance in Class 10 and 11, while 40% weightage will be given to the performance in Class 12 (pre-boards and before). The result of Class 12 will be announced by July 31 while Class 10 will be declared by July 20. The objective criterion drew a mixed response from experts. “Overall, the decision taken by CBSE is good for the department, but if seen minutely some bright students may suffer. The workload has increased. However, the result should be compiled immediately as the students need to take admission in higher education institutes," said Somdutt Tyagi, president of the CBSE Sahodaya School Complex (Pachwadoon). "We also did a meet among our members. The formula we came up with almost matches with the CBSE evaluation criteria. We have filled up the questionnaire given by the CBSE in which we have told the same things, but have also mentioned that we are not satisfied with the objective criterion adopted for evaluating the Class X students. We are satisfied with the Class XII evaluation formula,” Tyagi added. There are some who feel that there could have been further improvements. “The formula adopted by the CBSE is quite good, but some improvements could have been made as particularly in Class XI where most of the students think of just getting the passing percentage and not 80% or 90%. Also, students don’t have many subjects in Class XII which they had studied in Class X,” said Manmohan Jaiswal, president of the Uttarakhand Parents' Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cbses-objective-criterion-gets-a-mixed-response/articleshow/83615390.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Patna||Dissidents elect Paras LJP chief, Chirag Paswan fumes||PATNA/NEW DELHI: The split in Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) was wide open on Thursday when one faction led by Pashupati Kumar Paras formally elected him (Paras) as the national president of the party at its national executive committee meeting held here, the other led by Chirag Paswan described the election as “unconstitutional” and claimed a physical meeting of its national executive would be held in the national capital on Sunday to reiterate Chirag’s earlier election as the party’s national president. Paras, the younger brother of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, was earlier notified as the parliamentary party leader of LJP in Lok Sabha. Former LJP MP Surajbhan Singh said Paras was elected national president of the party unopposed as no other nomination was filed against him. “Altogether 71 members extended their support to Paras at the meeting,” he said. However, only four of the five rebel MPs were present at the meeting held at the residence of Surajbhan here. Samastipur MP and Chirag’s cousin Prince Raj was conspicuous by his absence at the meeting. Chirag said in New Delhi that the meeting organised in Patna was “unconstitutional” and lacked even minimum attendance of its national executive members. He told PTI that his party has also written to the Election Commission, urging it to stop the Paras-headed faction from using its symbol and flag in its meeting. LJP's secretary general Abdul Khaliq said a physical meeting of its national executive would be held in the national capital on Sunday. Meanwhile, Paras said in Patna that the party would leave no stone unturned to fulfil the dreams of its founder late Ram Vilas Paswan. He, however, described Chirag as “autocrat” who ignores the workers of the party. “Bhatija agar tanashah ho jayega to chacha kya karega? Yahan prajatantra hai, koi aajivan adhyaksh nahi rah sakta hai (When nephew turns autocrat, what option can an have? In a democratic set up, nobody can continue to serve as president of a party for his lifetime),” he told the mediapersons. Charting out his plans to strengthen the organisation, Paras said the party would focus on fighting for the cause of the poor and downtrodden. “The LJP was formed with the motto to give voice to the neglected and provide them their due share in the democratic set up. We will follow that ideology and win the hearts of the poor,” he said. He appealed to the leaders and workers who had earlier quit LJP to return to the party fold. “I assure you that you will be given due respect and honour. I apologize on behalf of the party,” he said. Meanwhile, Rajesh Bhatt, spokesperson of LJP (Chirag faction), said the meeting of the national executive committee was convened by Paras group in violation of the constitution of the LJP. “The meeting was undemocratic as Chirag is the national president of the party. The rebels may be satisfied for the time being by distancing themselves from the party, but the people of Bihar will never forgive them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dissidents-elect-paras-ljp-chief-chirag-fumes/articleshow/83616094.cms||---

IIL’s existing BSL2+ rabies vaccine facility has been repurposed for Covaxin and the civil works for the second facility too are nearing completion, sources at IIL told TOI. “The civil works for the new facility are going on at a rapid pace and are almost over. The new building will house facilities to make drug substance for Covaxin,” the source added. While the repurposed facility will manufacture drug substance for around three million doses of Covaxin per month, the new facility will have a capacity to make Covaxin drug substance for over six to seven million doses per month, taking IIL’s total capacity for Covaxin to over 10 million doses per month by year’s end. IIL is slated to begin supplying the drug substance to Bharat Biotech towards the end of July. Currently, Bharat Biotech is manufacturing 25 million doses of Covaxin at its Hyderabad facilities and is in the process of scaling up its capacities in Bengaluru, a senior Bharat Biotech official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iil-setting-up-2nd-facility-for-covaxin-substance/articleshow/83618533.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||New cancer patients in Hyderabad at risk as they put off doctor visits||HYDERABAD: Fears of contracting Covid-19 in hospital set-up may be the reason for new cancer patients not seeking timely treatment, but the disease is fast progressing without any medical intervention, top doctors said. As number of new cases being detected has gone down to a bare minimum, since mid-April this year, data shows footfalls of cancer patients have fallen to 20 per cent of the regular count. Doctors said with the second wave waning, patients have begun to show up but in most cases they are showing stage migration — increase in stage of cancer. Many have ignored the symptoms of the diseases which may have led it progress faster to the next stage. “Cancer is a semi-emergency as it keeps growing without causing problems for patients and hence many tend to overlook initial symptoms,” said Dr K Sreekanth, senior surgical oncologist at Yashoda Hospitals. “For instance, a patient might pass blood in stool, in urine or while coughing, might notice a lump in breast but not seek medical opinion which they would have otherwise,” Dr K Shreekanth said adding due to fear of Covid-19, many intend to wait till second wave is over. “But in these two-and-a-half months since there has been a significant decline in patient footfall, the disease would have progressed in many cases,” he said. Other experts say that while patients ultimately have to seek medical opinion, many do not realise that cancer grows continually. In some cases it might be slow in others it could be aggressive. Such cases are already being reported across the city. Speaking about the scenario with regards to breast cancer patients, director of KIMS Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases, Dr P Raghu Ram said, “We are getting such cases of upstaging of cancer already as patients have started coming since last one week. In case of breast cancer, usual presentation is a painless lump, (which) new patients often think is not urgent but in fact, the earlier they present to a doctor, the better the chances of survival.” Dr Raghu Ram said that although in past two months, elective surgeries had been put on hold everywhere, patients who they had seen were put on neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery to buy more time. “In case of a future wave, patients should not delay visiting an oncologist as alternate treatment can begin even if surgeries are postponed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-cancer-patients-at-risk-as-they-put-off-doctor-visits/articleshow/83618429.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Nagpur||Nagpur cops bring around 2,600 foreigners under scanner||NAGPUR: The arrest of an Afghan national, Noor Mohd Aziz Mohd, on Wednesday was part of a police exercise to verify visas and other documents of more than 2,600 foreign nationals in the city. Noor, who was staying illegally in Nagpur since 2010, would be deported soon. Apart from Noor, cops also unearthed details of yet another illegal resident Afghan, Mateen Sarwar Khan, who has even purchased some property in the city on the basis of an Aadhaar card, which cannot be issued to foreign citizens. An investigation by special branch under DCP Basavraj Teli revealed Khan had come to the city in 2016 during his journey to a dargah at Washim. The following year, Khan was nabbed by Nandanvan police for visa violations but soon got bail. It’s learnt Khan and his family had registered themselves in Assam when they first came to India. City police are also trying to zero down upon Khan to deport him too. “We will try to get the property purchased by Khan seized by the concerned department and confiscated by the government. Police would either try to expedite the trial in Khan’s case or get it withdrawn, as we are keen to deport him,” said CP. Kumar also said the documents of more than 2,600 foreign nationals, including Pakistan-based Hindus, would be verified to ascertain whether they were staying legally in the city. “Since around a week, city police had started checking and verifying documents of foreign nationals currently staying in the city. This exercise led us to Noor, whose deportation process has been initiated,” he said. “We have found a registration card and driving license from Noor but their authenticity is under question,” said CP. “Though his social media posts have pro-Taliban inclination, there was no record or information of Noor indulging in any dubious activities in the city,” said Kumar. He added Noor was involved in helping Khan in his financial dealings. It’s learnt Noor had arrived at Delhi airport in 2010 and reached the city, but no official record of his arrival and stay in city was found. The CP also added some of the Pakistani Hindus are staying with extended long term visas, and their documents would be scrutinized too. “Police would also verify details and documents of the other 269 foreign nationals too, including 96 Afghans,” he said. Sources there are five Bangladeshi nationals staying in city apart from natives of different other countries, including 12 Muslim women from Pakistan. It’s learnt cops are also set to launch a drive against illegally residing Bangladeshis in the city, whose numbers could be substantial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-cops-bring-around-2600-foreigners-under-scanner/articleshow/83615461.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Proposed in 2006, no sign of Danaganj mall in Nagpur 15 years later||NAGPUR: It is a fit case of administrative nonchalance and disregard for city’s development. Danaganj Mall, first proposed in 2006-07 and the work for which was to start in 2009, saw the contract being awarded in 2014. And as things stand now, the project remains far from over. This mall was proposed along with Jaripatka Mall, which is already up and running. The completion deadline has already been extended twice but the work has not gathered pace. Now, the public works department has submitted a proposal to the NMC general body meeting to be held on June 22 to set a new deadline for M/s Orange City Mall Pvt Ltd, the private firm which was awarded the contract. The firm has sought an extension in the deadline with assurance to complete the project by 2023-2024, said an official. Due to administrative delay, the NMC had awarded the work to Orange City Mall on May 8, 2014. The firm was supposed to complete the work within two years. Due to some technical problems and delays, the construction work could not start. In 2017, the department, after the standing committee’s nod, extended the deadline to September 28, 2019. The environment clearance needed for constructing a mall on over 20,000sqm land was obtained from the state government on February 2, 2019. Later, a revised plan was submitted to the town planning department. Despite all approvals in place, the firm failed to start the construction. As per the agreement, the firm was supposed to start paying Rs1 crore premium with 16% interest to NMC for 2019-20. The company has paid the mandatory late fees and charges to NMC since 2016-17. So far, it has paid premium and 16% interest, totalling Rs10.30 crore. It shows that the agency is willing to complete the work, the proposal stated. Due to Covid-induced lockdown, the firm could not work in 2020-21. So, the department submitted yet another proposal to extend the deadline by three years. It suggested levying Rs1.16 crore per year premium for deadline extension and that the firm must deposit the amount while executing the supplementary agreement. Even the NMC’s legal advisor SM Puranik gave nod to execute the supplementary agreement. Besides depriving citizens of east Nagpur a shopping facility, the NMC lost revenue in form of rent of Rs 45 per sqm per annum. Many small malls proposed in the past too are in the cold storage. Expressing concern over the delay, NCP city president and senior corporator Duneshwar Pethe said the NMC should terminate the agreement. Congress corporator Nitin Sathawane blamed the delay on inactive elected representatives from this part of the city. “Despite being in power for so many years, the ruling BJP did nothing to accelerate the project,” he said. Ruling party leader Avinash Thakre held the administration responsible for the mess. “We have urged the administration to resolve the issue,” he said. OTHER PROPOSALS * Town planning department seeks deletion of playground and allotment of 1,000 sqm of Kunjilalpeth Primary School for constructing an elevated storage reservoir * Deletion of reservation of crematorium land for construction of elevated storage reservoir in Vaishali Nagar * Extending contract of 56 teachers for 2021-22 academic session for 11 months * Aid of Rs1 lakh and Rs2.5 lakh to Rs5 lakh to physically challenged or self-help groups for self-employment projects * Proposal on waste-to-biogas project, material recovery facility, construction and demolition projects.

All the officers and employees were locked in their offices and had to scale the boundary walls of the two buildings to go home.The Temporary Teachers’ Union, Punjab, had laid siege to the entry and exit points of the education secretary’s office as well as the education board on Wednesday and the protest continued on Thursday as well. The women employees of the PSEB said it was very difficult for them to scale the boundary walls, leaving their vehicles inside, to go back to their houses after 5pm.Board staffers Surinder Kaur, Rajvir Kaur, Balbir Kaur and Santokh Singh said that they got terrified when the protesting teachers did not move out of the way on the second day as well. Surinder Kaur said, “We had to scale the boundary wall to reach our homes. We left our scooters in the PSEB parking as the gates were locked by the protesters.”Santokh Singh said, “My car was left inside the education department building parking lot as the protesting teachers refused to move out of the way.” The protesting temporary teachers’ union refused to budge as talks between them and the Punjab government bore no fruits. Their leaders Jhujar Singh Sangrur and Ranjit Singh Bhattiwal said in 2016 before elections, Captain Amarinder Singh had come to their protest site and promised that once their government came to power, they would regularise their services in the first cabinet meeting. Jhujar Singh said, “But now more than four years have passed, but the Captain’s government has not fulfilled his promises. We will hold protests till the government comes and gives us an assurance. We also demand that our salary be increased to Rs 40,000.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/locked-in-by-irate-teachers-edu-board-staff-scale-walls/articleshow/83615464.cms||---

In contrast, cold days and cold nights are projected to decline in the state. Using data of both temperature and precipitation (rainfall) from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) between 1951 and 2019, the study has made projections for the future. “The projections of mean annual daily temperature suggest that there is an overall tendency of increase in temperature. The mean annual daily maximum temperature increase is observed more towards north and north-eastern districts,” the study says. Except for the southern districts of Gujarat, the study observed “ a positive trend – (temperature rise by 1 degree C) in the mean annual daily temperature in almost all the other regions of the state.” Environmentalist Mahesh Pandya says that the combination of Gujarat having a very long coastline and being an industrialised state, increases its vulnerability to climate change. “At such a time, the action plan ought to have specific measures to mitigate harmful effects of climate change. Air pollution owing to industrialization has to be reduced drastically as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/more-hot-days-heatwaves-likely-in-gujarat-study/articleshow/83617619.cms||Meghdoot Sharon
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: TRS wants L Ramana, TTDP chief plays a waiting game||HYDERABAD: The TRS leadership and Telangana TDP president L Ramana seem to be playing a waiting game on the latter joining the ruling party. While talks with Ramana began soon after Eatala Rajender’s dismissal from the cabinet, the efforts hit a roadblock over demands of a cabinet berth for Ramana. Sources said the TRS leadership has offered to make him an MLC, but Ramana is believed to have asked for a ministerial berth before he jumps into the party. “As a result, the talks are not making any headway,” sources said. Ramana had lost in the graduates MLC elections from Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar constituency in March this year. Ramana said his decision would be based purely on political dynamics and what his followers want. “I am consulting with my party workers, followers and well-wishers on whether to join the TRS or other parties. I am not in a hurry as there is more time for the general elections. I will take a decision which is in consonance with my stature and seniority,” Ramana told TOI. He further said: “The TRS has invited me several times to join its ranks. But, I did not leave the TDP.” Apparently, Ramana is learnt to have told his close aides that he has very little hope in the TDP after the loss in the MLC elections. BJP leaders have also reportedly met Ramana and urged him to join the saffron party. Sources said the TRS leadership is firm on regaining Karimnagar and Nizamabad Lok Sabha seats from the BJP and also defeating Eatala in Huzurabad assembly bypolls. “The party believes Ramana’s joining will strengthen the party in Jagtial, which is part of Nizamabad LS seat. He also has considerable influence over BC voters in Huzurabad, which is part of Karimnagar LS seat,” sources said. Ramana belongs to a BC community and has served as TDP president of erstwhile Karimnagar district, Karimnagar MP and Jagtial MLA. “Huzurabad has a sizeable BC population and Ramana’s entry will boost the prospects of TRS in the bypolls,” a senior TRS leader said. Former Nizamabad MP and TRS MLC K Kavitha, during her recent visit to Jagtial, dropped enough hints of a possible entry of Ramana by claiming that there would be a major change in the political contours of Karimnagar district soon. Meanwhile, TDP all-India general secretary and Telangana affairs incharge Kambhampati Rammohan Rao spoke to Ramana and asked him not to take any hasty decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-wants-ramana-ttdp-chief-plays-a-waiting-game/articleshow/83617796.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Delhi||Parents among 6 arrested for trying to sell off kid for Rs 3.6 lakh||New Delhi: A six-day-old boy has been rescued and six people, including his parents who were allegedly selling him off for Rs 3.6 lakh, have been arrested. The arrested people include a childless couple who allegedly bought the baby with the help of a relative and his friend. The child welfare committee has sent the infant to a child care centre in Sarita Vihar. The biological parents have been identified as Govind Kumar (30), a resident of Sikanderpur in Gurgaon, and his wife Pooja Devi (22). Four cheques of Rs 40,000 each and Rs 15,000 cash have been seized from them. The others have been identified as Vidyanand Yadav, a 50-year-old resident of Bihar’s Madhubani, and his wife Rampari Devi (45), and Raman Kumar Yadav (32) and Haripal Singh (50). After receiving a kidnap call, a Delhi Police team reached the spot and found Kumar who said his wife had given birth to a baby boy on June 8. He claimed they were staying at his friend Singh’s house on June 4 when the latter locked them in and took away the child. A case of kidnapping was registered. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said the behaviour of the parents was found to be suspicious and Kumar subsequently said he didn’t know Singh’s address in Aya Nagar. He showed police a locked house, but Singh was finally caught from another place in Aya Nagar, Thakur said. Singh claimed the infant was given by his parents to Raman, a resident of Sanjay Camp, Moti Bagh. Police then detained Raman who also echoed Singh, the DCP said. Raman said that the couple, his relatives, had left Delhi with the child. A Delhi Police team finally found them on Swatantra Senani Express at Kanpur Central around 2.30am and rescued the infant, Thakur said. It was found that the couple from Bihar had been married for 25 Years, but did not have any child. Hence, they approached Raman who, through his friend Singh, had made the deal. The child’s parents initially demanded Rs 4 lakh, Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parents-among-6-arrested-for-trying-to-sell-off-kid-for-rs-3-6-lakh/articleshow/83617701.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||Thunderstorm damages four parked aircraft in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Heavy rain and high-velocity winds in Ahmedabad late on Wednesday caused chaos at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport. Four aircraft parked at the airport suffered varying degrees of damage due to the strong winds. The storm hit at around 9pm. Three aircraft of IndiGo, one of GoAir and one of SpiceJet drifted from their parked positions due to the wind. Sources said the wing of the GoAir aircraft got bent. An Adani Airports spokesperson said, “The winds were so gusty that it led to aircraft drifting and moving out of their parking positions. On Wednesday (June 16, 2021) around 9pm, weather conditions at Ahmedabad airport suddenly deteriorated, resulting in strong winds for one to two minutes. This strong wind led to parked aircraft drifting from their positions and colliding with ground equipment (step ladders) near the aircraft. Some four aircraft sustained minor damage to their wings.” All the aircraft were repositioned to standard parking bays and the area was cleared of debris. There was no injury to any personnel, the airport spokesperson said. A preliminary report regarding this has been sent to the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA). Five aircraft including Airbus A320s operated by GoAir and Indigo along with a Boeing 737 of SpiceJet moved from their positions due to the strong wind, sources said. SVPI airport authorities had not only issued an advance weather warning to the airlines but designated officials had also inspected parked aircraft, including those affected before the the incident. Spokespersons of GoAir refused to comment on the matter. Sources said the incident is being analysed and investigated. “Three IndiGo aircraft suffered minor/non-structural damage which will require replacement of certain parts. The aircraft will be in operation after the necessary repairs,” said an IndiGo spokesperson. A SpiceJet spokesperson said, “On June 16, a SpiceJet Boeing 737 aircraft was parked at bay No. 16R at Ahmedabad airport. Due to the thunderstorm last evening and strong winds, the aircraft moved from its original position. The aircraft was towed by the engineering team to align it properly at the assigned stand. No structural damage was caused due to the movement.” Sources said that the wind speed as forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) was around 25 knts however, the actual gust speed was much higher when the incident took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/thunderstorm-damages-four-parked-aircraft/articleshow/83617713.cms||Niyati Parikh

Chief minster Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said that the formulae for evaluation would be announced the next day while the results would be published by July. Earlier, the exams were cancelled after a six-member expert panel cited the pandemic situation. Thereafter, public opinion was sought through e-mails, in which a majority of students and their guardians had also called for the cancellation of exams. However, unlike the central boards, CISCE and CBSE, the state boards are facing a challenge as most of the 21 lakh students, who were to appear in the two board exams, have not been evaluated since January 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-to-notify-boards-result-formulae-today/articleshow/83617656.cms||---
---||Dehradun||FIR against pvt agency, 2 labs in fake Covid tests case||DEHRADUN/HARIDWAR: Haridwar police on Thursday filed a first information report (FIR) against Delhi-based Max Corporate Services — the private agency under scanner for conducting nearly 1 lakh fake Covid tests during the Kumbh mela in Uttarakhand — and two private labs it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with. The private agency had billed the health department Rs 3.8 crore, with majority of the bills on behalf of testing conducted by Nalwa Laboratories in Hisar, said Dr Arjun Singh Sengar, Kumbh mela health officer. Talking to TOI, Dr JP Nalwa, owner of the Nalwa lab, said that no one from the lab had gone to Kumbh. “We had cancelled our MoU in April with Max Corporate Services. We were not involved in any testing in Haridwar and haven’t received any money from the Uttarakhand government or the agency. Our names and letterheads have been misused,” he said. The other lab in question, Dr Lachandani Labs in New Delhi, claimed all the tests they conducted were authentic. ”We will cooperate with the investigation,” said owner Dr Mohit Lalchandani. All three parties have been booked under various sections of the Epidemic Act, 1897, the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 188 (punishment for disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery) and 471 (fraudulently using as genuine any document or electronic record). The FIR was filed based on a complaint by Haridwar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr SK Jha. “It is clear that a serious crime has been committed with the intention of stealing government money under the Disaster Act by making fake entries,” Jha said in his complaint. The FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, reads: “Max Corporate Services generated over a lakh SRF IDs (identification number which is unique to each Covid test) between April 13 and May 16 and the positivity rate of these samples was found to be 0.18% which is much lower than the positivity rate in Haridwar at that time which has raised suspicions that these must be fake entries done by the said firm.” The complaint also noted that over 50,000 reports were uploaded on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal between May 1 and May 16 even though the Kumbh festival was over by April 30. The agency was tasked with conducting testing in key mela areas during the Kumbh festival from April 1 to April 30. The FIR further said, “When the sample collectors registered with the firm were called, they said they were not associated with any of the path labs. It is clear that fake entries of sample collectors were also made by the concerned firm.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fir-against-pvt-agency-2-labs-in-fake-covid-tests-case/articleshow/83615492.cms||Ishita Mishra

Raut is upset over the state’s decision to cancel 33% reservation in promotions in state-run establishments.

---||Delhi||Plea to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, LG Anil Baijal to allow wedding venues to open||New Delhi: Representatives of wedding venues, hotels and event operators have sent a joint petition to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for allowing operation of wedding venues with all Covid protocols in place. In the letter, they have stated that if no decision is taken soon regarding capping of guests and operation of wedding venues, they will face major losses. “After July, there are no auspicious wedding dates for the next three months. All weddings of April also got postponed because of lockdown and people are thinking about cancelling and extending their bookings due to capping of guests. This is a really tough time for us,” said Rajeev Jain of Event and Entertainment Management Association. Sanjay Khullar, president of Delhi Catering Association, echoed similar sentiments. “Our industry has suffered major losses in the past two years and survival has become difficult. People are even losing jobs. We have asked for full-fledged operation of wedding venues. People are already going to malls and trains in thousands on a daily basis,” he said. The representatives of these associations have also shared a standard operating procedure (SOP) with the officials that they promise to follow strictly. They have assured the authorities to follow the 3 square metres formula during social gatherings. “That means, if any client plans to organise a wedding with 500 guests, then the size of the venue would be 1,500 sqm,” said Vijay Arora of Venue Operators’ Management Association. Besides ensuring sanitising of wedding venues at regular intervals of time, the associations say they are ready to create buffer zones between hotels’ main entrances and banquet parch so that there is no long traffic jam outside them. Sanitisation of car exteriors, contactless temperature check of guests and strict implementation of Covid norms were among the other points mentioned in the SOP. Guests were also given briefing verbally and digitally regarding arrangements, social distancing, etc, the representatives said. “ The SOP also includes norms for kitchen area, staff serving food, washroom areas as well as pre-event and post-event precautions. We have sought an appointment from LG and CM and hope that they would at least hear our pleas,” said Rajeev Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-to-cm-lg-to-allow-wedding-venues-to-open/articleshow/83617723.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Business||HDFC Bank to move to new digital bank IT platform||MUMBAI: HDFC Bank on Thursday unveiled its longer term digital banking plans. These involve building a new digital bank, rather than limit the solution to scaling up systems, and increased monitoring to address glitches. Earlier, HDFC Bank had said that it had drawn up short-, medium-, and long-term action plans to address digital banking outages for which it was pulled up by the RBI. The bank is moving from traditional core banking to a new architecture that involves ‘hollowing out’ the core. This will enable a lot of functions to be done outside the core banking architecture. Operations too are being moved to the cloud so that things can be scaled up on demand during festivals and big sale days. The bank has added 50 people as part of its ‘enterprise factory’ and ‘digital factory’ initiatives that aim to address glitches in the present system and parallelly build a new system for the future. HDFC Bank chief information officer Ramesh Lakshminarayanan said, “The core banking system was monolithic, they had one database where transactions took place. There was very little you could do to replicate them. Payments, balances, statements — everything sits on a monolithic architecture.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-to-move-to-new-digital-bank-it-platform/articleshow/83622752.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Delhi||Law faculty exam paper repeated, DU orders probe||New Delhi: First-year students of Delhi University’s Faculty of Law who sat for their Law of Contract paper on June 16 were shocked to find that they had got the same question paper as their seniors did for their exam in December 2020. The exam was held through online open book examination format. The law faculty has formed a committee to investigate the lapse. One of the candidates, Shwet Kumar Singh, said that he was shocked to see the same set of questions and was unsure if he had to attempt the paper. He had seen last year’s paper while preparing for his exam. “When second-year students gave the exam in December, they had received the exact same six questions. I and my classmates first thought that it was a mistake and complained about it but we got no answers from anyone,” said Singh. Vivek Raj, a second-year student, said that “those who appeared for their improvement exam in December would have never thought that the paper would be repeated. The 100-mark question paper had six questions, of which students had to attempt four. All the questions were exactly the same. The only difference was the date of the exam.” He added, “These types of things can ruin the reputation of the law faculty.” DS Rawat, dean of exams, said that “DU only issues the guidelines and the exam question papers are set by the law faculty. And during the pandemic, they said that they would also be conducting the exams. When we got to know about the incident, we spoke to them and asked them to investigate. The law faculty stated that they have constituted a committee and will investigate the matter.” Dean of law faculty Vandana did not respond to calls and messages by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/law-faculty-exam-paper-repeated-du-orders-probe/articleshow/83617846.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The smallest state now has 6.5% of its entire population vaccinated and over 8% of the eligible 12 lakh (18+) population vaccinated. Another 4.9 lakh citizens — 32% of the entire population—have been partially vaccinated. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said the health department is trying to cover the entire eligible population at the earliest. “All our doctors in the periphery are holding sessions to tackle vaccine hesitancy,” he said. Another doctor said it is the non-vaccinated population that is likely to be badly hit by the third wave. “Vaccination must be completed as soon as possible. The virus will now no longer find a host in the older population that have been largely vaccinated and will move to the younger population that is unprotected by vaccination and by contamination,” the doctor said. “The children and 18-44 who haven’t been vaccinated are expected to fall in the high risk groups for the next wave,” the doctor added. After walk-in vaccinations opened for 18- 44 population on Sunday, as many as 14,000 to 18,000 persons are being vaccinated each day. The health department has been administering only one vaccine the Covishield vaccine through all its health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-1-lakh-citizens-get-both-doses/articleshow/83620090.cms||---

After postponing the project for nine years, the state home department will include citizens services with an e-wallet, a digital locker, aadhaar services, real time traffic offence alerts within commissionerate jurisdiction and access to common services portal on its mobile app. “Right now we have the basic architecture ready and have invited proposals from leading mobile app developers for a stable app. There is a huge database,” said an official in the state home department. The official added that even traffic e-challans will be integrated into the home department mobile app. “Citizens will be alerted of any real time traffic offence, and payments of fines can be made via the app,” the official said. Basic services like details of jurisdiction of police stations with phone numbers, including those of the railway police, missing persons, unidentified dead bodies, missing property, missing passport reports will be available to citizens. All services of the home department will be geo-referenced. According to the proposal, citizens will require their aadhaar cards for authentication and even payments being made using the mobile app. The back-end data base will largely be composed of the eGujCop portal for within government and government to citizen services. The mobile app will also have a special dashboard for officers of various home department wings for real time monitoring.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/soon-all-state-home-department-services-will-be-just-an-app-away/articleshow/83617767.cms||---

Bandra’s Holy Family Hospital, where he was admitted from Taloja prison after an HC order on May 28, said in its report Swamy had been shifted to ICU as his health condition was “critical” and he required further “intensive care” in view of “serious medical issues”. Advocate Sandesh Patil of NIA, which is probing the case, sought an earlier date for the next hearing when the HC asked if it could be deferred by four weeks. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar posted the matter for July 3.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Private hospitals submit data on vaccine stocks, requirement||MUMBAI: Private hospitals have to reveal their vaccine stocks to the BrihanMumbai municipal corporation (BMC) and try to exhaust them at the earliest by vaccinating more, civic chief IS Chahal said on Thursday. “We will be issuing orders asking private hospitals to show us how much stock they have. We also want them to exhaust it swiftly since the idea is to cover as many citizens as possible at the earliest,” Chahal told TOI. While the public immunisation centres have been hit by erratic supply of doses, several private hospitals are sitting on stocks that can last more than a month. First two weeks of June have seen an average 71,268 and 72,544 daily vaccinations in the city respectively, the highest since the drive started in January. However, three of the every four doses administered have been in the private sector. Of 9.36lakh vaccinations in June, 7.21lakh (78%) has been in the private sector. The commissioner said BMC has started collating the requirement of each private hospital as the new procurement system, which kicks in from June 21, may not allow private hospitals to deal with vaccine manufacturers directly. A file has been circulated where hospitals are putting in their tentative requirements, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Until June 7, the central government was purchasing 50% of the supply to distribute it among states for free to vaccinate those above 45. Changing this policy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the Centre will now purchase 75% of the Covid vaccine supply. The remaining 25% will be bought by the private sector under the Centre’s supervision. “We will be collecting their vaccine requirements and passing it on to the state. The state will share the consolidated figure with the Centre,” Chahal added. Private hospitals told TOI that there is confusion about vaccine procurement. While bigger hospital chains have got 9lakh-10lakh doses stock, smaller standalone ones have struggled to get even 10,000. COO Dr V Ravishankar of Lilavati Hospital said they are hoping to get better clarity in the next few days. The hospital recently received 50,000 doses and is vaccinating 1,300-1,500 daily. Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja Hospital, said they have received stocks of 1lakh doses only once. “We are waiting for directions... For now, we have handed our vaccine requirement to BMC,” he said. On Thursday, 75,867 people got vaccinated, taking the overall count of Mumbaikars who have got at least one dose to 41.87lakh. Kakani said the supply of vaccines to BMC has marginally improved in the last few days. "We have recently got around 1lakh doses. We are hoping to get higher doses from June 21," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-private-hosps-submit-data-on-vax-stocks-requirement/articleshow/83617872.cms||Sumitra Debroy

More than 100 writers responded to the Akademi’s publication, Shabdshrushti, in which Khakhar’s poem was criticized in an anonymous essay titled ‘No, this is not a poem, it is misuse of a poem for anarchy’. “The anonymous writer makes outrageous statements such as ‘the poem is bad though poet is good’, and through such insinuations attempts to issue indirect threat to Gujarati writers indicating in an authoritative voice what they should write or not write. This is reminiscent of the time of The Emergency. This is akin to beating the pen with a hammer, a death knell for the freedom of expression of Gujarati writers,” the statement reads. The authors and poets took exception to the word ‘literary Naxals’ in the essay. They said, “In an attempt to gag the glorious literary tradition of Gujarat, this government-controlled institution which functions in a democratic structure, has opened the floodgates for a practice that goes against the interests of the people and has a dangerous fascist tendency we condemn.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/akademi-under-fire-for-essay-on-khakhars-poem/articleshow/83617816.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Water logs out vaccination drive in some Kolkata centres||KOLKATA: Entrance to several vaccination centres in the city got flooded due to heavy overnight rain leading to disruption in inoculation in many centres. Approach roads to several vaccination centres were also waterlogged due to the rain making it difficult for people to access the centres. In several centres, people are required to register between 9 am and 10 am to receive the vaccine but the inclement weather and waterlogging led to a dip in such registrations. As a result, in many centres, vaccination started in the second half when the rain stopped and water receded in many parts of the city. The vaccination centre in Madan Mohan Burman Street where super spreaders are being vaccinated was flooded and so were all the roads leading to it. “In the morning, there was so much water on Central Avenue that it was impossible for the staff to come to the centre. Water had entered the ground floor of the vaccination centre. We opened the centre in the afternoon, but vaccination was not done. But throughout the day only a few people came to enquire because the road was waterlogged through out,” said an official at the centre. Water accumulated in most city neighbourhoods making it difficult for people to commute to office and other destinations. “On Thursday morning, however, there was hardly anybody to get registered,” said a health official at Collin Institute on Lenin Sarani where immunisation is being carried out. “It was raining heavily and roads were waterlogged. Every day we have at least 100 people in the queue. On Thursday, there were hardly 25 people waiting,” said a security personnel at the centre. At School of Tropical Medicine and Medical College Kolkata, super spreaders and government staff are being vaccinated. The stretch of Central Avenue between Jorasanko and BB Ganguly Street is the most affected when it rains heavily. “Around 50% people turned up for vaccination,” said an official. Very few people were there at the College Square centre. “Though there was no water inside the entire place was badly waterlogged throughout the day,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/water-logs-out-vaccination-drive-in-some-kol-centres/articleshow/83615587.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Nagpur||Cos won’t supply vaccine directly, queries referred to Maharashtra government: Private hospitals||NAGPUR: Private hospitals that are planning to start paid vaccination in the city say vaccine manufacturers have asked them to procure the stock directly from the state government. Some private hospitals had sought to directly purchase vaccines from the manufacturers, Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech (BB), before the the central government changed its policy over vaccination of all above 18 earlier this month. As the government has now decided to provide free vaccination to 18+ age group too at its Covid vaccination centres (CVC), the manufacturers have referred the procurement queries to the state government. The Centre has also tasked states to monitor charges being levied by private hospitals. In Mumbai, all stocks procured by private hospitals will be routed through the BMC. Amid this, each district has been asked to submit its total vaccine requirement to the public health department. Local authorities have sought the requirement from private hospitals too. Administrative and top health officials are tight-lipped as to why requirement of private hospitals is being sought. On Wednesday and Thursday, some private hospitals in the city said they have received mails from SII and BB informing them that they won't be able to supply stock directly. As per the revised guidelines, 18+ age group would start getting vaccine free of cost at all government centres. It has left private hospitals clueless about charges they can recover from beneficiaries. If the government supplies directly, the hospitals will only be able to charge Rs150 service fee as per the new guidelines. The central government has notified Rs780, Rs1,410 and Rs1,145 for each dose of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V, respectively, at private hospitals. Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) convenor Dr Anup Marar told TOI earlier they had approached SII to procure one lakh doses on behalf of all small hospitals as the company was clearing only major orders. “But it seems the manufacturers will now supply through government only. Almost all hospital and clinics are ready and eager to join hands with government to commence vaccination as we feel vaccinating all is the only key to control this pandemic,” he said. Dr Marar added that a day back NMC collected details about anticipated number of doses required by all registered CVCs. “However, we are not clear about modalities of distribution. If NMC is providing free vaccines from their own stock received through Union government, we will be only charging Rs150 per dose. But if they pass on the cost to private hospitals, then we will be charging cost of vaccine plus Rs150,” he said. Muncipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said they were yet to receive any guidelines regarding the June 21 drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cos-wont-supply-vax-directly-queries-referred-to-state-govt-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/83617864.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Delhi||No RFID tag, no entry in Delhi from July 1||NEW DELHI: No commercial vehicles without valid Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags or enough recharge will be permitted to enter Delhi from July 1. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) issued a public notice on Thursday, specifying that RFID systems have been installed at all 124 toll plazas in the city for collection of toll tax and environment compensation charges (ECC). The notice stated: “In compliance with the Supreme Court order of October 2020 and Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) directions, the task of installing RFID systems at 124 entry points of the city has been completed. We have also arranged for online collection of toll tax and ECC from specified commercial vehicles entering the city. So vehicles entering without tags or sufficient recharge won’t be allowed entry from July 1.” The toll tax collection agency has so far issued 5,02323 RFID tags to the owners and drivers of specified commercial vehicles. However, many specified commercial vehicles entering Delhi borders are not equipped with RFID tags or don’t have sufficient balance leading to violation of the SC order, said a senior SDMC official. “We are planning to pursue the CAQM to give us authority to penalise the defaulters for not adhering to the norms by charging double tax amount from July 1,” said the official. The new RFID tags can be obtained or tags can be recharged at 39 points of sale system set up at Delhi entry points. SDMC has also launched an app to guide the process to be followed for recharging tags online. “One has to download the app MCD-Toll from the Google Play Store, enter the mobile number and recharge their tag using debit/credit card or net banking. Same procedure can be followed while recharging tag at www.ecctagsdmc.com,” said the official. “However, vehicle owners will need to visit the POS sites with their vehicles to get an RDIF tag issued because no tags will be issued without physical examination of vehicles.” Until now, RFID tags were mandatory at 13 toll points, but the system slowed down during the pandemic. Several internal reports had indicated that after the creation of the RFID-compliant border points, the commercial vehicle traffic had drastically reduced due to diversion to other border entry points, thereby rendering the gains pointless. “A new concessionaire took over the toll tax collection system after long legal dispute with old concessionaire. Also, due to pandemic, collection was slow down due to limited movement of commercial vehicles. We had also received reports of cash collection of toll tax at certain points. However, if this continues, then strict action would be taken,” said an SDMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-rfid-tag-no-entry-in-delhi-from-july-1/articleshow/83617854.cms||Vibha Sharma

He also announced 6-laning of Nagpur-Butibori Road, and promised to make Nagpur the greenest city in the next five years. Speaking at the inauguration of Butibori flyover on Thursday, he said the administration would soon start work on Rs 2,200 crore project to rejuvenate and beautify the iconic river. He added though people usually didn’t believe what he says, he has proved them wrong every time, and the same would happen with the historic river in the next two to three years. “I’ve always fulfilled what I promised. I’ve asked the civic administration to beautify the riverfront so that it could become a tourist spot where people can visit in the evening and feast on their favourite snacks like panipuri and bhelpuri, besides boating. There would be ports at regular intervals where water taxis would ferry passengers. It would be a new way for commuting from one place to another just like buses and metro.” Announcing that Nagpur-Butibori Road would be expanded to six lanes, the city MP called on public representatives in Butibori to prepare a blueprint for the town's development. “It should have a stadium and playgrounds to promote sporting activities. Prepare a development scheme and I will support you in all endeavours. During the BJP-led government, then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and ex-guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule had allotted Rs50 crore for development of sports in Nagpur. I’ve planned to make 107 sporting stadiums in the city so over a lakh youths would play in the evenings.” Declaring he would adopt Butibori Municipal Council for development as a model, he called for a good hospital, with all facilities, including ventilators. “The public representatives should make efforts to make Butibori the number one municipal council in Maharashtra, and I will help you in this. I’ve decided to make Nagpur the greenest city in the next five years, now it’s your responsibility to keep Butibori green by reducing air and sound pollution, and planting trees.” Stressing on the need for the flyover at Butibori, he pointed out that the junction often witnessed severe traffic congestion and had led to over 100 deaths in accidents. “There was a court stay on the project. I appreciate the efforts of MLA Sameer Meghe, who was behind it since 2014, and removed the stay. The flyover will facilitate smooth traffic at the junction. It’s very aesthetically designed and I’ve told NHAI officials to undertake landscaping under it to prevent encroachment. I’ve also told them to paint it with a product made from cow dung by Khadi Gramodyog, which is available at half the price of regular paint.” Adding that he would be inaugurating beautification work of 4.45km flyover in front of Liberty Talkies on Friday, the minister said it was painted by students of Chitrakala Mahavidyalaya. “If you rope in artists from Butibori for similar work on this new flyover, it would provide them employment. Local talent must be promoted, please bring a proposal to me in this regard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-reiterates-dream-to-take-boat-down-nag-river-make-nagpur-greenest-city/articleshow/83613105.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

According to DGCA data, 21.1 lakh people flew within the country last month. Domestic flights were suspended for two months from March 25 to May 24, 2020, during last year’s lockdown. June and July, 2020, had seen 19.8 lakh and just over 21 lakh domestic flyers, respectively, according to DGCA data. When the first wave ebbed and daily Covid cases started falling, domestic flights saw an increase in the number of passengers — with the peak of 78 lakh in a month being touched twice in February and March, 2021. As the second wave unleashed its ferocity, the numbers first dropped to 57 lakh in April and then crashed to 21.1 lakh in May, 2021 — a figure seen in the first two months after domestic flights’ resumption on May 25, 2020. Last month saw only 8,000 more domestic flyers than July 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/air-travel-in-may-drops-to-july-20-levels/articleshow/83622754.cms||---
---||Delhi||2 more lakes to come up in Dwarka: Delhi minister Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Pappankalan lake area in Dwarka will be turned into a three-lake complex spread over 25 acres. The water-holding capacity of the newly created lake will be doubled from 10MGD to 20 MGD while two new lakes of 50MGD capacity are to be set up in its vicinity, said water minister Satyendar Jain. Jain visited Pappankalan sewage treatment plant (STP), Dwarka water treatment plant (WTP) and the supplementary drain near Rithala STP on Thursday. At the Dwarka WTP, Jain instructed the officials concerned to increase the production capacity of the plant from 50 MGD to 70 MGD. “A lake over an area of 10 acres will be constructed inside the Dwarka plant to increase groundwater levels,” the minister said. He said, “Various water augmentation options have been discussed with the officials to increase the production by 20 MGD. Additionally, a lake in 10 acres of area will be constructed inside the water treatment plant to increase groundwater levels.” The inspection ended near the supplementary drain near Rithala STP. Jain said, “The irrigation and flood control department has constructed a low-cost weir to divert untreated sewage of the drain into STP. This will increase the natural treatment of wastewater in any running drain and reduce pollutant load flowing into the river. Similar weir systems will be replicated all over Delhi.” The Pappankalan lake project is going to be used as a model to create new artificial lakes near STPs, a senior official said. “The water for this lake is being sourced from Pappankalan STP, which is the most advanced sewage treatment plant being run by water utility. The water from the treatment plant is made to pass through a tertiary filter and nutrient filter. The quality of water is much better than the standard limit of BOD: TSS 10:10. The level of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) is around 5-6 units,” the official added. Another official said that in future, the possibility of groundwater extraction could also be explored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-more-lakes-to-come-up-in-dwarka-jain/articleshow/83617980.cms||---
---||Nagpur||After reports of malpractices, NU will not give colleges exam work||NAGPUR: Following reports of malpractices, Nagpur University has decided not to hand over examination work to colleges. Now, from summer 2021 exams, all papers would be conducted by NU only, said officials. Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable said, after receiving complaints, the administration has decided to take back the exam work from colleges to ensure transparency. Bumper results in the summer-2020 exam were also a reason behind it. “We’re conducting all papers of summer-2021 exams commencing from June 29. Because of the pandemic last year, NU had decided to share the burden of final year exams, so that results could be declared quickly,” he told TOI. Since the last two exams – summer and winter-2020, the university had entrusted colleges with holding exams for courses where student numbers were very less. The move was taken due to inordinate delay on account of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, where the government forced all universities to conduct online papers for ensuring the safety of examinees. In summer exams last year, NU asked colleges to conduct papers of failed students. It turned out to be a lottery for them as a majority managed to clear the online exams. Even those failing from the last seven to eight years managed to clear the papers with flying colours, which surprised everyone. In winter exams, NU had allowed colleges to hold postgraduate exams, besides those for repeaters and external students. Recently, Gondia-based Kirsan Mission’s College of Management hogged the limelight after its teacher allegedly asked money from students to clear them in MBA exams conducted by the college. TOI had reported in detail about it on May 30. NU officials claimed that all colleges indirectly helped their students in all possible ways to clear the exams. “The students were already provided PDFs of multiple choice question (MCQ) papers with their answers by the teachers themselves on their WhatsApp. They are usually given 50 questions and told to prepare from them. The same teachers then set the question paper where the same questions are repeated. A majority of them would clear the subjects.” A senior NU official disclosed that after summer-2020 exams, where 99% of students managed to clear their papers, they received many calls from former students, who had left education midway as they failed to clear the subjects in multiple attempts. All of them wanted to resume their education to get their degrees and diplomas, considering the guarantee of passing the exams. “Unlike NU’s proctoring software, the exams conducted by the colleges through Google forms didn’t have anything to catch the examinees using unfair means. It’s all a farce and even the government knows it, but all are helpless” he said. Why NU took away exams from colleges: Key points * In summer-2020, NU handed over final year repeaters exams to colleges due to pandemic * A majority of them cleared papers with flying colours * In winter-2020, NU entrusted colleges with PG, repeater & external students’ exams * Complaints of malpractices received by NU, but it couldn’t act due to lack of proof * Gondia college students complained about a teacher asking money to clear their papers * BOEE then took the decision to conduct all exams through NU to ensure transparency||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-reports-of-malpractices-nu-will-not-give-colleges-exam-work/articleshow/83630898.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Chandigarh||Haryana’s farm policies in line with Centre’s: Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar||CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday claimed that the state’s farmers friendly policies were on the lines of three central government’s agriculture laws which are being opposed by farmers. He claimed that contrary to the apprehensions of farmers, grain markets and mandis are operating as usual and MSP is being given. Maintaining that farmers should understand that there is no harm in three farm laws, he said, “We have been advising them to try them for two years or some time so that one can understand if, at all, there is an issue.” Khattar even referred to the Meri Fasal Mera Byora scheme, saying it “is being accepted widely in Haryana but farmers are opposing it in Punjab”. Calling for water conservation measures, he referred to his government’s Mera Pani Meri Virasat Yojana, under which farmers have been called upon to cultivate alternative crops in place of paddy. The area under paddy cultivation came down by 94,000 acres after the government started this scheme, he said. This year, a target of two lakh acres has been set, he stated. Khattar said an incentive of Rs 4,000 per acre will be given for the cultivation of pulses and oilseeds in place of millet. The production of millet is increasing in the state, so this time the government has decided that farmers who grow pulses and oilseeds in place of it will be given an incentive of Rs 4,000 per acre, he said. He also referred to the Lal Dora Mukt Gaon scheme, saying Haryana started it and Centre took it to other states as Svamitva Yojana. A scheme has also been started to give ownership rights to people who have been in possession of shops and houses of municipalities running on rent or lease or license fee for more than 20 years, he said. A plan has been made for integrated development of Panchkula and efforts are being made to bring the township at par with Mohali in terms of development. Drone Corporation for aerial surveys Khattar said his government has formed a Drone Corporation of Haryana, to help departments get aerial surveys done to check the law and order situation, forests, agriculture and other activities. Under the programme, 100 drones will be procured in the first phase and an equal number in the next phase. 4 new departments Four new departments have been formed for better administration, he said. These include citizen resources information department to give a concrete shape to Parivar Pehchan Patra; housing for all department to fulfil the PM’s vision; foreign cooperation department to attract foreign investment, travel and aid Haryanvi diaspora; and a MSME department to promote small industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryanas-farm-policies-in-line-with-centres-khattar/articleshow/83620147.cms||---

An advertisement has been issued inviting applications from 900-1,000 MBBS, ayurveda and homeopathy doctors. In addition, the civic body is also looking at 50-70 specialists. The BMC has invited eligible candidates to apply by June 23 via email but has not scheduled their interviews. Dr Mohan Joshi, dean, Sion Hospital, said they are creating a database. “A list of these doctors who are willing to work with the BMC will be prepared. We can deploy them to our jumbo centres as and when cases rise and more manpower is needed,” said Joshi. BMC is expecting four new jumbo Covid centres, one each at Bhandup (Crompton Greaves), Somaiya grounds, Mahalaxmi Racecourse and Malad (Raheja Grounds), to be ready soon. While the advertisement mentions requirement as three months, the term can be extended based on the need, said Joshi. The candidates have been asked to mention their addresses, to classify the database based on requirements in the eastern and western suburbs. Among the specialists, the BMC has invited applications for 15 senior medical advisers, intensivists, 10 anaesthetists, three nephrologists, a cardiologist and a neurologist for a salary of Rs 1.5-2 lakh a month. The salaries offered to the contractual doctors are in line with what BMC paid last year – Rs 80,000 (for MBBS), Rs 60,000 (ayurveda) and Rs 50,000 (for homeopaths). Nurses are offered Rs 30,000 per month. The BMC had invited applications from doctors even last year at the peak of the first wave. The three BMC hospitals–Sion, KEM and Nair–have over 3,000 doctors and interns put on duty since the outbreak in March last year. This included the SMOs (specialty medical officers) who complete bond service after their postgraduate exam; they were also deputed on Covid duty. The doctors were also working at centres like BKC and Seven Hills Hospital, said a representative of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doctors-and-nurses-a-thousand-each-to-be-hired-by-civic-body/articleshow/83617940.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Nagpur||Nagpur city police sets quick complaint redressal system in motion||NAGPUR: City police chief Amitesh Kumar, along with his team, heard grievances of around 115 persons at an open complaint redressal camp held on Thursday. The top cop set an example before the police station in-charges and their supervisory level officers about dealing with complaints sympathetically within the framework of law. The camp was held at Alankar Sabhagruh in Police Line Takli (headquarters). The CP also issued two key instructions. First, the cyber cell must undertake drive to file FIR in case of unregistered complaints and initiate investigations. Secondly, the police station officers must refrain from inviting anyone having crime record or shady past for any programmes, which may attract action too. The grievances included a woman’s complaint about domestic violence and sexual exploitation by close relatives, a senior citizen seeking help after being driven out of home by son, a plea from man who had lost money in online transactions and a father whose teenager daughter has eloped. Kumar was supportive in most cases but repeatedly reminded complainants and senior officers that cops will not undertake exercises like forcibly vacating premises, recovering dues and intervening in civil disputes. While the top cop twice admitted mistake of cops in cases when genuine complaints were turned down, he also berated one of the complainants for using foul language while narrating his plight. Kumar, who later said that his efforts would make his officers introspect, also assured personal attention to a man to help him trace his teenage daughter. He also put two officers to work after a man voiced concern over illegal activities at Gaddigodam. The CP said he was hopeful grievances will be redressed even when people approach the police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-sets-quick-complaint-redressal-system-in-motion/articleshow/83617931.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Dalit labourers accuse panchayat member’s husband of ill treating woman worker||BATHINDA: Labourer organisation Mazdoor Mukti Morcha (MMM) has accused the panchayat members of Matti village in Mansa of illtreating a dalit woman labourer. The labourers claim that the matter pertained to fixing the rates of paddy transplantation. The labourers had started working in the fields over agreement for Rs 3,500 per acre but they are being paid only Rs 2,900 per acre after work. A meeting was arranged at the residence of village sarpanch on Wednesday where, MMM claimed, a panchayat member’s husband maltreated labourer Gurpreet Kaur. The labourers have demanded registration of case against panchayat member’ husband and sarpanch. The sarpanch has denied the allegations. This year, there were not that many disputes over rates of transplanting paddy compared with previous year as migrant labourer in adequate numbers returned to Punjab and more area is being covered under direct seeded rice (DSR). MMM state president Bhagwant Samao told TOI that at panchayat meeting on Wednesday at the residence of village sarpanch Sukhwinder Kaur, Gora Singh, husband of one of panchayat members, maltreated Gurpreet Kaur. “We want action against the guilty or we will hold protest,” he added. Matti sarpanch Sukhwinder Kaur when contacted agreed that issue was raised over rate and a meeting was held at her residence. “But no one maltreated any labourer woman,” she added. She said after the local labourers did not agree to work for Rs 2,900 per acre, migrant labourers were engaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dalit-labourers-accuse-panchayat-members-husband-of-ill-treating-woman-worker/articleshow/83620192.cms||---
---||Nagpur||16% of country’s forest fire alerts in Maharashtra alone||NAGPUR: Of the over 3.86 lakh fire alerts issued nationally by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) based on satellite data, Maharashtra recorded 60,851 alerts, which comes to 16% of the total forest fire incidents in the country this year. As per FSI data, there were record number of fires between January and May as compared to the last two years. Most of these fires reported in April and May were man-made and ignited for mahua and tendu leaves collection. “Despite the state government spending crores of rupees on combating forest fires by way of procuring equipment like blowers and paying wages for drawing fire lines and appointing watchers, this year number of fires was far more compared to last two years,” admit forest officials. APCCF (protection) Pravin Chavan admits there were 60,851 fire alerts this season as compared to 45,681 in 2019 and over 23,000 in 2020. Over 36,000 hectare forest area was devastated this year. Last year, due to intermittent rains in summer and lockdown, over 20,000 hectare area was destroyed in ground fires. “The fire situation this year was similar to 2019 when an equal area was burnt. We have sought factual reports on reasons for increasing fire incidents and what steps were taken to control them,” said Chavan. Senior forest officials admit the actual area destroyed in ground fires is always concealed and only one-fourth of it is shown on record fearing action. Even if 36,000 hectare is officially shown as burned this year, it may be over one lakh hectares. However, APCCF Chavan says, “At least 60% fires are in non-forest areas, which are not recorded by us. Dry weather condition is one of the reasons for fires, but it is also true that most of the fires are witnessed during mahua flower and tendu collection season.” In Gadchiroli alone, which has high stakes for tendu patta and mahua collection, there were 19,615 alerts. This was followed by Thane (7,708), Kolhapur (7,045), Chandrapur (6,378), Nagpur (5,282) & Aurangabad (3,029). These were the five forest circles that reported maximum fires this year. As per rules, if forest fires occur in the area having tendu units then chief conservator (CCF) or deputy conservator (DyCF) is empowered to cancel these units, but despite so many incidents not a single tendu unit has been cancelled in the state. Take for example Bramhapuri division in Chandrapur circle, which reported 4,520 fire alerts, but there was no action against any field staff nor any tendu unit was cancelled. APCCF (non-timber forest produce) TK Choubey said, “The tender conditions are very clear, and territorial officials are empowered to take action against the tendu contractors if fires occur in units. As of now, there is no report of any cancellation of tendu units due to fire.” Suresh Chopne, president, Green Planet Society, says, according to various studies, the annual losses from forest fires in India have been moderately estimated at Rs450-500 crore. This estimate does not include the loss suffered in the form of biodiversity, nutrient and soil moisture, and other intangible benefits. There was 10 times increase in forest fires in sanctuaries and national parks under Nagpur (Wildlife East). In 2020, there were 159 alerts only in Tadoba (core & buffer), Navegaon-Nagzira, Allapalli, and Pench but this year the number was 1,491 with Alapalli (776) and Pench (507). With 441 fire alerts, Melghat wildlife consisting of six divisions was at the lowest. FIRE ALERTS Circles 2020 | 2021 Gadchiroli 7,300 | 19,615 Thane 4,587 | 7,708 Kolhapur 4,917 | 7,045 Chandrapur 1,020 | 6,378 Nagpur 651 | 5,282 Aurangabad 335 | 3,029 Pune 1,947 | 1,391 Yavatmal 361 | 2,722 Wildlife (East) 159 | 1,491 Melghat 110 | 441||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/16-of-countrys-forest-fire-alerts-in-maha-alone/articleshow/83613184.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

She plans to visit her sons as well as attend a medical emergency in July. However, the recent travel ban by the US has forced her at home. TOI on Wednesday spoke to few people whose family members are settled in the US. “We had visited her prior to Covid when cases had started dipping in January and February. She was planning to visit us in July. Now, due to the restrictions, it is not clear whether she can come. Let’s hope there are some relaxations before July,” Chander Singh Bhandari, son of Pushpa Kumari, told TOI from New York. Similarly Shweta Kaushik, a homemaker settled at Pennsylvania, is expecting a child by mid-July. She is hoping that her mother based at Jalore will come. “We got her tickets booked in Feburary and urged her to get vaccinated. But it is not clear whether she would be allowed to fly by first week of July. We need her at the time of delivery,” said Himanshu Kaushik, Shweta’s husband, who works as a financial consultant in a US-based company. Prem Bhandari, a social activist who had played an instrumental role in getting relaxation in Visa travel restrictions for OCI card holders said, “It is not just about fellow Rajasthanis. Since I am settled in the US for more than 34 years, I know parents visit from India bring cheers their families settled in the United States. I would request President of the United States and their embassy and also the Indian government to give some relaxations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-who-booked-tickets-to-us-are-in-a-fix/articleshow/83617920.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Another heavy spell predicted in 48 hours, break likely on Sunday||KOLKATA: An overnight deluge, caused by a cyclonic circulation, left Kolkata drenched and waterlogged on Thursday morning even as the Met office predicted another heavy spell of rain within the next 48 hours. Warning that the wet spell could continue till Saturday, weathermen said the city might receive 70 mm of rainfall between Friday and Saturday. A brief respite from showers has been predicted on Sunday but the rain may resume on Monday. While the city received 144mm of rain in 24 hours till 8.30am on Thursday, the figure was 5.8mm in the next seven hours making it the second wettest June day in Kolkata in six years. The last time Kolkata had received such a pounding in June was in 2018, when it had rained 162mm, soon after the onset of monsoon on June 26. After a relatively dry and cloudy Wednesday, a cyclonic circulation, which had formed on Wednesday, settled over Gangetic Bengal. It moved very little, leading to heavy showers that triggered a continuous, nightlong downpour across Kolkata and the neighbouring south Bengal districts. It started late on Wednesday evening, got heavier as the night progressed and eventually turned into a relentless deluge that flooded most parts of the city. The circulation was aided by a “land trough” that stretched from Punjab to north Bay of Bengal. By the time the city woke up on Thursday morning, extensive areas in south, central and north Kolkata had gone under water. Other than the usual waterlogging-prone areas, such as Amherst Street, Thanthania, Chittaranjan Avenue and Sukeas Street, south Kolkata, too, suffered badly on Thursday, when most arterial roads remained under ankle-deep water. Areas like Taratala, Jadavpur, Southern Avenue, parts of Ballygunge, Alipore, Chetla, New Alipore and Mukundapur got waterlogged. The civic authorities pressed multiple pumps into service and managed to drain out the water in most areas by early afternoon. It helped that though it kept drizzling through Thursday, there was no heavy shower. Most south Bengal districts, including Kolkata, West Midnapore and Jhargram, recived moderate rain during the day. “As the circulation hasn’t moved significantly, more rain is likely. It is aided by the land trough and the presence of moisture, which is flowing into the region from the sea. So, we expect another heavy spell either on Friday or Saturday. Kolkata may receive another 70mm of rain over the next 48 hours,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. He added that Sunday might remain dry, barring a few light spells of rain, but showers would resume on Monday. “As the circulation persists, rain will continue. The intensity may go down early next week,” Das added. Western districts of the state—Birbhum, Bankura and Purulia—also received heavy rain on Thursday. The Met office predicted heavy rain in north Bengal on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/another-heavy-spell-predicted-in-48-hrs-break-likely-on-sunday/articleshow/83618005.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Mumbai||Ambani security scare: Ex-encounter cop 'Pradeep Sharma was at conspiracy meetings’||MUMBAI: The NIA team probing the planting of explosives in a vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the subsequent murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran arrested retired police inspector and encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, whom the alleged killers spoke to before and after the crime. Sharma, who was holidaying with his family at Aamby Valley in Lonavla, was picked up early Thursday morning and brought to NIA’s office. Two others, Satish Tirupati Mothkuri alias Tanni alias Vicky Baba (40) and Manish Vasant Soni (46), were arrested from Malad. With this, the number of persons arrested in the case is 10. Special NIA judge Prashant Sitre remanded the three in police custody till June 28. The role of a senior police officer, who reportedly extended logistics support, is being ascertained. The NIA prosecutor told the court Sharma’s role has now surfaced, hence they have arrested him. Sharma is also accused of procuring gelatin sticks from a Thane businessman who is his friend. ‘Sharma was at conspiracy meetings’An NIA team accompanied by CRPF personnel reached retired cop Pradeep Sharma’s house and office, located at different spots in J B Nagar, Andheri, and carried out searches for over six hours. The NIA claims to have recovered some cash, documents and illegal arms and ammunition. Sharma was earlier arrested in 2009 in the alleged fake encounter of Chhota Rajan aide Lakhan Bhaiya in 2006. In 2013 he was acquitted. Special NIA public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves told court they want to ascertain the deep-rooted conspiracy in the case. The court rejected his request to disallow the media inside the court as it was a sensitive case. According to NIA, on March 4, dismissed policemen Sachin Waze and Sunil Mane handed over Mansukh Hiran to four accused --Santosh Shellar, Anand Jadhav, Satish and Soni at Hotel Hill View at Ghodbunder Road in Thane. The four took him in a Tavera car, smothered him to death and dumped his body in the creek at the behest of Waze and Sharma. Shellar and Jadhav, both Malad residents arrested last Saturday, have also shown the place where they dumped Hiran’s body, NIA claimed. The killers spoke to Waze and Sharma before and after the crime, NIA said. Gonsalves said the key accused need to be confronted with each other, without which investigations cannot be completed. “There are other people also involved, hence we want 14 days’ police custody.” The vehicle laden with explosives was found on February 25, and Hi-ran’s body was found in a Mum-bra creek on March 5. NIA sources said Sharma is accused of attending conspiracy meetings held at police headquarters on March 2 and 4 between him and Waze and two other officers. Another meeting took place at Sharma’s office in Andheri, where Mane is believed to have handed over a SIM card to be used in the crime. After Hiran’s murder, one SIM card was active up to the point of Sharma’s house at J B Nagar, NIA said. All the accused were in touch with Sharma before and after the crime. Judge Sitre asked NIA officials why they didn’t arrest Sharma if they had unearthed a conspiracy when they arrested inspector Sunil Mane. On the judge’s demand, NIA SP Vikram Khalate showed him the case diary. Gonsalves told court, “We had information about Sharma’s role but then he was just a suspect and we were collecting evidence. He is an ex-police officer who knows how to dodge the investigating agency. He is a tough nut to crack and he initially misled the agency. We have got traces of DNA samples collected from the Tavera which belonged to Jadhav. A lot of money has been distributed to the accused by Waze and Sharma, which needs to be ascertained. There are a few more people involved... to be arrested.” Sharma’s lawyer Sudeep Pas-bola argued there was no material evidence to link his client’s role in the case and said he has been cooperating with the agency. Sharma sought permission to speak and told court, “I am not involved in the crime. I have been made a scapegoat in the fight between two lobbies in the police department. I don’t know these two people who have been arrested along with me. If I was involved, why would I be sleeping in my house, I would have run away. I only know Santosh Shellar as he has been my informant for12 years.” Earlier, NIA arrested four other cops: Waze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane and former constable Vinayak Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-arrests-ex-encounter-cop-in-antilia-hiran-murder-case/articleshow/83621802.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Jaipur||Centre’s Covid plan for orphans defective: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday termed the Centre's welfare measures for children orphaned by Covid “defective” and demanded that they be revised as they did not provide immediate relief. He claimed the Centre did not announce any scheme to help widows whose husbands succumbed to the disease. The chief minister said the state government was working on a incentive scheme for panchayats which excel in vaccination. People throng a vaccination centre at Gandhi Nagar club in Jaipur.The state government has made elaborate preparations for vaccination. If adequate supply of vaccine is ensured by the Centre, the target of vaccination remaining people of the prescribed age group can be achieved in the next two months, said Gehlot while speaking during a video conference on Covid vaccination drive in the villages. On May 29, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a number of welfare measures, including providing financial assistance, to children who lost their parents to Covid. According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), fixed deposits will be opened in the names of such children and the PM-CARES fund will contribute through a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each of them. This corpus will be used to give the beneficiaries a monthly stipend from 18 years of age for the next five years. On reaching the age of 23, they will get the corpus amount as one lump-sum for personal and professional use. Gehlot said the Centre's package did not provide immediate relief, which was of utmost importance, to children who lost their parents and support system. “The package of the government of India is defective. The government will provide financial help after a child reaches the age of 18. Who knows who will be where after 18 years? Package means instant help,” he said. He added that he would speak to Modi about the scheme. The chief minister also alleged that the Centre did not announce any measures to help women who lost their husbands to Covid . On the other hand, the Rajasthan government provided immediate relief of Rs 1 lakh to children orphaned and women widowed by the pandemic apart from monthly financial assistance, he said. In addition to this, children would get Rs 2,500 per month till the age of 18 and Rs 5 lakh once they attain the age of 18 while widows would get a monthly social security pension of Rs 1,500. During the conference, Gehlot said the campaign of vaccine wastage against the government was unfortunate. “Such an unfortunate campaign was run at a time when the public was suffering. It is wrong that vaccines were wasted. Our target is to ensure zero wastage of vaccines,” he said. He said nobody knows what turn Covid virus will take with experts talking of a third wave. He said vaccination was the only effective remedy to prevent Covid. UDH Minister Shanti Dhariwal in his address attacked the centre. He said the Central government ignored warnings of a second wave of Covid. Besides he said 'mentally retarded politicians' took full advantage of Election Commission's exemption' during elections and big rallies were taken out. Kumbh mela was another facotr which led to the second wave. Now people of the country says "mai hu tho mumkin hai, thum hai to mushkil hai." Secretary medical and health Siddarth Mahajan gave a presentation on the vaccination drive and Covid situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centres-covid-package-for-orphans-defective-no-package-for-widows-gehlot/articleshow/83617942.cms||---

Deputy Commissioner of Police (North), Paris Deshmukh said that teams have been sent to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and other cities to track down manufacturers and suppliers of fake remdesivirs. “We had sent samples for the lab examination. The lab report found vials were not remdesivirs. As part of further investigation, we dispatched teams to different parts of the country,” he said. The police last month had conducted multiple raids across the city following complaints of remdesivirs being sold through black-marketers. The investigation led to the arrest of several accused including pharmaceutical dealers and medical professionals. An FIR in the same case was registered by the Kotwali police station. According to Deshmukh, the vials did not have any requisite packaging details mentionig the names and locations of the manufacturers. “This evoked suspicion about none of these remdesivirs sold at such a high price did not have mandatory markings on them. We consulted drug controllers who said that it was very likely that vials were spurious. We then sample for lab examination which confirmed our suspicion,” he said. The police suspect that the accused was part of some bigger racket that produced and delivered fake remdesivirs to black-marketing gangs. “After the lab report’s findings, we are now in the process of adding additional cases against all the accused of selling fake drugs,” Deshmukh said, adding that the investigation in the case is currently underway. During the second spell of the Covid-19, remdesivir vials were short in supply for several days. These led to several gangs selling vials at very high prices, special police teams then conduct decoy operations and arrest accused from multiple locations including Murlipur, Kotwali, and Faridabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fake-remdesivir-case-gang-sold-900-vials-in-city/articleshow/83617973.cms||---

Each age-specific kit will have drugs that are usually given to Covid patients and instructions to administer them. The initiative was flagged off by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday and the stock is likely to reach Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad in the next few days, officials said. In a letter issued to all districts on Wednesday, state additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad, had said that medicines have been sent for four age groups — up to one year, 1-5 years, 5-12 years and 12-18 years — and the drugs would be distributed through monitoring committees. About 50 lakh kits have been prepared by the state government and each of those contain drugs to treat fever and related ailments, ORS sachets and multivitamins. Medical experts and paediatricians have been consulted to prepare them, officials said. Children between 12 and 18 years will be given medicines that are usually administered to adults. Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr NK Gupta said: “We are hopeful that the kits will reach us in the next couple of days. Along with medicines, there will be instructions on how to administer them.” He added that the kits are being distributed ahead of a possible third Covid wave. Each district has been directed to organise an inaugural event for the drive on June 26. In Noida, officials said, the stock is likely to reach by next week but there is no information about the quantity. “The medicines will be in the form of syrup for younger children and tablets for older ones,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, CMO, Gautam Budh Nagar.Ghaziabad has 161 monitoring committees in rural areas and 286 in urban areas and they will distribute the age-specific kits in each household. In April and May this year, kits containing medicines that are usually given to Covid patients were distributed in some parts of the district.According to officials, 86,000 kits were distributed in both rural and urban areas till May 31 through monitoring committees, rapid response teams (RRTs), staff deputed at Covid testing centres (private and government), urban primary health centres and community health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/noida-gzb-to-get-medical-kits-for-children-below-18-yrs/articleshow/83625835.cms||Snehil Sinha

If this is not corruption then what is?” Singh asked. “BJP leaders should apologise to the crores of Hindus of the country and the world,” Singh said, demanding strict punishment for those involved in the alleged corruption and recovery of the balance amount. Recently the nameplate at the AAP MP’s house was defaced. “My family members are being threatened, I am being attacked. I want to tell crores of Ram devotees not to be misguided. Their reality has now come to the fore,” Singh added.

As on Thursday, the total number of recovered cases stood at 9,37,481 while the casualty count is 8,875. However, while the recovery rate continues to improve, the state government is now focusing more on vaccination drives anticipating the third wave in the coming months. At a time when the state government is making efforts to accelerate the inoculation drive, a private hospital here is also providing doses of Russia’s Sputnik-V vaccines. “We got Sputnik-V vaccines for people in our hospital. We have proper facilities to store the vaccines and to maintain the cold chain at minus 80°C. One can get the second dose of Sputnik-V after 28 days of receiving the first. The cost of one dose is Rs 1,140. The vaccine is effective against the Delta variant,” said Dr Sandeep Bakshi, chancellor, JNU. Besides, the state government has received 1 lakh doses of Covaxin procured for beneficiaries aged between 18 years and 44 years. Moreover, the state government is receiving 8 lakh doses on Friday, out of which 4 lakh are procured by the state government, while the rest will be supplied by the Centre. “As on Thursday, we had around 5 lakh doses left. On Friday, we are getting another 8 lakh doses. Vaccination remained affected on Thursday as it was a routine immunisation day in which pregnant women and children are administered vaccines under national vaccination programme,” said a health department official. The health department officials appealed to people to get vaccinated before the third wave. Currently, the state is reporting more than 200 Covid infections daily. Districts which reported new cases are: Jaipur (42), Alwar (27), Churu (19), Jodhpur (18), Udaipur (13), Sriganganagar (10), Bikaner(9), Tonk (8), Hanumangarh (8), Jhunjhunu (7), Pratapgarh (6), Sirohi (5), Dausa (4), Sikar (4), Bhilwara (4), Jhalawar (4), Kota (3), Dholpur (3), Banswara (3), Bharatpur (2), Pali (2), Baran (1), Sawai Madhopur (1), Bundi (1) and Chittorgarh (1).

They are meeting agriculture experts, environmentalists and farmers who are already into diverse or organic farming, asking them to share their experiences and experiments on social media. According to the group they are reaching out to non-resident Punjabis to set the example on their lands. “Our target is to make at least 500 acre free of paddy this year. It may be a very small area, but we want that this would set examples in diversification. Though our idea is that cultivation of paddy should be reduced but for instant reduction in over exploitation of water we are also amplifying the alternate techniques of paddy cultivation,” said Mandhir Singh and Parmjeet Singh, who started the jal chetna yatra on June 7. The activists have already met environmentalist Padma Sri awardee Baba Sewa Singh of Khadoor Sahib, and Padma Bhusan awardee Dr Inderjeet Kaur Pingalwara at Amritsar, who has been promoting organic farming at the farm of Pingalwara near Amritsar and have shared their experiences. The activists, who have met some farmers already into organic farming or have successfully diversified into other crops, have amplified their techniques and experiences through social media. For instance, farmer Raja Singh of Dosanjh village near Moga, who could not go to Canada despite getting visa due to illness of his father and started diversified farming on his family land, told that in between each row of sugarcane he was having different crop including vegetables and in one acre he was having 15 different produces in a year. He and his wife Jasleen process all their produces and sell. “We are specially urging non-resident Punjabis, including some gurdwara committees abroad, to come forward and set examples on their lands back home. Quite a few of them have already taken up the call to diversify and also to have forests on chunks of their lands,” they said. “Punjab needs comprehensive approach and solution. Only reduction in paddy cultivation is not enough and we need to increase the green cover in the state, which is just at 6% now. On July 28, we are planning to have a conference in which we intend to have agriculture experts, environmentalists and successful farmers so that comprehensive solutions can be brought before the people,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/reduce-paddy-save-pb-campaign-propagates-permaculture-to-save-groundwater/articleshow/83620220.cms||IP Singh

The ministers themselves have begun making surprise visits in the districts to evaluate if the administration has taken up all the welfare schemes and programmes of the government. Apart from speaking to officials and holding meetings, the ministers are also making an on the ground assessment. With the CM having made it clear that he will check if Palle Pragathi and Pattana Pragathi programmes are being implemented well, the ministers too are getting data from the villages. Transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar, who made a surprise visit to a village on Thursday, suspended B Ramkey, panchayat secretary of Manchukonda village in Raghunathapalem mandal, as his work was not up to the mark. “Do your work. If you do well you will be rewarded,” he advised the officials. In Warangal, panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao held a meeting with officials, while energy minister G Jagadish Reddy also had a pep-talk with officials in Nalgonda. “The data that is being given and the reality in the ground is different. This has to be rectified. There can be no laxity,” Dayakar Rao told the officials. He said the CM himself had made it clear that he was giving officials time to complete all pending works at the village level before he begins his visit to the districts to check for himself on what has been achieved. KCR will begin his tours to the districts from June 20 beginning with a visit to Siddipet. He will inaugurate the new collectorate complex comprising government departments and also the police commissionerate office which have been constructed at a cost of Rs 81 crore. On June 21, the chief minister will tour Warangal where he will lay the foundation stone for a multi-speciality hospital in the place where the Warangal Central Jail used to be there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ministers-undertake-surprise-visits-ahead-of-cms-tours/articleshow/83618018.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Other teachers whose physical presence in schools is mandatory for online classes from Tuesday cannot board trains. Class IX and X teachers doing assessment for SSC are unable to reach schools as they do not fall in essential categories of persons allowed to board trains (TOI, June 5). Details of teachers and non-teaching staff carrying out assessment work that began on June 11 has been sought from schools. Deputy director (education), Mumbai, will be the coordinating officer for collecting information on such people. ‘Level 2’ passes will be sent to those eligible as an SMS link, which can be downloaded, said state education minister Varsha Gaikwad. Rajesh Pandya, vice-president, Teachers’ Democratic Forum, who had first raised the issue, said actual travel is likely to happen next week. “Teachers will not be able to complete assessment work by June 20, as required by the state,” said Pandya. Teachers from Palghar, Vasai-Virar, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and Navi Mumbai were unable to reach schools for assessment. The state had also decided to have mandatory 50% attendance of teachers in school and 100% lecturers in junior colleges. On Monday, teachers protested by travelling ticketless and paying fines.

---||Noida||Noida & Ghaziabad to get medical kits for children below 18 years||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: The state government has started distributing medical kits for children below 18 years among all 75 districts. Each age-specific kit will have drugs that are usually given to Covid patients and instructions to administer them. The initiative was flagged off by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday and the stock is likely to reach Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad in the next few days, officials said. In a letter issued to all districts on Wednesday, state additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad, had said that medicines have been sent for four age groups — up to one year, 1-5 years, 5-12 years and 12-18 years — and the drugs would be distributed through monitoring committees. About 50 lakh kits have been prepared by the state government and each of those contain drugs to treat fever and related ailments, ORS sachets and multivitamins. Medical experts and paediatricians have been consulted to prepare them, officials said. Children between 12 and 18 years will be given medicines that are usually administered to adults. Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr NK Gupta said: “We are hopeful that the kits will reach us in the next couple of days. Along with medicines, there will be instructions on how to administer them.” He added that the kits are being distributed ahead of a possible third Covid wave. Each district has been directed to organise an inaugural event for the drive on June 26. In Noida, officials said, the stock is likely to reach by next week but there is no information about the quantity. “The medicines will be in the form of syrup for younger children and tablets for older ones,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, CMO, Gautam Budh Nagar.Ghaziabad has 161 monitoring committees in rural areas and 286 in urban areas and they will distribute the age-specific kits in each household. In April and May this year, kits containing medicines that are usually given to Covid patients were distributed in some parts of the district.According to officials, 86,000 kits were distributed in both rural and urban areas till May 31 through monitoring committees, rapid response teams (RRTs), staff deputed at Covid testing centres (private and government), urban primary health centres and community health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-gzb-to-get-medical-kits-for-children-below-18-yrs/articleshow/83621797.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Business||Desi companies target Coke, Heineken||NEW DELHI: ‘Bottlegate’, which saw footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba remove Coke and Heineken bottles at Euro 2020 press conferences, led to domestic players such as Amul and Fevicol taking a jibe at the global brand through ads on social media. It also led to other brands being inadvertently pulled into the grand meme fest. While R S Sodhi, MD at Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) tweeted an ad with the Amul girl that said “Not bottling one’s feelings”, Pidilite the maker of adhesive brand Fevicol, put out a cheeky one with two bottles of Fevicol on a table that said, “Na bottle hategi, na valuation ghategi” (the bottles cannot be removed, nor the valuation will dip). Ronaldo’s action on Thursday not only caused a global storm among foot ball fans and the marketing community but also erased $4 billion from the Atlantaheadquartered beverage maker’s market value. “Ronaldo has set the cat among the pigeons. He has started an all-new movement I would dub ‘Brand De-endorsement’,” said Harish Bijoor, brand expert and founder at Harish Bijoor Consults. “A movement that resonates with his fans it seems. And therefore Euro 2020 has become an event where it all happens, one press conference after another. The stars are making a statement!” Homegrown water tank brand Vectus, too, joined the discussion with an ad of its tank and a football that said, “Gentle reminder to stay hydrated, always!” Several others such as MRF, PepsiCo, Lays potato chips, Vimal Pan Masala were tagged by social media users in various memes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/desi-companies-target-coke-heineken/articleshow/83622772.cms||John Sarkar

Following state government orders, outpatient departments (OPDs) and fever clinics have been reopened at all centres and some CHCs have also started taking in patients. Officials, however, claimed that space and staff shortage are the major concerns when it comes to increasing capacity.  There are five CHCs in Noida and four in Ghaziabad and each of them have 30 beds. All CHCs will be used as L1 facilities if required, officials said. Jewar CHC has been turned into a 70-bed unit with 70 oxygen concentrators and some other ICU equipment.  “There is also a plan to set up a 500 litre liquid medical oxygen plant and we are working on laying pipelines for that. From a non-functional centre, we made the place operational in two-three weeks,” said Dr Pawan Dayal, medical superintendent, CHC, Jewar. Noida’s Bhangel CHC is also being upgraded to a 100-bed facility. More than 70 cardboard beds with mattresses have been kept there and can be put to use within an hour, if needed. “All OPDs have also reopened,” said Dr Yatendra Singh, medical superintendent, CHC, Bhangel. In Ghaziabad, officials have been asked to increase the number of beds to 50 at all four CHCs in Loni, Muradnagar, Modinagar and Dasna. The number of beds in Bhojpur primary health centre would be doubled to 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/more-beds-infra-upgrade-at-local-health-centres/articleshow/83621812.cms||Snehil Sinha

---||Chandigarh||Short of specialists, Punjab to train doctors in critical care||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government is all set to train qualified doctors in critical care of patients to overcome the shortage of anaesthesiologists, who play a critical role in the management of infected patients, in line with a possible Covid-19 third wave in the coming months. The state government has been grappling with a shortage of anaesthesiologists and struggling to fill the vacant posts. About 100 anaesthetists are working in the government hospitals while about 120 posts are lying vacant. Punjab was hit hard by the second wave of infection, pushing the number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and patients requiring ventilator support to a record high. The health authorities had to scramble with the limited resources for treating the patients. The shortage of anaesthetists even forced the health department to give many life-saving ventilators to private hospitals that were lying unused in many districts. The officials maintain that they have been receiving a poor response to the walk-in interviews being conducted by the health department. After only three anaesthesiologists turned up at the recently held interview on June 5, another round of interview has been scheduled for June 19. Keeping in view the projected third wave, the government has decided to provide life-saving anaesthetic skills (LSAS) training to qualified MBBS doctors. As per the plan, selected doctors will be imparted training about necessary skills and competencies for handling cases requiring life-saving care at ICUs and Covid wards. They will be provided with working knowledge about ventilators, anaesthesia machine and safe delivery of anaesthesia. Principal secretary health Hussan Lal said the government has been making efforts to fill the vacant posts but has not received a good response so far. So, doctors will be given training at medical colleges in the state and PGIMER, Chandigarh. After completing the training course, they will be deployed at ICUs and Covid wards under the supervision of anaesthetists. "These specially trained doctors will ease the workload of anaesthetists," he said. As the existing workforce is overstretched due to limited resources, Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA) president Dr Gagandeep Singh, who is an anaesthesiologist, stated that though the planned move will ease their workload, it cannot be a permanent arrangement and asked the government to fill the vacant posts by making policy changes. "The planned move can only be a short-term arrangement during Covid times," he added. To address the issue of poor response from the advertised posts, Dr Gagandeep suggested that the government should allow MBBS doctors to do MD after completion of three years of service. RELIANCE ON PVT FACILITIES Due to limited resources, Punjab government is relying heavily on private health facilities for Level-III beds. There are 1,472 ICU beds with ventilators for critically ill patients of which 710 are in private hospitals while out of 1,262 ICU beds without ventilators, 1,102 are in private hospitals. Most of the Level-III beds in the government setups are in Patiala, Amritsar, and Faridkot where the government medical colleges are located.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/short-of-specialists-punjab-to-train-docs-in-critical-care/articleshow/83620261.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai, 4 other dists have 57% of state’s mucor cases||Five districts — Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Mumbai and Nashik — have collectively recorded 57% of the state’s Covid-associated mucormycosis cases, shows the latest health department report (see box). “Of the state’s 7,359 patients diagnosed with the invasive fungal infection, these five districts have recorded 4,238 patients in their urban and rural parts. That means 57% of the total cases are from these five districts, which were also among the worst-hit places during the Covid second surge,” said a senior state health official. The Covid-associated mucormycosis cases have been registered across the state’s 35 districts. Some of the districts with the lowest number of cases are Buldhana (3), Palghar (9), Ratnagiri (10), Raigad (15), Washim (15), Hingoli (16) and Parbhani (18). In view of the rising cases, the Maharashtra government has advised screening of a sizable chunk of hospitalised Covid patients for mucormycosis immediately before or after discharge. They include patients who had steroid and oxygen therapy, and stayed in intensive care units (ICU) for more than seven days. Admitted patients with high blood sugar (above 200 mg/dL or glycated haemoglobin [HbA1C] above 8) are also advised to be screened for the invasive fungal infection that primarily affects the sinuses. Patients given the anti-rheumatic drug tocilizumab are also included on the list of factors for early screening. The nationwide shortage of key anti-mucormycosis drug amphotericin B has badly affected the patients. “Pune district received only 12,838 vials of amphotericin B between May 20 and June 10 despite registering the highest number of Covid associated mucormyosis cases in the state,” said health activist Abhijit More. The actual requirement — considering each patient needs a minimum of six vials every day for a minimum 21-day course — is 1.1 lakh vials for the 878 patients currently on treatment in the district. “How can doctors treat the patients when the key drug is not available in adequate numbers?” More asked. ENT surgeon Samir Joshi of the state-run B J Medical College and Sassoon hospital said, “Amphotericin B, either conventional or liposomal, plays a pivotal role in arresting the spread of the deep-seated mucormycosis. Surgeries are only helpful in clearing the tissues which are already damaged.” The Union government’s National Joint Task Force recently recommended that the injection posaconazole could be used in cases of non-availability of amphotericin B or in those patients having severe intolerance to amphotericin B in view of the nationwide shortage of the key drug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-other-dists-have-57-of-states-mucor-cases/articleshow/83618102.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The high tide at 4am, when it was still raining steadily, only compounded matters as the lockgates had to be shut for four hours during which, storm water could not be flushed out into the river. The Mominpur-Ekbalpore belt near Alipore, Kalighat, Behala, Chetla and Ballygunge were the worst hit, recording between 145mm and 187mm or rainfall. As the water level rose during the high tide, those living near Tolly’s Nullah were shifted to shelters in primary school buildings. The rainfall records at KMC drainage pumping stations reflected the clear south-north divide. North Kolkata, areas such as Maniktala, Belgachhia and Ultadanga, received between 85mm and 91mm rain. The flooded streets threw traffic out of gear. According to Kolkata traffic police, 84 roads were waterlogged. Traffic movement on at least half of those stretches remained slow till around 3pm. The waterlogging ranged from being ankle deep to knee deep. Wherever there was knee-deep water, like Elgin Road and parts of Lake Gardens and Behala, there were reports of breakdowns of cars and bikes. Even those travelling to hospitals of Mukundapur had great trouble wading through the water off EM Bypass. Police had to divert traffic from both the main road and tertiary roads. Service roads near Kalikapur and the stretches on the Anwar Shah Ropad connector were also inundated. Behala and Chetla Kalighat remained some of the worst waterlogging pockets in south Kolkata. According to a KMC sewerage and drainage department official, while the clogged Bagjola outfall canal was to blame for storm water reaching Behala households, particularly in Parnasree, Barisha, Thakurpukur, Vidyasagar Palli, Shakuntala Park and Silpara areas, a high tide made the waterlogging scene worse for residents of Kalighat and Chetla. Rajendra Nath Das, a resident of Vidyasagar Pally, couldn’t even drive his car out for an official assignment. “The water has touched the bonnet of my car. Given that the local canal is blocked, we can only pray for this rain to stop. Most of the areas of Barisha-Silpara-Thakurpukur has become a pond,” said Das, a driver of an IT major. Tinku Ghosh of Kailash Ghosh Road at Silpara found it difficult to stay in his house with the drain water entering his ground-floor apartment. “We cannot run our water pump for home use as it has already gone under water,” he added. According to Kolkata Police, irate Behala residents took to roads and demonstrated against severe waterlogging in some places. But the KMC sewerage and drainage department officials couldn’t utter a word of hope for the Behala residents as more rain had been predicted for the next two days. KMC Board of Administrators (BoA) chairman Firhad Hakim squarely blamed two former state irrigation ministers for not taking the initiative of dredging the outfall canals that led to clogging, resulting in severe flooding in Behala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/north-south-divide-mominpore-got-187mm-of-rain-r-g-kar-65mm/articleshow/83618146.cms||Saikat Ray

The committee estimated that with the settling of disputes related to properties of Schedule IX, X of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014, Rs 2,000 crore can be mobilised. The cabinet sub-committee meeting, held under the leadership of finance minister T Harish Rao, also decided to submit a preliminary report on the fund mobilisation plan to the chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. The finance department officials have given a detailed fund mobilisation plan, which will be discussed with the stakeholders like government corporations later. Sources privy to the developments said there is no timeline to submit the report and the land auction process will be completed in three phases. It was also discussed that first, land auction of land parcels of HMDA including Kokapet will fetch the best price in the country. The first phase of tendering for auction of these land parcels will be completed next month, and after a gap of two months, next phase of land auction will begin. It was also suggested to look for land parcels feasible for sale at the district headquarters. In the state budget for 2021- 22, land auction was estimated to generate Rs 20,000 crore. A detailed GO on funds mobilisation has clearly stated to identify the land parcels feasible for sale everywhere. With the auction of HMDA land parcels, at least Rs 2,000 crore income is expected to be generated. Meanwhile, another cabinet sub-committee meeting was held under leadership of finance minister T Harish Rao on health infrastructure. The meeting involved discussion on the measures to improve healthcare facilities for the poor in the state. The sub-committee had a detailed discussion on facilities presently available in the government hospitals. The committee also looked at the special healthcare provisions that can be given to the poor in government hospitals. This is a preliminary meeting, which will be followed up by further meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-to-mobilise-rs-11k-crore-through-land-auction-plan/articleshow/83618092.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||Right of passage for pedestrians, smoother traffic may be reality soon in heart of Delhi||NEW DELHI: Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Marg in central Delhi will now be converted into a heritage corridor. The Public Works Department’s redesign provides for continuous movement of pedestrians and non-motorised vehicles, reduced traffic speed, better footpaths and proper signals and bollards. A PWD official said that the proposed plan encouraged mobility and aimed at easing traffic congestion on the stretch. It will also improve accessibility and interchangeability from and to public transport while discouraging loading and unloading activities during prohibited hours. The design provides continuous movement for pedestrians and NMVs. Besides better footways (paving, landscaping, lighting and street furniture) to encourage use of dedicated pedestrian paths, a fully segregated non-motor path will also be created along the main road. Key structures like Red Fort, Old Delhi Railway Station, Church Mission and Delhi District Library are included in the redesign. According to officials, the new plan, when implemented, will provide parking facilities and pick and drop points in the area. The stretch will also be made free of encroachments. These changes are likely to have an environmental impact due to reduced air and noise pollution. The carriageway width transitions from six lanes between Hanuman Mandir and Church Mission Road to four lanes towards the west of the Church Mission Road-SP Mukherjee Marg intersection.  Up to this intersection, the traffic is predominantly transit-oriented and destined for Old Delhi Railway Station. After this point, the traffic becomes trade-oriented.  The difference in capacity of SP Mukherjee Marg on either side of Church Mission Road are primarily due to land use, vehicle mix and traffic requirements. If the width of the motorised carriageway is kept uniform at four lanes in each section, irrespective of traffic levels, the road congestion, especially at peak hours, will be high in a few critical sections and the benefits from the redesign will be nullified. Substantial traffic volumes are observed on SP Mukherjee Marg throughout the day. The peak hour vehicular traffic along different sections varies from 1,414 passenger car units to 2,602 PCUs in the morning and between 1,463 PCUs and 4,053 PCUs in the evening. The share of non-motorised cycles, cycle rickshaws and hand and animal-drawn vehicles is significant throughout the corridor. The planners observed that by segregating the pedestrians, non-motorised vehicles and vehicular traffic, the capacity of either carriageway increases and the level of service of the vehicular traffic improves considerably. An official said that the capacity of the pedestrian paths can be enhanced by maintaining a good quality surface, strictly controlling the encroachments and obstacles created by service points and maintaining a smooth flow of traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/right-of-passage-for-pedestrians-smoother-traffic-may-be-reality-soon-in-heart-of-delhi/articleshow/83618156.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

State Congress president Selja was first to stand up and claim: “These claims are hollow. For the entire tenure, so far, this government courted controversies and hurt farmers the most. Instead of sharing details with the officers and media, why don’t the CM and the DyCM go out and tell the public.” Former CM Bhupinder Hooda said whatever had happened during the BJP-JJP government’s tenure should not have happened. He claimed that under this government, Haryana had become number one in crime, unemployment, scams, and debt. He said: “It’s a good pastime for the most unpopular state government ever to tom-tom its achievements.” Just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s has used “andolanjivi” to describe those who lived off agitations, Congress communication head Randeep Surjewala called Khattar a “vigyapanjivi” (one living off advertisements). Independent MLA Balraj Kundu went to the extent of calling the government “anti-people, anti-farmer, anti-student, and anti-women”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/congs-ridicules-hry-govts-achievment-list/articleshow/83620305.cms||---

The meeting was chaired by Rajiv Gupta, additional chief secretary (ACS), industry & mines department. Gupta said, “We called representatives of all major industry associations for the first time after the second wave of the pandemic. We heard all their issues and have categorised them under three heads of long-term policy issues, short-term organizational issues with government bodies like GPCB, GIDC, industries commissioner, MSME commissioner, etc and individual industry-related issues.” He added that it has been decided after the meeting to set up a task force of top officials from GPCB, GIDC, industry commissionerate and MSME commissionerate. “Instead of industry approaching these authorities, senior officials will visit all districts and meet the industry associations to resolve issues. The task force will resolve all bona fide issues of the industries within a fixed time limit,” he said. Natubhai Patel, president, GCCI, said, “We had a meeting with the ACS, industry & mines department, and key officials of the department and made representations about various issues in the post-corona situation.” Patel added, “In all, 23 associations under the umbrella of GCCI met government officials. We raised several policy and administrative issues faced by industry. Rajiv Gupta promised to resolve all issues proactively by sending teams of officials to various regions. It was a positive gesture and will help industry explain their real problems in the field to government officials.” He added that industry has sought an extension of all benefits under the Atmanirbhar scheme till March 31, 2023 instead of March 31, 2022. “We also requested the government to resolve key law interpretation issues related to the environment and GPCB,” Patel said. Shailesh Patwari, industrialist and former GCCI president, said,“It was a positive meeting with all line departments led by Rajiv Gupta. He has assured us to resolve all major issues in very short time and communicate our issues at the highest level in government. We raised several issues like dual policies of GPCB and GIDC. Undue problems are faced by industries due to misinterpretation of various laws and rules. We requested to resolve issues related to GPCB, GIDC and MSME.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/industry-wants-pending-issues-redressed/articleshow/83618268.cms||Kapil Dave

The areas now have only one active case each. The areas that fall under G-South ward were once listed among areas with most cases and Worli Koliwada was marked as Mumbai’s first containment zone in April 2020. BMC officials said there has been no new case in Worli Koliwada and Jijamata Nagar since June 7. So far, the areas have reported 1,099 cases and the densely populated enclaves have seen 70 deaths; 1,027 patients have recovered. “Now, we have vacant beds at NSCI Dome and Poddar Hospital, which were turned into Covid-19 centres. In fact, people from other wards have also been treated at NSCI Dome. Our focus is now to push vaccination in Worli Koliwada and Jijamata Nagar. This is probably the only ward that does not have a full-fledged hospital but we treated many patients,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner, G-South ward. State tourism minister and Worli MLA said, “At zero cases for more than a week, it shows what the resolve of citizens and civic authorities can do.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-new-covid-case-in-worli-koliwada-for-10-days-says-bmc/articleshow/83618194.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Five orphans rendered fatherless again||AHMEDABAD: This tale is too strange even for coincidence. In a tragic turn of events, five siblings who had lost both parents before the pandemic were orphaned for a second time when their paternal uncle, who fought hard in court to get their custody so he could give them a better life, succumbed to Covid-19 just months after getting their legal guardianship in December 2020. The sad turn of events was revealed in the Gujarat high court which took hearing of the case on Wednesday. In March this year, the court had directed the authorities to explore the possibility of extending the benefits of ‘Palak Mata Pita Yojana’ (a foster parents scheme) to resolve financial issues that the uncle may face in bringing up the children. The case involves Kanti Salat, who had lately settled in Khedbrahma town of Sabarkantha district. Salat lost his brother, Rukesh, three years ago. Rukesh’s widow also passed just before the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020. The couple’s five children, between four and 15 years old, were taken in by their maternal uncles in Valsad. The family belongs to a nomadic tribe and shifted from Pune to Valsad when the children lost their mother. In December 2020, Salat moved the Gujarat high court claiming custody of his brother's children. His advocate Vaibhav Sheth submitted that the maternal uncles were not looking after the children well and they were also deprived of formal education for more than a year. The advocate submitted that Salat was well settled and earning a decent income from selling blankets. He did not have a child of his own and could look after the five children in a better manner by ensuring good education and shelter for them. The HC, after hearing the case, passed an interim order granting custody of the children to Salat. It observed that it was in the kids’ interest as Salat could ensure education for them. In January, the HC ordered to shift the children from Valsad to Khedbrahma where Salat was staying. The court also asked the government authorities concerned to ensure the children got the benefits of welfare schemes. In March, the court asked the authorities to find a boarding facility in a nearby town for the children. It also ordered to explore the possibility of extending the benefits of ‘Palak Mata Pita Yojana’ so that Salat and the children do not have financial issues. With the resumption of regular hearings in court, the HC took up the case on Wednesday only to find that the children’s guardian, Salat, had contracted Covid in the deadly second wave and succumbed at the end of April. Sheth said he has now filed an application to bring Salat’s heir, his widow, on record as the petitioner to retain custody of the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/five-orphans-rendered-fatherless-again/articleshow/83618228.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Amritsar||Additional subsidy on fertiliser prices a one-time support: SKM||BATHINDA: Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has accused the Central government of limiting subsidy on complex fertilisers for only 2021-22 Kharif season. On Thursday, Kisan Morcha members pointed out that the cabinet committee on economic affairs has stated that the subsidy extended to offset increased complex fertiliser costs is one-time support, applicable only to Kharif season 2021. They said this meant that farmers could be asked to bear increased cost from the forthcoming seasons. “Costs on various fronts, including diesel prices, are constantly shooting up, while prices in the market continue to be low and exploitative for farmers. As for MSP, the government is not ready to adopt the Swaminathan Commission formula, or without improving cost estimations as per Ramesh Chand Committee report. It is also not stepping forward to fulfill one of the key demands of the current struggle - that of legal guarantee of remunerative MSP for all farmers,” morcha members alleged. They added that the BJP, which fought and won elections on this plank, should fulfill the demand of protesting farmers on remunerative MSP unconditionally and immediately. SKM accused Haryana government of continuing with its “anti-farmer behaviour.” They alleged that a farmer from Kandela village in Jind district, Bijender Singh, has been missing from the January 26 tractor parade and the administration was not responding to his family’s repeated appeals to locate him. They alleged that the administration had also “unjustly slapped cases” on farmers protesting against the foundation stone-laying for a BJP office in Jhajjar and demanded that these be withdrawn unconditionally and immediately. SKM further demanded withdrawal of the case registered against protesting farmers for opposing Congress MP Manish Tewari at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. Govt implicating protesters: SKM SKM leaders accused the BJP-JJP government in Haryana of trying to discredit the farmers’ movement using alleged suicide by a local village resident. They said that Mukesh, a resident of Kasar village, Bahadurgarh, was burned to death around a petrol pump near his village, close to Kisan Morcha tents at Tikri border on June 16. He succumbed to his injuries. Morcha leaders said that the FIR named a person identified as Krishna, as accused and he has been arrested. They alleged that the FIR also insinuates that protesting farmers burned him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/addl-subsidy-on-fertiliser-prices-a-one-time-support-skm/articleshow/83629394.cms||---

In Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh, and Gandhinagar, 45% of the population has been covered by the first dose, while for the districts, the share was 25% of the population. However, 78% of all vaccination has taken place in districts and 22% in cities, show figures from the state health department. “Vaccination for the 18-44 years age group started from seven cities and three districts. It is one of the reasons the coverage is a bit more in urban areas. But in the next few months, the ratio will surely improve,” said a senior health department official. Against 33.3% coverage of the state’s population for the first dose, more than 10 districts had less than average coverage. So far, 9.5% of the state’s population (46.7 lakh) is fully vaccinated. In Ahmedabad, total vaccination figures crossed 25 lakh on Thursday with 20.5 lakh first doses and 4.5 lakh second doses. Of the total, healthcare workers accounted for 1.76 lakh, frontline workers 2.57 lakh, and the rest in the general population. Of the 26 lakh people between 18 and 44 years, 34% are covered, the AMC claimed, whereas for the 15.6 lakh people older than 45 years, coverage is 74%.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 2 days on, 4 held for kidnapping boy||CHANDIGARH: The UT police on Thursday claimed to have arrested four accused for kidnapping a 15-year-old boy for a ransom of Rs 50 lakh. Their fifth accomplice is on the run. Ankit was kidnapped near Manimajra railway crossing on the morning of June 15. UT SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “The arrested are Pankaj Gupta, 28, his brother Vishal, 24, residents of Kishangarh village, Rajat, 21, and Mukesh Kumar, 24, both of Ram Darbar. Their aide, Ajay Sharma, is at large. Pankaj, Vishal and Mukesh are recovery agents with a private bank.” Pankaj and Vishal knew the boy’s family as they are neighbours. “The accused were facing financial problems due to the lockdown, were addicted to online games like PUBG and Free Fire and finding it difficult to repay loans. Pankaj had also invested money in online schemes and suffered losses,” the SSP added. The mastermind of the kidnapping was Pankaj, who, along with four others, had hatched the plan. When Ankit was near Manimajra railway crossing, Ajay, Mukesh and Rajat reached there in a white Maruti Brezza car bearing fake Haryana registration number and pulled him in at gunpoint. Using Ankit’s cellphone, they made a call to his family, demanding Rs 50 lakh to release him. After committing the crime, they affixed the original number plate on the car. In the meantime, Pankaj and Vishal pretended to help Ankit’s family in tracing him. They accompanied his father, Churamani, to the police station and even talked to the kidnappers and told them that they were arranging the ransom amount. Simultaneously, they were apprising their accomplices of the goings-on. When police intensified their efforts, they got scared and fled after abandoning Ankit at Baltana, Zirakpur, the SSP said. The boy was recovered unharmed. After recording the statements of Ankit and his father, Manimara police had registered a case. During investigation, the police recreated the crime scene and scrutinized the footage of CCTVs in Baltana and Panchkula. They zeroed in on a Brezza car and traced its owner to Panchkula. The car owner, Rohit Sharma, told the cops that his brother Ajay, who lived in Baltana, was using the vehicle. Police then made the first arrest of Mukesh, who revealed the names of other accused. Cops said, “Pankaj and Vishal were very close to the boy’s family. They knew that Churamani’s daughter was getting married in October. Thinking that he had enough cash and gold jewellery, they went ahead with their plan.” The four were produced before a local court that sent them in four-day police remand. “They will be questioned about Ajay and the pistol and the knife used to kidnap the boy,” said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2-days-on-15-yr-olds-kidnapping-solved-with-arrest-of-4/articleshow/83615894.cms||Pawan Tiwari

The duo was also allegedly involved in gold smuggling. The accused were identified as Mohammad Rafiq and Mohammad Aameen. A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) card, Rs 770 cash, a mobile phone and six gold biscuits weighing 137 grams were recovered from them. Police are yet to recover the fake Aadhaar cards used by them. The police also suspect that the duo was involved in forging and supplying Indian residency documents for other illegal Rohingyas. The two men have been booked under IPC sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation) and 420 (cheating) and the Foreigners Act. Babloo Kumar, SSP ATS, told TOI that the duo will be produced in the court and police remand will be sought for them to uncover their nexus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-ats-arrests-two-rohingyas-in-aligarh/articleshow/83613394.cms||---

The Sinhagad Road police later arrested tempo driver Govind Singh (43) on the charge of rash and negligent driving causing death and injury. Sub-inspector Amol Kale told TOI, “The couple was heading towards Ambegaon, where they had recently bought a flat. Earlier in the day, they had gone to their old house in Kothrud for some work. The tempo was on its way to Satara. The couple was taken to a private hospital in Dhankawadi, where the woman was declared dead. We registered a case against the tempo driver on Tuesday and subsequently arrested Singh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-killed-after-tempo-rams-bike/articleshow/83618186.cms||---

---||Agra||Biker in Agra intentionally crushes two puppies under wheels, cops file case and launch hunt||AGRA: Police in Agra have filed an FIR and are trying to identify a motorcycle rider who allegedly crushed to death two puppies and fled, a brutal act which was caught on CCTV camera on June 14 night. The alleged incident took place in Agra's Sikandara area at 10:28pm. In the 2 minutes 49 seconds video, the rider can be seen passing through the road while the puppies were playing with their mother on the side. Within a few seconds, the man returned and crushed one of the puppies, killing him. “If that was not enough, the suspect was back in less than a minute and crushed another one to death. While there was enough space for his bike to pass, the rider appears to have driven over the puppies purposely,” says Anjali Yadav, 28, who lives in the colony and who had retrieved the videos after seeing the puppy’s blood soaked bodies. She later shared the video on WhatsApp group ‘Satyamev Jayate Pashu Seva’ asking for help to save the lives of the remaining four puppies. Yadav told TOI that on June 14 night, suddenly she heard loud barking by dogs. “When I came out of the house, I saw two puppies dead. With the help of my brother, I buried them in a field,” she said. Later, CCTV footage clearly showed that the person had intentionally killed them, she said. After seeing the video, a local resident, Vivek Raizada and PFA (People for Animals) manager in Agra, Ram Avtar Singh, contacted her and took the footage. Later, Singh and another animal lover, Karan Saxena, filed a complaint at Sikandra police station. “An FIR has been registered against an unidentified person for rash driving and under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, on the basis of a complaint filed by them,” police station in-charge Kamlesh Singh told TOI. He said efforts are on to trace the suspects.

---||Surat||Gujarat: Vaccine coverage in cities 80% higher than districts||AHMEDABAD: Analysis of vaccination figures from the state’s eight municipal corporations and 33 districts shows that vaccine coverage of eligible people (those older than 18 years) is about 80% higher in cities compared to the districts. In Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh, and Gandhinagar, 45% of the population has been covered by the first dose, while for the districts, the share was 25% of the population. However, 78% of all vaccination has taken place in districts and 22% in cities, show figures from the state health department. “Vaccination for the 18-44 years age group started from seven cities and three districts. It is one of the reasons the coverage is a bit more in urban areas. But in the next few months, the ratio will surely improve,” said a senior health department official. Against 33.3% coverage of the state’s population for the first dose, more than 10 districts had less than average coverage. So far, 9.5% of the state’s population (46.7 lakh) is fully vaccinated. In Ahmedabad, total vaccination figures crossed 25 lakh on Thursday with 20.5 lakh first doses and 4.5 lakh second doses. Of the total, healthcare workers accounted for 1.76 lakh, frontline workers 2.57 lakh, and the rest in the general population. Of the 26 lakh people between 18 and 44 years, 34% are covered, the AMC claimed, whereas for the 15.6 lakh people older than 45 years, coverage is 74%. Comparison of various zones reveal that western Ahmedabad had a higher percentage of vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vaccine-coverage-in-cities-80-higher-than-districts/articleshow/83623108.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Kolkata||Class X marks okay but XI a problem: Teachers||KOLKATA: CBSE schools were relieved to get the board notification on the formula to be followed by schools to compute the final scores for their Class XII candidate. Going by suggestions from schools, the candidates’ Class X board marks have been taken into consideration and 30% weightage has been given to it. However, the board has also kept a 30% weightage on Class XI marks, which has given rise to concerns among school heads as they feel students’ scores usually dip in Class XI before again picking up in Class XII. But the principals, whom CBSE had consulted before drafting the formula, said this was the best that could be done for objectivity. While the average student would gain, the ones in the 95%-plus bracket might suffer due to gain or loss of 3%-5% in the law of averages, they said. Most schools were happy the board had taken the Class X marks into consideration. Some schools also felt there were many subjects in Plus-II that had no co-relation with those of Class X and so, clarification needed to be sought on those. “It is a mammoth task now. We might need to seek clarification on subjects, like psychology, commerce, accountancy, mass media and fashion technology, which were not taught in Class X,” said Lakshmipat Singhania Academy director Meena Kak. But Birla High School principal Loveleen Saigal argued even if there were co-relational issues, a child’s basic knowledge could be assessed from Class X performance. Language, aptitude for science and maths can be gauged from Class X boards, she said. North Point Senior Secondary Boarding School director Rita Chatterjee, who has been in the CBSE system for 40 years, said about 20% students changed schools or boards in Plus-II. These children missed the social-emotional pool in the first year (XI) and their scores dipped, she said, adding including Class XI marks could be challenging for them. Asian International School Vijaylakshmi Kumar echoed her: “Some manage average to low marks in Class XI but there is a sharp rise in Class XII because of the hard work they put in later.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/x-marks-okay-but-xi-a-problem-teachers/articleshow/83618290.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Out of the 1,541 active patients, 1,080 patients are undergoing treatment in civic and private hospitals, while remaining 461 are under home isolation. The recovery rate of Covid patients has also increased from 94.90% to 98% during the last one month. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said there was spike in new cases in March and April, but it started declining since the beginning of May. Now, infectivity of the coronavirus has reduced that has also led to drop in the Covid positivity rate up to 2%. “The restrictions imposed by the state government and stricter implementation by the civic and district authorities have helped in curbing the spread of the pandemic,” Nagargoje said. The city reported an average of 99 cases per day in the first week of February. Moreover, the city had only 500 active cases at that time. But there was sudden rise in new cases per day thereafter. The cases started increasing from March and there was sudden spike in the month of April. In April, the city recorded an average of 3,000 new cases per day, while the number of active patients had increased to 28,000 cases till April 23. The recovery rate had also reduced to 83% in April. However, the curve flattened from the last week of April and there has been further drop in new cases. Now, the daily cases have reduced to average 100 cases per day, while the positivity rate has also reduced from 5% last week to 2% this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/84-drop-in-active-cases-in-nashik-city-over-past-month/articleshow/83610657.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Five-level lock-unlock system stays amid 3rd Covid wave fears||MUMBAI: A day after the state task force on Covid-19 warned that the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic could be just two to four weeks away, the state government said it would stick to the five-level unlock system that was introduced two weeks ago. State public health minister Rajesh Tope, confirming that the unlock process was here to stay, said district administrations have been told to ensure strict compliance to norms, especially after reports that crowds increased after restrictions were eased. The state and the city reported a dip in cases on Thursday. The state reported 9,830 new cases and 236 fatalities, taking the total caseload to 59.4 lakh and, with the addition of 400 old deaths, the death toll to 1,16,026. Mumbai reported 660 cases and 20 fatalities, taking the total cases to 7.17 lakh and the death toll to 15,247. Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, state relief and rehabilitation department, said that the five levels serve the dual purpose of unlocking and locking areas based on the positivity rate.“The success of this system will depend on how fast the administration reacts to an increase in numbers,” Gupta said. He said there was a possibility of reintroducing lockdowns in a graded manner, should the caseload increase during the third wave. “It must be realised that these levels are not cast in stone — if the government feels that the cases are rising in an alarming manner, it will react immediately and impose stricter measures,” Gupta said. A state official said that while the number of positive cases have been steadily on a decline, some of the smaller districts with limited infrastructure continue to have a high burden of active cases. Sindhudurg, for instance, has 656 active cases per lakh population, while Ratnagiri has 464 per lakh. Raigad has 175 active cases per lakh population, while Sangli and Satara have more than 300 and 400 cases, respectively. Mumbai and Thane have 148 and 127 active cases per lakh population, respectively. Dr Pramod Gavi, acting civic surgeon of Raigad, said the district was seeing over 600 cases daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-5-level-lock-unlock-system-stays-amid-3rd-wave-fears/articleshow/83625188.cms||---

The most common spots for overspeeding were Baner Road, Ganeshkhind Road, and the old Pune-Mumbai highway through Pimpri-Chinchwad, with 90% or more vehicles monitored driving above the prescribed speed limit of 40km/h. By contrast, the Pune-Bengaluru highway, which skirts the city, as well as the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, and which have a higher prescribed speed limit of 50 km/h, performing better in Parisar’s survey, with only 55% of vehicles overspeeding. The common over speeding offenders, according to Parisar, were two and four-wheelers. While Parisar found that the level of overspeeding during day and night was largely the same on Baner Road, the level was higher during the morning hours on old Mumbai-Pune highway, and the same was higher at night on Ganeshkhind Road. Other stretches of road in the city also performed poorly on the overspeeding front, with 80% or more vehicles over speeding on stretches like Pune-Nashik highway, the stretch between Aundh and Ravet, near the Aundh Chest hospital, and near Swargate flyover. Sinhagad Road performed slightly better, with around 67% of vehicles surveyed driving above the prescribed limits||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gross-overspeeding-on-major-pune-roadsparisar/articleshow/83618218.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

At the same time, it also suggested that the RBI could expand its balance sheet to ensure that a bigger spend does not push up interest cost. Citing a survey conducted by it, the lobby group said that 51% of the respondents expected an adverse impact on production and sales during the first quarter as company employees had been infected apart from raising medical costs, resulting in a squeeze on income. It assessed the overall GDP growth at 9.5% during the current financial year due to a strong recovery in the second half. Assuming three different fiscal scenarios with fiscal deficit of 7-8% of GDP, CII suggested that there was scope to provide further stimulus of around 1.3% of GDP. “Fiscal stimulus of Rs 3 lakh crore is required,” said new CII president T V Narendran, who is also Tata Steel MD. He recommended a significant ramping up of vaccination to at least 71.2 lakh shots average daily — more than twice current level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cii-seeks-rs-3-lakh-crore-stimulus-rbi-balance-sheet-expansion/articleshow/83622804.cms||---

In the last 10 days, the daily number of Covid cases in the city has hovered above 400, marking highest contribution in the district, which tops the chart with high positivity and oxygen bed occupancy rate. Of the 16 Covid Care Centres run by the KMC, 12 are equipped with oxygen cylinders. The total number of oxygen beds in these centres is 320, of which, only 14 were available by Thursday evening. A week ago, the oxygen bed vacancy in these centres was around 40. The DOT Centre Shivaji University have 10 oxygen beds vacant while the rest have only one to two beds free. The total number of vacant non-oxygen beds in these centres is 405. Deputy municipal commissioner Nikhil More said, “Most of these beds are occupied by patients from rural fringes. We have over 150 oxygen beds ready in two more centres which we have kept in spare. The cases in Kolhapur city are constant for last eight to 10 days. We are hoping to soon witness a declining trend.” There are over 1,600 patients in Kolhapur city undergoing treatment in home isolation. The centres at Kasba Bawda and Vichare Mal have been opened to shift these home isolated patients to avoid further spread of infection among their family members and neighbours. However, no home isolated patients have shifted to these centres so far. Apart from patients admitted to KMC’s centres, many are also undergoing treatment in private hospitals in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/only-14-o2-beds-vacant-at-kolhapur-civic-run-cccs/articleshow/83610723.cms||---

Our support to the dabbawalas is an endeavour of supporting the communities where we operate. We are working with United Way Mumbai to reach out and hope that this financial assistance will aid their resilience during these challenging times,” said Hitendra Dave, Interim CEO, HSBC India. Earlier this week, TOI had highlighted the plight of Mumbai’s dabbawalas, many of whom had lost their source of livelihood and returned to their villages. Looking for fresh ways to tackle their trade, the tiffin carriers were in for yet another change of not just dropping off lunch boxes at people’s homes but kicking off the next era with a “cloud kitchen”. Reacting to the relief assistance Ulhas Muke, President, Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust, said: “Since March 2020, dabbawalas services have come to a standstill for the first time in 130 years. HSBC India’s initiative will help us and our families cope with these very difficult times and provide a much-needed safety cover.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-dabbawalas-get-a-lifeline-with-rs-15-crore-relief-package/articleshow/83618339.cms||Mohua Das

We carried out tests and planned a surgery with a team of experts as we also had to ensure the infection from the earlier cage doesn’t damage nerves. If it didn’t go as planned, the patient could get paralyzed.” The team carried out the operation and replaced the older cage with new supports to her spine.

He was reacting to chief minister Pramod Sawant’s statement that the government does not plan to open the tourism sector till 100% population is vaccinated with the first dose. He said hotels that have opened so far have been following Covid-19 protocols. “When we held a meeting with the government earlier this week, we were told that once the case positivity goes below 5%, tourism will start. In a few days, it will. In view of protocols in place, the government should not wait till the entire population is vaccinated to open the tourism sector,” he said. He said the situation appears very grim for the industry, and it is not easy to sustain for long without business. Many more are likely to lose their jobs if there are further delays in opening the tourism sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/delay-in-opening-tourism-sector-will-cost-more-jobs/articleshow/83620468.cms||---

Police said speeding up of work is all the more important after relaxation of Covid restrictions and more vehicles and people coming out to the streets to attend to day-to-day work. Since private and government offices, hotels, shopping malls, and other establishments have now opened, it has led to an increase in vehicles on city roads, but the repair work is yet to be completed, police said. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame told TOI, “After visiting a few areas from where where traffic jam-like situation was reported in the last few days, it was found that many roads had been dug up for various purposes like laying of drainage pipelines, cables etc. Life in the city is returning to normalcy. Shops, offices, and other establishments have opened, and vehicular movement on city roads has increased tremendously in the last two weeks. There are chances of traffic jams/accidents due to the ongoing road work.” He said, “Work like laying of drainage pipelines or installing underground cables and others was taken up by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) after lockdown-like restrictions were imposed in the state in March this year. The work is going on in some areas.” “At the same time, owing to the rains, visibility of drivers has reduced drastically. If the roads are in good shape, there are fewer chances of accidents,” he said. “We have deployed more manpower at places where roads have been dug up to clear traffic, but it is a temporary solution. Thus, we urge the civic authorities to expedite work,” he said. A senior PMC officer said, “The civic body has decided to continue with the water supply work. We have made arrangements for special engineers who have been assigned the task of ensuring that digging work is carried out without causing any problems to locals or commuters. We are also trying to expedite the work,” The officer said “The civic administration has given instructions for digging roads in small patches of around 100 meters at a time so that obstacles are not created for traffic.

Sonal was operated on at a private hospital in Rajkot and was given a spinal cage near the base of her spine as a solution. “For the past few months, she had started reporting severe pain along with puss where the cage was installed. The revision surgery was costly and technically challenging,” said Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital and spine surgeon. “The family thus came to Ahmedabad. We carried out tests and planned a surgery with a team of experts as we also had to ensure the infection from the earlier cage doesn’t damage nerves. If it didn’t go as planned, the patient could get paralyzed.” The team carried out the operation and replaced the older cage with new supports to her spine. She will be discharged soon, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/girl-undergoes-revision-spine-surgery-at-civil/articleshow/83618254.cms||---

Official data shows that the state-run health facility has 112 active Covid cases, of which, only 11 are in moderate condition. Till now, GMCH Aurangabad has treated 10,282 Covid patients since the beginning of the pandemic. Of these, 2,878 succumbed to the disease till Thursday morning. GMCH Dean Dr Kananbala Yelikar said the state-run facility gets from around 12 districts. “The load of active cases has come down considerably and all attention is being paid to critical patients. We come across maximum cases of late reporting of Covid with high severity of infection. This makes our job tougher,” she said. Yelikar said the mortality rate at GMCH Aurangabad was in the range of 20% to 22% during the second wave. “As compared to the first wave, the novel coronavirus was more virulent and infectious during the second wave. Besides senior citizens, people in the age group of 18 to 45 years also got infected and even lost their lives,” she said. Exhorting the need for Covid-appropriate behaviour, Yelikar said the battle against the pandemic was not over yet. “The complacent approach after the first wave caused the second wave of Covid-19. If we lower our guard, the threat of another wave of the pandemic looms large,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabads-situation-better-gmch-still-has-101-critical-cases/articleshow/83610785.cms||---
---||Pune||Five districts record 57% of Maharashtra’s Covid-linked mucormycosis cases||PUNE: Five districts — Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Mumbai and Nashik — have collectively recorded 57% of the state’s Covid associated mucormycosis cases, the latest health department's report has revealed. Of the total 7,359 cases recorded till June 14, Pune has registered a maximum of 1,216 cases followed, by Nagpur (1,184), Aurangabad (700), Mumbai (596) and Nashik (542). “Of the state’s 7,359 patients diagnosed with the invasive fungal infection, these five districts have recorded 4,238 patients in their urban and rural parts. That means 57% of the total cases are from these five districts, which were also among the worst-hit places during the Covid’s second surge,” said a senior state health official. The Covid associated mucormycosis cases have been registered across the state’s 35 districts. Some of the districts with the lowest number of cases are Buldhana (3), Palghar (9), Ratnagiri (10), Raigad (15), Washim (15), Hingoli (16) and Parbhani (18). In view of the rising cases, the Maharashtra government has advised screening of a sizable chunk of hospitalised Covid patients for mucormycosis immediately prior to or after the discharge. They include patients who have had steroid, oxygen therapy and intensive care unit (ICU) stay for more than seven days at hospitals. Admitted patients with high blood sugar (above 200 mg/dL or glycated haemoglobin [HbA1C] above 8) are also advised to be screened for the invasive fungal infection that primarily affects the sinuses. Patients given the anti-rheumatic drug tocilizumab are also included in the list of factors for early screening. The state’s commissioner of health services and mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), issued this set of guidelines on May 17. The nationwide shortage of key anti-mucormycosis drug amphotericin B has badly affected the patients. “Pune district received only 12,838 vials of amphotericin B between May 20 and June 10 despite registering the highest number of Covid associated mucormyosis cases in the state,” said health activist Abhijit More. The actual requirement — considering each patient needs a minimum of six vials every day for a minimum 21-day course — is 1.10 lakh vials for the 878 patients currently on treatment in the district. “How can doctors treat the patients when the key drug is not available in adequate numbers?” More asked. ENT surgeon Samir Joshi of the state-run B J Medical College and Sassoon hospital said, “Amphotericin B, either conventional or liposomal, plays a pivotal role in arresting the spread of the deep-seated mucormycosis. Surgeries are only helpful in clearing the tissues which are already damaged.” The Union government’s National Joint Task Force recently recommended that injection posaconazole could be used in cases of non-availability of amphotericin B or in those patients having severe intolerance to amphotericin B in view of the nationwide shortage of the key drug.

---||Kolkata||‘Start early in new assessment regime’||KOLKATA: Teachers have started advising students on the importance of being regular in classes—online or physical—completing all classwork and submitting of homework, especially after national boards are considering school-level marks for marking Class X and XII candidates. Students are being told every child would be continually assessed as these observations might be of supreme importance in the changed circumstances, when only board exams marks would no longer be the sole criterion for appraisal. Schools said learning curves would be prepared from the middle school so that a child’s natural aptitude for subjects and other proficiencies could be plotted. “This system is followed abroad. The old pattern of assessing a child on just board marks is being replaced with a holistic assessment where, a child’s engagement with every subject and process will be plotted from his/her formative middle school days. If a child takes interest in class, gives interesting answers and solutions, he/she should be awarded a score,” said Rupkatha Sarkar, principal of La Martiniere for Girls. “The current challenges have taught us assessments are bound to change and we are moving towards a system followed abroad where a child’s all-round learning curve is plotted. Every assignment a child writes has to be recorded,” said Heritage School principal Seema Sapru. Asian International School had started a multiple mode of assessment, where exam scores were as important as class response, said principal Vijaylakshmi Kumar. At an online meet of Class XI students at Birla High School on Thursday, principal Loveleen Saigal said each child’s progress in the past five years might be compared with exam scores. “It is important to be diligent throughout,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/start-early-in-new-assessment-regime/articleshow/83618421.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The police on Wednesday arrested a nursing staff working at a government hospital at Gulbarga in Karnataka and recovered 22 injections worth Rs1.4 lakh from him. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said that on June 7 the crime branch arrested five people, including two pharmacists and a nurse, from the PCMC’s Covid care centre at Moshi for selling injections needed for treatment of mucormycosis in the black market. Police recovered four injections from the suspects. “While probing the case, sub-inspector Deepak Kadbane of the Wakad police received information that a friend of the arrested nurse was operating from Solapur,” the commissioner said. Senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar and his team took suspect Sharanbasaveshwar Dhamame (38), a medical representative from Solapur, into custody. “During questioning, Dhamame revealed that these injections were supplied from Gulbarga. We sent a decoy customer there and took Rajshekhar Basantri (33) into custody,” Krishna Prakash said. He said that Basantri worked as a nursing staff in a Gulbarga hospital. “He had sold some injections in Solapur district, too. Our probe is on,” the commissioner said. Krishna Prakash announced a cash reward of Rs50,000 to senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar of the Wakad police and his team for investigation into the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-recover-22-injections-used-for-treatment-of-black-fungus-2-held/articleshow/83618358.cms||---
---||Chennai||Fight for HC judge posts at the cost of democracy||By R S Raveendhren The Supreme Court Advocates-on-record Association (SCAORA) has courted controversy by its proposal to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) requesting that lawyers practising at the apex court be considered for appointment as judges in high courts across the country. What has raised eyebrows is the categorical statement of the association’s president that the CJI has acceded to the request and the news reports that the CJI has requested the chief justices of all high courts to consider apex court lawyers for elevation as high court judges. While the office of the Chief Justice of India has not commented about the claims, the proposal has invited sharp critiques from Bar associations of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha and Delhi. The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has added to the controversy by writing to the CJI that Supreme Court lawyers are ‘more meritorious’ than high court lawyers. It went an extra mile by constituting a ‘search committee’ to facilitate the process of identifying Supreme Court lawyers. As a result, in the past few days, a couple of non-statutory bodies has emerged as extra-constitutional mechanisms in selection and appointment of judges. The demand of the SCAORA and SBCA is illegal and motivated. Article 214 of the Constitution provides for the establishment of a high court for each state. Article 217 (2) (b) states a person shall not be qualified for appointment as a judge of a high court unless he has for at least 10 years been an advocate of a high court or two or more such courts in succession. It is worthy to recollect that this stipulation is only a reflection of a similar suggestion made under pre-independence-era reports, namely, Motilal Nehru Report of 1928, Sapru Committee Report of 1945 and Constituent Assembly’s Adhoc Committee concerning judicial system. The proposal runs counter to the memorandum of procedure evolved for selection and appointment of judges’ consequent to ‘Judges Appointment cases’. It is perplexing that a body of lawyers at the highest court of the land choses to float a proposal against a clear constitutional mandate. The question is, can a practitioner who consciously forgoes the opportunity of being considered for elevation as judge of a high court by choosing his practice at Supreme Court, claim parity with a practitioner of law at a high court? The SCAORA and SCBA demand also undermines the authority of the high courts and poses a threat to its independent functioning by trying to cultivate constitutional elitism. If at all the grievance of the practitioners at Supreme Court is about lack of opportunities for them in matters of appointment of judges, they can seek consideration under Article124 (3) (b) for appointment as judges in Supreme Court or they can petition the President of India under Article 124 (3) (c) of the Constitution which empowers him to appoint a person as judge of Supreme Court if he is of the opinion that the candidate is a distinguished jurist. This provision has been totally ignored as professor Upendra Baxi puts it, "….The prospect of having our own equivalent of a Felix Frankfurter has been willfully squandered"; But any attempts to evolve supra-constitutional methods and mechanisms need to be nipped in the bud. The contentious proposal is an affront not only to the constitutional provisions and high courts but also to the rights of the states. Every state has the right to have people from its own land to be appointed as judges for its high court so that the selected candidates would be familiar with local laws, culture, customs and usage that will promote the cause of justice. In Tamil Nadu, the sanctioned strength of judges for the Madras high court is 75. Its present strength is 64, of which 13 are women judges, an enviable record. With existing vacancies, the present proposal poses a threat to make deep inroads into the representative strength and independent capacity of states in the judicial system. This will in turn upset the representative equilibrium at the apex court level by creating imbalances. This very proposal is undemocratic as it lacks transparency and accountability. And so the office of the Chief Justice needs to clear the air to dispel the misgivings created by actions of SCAORA and SCBA. Considering the ramifications, Govt of Tamil Nadu should take note of the developments and object to the proposal as it meddles with functional autonomy of High Court in the state under the constitutional scheme. Lawyers are officers of the court and are an integral part of the judiciary. Original ideas and concepts in law are developed and tested more at a ground level than at the higher levels. No single institution or group can take credit singularly for the march of law. Professional bodies like SCAORA and SCBA are supposed to be a bridge between the judicial system and lawyers, and not a dividing wedge. Instead of the present controversy, professional bodies should instead strive for diversity in appointments, in terms of gender, religion, caste and ethnicity in the lines of the Constitutional Reforms Act, 2005, of Great Britain or the Constitution of South Africa. It will go a long way in creating a dynamic emblematic value in promoting public confidence over the constitutional body.

At least 10 people from his village, Deepur Gobra, gave an affidavit to the SSP on Wednesday certifying that Parsadi Lal had died in 2006 and his name was wrongly included in the FIR, said Ashok Pandey who accompanied the residents. The FIR was registered against seven people, including village head Kalicharan, under various sections of the IPC, including 307 (attempt to murder) and 354 (b) (assaults or using criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to be naked), 148 (rioting, being armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) at Akrabad police station on June 13. According to police, Prasadi was Kalicharan’s father and his name had been included in the FIR based on a complaint by the survivor’s family. Suman Kanojia, circle officer (CO) of Barla, said the deceased’s name was “misprinted” in the FIR because of the content of the complaint. “This will be removed during the investigation of the case,” she said. The FIR filed on a complaint by the survivor says that on the evening of June 12, she had gone to drive away cows from the family field when two of her neighbours allegedly grabbed her and molested her. When the victim tried to scream, the suspects allegedly brandished a gun, forcing her to keep quiet. Meanwhile, her brother came to the spot and they allegedly opened fire, scaring him away. After reaching home, the girl was trying to narrate her ordeal to her family when the suspects with their relatives and the village head, his father, Prasadi Lal, and some other people allegedly attacked her house and assaulted her family members, the FIR states Prasadi Lal’s relative, Tulsi Ram, told TOI that the case is an outcome of the sheer frustration of the supporters of a candidate who lost the panchayat elections against Kalicharan. The fact that Kalicharan’s dead father's name was included in the case is proof of this, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-cops-book-man-who-died-in-2006-for-attempt-to-murder/articleshow/83613554.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Chouhan said that now the state is being unlocked and economic activities have started, therefore it is mandatory for every person to follow Covid Appropriate Behaviour in toto. Even the slightest callousness can cost dear. Everyone must wear masks, maintain distance from one another and avoid crowding a place. Everyone must make sure to get vaccinated for protection from Covid-19. The chief minister was reviewing the Coronavirus situation in the state at Mantralaya. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang, chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, additional chief secretary, health, Mohammad Suleman were present in the meeting among others.

On Thursday, total doses administered in MP was 1.49 crore. It took 152 calendar days to reach the figure. Vaccination drive to protect against Covid began on January 16. The highest single day coverage for vaccine administration, has been 5.10 lakh in MP. To reach the number of half a crore doses, some seven lakh people would have to be inoculated each day. That said, on Monday and Friday Covid-19 vaccination does place. It is for regular immunization. It would take about 10 calendar days if all things fall into place. “We have a human resource strength of some 11,000 for vaccination. Till now only about 5700 have been utilized at a time. 50 lakh doses can be accomplished,” said MP state immunization officer, Dr Santosh Shukla. To get the plans in place, a meeting with senior state government officials and central government is slated for Friday. Vaccination is dependent on availability of the vaccine. Shortages in supply have been a hurdle in the recent past. The issue has been sorted, claim health officials. From Saturday each day, MP is expected to receive a consignment of about four lakh doses. About seven hospitals in MP have directly procured vaccines from manufacturer. As per new union government guidelines, ‘all vaccine doses will be allocated to the states and union territories based on their population, disease burden and their vaccination progress. The price of all vaccine doses for private hospitals will be declared by each vaccine manufacturer’. Union government is to buy 75% of jabs from vaccine makers for free supply to states. 1.23 lakh doses were administered across MP on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/50l-to-be-vaccinated-as-mega-drive-begins-june-21/articleshow/83616116.cms||---

Goa, said GFP president Vijai Sardesai, needs to rebuild its credibility and integrity. He said that locals need to generate ideas on “how they envision Goa to be governed in the future” in a post pandemic world. “Goa needs a repositioning and Goans should work to build a consensus among the people, by giving them a way forward that allows for their recovery, their growth and their future,” the GFP chief said. He further said that Goa’s repositioning needs to focus on the three main goals of recovery, sustenance, and future readiness. “We cannot allow Goa to be seen only through the lens of rave parties, and cheap holidays. We need to bring back the credibility and integrity of our state. We need to bring back the respect and reverence of our people, our culture, our traditions and our way of life,” the former deputy chief minister said. Sardesai blamed the BJP for tarnishing Goa’s reputation, destroying the state’s economy and reducing Goa’s credibility. He said that restoring Goa’s credibility and aiding the state’s recovery is “a collective exercise”for which a “united opposition” that can “take on the BJP” is vital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/must-change-goas-party-image-gfp/articleshow/83620547.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||States should keep tabs on labs after reports of fake tests: ICMR||Pune: Senior officials of the Indian Council of Medical Research on Thursday told TOI that states should maintain a strict vigil on laboratories conducting Covid-19 tests in the wake of fake reports emerging at Kumbh. Senior epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said, “Health being a state subject, local authorities of the states should keep a check on the approved laboratories conducting tests. Regular review of complaints regarding any laboratories not following the good laboratory practice should be closely monitored.” There are 2,655 ICMR-approved laboratories in India currently. Of them, a total of 1,579 laboratories — 594 government and 985 private laboratories — are dedicated to RT-PCR tests. As many as 930 labs conduct the TrueNat test. Of them, a total of 629 are government laboratories and 301 are private hubs. Around 133 laboratories are into CBNAAT test and about 13 conduct other molecular-nucleic acid tests, according to the data on the ICMR website. Consultant pathologist Dr Rohit Jain, the secretary of the Practicing Pathologists’ Society, told TOI that the ICMR — with powers delegated to it under the Disaster Management Act and being the approving body for laboratories in the country — should be able to monitor them and de-list those bending the rules. “The health is a state subject and the state health authorities should be closely monitoring the laboratories, but there is no mechanism to monitor them. There should be a proper system to monitor all the centres,” he said, adding that states would hardly be able to maintain vigil unless the processes were put in place. A state health official said there should be a separate authority to monitor the laboratories because the regular staffers were overburdened. Maharashtra conducts the highest number of tests in the country — over 2.2 lakh tests a day. Currently, the state has 102 government laboratories and 147 private laboratories. Another health official said, “Once a laboratory is approved by the ICMR and is NABL accredited, it is obvious that there should be a mechanism to keep a check on it. With fake tests emerging, there is a need to keep a proper check on all the testing laboratories.” The Pune district authorities said the list of approved laboratories under the ICMR had been put out and the local authorities could act against those not performing test according to the norms. “There should be a team to regularly assess the performance of the laboratories in the district,” said a senior official, in charge of testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-should-keep-tabs-on-labs-after-reports-of-fake-tests-icmr/articleshow/83618389.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Will publish weekly vaccination plan in districts: State govt to Bombay HC||MUMBAI: To avoid inconvenience to citizens, a weekly vaccination plan will be published in all districts, including Mumbai city, depending on the availability of vaccines, the state government has told the Bombay high court. The decision came in response to suggestions by Yogeeta Vanzara, a teacher at Bharda New High School in Fort, who had filed a PIL highlighting the glitches faced by people trying to book slots on the CoWin portal, saying that it causes “extreme stress and mental trauma.” On June 9, the HC said it would be desirable if the state looked into her suggestions and adopted those that are workable without waiting for its order. In its June 16 reply to the court, the state said that the Centre had already directed the state to work towards making a weekly vaccination plan available to citizens, and that “the state government will plan the schedule on vaccination as per the supply given by government of India on a weekly basis, before publishing the same”. The state, however, expressed its inability to publish such a schedule on a weekly basis in all districts for want of consistent vaccine supply. Pointing towards the difficulty in notifying weekly plans, the state informed the court that in Kolhapur, Gadchiroli and Yavatmal districts, a weekly plan was given for a particular time as there was sufficient vaccine stock then. “But with reduced vaccine supply now, the authorities in the three districts are unable to prepare a weekly plan,” said the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-publish-weekly-vax-plan-in-dists-state-to-bombay-hc/articleshow/83618424.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Constructed in 1913, the 27m-tall structure from the terrace is the second oldest building after the Senate House at the Chepauk campus. After renovation, ‘Thirukkural’ couplets will be played every hour, an initiative that was first put in place about a decade ago as a mark of commemorating the World Classical Tamil Conference at Coimbatore in 2010, but discontinued.The Indo-Saracenic style Tower Clock is built with exposed red brickusing lime mortar. Four large bells of varying sizes are house inside at the top with a water tank beneath. While the bells were rung manually in the olden days, the concrete water tank was built to supply water for the Tower Clock block.Today the bricks are eroded, cracked and breaking away and water leaks through the roof of the Tower Clock block. and the insides of the Tower Clock is the nesting ground of pigeons and owls. Though repairs were done in the past, the seepage persisted.The University of Madras is executing renovation work of the heritage structure through the building centre and conservation division of the Public Works Department (PWD) at a cost of `4.1 crore. The traditional method of mixing jaggery and inknut paste and lime mortar to arrest seepage is done for the roof.The work began after clearing nearly 50kg of pigeon droppings, says a PWD official. "We need to replace the broken bricks and clear the modern additions such as wirings to restore the structure to its past beauty. We are expecting to complete the renovation by March 2022," a PWD official said.K Jothi Sivagananam, head of economics department, University of Madras and director-Chepauk Campus, said it is the first time that the Tower Clock is being renovated completely. "Once the renovation is done, steps would be taken for restoring the system of audio recitals of ‘Thirukkural’ couplets every hour," he said.

---||Pune||Hospitals attain ‘near normalcy’ level, up to 85% non-Covid healthcare services resume||Pune: Big hospitals have achieved pre-pandemic ‘near-normalcy’ level in terms of elective/planned surgeries and other non-Covid healthcare services following the relaxation in lockdown-like restrictions in the wake of the steep decline in Covid cases in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). Citizens, who have been putting off non-emergency surgeries out of Covid fears, have started approaching hospitals to schedule surgeries meant for weight loss, kidney/gall bladder stone, bone joints/muscle, among others. “We have achieved almost 75% resumption of non-Covid healthcare services, mainly elective surgeries, after the relaxation of curbs this month. This is fairly pre-pandemic and near the normalcy stage. However, there is a need to stay alert and keep an eye on any new spike in Covid cases,” said Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital. Hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans said, “Prior to the pandemic, our surgeons were conducting an average of 60-70 elective surgeries every day. They are doing 40-50 such surgeries every day now.” Sharing the view, senior surgeon Shashank Shah said of Laparo-Obeso Centre, one of the dedicated bariatric surgery units in Pune, said, “We have carried out 20 bariatric surgeries, besides 10 cancer, eight hernia, four gall bladder and 10 intestinal obstruction surgeries so far this month. These patients were mainly the citizens who have been deferring the surgeries for over three months now in view of the Covid surge. They were just managing with painkillers and other supportive drugs during this period.” The state-run Sassoon General Hospital, which is the referral tertiary care centre, has recorded 85% resumption of elective surgeries. “Many patients from the city’s slums and rural parts are coming for various ailments that necessitate surgery. We are planning or prioritising their surgeries as per the level of urgency and possibilities of complications,” said hospital’s dean Muralidhar Tambe. Although the number of people testing positive for Covid -19 was unprecedented during the second surge, the patient recovery rate was also faster as compared to the first wave last year, health experts said. “Therefore, the elective surgeries are expected to touch normal levels faster now than the first wave,” said Abrarali Dalal , chief executive officer, Sahyadri Hospitals. “Elective surgeries dropped by 60% in April-May this year, whereas, in June 2021, there is a good pick up of 80-85% in planned surgeries, which is near normalcy pre-pandemic stage,” Dalal said. Delaying medical care may increase medical complications. Hence, people should seek medical care in time, the experts advised. “We have all infection control protocols in place. Hence, citizens who are advised elective surgeries by their consultants should get themselves operated at bigger hospitals in time,” said Vinod Sawantwadkar, chief executive officer, Jehangir hospital.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra State scraps plan for SRA scheme in Aarey Colony||Mumbai: The proposed slum rehabilitation scheme in Aarey Colony has been scrapped. “The Bombay high court in a 2012 PIL had passed an order in 2016 stating that in view of the National Green Tribunal and interim orders passed by the court the slum rehabilitation scheme cannot be implemented in the Aarey Colony area. Therefore, the notification issued earlier has been cancelled,” SRA chief Satish Lokhande, in a notification issued on Wednesday, said. In May, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) had announced its intention to declare 32,310 sq ft in Aarey Colony as a slum rehabilitation area despite a stay on construction by the high court. The area is part of the 66-acre owned by the state dairy development department. TOI was the first to report the notification was being issued despite the HC order. When asked about the SRA’s intention when there was a court stay, Lokhande had then said that the authority had only invited objections and suggestions.  Activist Godfrey Pimenta said it was a welcome decision from the SRA. Activist Zoru Bhathena said it was rare that a government department accepted its mistake and carried the conviction to correct a wrong. “It shows the government’s resolve to save Aarey,” he added. Advocate Zaman Ali said the Bombay high court order should have been understood by the government in 2016 itself. “The state government has understood it five years late. Such a delayed action calls for legal officers/departments of our state agencies to introspect the way it internally updates and carries itself in such important issues of governance,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-scraps-plan-for-sra-scheme-in-aarey-colony/articleshow/83620564.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Nashik||Malegaon’s positivity & case fatality rates improve||NASHIK: Malegaon municipal commissioner Balchandra Gosavi on Thursday said the Covid-19 situation in Malegaon town has significantly improved in the last one month. The positivity rate in the textile town in early May was around 30%, but it has now declined to around 2%. Similarly, the mortality rate has dipped from 5.5% to around 1.8% during that same period. There are as many as 130 active patients currently hailing from Malegaon town, which in May was above 1,700. Talking to TOI, Gosavi said the positivity and mortality rates in the textile town have declined due to the measures taken by the civic administration in the last one month. Gosavi took over the charge of Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) in the third week of April this year. “The civic administration took few steps to reduce the spread of the infection and deaths due to Covid in Malegaon town after I took charge. We ramped up daily testing from around 150 to over 500-600 a day. This helped us in identifying Covid patients so that they could be isolated and treated early. Moreover, we stopped home isolation completely. Even asymptomatic patients were admitted to Covid facilities where they were kept under observation and treated,” Gosavi said. The civic chief has also directed the authorities of the Covid facilities to ensure patients undergoing treatment should not face any problems during their stay at these facilities. According to Pankaj Shimpi, senior functionary of the civic body’s health department, the improvement in the Covid situation in the textile town can be gauged from the fact that between June 1 and 16, only six people have succumbed due to the infection, including 10 days when no deaths were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/malegaons-positivity-case-fatality-rates-improve/articleshow/83610968.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Nagpur||Now, post-Covid blood clots affecting vision, say doctors||NAGPUR: An over 40-year-old patient was cured of Covid and also mucormycosis, and walked out of the hospital without any disfigurement. Some days later, he returned complaining of loss of vision in one of the eyes. Further investigation revealed that it was a case of retinal artery occlusion. In this the artery that supplies blood to the retina in the eye is blocked due to a clot, hampering the vision. Doctors say at times it’s difficult to get the vision back. This normally happens in persons with blood clotting tendencies. However, during Covid pandemic, added with mucormycosis, the numbers have gone up as compared to other times. It isn’t alarming, but there has been a tangible increase in number of such patients in last three to four months, said practitioners TOI talked to. It’s like an heart attack of the eye, the blood supply is blocked taking away the vision, said the doctors giving a comparison. Dr Ashish Kamble of Kingsway Hospitals, who treated patient who returned after recovering from Covid and mucormycosis, said the cases have gone up these days. “Covid has tendency to create clotting in the blood. Blood supply to the retina is blocked by the clots leading to loss of vision,” said Kamble. Another 74-year-old patient also suffered occlusion and also had cataract in the other eye. “This hampered vision in both his eyes till the cataract was removed,” said Kamble. As TOI talked to other eye doctors in the city, there were confirmations of the cases going up. Dr Mrunal Upasni, who is attached to Alexis Hospital, said the cases have gone up indeed. “It may not be many, but certainly more than the normal times. Earlier, these used to be a rare case. However, since couple of months I have come across 10 cases,” said Upasni. Dr Bhodhraj Dhawan, who offers his services to Alexis and two other centres, said, “Lately, I have come across six cases of artery occlusion and three of vein occlusion in the three centres clubbed. Apart from arteries, even the veins are being affected.” “The chances of getting back the vision is less if the occlusion is in the artery as compared the veins. This is seen in patients who had suffered from both Covid and mucormycosis as well as only Covid. These days the artery occlusion is also being seen as early signs of mucormycosis in a number of patients,” said Dhawan. This was also confirmed by another doctor in a private hospital. ‘Mucormycosis behaving in strange way’ Doctors at Kingsway Hospital have come across a couple of cases where mucormycosis has directly hit the optic nerve of the patients, bypassing the general route it has been taking. In both the cases there was no telltale sign of eyes bulging or redness as it has been seen in other cases, yet the vision had been affected. “Normally, mucormycosis spreads through para-nasal sinuses, to the maxilla (cheek bone), getting into the eye and then the brain. In this case without getting in the directly, the fungus was also present in the sphenoid sinus, a bone located close to back of the eye. The optic nerve which runs on the other side sphenoid sinus’ was swollen due to the infection, leading to vision loss” said Dr Ashish Kamble. “Normally, steroids are administered to such patients but since they are infected with mucormycosis, the drugs cannot be given,” said Kamble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-post-covid-blood-clots-affecting-vision-say-doctors/articleshow/83618082.cms||Shishir Arya

The administration is considering the entire district as a single entity when it comes to placing Nashik under the ‘restrictions for Break The Chain’ as announced by the state government. Accordingly, Nashik was placed in Level 3 as the weekly positivity rate stood at 6%. “Though weekly positivity rate will be calculated on Friday, the current daily positivity rate has slipped down from 7.1 per cent to around 4.5 per cent,” Kailas Bhoye, taluka health officer for Nashik who is in-charge of the district affairs, said. It should be noted that during the last weekly meeting Nashik city’s weekly positivity rate was better than in rural areas. However, since Nashik rural’s weekly positivity rate was on the higher side, the district administration decided to maintain Nashik’s status to Level 3. “Thereafter, testing was carried out in large numbers in rural areas. There were multiple effects of the increased testing that was carried out at the Primary Health Centre-level as it helped in identifying the infected people despite they not having any kind of symptoms and treating them. This helped in curbing the spread of the disease,” Bhoye said. The large number of testing further helped in increasing the sample size thus bringing down the rate of positivity — indicating that the infection is under control. Health authorities said currently they were testing more than 30 contacts of each of new covid positive person detected in the rural areas. Due to this the number of hotspot talukas and active cases have also reduced drastically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/daily-positivity-rate-in-nashik-rural-areas-drops-below-4-5/articleshow/83611056.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “Of the total doses received, around 30,000 each have been provided to the Pune rural and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administrations, while around 16,500 doses have been given to the Pimpri Chinchwad civic body. We are expecting the arrival of Covaxin doses later this week.” Deshmukh said once the centralised procurement of vaccine starts, the overall vaccination could pick up the pace after June 21. “We are conducting meetings with the private hospitals and getting to know their vaccine needs and accordingly it will be conveyed to the centre,” he said. The PMC has scheduled drives for Covishield across 170 designated CVCs on Friday, while 16 will conduct the Covaxin drive. The 60% of the quota will be available through CoWin app booking, the slot for which will open at 8am on Friday.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘After vax, <1% med staff with Covid needed hosp’||Mumbai: Complete double-dose immunisation can significantly protect against severe Covid infection and hospitalisation, shows analyses of data on breakthrough infection among thousands of healthcare workers collated as part of multi-centre studies. Only 6% of their 16,147 medical personnel across 26 locations got infected after vaccination with both doses, found the analysis by Fortis Healthcare. Among them, 92% had mild symptoms, 7% had moderate disease and only 1% got critical. There was one death recorded in the cohort, which the researchers attributed to comorbidities. Releasing their study of 31,621 vaccinated health workers on Thursday, the Apollo Hospital Group said only 4.3% (1,355) of them reported breakthrough infections. Breakthrough infections occur when one tests positive for coronavirus two weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. Only 90 (0.28%) required hospitalisation, while three (0.009%) required ICU admission, the study said. There were no deaths. “It is reassuring that 92% of the fully vaccinated healthcare workers developed only mild Covid-19 infection, largely recovering in home care,” said Dr Bishnu Panigrahi, group head, medical strategy and operations, Fortis Healthcare. Data showed that of the 978 (6%) who got infected, only 0.4% (69) needed hospitalisation for oxygen support and 0.05% (8) required ICU admission. Only two (0.01%) required a ventilator and one died. “The study clearly shows the vaccines available in India do provide protection, even in healthcare workers who are most at risk,” he said. Healthcare workers were the first to get vaccinated in the country, starting from January 16, and the data is among the many real-world efficacy analyses coming out of hospitals now. Panigrahi said the ongoing studies have found another benefit of getting vaccinated. “Besides reducing risk of infection and severity, vaccines may be associated with reduced likelihood of household transmission, thereby preventing the spread of infection to others,” he said. Vaccines have definitely offered protection despite the second wave infecting a much higher number of individuals, said Dr Gajanan Velhal, head of community medicine at KEM Hospital. “We had far fewer infections and persons to be quarantined against positive cases. There were hardly any serious cases among the vaccinated healthcare workers in the second wave,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-vax-lt1-med-staff-with-covid-needed-hosp/articleshow/83618558.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The deals involve two plots of 40 acres and 39 acres at Padeghar village, Panvel, owned by Khan Bahad-ur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala Trust (KBHMB)-Mumb-ai, which were sold by Dosu Aardeshir Bhiwandiwala, claiming to be sole trustee of KBHMB. “RTI documents reveal Bhiwandiwala became lone trustee of KBHMB in 1999. Bhiwandiwala, in 2000, sold a 39-acre plot, to Paresh Thakur, brother of Prashant Thakur, for Rs 49 lakh and a 40-acre plot to Ramseth Thakur Samajik Vikas Mandal (RTSVM) trust for Rs 51 lakh. The trust is headed by Prashant Thakur,” alleged Rajeev Mishra, RTI activist. “A SC order had struck down Bhiwandiwala’s claim to be legal heir of KBHMB trust. Thereafter, RTSVM trust sold the 40-acre plot to a private firm at Rs 36.42 crore. Paresh Thakur divided the 39-acre plot and sold a small portion to the same firm at Rs 1.15 crore.” Prashant Thakur said: “The land was bought and the RTSVM trust sold the land to a firm after obtaining the charity commissioner’s nod. We are not party to the court proceedings.” Paresh Thakur said: “My father had done the two transactions. A small portion of the land was sold to the firm and the rest is in my ownership.” —Umesh K Parida||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-officials-order-probe-into-land-deals-linked-to-panvel-mla/articleshow/83620773.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Malls open to warm response, sizeable footfalls||BHOPAL: After more than two months of lockdown, shopping malls in the city opened to a warm response from the people, who turned up in siezable numbers for shopping in the past couple of days, raising hopes of a greater turnout as the time goes by. Similar precautionary measures are in place at the shopping malls as those witnessed after the first lockdown in 2020 except a change, all the staff and most of the customers, who turned up for shopping, were vaccinated. Guards thermal screening visitors, offering them sanitisers and requesting them to maintain physical distancing is all there. “I have come to buy some ready-to-eat stuff which we get here only. Children like it very much and had been demanding it, so I thought let’s meet their demand as the malls opened today”, said Atul Shrotriya, who had come to a mall in MP Nagar. Visitors at the mall seemed to be more cautious than before and patient too as they were offered sanitiser in whichever retail shop they entered and they allowed the security guard to sprinkle it on their hand unlike the past when they would stop them saying “Abhi to lagaya hai yaaar baju wali shop mein” (”I have just washed my hands with sanitiser in the neighbouring shop”). They were wearing masks properly even while going up and down in the mall and maintaining distance as well. . Multiplexes, which often attract the maximum crowd in a mall, are closed for now and food courts, though allowed to operate, were more or less closed on the first couple of days. In some malls, joints in the food court will open up at a later stage. “We received the communication from the administration late on Tuesday. Food joints have to do an extra bit to put their stuff in order. They will clear the stuff which was there when they shut the joint. In addition to sanitisation, it takes much more to make the place hygienic and they are doing it”, said Rahul Sharma of DB Mall. In response to retail shops, he said “There is a lot of excitement. The response has been positive. We are looking forward to a better response as the days pass by. We are concerned about the safety of our staff and customers both. So, over the last two weeks, we ensured that everyone working in the mall gets vaccinated. Most of the victors coming to shop are also vaccinated. We hope it will go a long way in restoring confidence among people and also ensure their safety.” Interestingly, a vaccination camp was going on in the mall where visitors, who didn’t have a single jab of vaccine till, now could have got themselves vaccinated in the cosy environs of a mall rather than a health centre. Rahul Kumar of Capital Mall was also happy at the response of the people and happier at the way they were conducting themselves in the mall. “It’s heartening to see people wearing masks properly and maintaining safe distance on their own”, he said. “Response is good except the fact that closing time is 8.00 pm. People start coming out for shopping at 7.00, 7.30 in the evening after coming from office. If the restaurants are allowed to operate till 100 p-m, why not malls and the market as whole. It’s not a big issue though, I know timings will be extended in course of time.” The food court in nCapital Mall is closed as of now and is likely to open in a week. “It takes pest control, deep cleaning and other things before eateries in the food court could start business. I may take time unlike retail stores which are ready to welcome the guests”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/malls-open-to-warm-response-sizeable-footfalls/articleshow/83616155.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Goa||Minimum 71L jabs per day a must for eco recovery: CII||Panaji: India’s economic recovery hinges on an accelerated vaccination with at least 71.2 lakh individuals being vaccinated on a daily basis, said Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Thursday as it urged the government to put in place a multi-pronged strategy to stimulate economic growth. Vaccination is a key factor that will aid India’s recovery and the Centre needs to increase vaccine production in order to ensure that a majority of the country’s population is vaccinated by December end. India’s GDP growth rate for 2021-22 could touch 9.5% if public expenditure, reforms and vaccination are accelerated, said CII president T V Narendran in an online media interaction. “With majority of the population vaccinated by the end of this year, implementation of big-ticket reforms in factor markets and the financial sector, and a large fiscal stimulus, we will be able to reach the critical $5 trillion mark by 2025-26,” Narendran said. India could witness strong growth in the second half of the current financial year if supported by “robust external demand and largescale coverage of vaccination,” said Narendran. CII has suggested a range of measures to speed up the vaccination drive. It estimates that an average of about 71 lakh daily vaccinations are required between June to December to administer at least a single dose to all adults in the country. CII has also recommended that an empowered minister of vaccination needs to be appointed to accelerate the vaccination programme, procurement and distribution of vaccines to states. The government should fast track all necessary licencing requirements and pay vaccine manufacturers in advance for purchases, besides providing capital subsidies to incentivise production. It should urge the IP owners of vaccines to issue licences for mass manufacturing with transfer of technology. To combat vaccine hesitancy, governments at the Centre and at the state-level need to rope in social influencers and also provide cash, food and insurance incentives.“The cumulative impact of the two waves on incomes and consumer sentiment, coupled with the increase in household medical expenses in the second wave, is likely to affect consumer demand for some time. As the economy reopens post the second wave, a dual-pronged Government strategy is required to boost consumption and support industry till demand is well-entrenched,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/minimum-71l-jabs-per-day-a-must-for-eco-recovery-cii/articleshow/83620623.cms||---

Municipal chairman M K Jayaprakash had said that he was not aware of the steps taken by the municipality secretary and other officials resulting in a gazette notification converting nearly 350 acre of wetland in the municipality into dry land. The chairman said that cultivation should be done in the converted land wherever possible. He visited the converted land along with the members of the Padasekhara Samithi. He has also directed the secretary to examine the complaints and take corrective measures on the conversion of wetland. He said that the revenue and agriculture departments would jointly verify these areas and exemptions would be given only as per the Kerala Conversion of Paddy and Wetland Act 2008. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/municipal-chairman-slams-secy/articleshow/83587373.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar on Thursday inaugurated the public transport facility run by state-owned Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL). In the absence of any public transport service, the residents of this hamlet – located nearly 70 km from Margao - had to trudge a distance of over 5 km to reach the nearest bus stop at Netravali. The village has nearly 50 houses and a population of about 300. Though there is a primary school in the hamlet, the nearest high school is at Netravali, and students have to travel to Curchorem or Margao for higher secondary and higher education. Besides, there are several people travelling to Curchorem and Margao for work on a daily basis. Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar, former Sanguem MLA Subhash Phal Dessai, general manager of KTC Sanjay Ghate, besides others, were present during the launching ceremony. Kavlekar, speaking on the occasion lauded KTCL for connecting villages as remote as Mangal with a bus service. “The state government is committed towards the all-round development of the state and while making the state self-reliant, the last mile connectivity will play an important role,” Kavlekar said. Ghate pointed out how KTCL has been operating a few remote routes with the sole objective of providing connectivity for the villagers. “KTCL is operating some routes which will never make profits, but KTCL buses will continue plying on these routes, as they are for the benefit of the people of Goa,” he said. The bus will originate from Mangal early morning and proceed towards Kurpem and then head to Curchorem via Rivona.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/remote-mangal-gets-ktc-bus-service/articleshow/83618526.cms||---
---||Goa||SGPDA fish market opens to poor response||Margao: The retail fish market of the South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA) reopened on Wednesday following the government’s relaxation in curfew restrictions in that regard. However, the reopening of the retail fish market drew poor response from customers as the stock of fish in the market was scarce and rates high. The wholesale fish market, however, remains shut as the government is yet to allow its reopening. With a view to preventing crowding at the wholesale fish market, the authorities had ordered its closure on May 6. However president of the Association Ibraham Musa said that fish vehicles coming to the market from other states offload their fish stocks outside the wholesale fish market and sell it at exhorbitant prices. He urged the government to allow reopening of the wholesale fish market so that people could buy fish at affordable rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sgpda-fish-market-opens-to-poor-response/articleshow/83618564.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Five-level unlock system to continue, district-level monitoring to be stepped up||PUNE: The state government on Thursday said it would stick to the five-level unlock system, a day after the state task force on Covid-19 warned that the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic could be just two to four weeks away. State public health minister Rajesh Tope, confirming that the unlock process was here to stay, said district administrations have been told to step up vigil and ensure strict compliance to norms, especially after reports that crowds increased after restrictions were eased. “There should be a thorough assessment with all stakeholders at the district-level as they announce the level for the respective district,” Tope said. Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, state relief and rehabilitation department, told TOI that the five levels serve the dual purpose of unlocking and locking areas based on the positivity rate. “The success of this system will be depend on how fast the administration reacts to an increase in numbers,” Gupta said. He said there was a possibility of reintroducing lockdowns in a graded manner, should the caseload increase during the third wave. “It must be realised that these levels are not cast in stone — if the government feels that the cases are rising in an alarming manner, it will react immediately and impose stricter measures,” Gupta further said. Gupta further said the state will continue with the ‘oxygen trigger’, which mandates that should the oxygen bed occupancy in the entire state cross 35,000, then levels 1 and 2 would be done away with. If the occupancy rises above 45,000, then the entire state would be categorised as level 4 or 5, regardless of local situation. The state government has given discretionary powers to the local disaster management authorities. “They have been empowered to enforce strict restrictions over and above a particular level, should they feel it necessary,” Gupta said. “The state government would be closely monitoring the situation in each district and would not intervene unless absolutely necessary,” he added. The state government has called for feedback and suggestions from all stakeholders as it looks to strike a balance between containing the spread of Covid-19 and restoring economic activity, Gupta said. At Saturday’s district review meeting, areas in the rural pocket that have a positivity rate lower than 10% might be upgraded to level 3, while Pimpri Chinchwad could be categorised as level 2 if its positivity rate is below 5%. Pune city is currently at level 2. Local authorities have said they would make suggestions as per the situation, and that a final decision would be taken at the meeting. State task force member Sanjay Oak said there should be increased emphasis on vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour and advised the authorities against opening schools and colleges in haste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/five-level-unlock-system-to-continue-dist-level-monitoring-to-be-stepped-up/articleshow/83616195.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Soon, PMPML to add more buses on busy routes||Pune: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) plans to increase the number of buses catering to passengers by almost 80% to address the issue of crowding. “Despite instructions that each bus can only have 50% commuters with no standees, some buses are seen packed especially during the peak hours. It is dangerous and we are trying to contain the situation. However, people must also be a bit patient and think about the regulations and safety. Merely blaming PMPML is not going to help,” said a PMPML official. On Tuesday, the task force on Covid-19 warned that the third wave of the pandemic could hit Maharashtra or Mumbai within the next two to four weeks due to the crowding indication in the last few days. “We started the services last Sunday with 25% buses on the roads. The same has been increased to almost 50% by now and we plan to further extend it to 70% in a few days. Of the 1,648 bus schedules, close to 800 schedules are presently operational. With buses being increased, we hope that the wait time for commuters during peak hours will reduce and they will not crowd buses,” said Dattatray Zende, PMPML traffic manager. Another official said that the number of buses on the road will increase only during the peak hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/soon-pmpml-to-add-more-buses-on-busy-routes/articleshow/83616215.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Goa||Road to Tirval set to end its hardships||Poinguinim: Deputy speaker and local MLA Isidore Fernandes laid the foundation stone for the 3km-long Marlim-Tirval road on Thursday. The project, estimated to cost Rs 66 lakh, is expected to end the residents’ hardships due to non-existence of a road. Fernandes said that the work will start on Friday and it will be completed by October-November. Asphalting will be taken up thereafter, he said. The interior road will connect the area to Amona which joins NH-66 at Partagal. Locals had been demanding a proper road since Liberation and had twice threatened to boycott elections as the small access which they had was not motorable. Poinguinim sarpanch Jagdish Gaonkar and some local elders recalled the difficulties they had faced, being cut off from the rest of the state. Every candidate used to assure us about the road before the elections, but nothing happened, they said. Due to no motorable road, the people faced problems transporting the ailing and pregnant women to medical facilities. The main hospital at Chaudi is about 16-17 km from the area. Children from the area had to walk through a forested area to go to high school. The villagers said that in 2001, during the Ganesh festival, they got electricity supply in their houses, due to the efforts of then MLA Fernandes. After launching the works, Fernandes said that he could get this work approved through chief minister Pramod Sawant and other officers due to the cooperation of the Poinguinim panchayat. He appreciated the efforts of the people Marlim and Tirval for constructing a community hall using their own funds. “It’s sad that the government couldn't fund it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/road-to-tirval-set-to-end-its-hardships/articleshow/83618622.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Staff crunch & 10pm deadline force most restos to delay dine-in restart||Pune: A sizeable number of restaurants is yet to reopen despite the extension of the deadline to 10pm due to the shortage of labour and delay in bringing many of them back from their hometowns following the second wave of Covid-19 and the ensuing restrictions. Many eateries have, however, permanently closed because of the financial crunch and uncertainties.An estimated 65% and 30% fine-dine restaurants and bars still remained shut in popular hubs such as Koregaon Park and Kothrud, respectively, said local restaurateurs. Some of the facilities might reopen in the next one-two weeks.“Rents for commercial establishments in these areas are steep. Without proper income since the pandemic began, it has been difficult to make payments. Expenses are the same as the pre-Covid times, or even more. But income has reduced to less than 50%,” said the owner of a popular restaurant with multiple branches.Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, said of the total 850 members, only 250 were restaurants with permit rooms. “Among them, 20% have not been able to renew their licence; 15-20% permanently shut,” he said.The usual buzz is missing from Balewadi High Street. “Half of the restaurants have disappeared after the second wave,” said a regular patron of restaurants in the area.The manager of an eatery on Salunke Vihar Road said, “My staffers are not back and many don’t want to return fearing another lockdown.” At Phoenix Marketcity in Vimannagar, most restaurants in the food court and the standalone facilities remained closed this week. Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer of Amanora Mall, Magarpatta, said, “The mall has 12 restaurants; five have reopened until now.”Business at SGS Mall, Camp, which has quite a few popular quick service restaurant outlets, is up to “satisfactory level” despite the early closing time. “They are retrieving 90% of the pre-Covid business within the 10am-6.30pm operational hours. We have about 110 people there at a time. While people used to spend an average one-two hours at the food court, now they spend 30-45 minutes,” said Vikas Ladhe, centre head of SGS Mall.(With inputs from Joy Sengupta and Ashish Gupta)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/staff-crunch-10pm-deadline-force-most-restos-to-delay-dine-in-restart/articleshow/83616240.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Mumbai||Test for Sena: Cong, BJP to oppose property tax hike in Mumbai||Mumbai: The BMC’s bid to hike property tax by 14% has turned into a political hot potato with Congress and BJP saying they would vote against the proposal, putting the ruling Shiv Sena in a tough spot barely six months before civic elections. On Wednesday, the BMC proposed calculating property tax based on the revised Ready Reckoner (RR) rates of 2020, which would translate into a hike of 14%. The standing committee put the proposal on hold and will take it up next week. “We will oppose this very strongly. There is no way residents can bear this hike at a time when almost all households have faced a loss in income due to the pandemic. The BMC wants to give a waiver in property tax to five-star hotels and wants to hike taxes for common residents,” said Congress corporator Ravi Raja. BJP’s party leader in the BMC Vinod Mishra said: “There is no way BJP will allow any hike in property tax. The BMC has given waivers and relief in Covid to hotels and even contractors but wants to hike taxes of the common man. If Shiv Sena bulldozes this proposal in the standing committee, we will hit the streets.” BMC officials said if property tax rates had been revised as scheduled in 2020, residents would have faced an increase of up to 40%. There are 4.2 lakh property owners in Mumbai, of whom 1.4 lakh have houses smaller than 500 sq ft and are eligible for a property tax waiver, they pointed out. “Property tax is calculated on the capital value of property on the basis of RR rates. The RR rate is multiplied with various factors like year of construction, floor rise, carpet area of the property… we are not revising the capital value, but only using the new RR rates of 2020 to calculate the property tax. Since RR rates have increased since 2015, there is a proportionate rise in property tax,” explained an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/test-for-sena-cong-bjp-to-oppose-property-tax-hike-in-mumbai/articleshow/83618651.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Pune||Pune: Manpower shortage, inability to pay excise fee hamper bar owners’ plans||PUNE: Close to 40% of bars and clubs have not reopened despite the restrictions being relaxed. Of the restaurants that haven’t reopened, close to 20% weren’t able to pay the excise license renewal fee in order to reopen, statistics provided by the state excise department revealed. Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA), said that the lack of manpower and inability to pay the excise fee have hindered reopening of bars. “There are around 1,800 to 2,000 bars and clubs in Pune. For many, getting back employees, who left for their homes, is an issue. Trains are not running and flight tickets are expensive. Some bar owners are trying to bring back their employees by offering them tickets. A few others want to wait and watch before they reopen. Bars are to remain closed on weekends and that is an issue for many owners. We are going to meet deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday. We hope to get permission to operate on weekends,” Shetty told TOI. State excise superintendent Santosh Zagade said that while 1,673 bars renewed their licenses for 2021-22, around 320 have not approached them for the renewal. Rajas Divakar, who used to run a lounge in Kothrud, said that he was not in a position to reopen business. “The excise fee needs to be paid before March 31 for the entire financial year. Last year, many owners suffered heavy losses due to the lockdown and the state government was requested to cut the fee by half, which it did. Bars and clubs reopened in late-September and October. This time, however, no such relief has been granted. Many of us have faced such huge losses that we are in no position to pay the fee to reopen the outlet,” Divakar said. Kishor Sarpotdar, general secretary of PRAHA, said clubs and lounges wouldn’t do good business until students returned to the city. “There are many issues including staff availability, rent payment, and salaries. While bars will reopen slowly, business for lounges and clubs will remain poor as students, who frequent them have gone back home,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/manpower-shortage-inability-to-pay-excise-fee-hamper-bar-owners-plans/articleshow/83616250.cms||Joy Sengupta

He said rumours that Covaxin contains newborn calf serum are baseless and aimed at dividing the country.  "Congress is a rumour-mongering machine.It first called the indigenous vaccine as BJP's vaccine and talked about largescale deaths due to the vaccine. Congress even called the coronavirus an Indian variant and spread rumours about thecrisis of vaccine in the country. Now the Congress has played a new trick that the covaxin contains serum of a newborn calf," Sarang said.  He said, "The day Indian scientists succeeded in manufacturing a vaccine to save the lives of the people of India, the Congress leaderstarted spreading rumours about the vaccine. I thank Modi because scientists under his leadership have made the vaccine within one year. This is a big achievement for us but Congress is working to break the country in order to establish a family empire and mislead the public. Congress is trying to make the vaccine controversial from day one. It's shameful." Congress, however, blamed the government for the RTI response on a query seeking reply on serum content. "The findings were disclosed by the Congress leader through an RTI response given by the Central Drugs Controller General. If the RTI response was baseless, the government should take action against the officer responsible and not blame the Congress," said Congress state spokesperson Narendra Saluja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cong-trying-to-spread-rumours-on-vax-sarang/articleshow/83616270.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Gun culture in Kota worries cops||JAIPUR: Firearms being fished out from pockets to resolve minor banter and confrontations have become common in Kota, thanks to easy availability of guns from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Since January 2020, Kota has witnessed three murders in which firearms were used in addition to use of guns for resolving minor altercations. A day after a commission agent dealing with fruits and vegetables was targeted by six unknown men here, TOI spoke to senior police officers to get first-hand information on rising incidents of fire power being used to address minor scuffles. “A 38-year-old fish trader was shot dead after a minor altercation under Kaithunipole police station area here in January 2020. Since then, Kota has witnessed three murder cases in which firearms were used. In all these cases, it was found that majority of the assailants were first timers and easy money and easy availability of firearms dragged them to crime,” said a senior police officer in Kota. Even traders are getting intimidated with attacks on their counterparts. “I think the business and trader community is intimidated. You get into confrontation with various people over payments. The way people are using firearms is serious. I will meet the SP and collector for their intervention,” said Om Malav, former chairman of Kota Krishi Upaj Mandi. Former DGP Omendra Bhardwaj said, “I think easy availability of firearms could be the reason. Police need to go for massive crackdown on inter-state arms dealers.” Kota SP Vikas Pathak said, “In all the past cases, we have made arrests and accused were charge-sheeted. We also we run campaigns against the use of firearms and arrest people under the arms Act. We will certainly look into the grey areas. As far as Monday’s incident is concerned, we have identified four out of the six men and will make arrests.” Pathak admitted that arms dealers of Madhya Pradesh have been active in Kota. “We will intensify the campaign against arms dealers,” he added. ADG (crime) Ravi Prakash Meherda said, “In all our meetings, we had raised concerns on this. I will again repeat to IGs and SPs to continue crackdown on illegal use of firearms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gun-culture-in-kota-worry-cops/articleshow/83618676.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Pune||Work vacations in vogue as Covid cases drop||Pune: The scene from the Bollywood movie Zindagi Naa Milegi Dobara in which Hrithik Roshan’s character abruptly stops the car at a scenic valley to log on to his laptop and interact with a client, is steadily inspiring a number of tourists. Travelling for leisure while logging onto work or online classes is slowly catching on and people are approaching travel agents for a working vacation as Covid-19 cases continue to drop. Even with restrictions in place, like having an RT-PCR negative report not older than 48 to 72 hours, travel inquiries are on the rise. Many engaged with the travel industry said that though most queries were yet to convert into bookings, the fact that people have started enquiring can be seen as a healthy sign. “People have called us requesting quotations for travel to places like Goa, Coorg, Manali and Ooty during the monsoon. The second wave hit during the peak summer, when people usually take vacations. Now, they want to travel during the monsoon,” said Santosh Gupta, owner of Shree Vinayak Holidays. He added that the work from home regime and online classes for students weren’t a deterrent anymore. “It is a sort of work vacation trend that is slowly catching up. People can easily travel with their laptops and other electronic devices so they can attend important meetings while on a vacation,” Gupta added. Nilesh Bhansali, director of Travel Agents Association of Pune, also said that the number of enquiries has increased lately. “While it is a good sign, things will be clear only after June 20. Many states are under lockdown and many big hotels have shut down due to losses. One has to wait for another 10 days to get a better picture,” said Bhansali. Manohar Sharma, who got back from a trip to Goa in March, is planning to travel there in July. “I have been working from home and I didn’t feel the need to take leave for a vacation. So, I went to Goa, relaxed on the beach and worked too. I am planning to go again next month but this time I will take leave,” said Sharma, who works with a private firm.

The NIA claims to have recovered some cash, documents and illegal arms and ammunition. Sharma was earlier arrested in 2009 in the alleged fake encounter of Chhota Rajan aide Lakhan Bhaiya in 2006. In 2013 he was acquitted. Special NIA public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves told court they want to ascertain the deep-rooted conspiracy in the case. The court rejected his request to disallow the media inside the court as it was a sensitive case. According to NIA, on March 4, dismissed policemen Sachin Waze and Sunil Mane handed over Mansukh Hiran to four accused --Santosh Shellar, Anand Jadhav, Satish and Soni at Hotel Hill View at Ghodbunder Road in Thane. The four took him in a Tavera car, smothered him to death and dumped his body in the creek at the behest of Waze and Sharma. Shellar and Jadhav, both Malad residents arrested last Saturday, have also shown the place where they dumped Hiran’s body, NIA claimed. The killers spoke to Waze and Sharma before and after the crime, NIA said. Gonsalves said the key accused need to be confronted with each other, without which investigations cannot be completed. “There are other people also involved, hence we want 14 days’ police custody.” The vehicle laden with explosives was found on February 25, and Hiran’s body was found in a Mumbra creek on March 5. NIA sources said Sharma is accused of attending conspiracy meetings held at police headquarters on March 2 and 4 between him and Waze and two other officers. Another meeting took place at Sharma’s office in Andheri, where Mane is believed to have handed over a SIM card to be used in the crime. After Hiran’s murder, one SIM card was active up to the point of Sharma’s house at J B Nagar, NIA said. All the accused were in touch with Sharma before and after the crime. Judge Sitre asked NIA officials why they didn’t arrest Sharma if they had unearthed a conspiracy when they arrested inspector Sunil Mane. On the judge’s demand, NIA SP Vikram Khalate showed him the case diary. Gonsalves told court, “We had information about Sharma’s role but then he was just a suspect and we were collecting evidence. He is an ex-police officer who knows how to dodge the investigating agency. He is a tough nut to crack and he initially misled the agency. We have got traces of DNA samples collected from the Tavera which belonged to Jadhav. A lot of money has been distributed to the accused by Waze and Sharma, which needs to be ascertained. There are a few more people involved... to be arrested.” Sharma’s lawyer Sudeep Pasbola argued there was no material evidence to link his client’s role in the case and said he has been cooperating with the agency. Sharma sought permission to speak and told court, “I am not involved in the crime. I have been made a scapegoat in the fight between two lobbies in the police department. I don’t know these two people who have been arrested along with me. If I was involved, why would I be sleeping in my house, I would have run away. I only know Santosh Shellar as he has been my informant for 12 years.” Earlier, NIA arrested four other cops: Waze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane and former constable Vinayak Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sharma-was-at-conspiracy-meetings/articleshow/83618789.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Jaipur||Mixed response to CBSE Class XII evaluation formula||JAIPUR: The Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) formula for evaluation of marks, thus putting an end to the confusion among parents, schools and students. The move has evoked a mixed response among the stakeholders. Many parents are happy with the decision, however, many meritorious students have expressed their desire to appear for physical tests. Kavish Yadav, a student of Class XII (science), said, “I didn’t like the formula because usually we do not take Class XI examinations seriously. I will get low percentage this year if this formula is followed. I would want to sit for physical examinations whenever they are conducted.” Another student Shreya Kumari has positive outlook towards the results. She said that her parents and friends are happy with the decision given the fact danger physical examinations could pose to their lives. Parent of a child in Class XII Seema Saxena said that though she is happy that her daughter won’t have to appear for board examinations, she is worried about her results. “This is a positive step because I wasn’t sure about the physical examinations in pandemic, but this formula will not do justice to my daughter’s performance. She couldn’t score well in Class X board, but was expecting a better result in Class XII.” This is a dilemma parents have been facing for a long time. There have been cases in the past when students not getting more than 70% in Class X board come in merit list in Class XII board. Sunil Yadav, president of All Rajasthan Parents Forum, said that the decision of CBSE is good for average students but meritorious students will face difficulty. “I believe CBSE should conduct physical examination to satisfy students who couldn’t score well. Most students are happy as now they won’t have to study but students who genuinely worked hard should be given a chance,” said Yadav. Ruchira Solanki (CEO, Tagore Public School) After analysing the marking formula, I feel there couldn’t be a better way to do it. It has been balanced by including pre-Covid era & post-Covid XII pre-board examination and practical where all the learning was mostly online. The only flaw seems to be Class XI marks where students are not very focused on academic performance in school & start preparing for various competitive examinations Abhishek Jain (Spokesperson of Rajasthan Abhibhavak Sangh) The moderation committee will consist of two schoolteachers which will look into the difference in marking mechanism adopted by schools. Looking at the sour relationship between parents and schools since 2020 due to fees issue, it would have been better if parents were also made part of the committee. This will help students to get marks without any biasedness on part of schools. Damodar Goyal (President of Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan) The formula by CBSE is just an eyewash and there are many complications. Around 10% students change their stream in Class XII or change different schools in Class XI and XII. How is CBSE going to evaluate them? Taking Class X and XI marks into consideration is not right as many students perform exceptionally well in Class XII board. This will have negative impact on good students in future. Ashok Vaid (Head of Sahodaya Group of Schools) This is a very rational and systematic approach by CBSE given the current circumstances in the country. It covers every aspect of students’ performance and it seems very reliable, fair and transparent. I hope this will serve its purpose for students who have faced a lot of challenges in the pandemic as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mixed-response-to-cbse-class-xii-evaluation-formula/articleshow/83618685.cms||---

Locals as well as those from surrounding areas have started visiting the place to catch the glimpse of the water body. It was inaugurated by the Portuguese in 1960. When the water level drops in summer, people from Borimoll ward walk through the shallow waters of the dam basin to reach Quepem, though a bit risky -- being the shortest route. With the river overflowing, water level has reached a danger mark near the Paroda bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kushawati-dam-level-rises-to-danger-mark/articleshow/83618708.cms||---
---||Bhopal||BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya seeks President’s rule in West Bengal||BHOPAL: BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya has demanded President's rule in West Bengal as around 45 party workers have lost their lives in post-poll violence in the state. He said BJP workers are being attacked and law and order has collapsed. The BJP leader also hit out at the Congress and said that the party will not come to power in thenext 50 years, hence there is no question of reversing Article 370.  "After assembly results in West Bengal, at least 45 BJP workers have been killed in post poll violence. BJP workers are being attacked at polling booths where the party had won. Threrefore, President's rule should be imposed in the state. The only problem is how to impose President's rule against the government that was won just two months back," Vijayavargiya told reporters after meeting former minister Jaibhan Singh Pawaiya at the latter's residence in Gwalior, on Thursday. He rejected the claim that BJP had been routed in the West Bengal polls. "We have wiped out opposition parties, including Congress and Left parties. The party's performance in West Bengal was impressive. Winning 77 seats is not a loss for the BJP," he said.  The BJP leader also paid tributes to Balwant Singh, father of Pawaiya, who passed away recently after a brief illness. The meeting between the two leaders has triggered speculations about appointments in boards and corporations and resentment among party leaders after the announcement of the new state working committee. Vijayavargiya, however, termed it a formal meeting between two leaders. Replying to queries on Congress leader Digvijaya Singh's remarks over reversing Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP leader said that Congress is unlikely to return to power soon. "Digvijaya Singh speaks only for the sake of publicity. There is nothing more than this," he said. On Congress allegations of corruption in Ayodhya land purchase, he said, "They talk about scam in the purchase of land, while the seller of the land is a Muslim," he said. When asked about CM, Vijayavargiya said, "Chouhan is our leader and is doing good work. But will he be CM till 2023-24 is a hypothetical question. I am not an astrologer," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/kailash-vijayavargiya-seeks-presidents-rule-in-bengal/articleshow/83616302.cms||---

In its official reply, the Parivahan portal of the ministry of road transport and highways states that the issue is related to the Aadhaar service and suggests updating demographic details on the Aadhar card first. Sanjay Metrewar, the regional transport officer, Aurangabad, said the issue was discussed during the state-level review meeting. “The National Informatics Centre (NIC) that looks after e-governance services of the government has been apprised about the issue and the necessary solution is expected shortly. In the meantime, applicants are requested to update demographic details,” he said. As per preliminary analysis carried out by authorities, the applicant whose Aadhaar details do not have a mention of ‘son of’ or ‘wife of ‘were largely facing the issue in necessary enrolment on Parivahan portal. The local authorities, however, said filling up details such as ‘son of' or ‘wife of' were no longer part of enrolment for Aadhaar. “Such entries were possible earlier, but now such details cannot be incorporated while registering for Aadhaar,” said Jai Patil, in charge of the local civic body run Aadhaar centre. Metrewar said the feedback to this effect would be submitted to NIC and the state-level authorities. “The registration on Parivahan portal for getting learner’s driving license can be done without Aadhaar authentication also, which requires a visit to the Regional Transport Office,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/insufficient-info-on-aadhaar-becomes-a-snag-to-get-licence/articleshow/83611395.cms||Prasad Joshi

He announced that from July 1 to 3, there will be a vaccination campaign across the state,” Jitu Patwari said, speaking to reporters at the state Congress office. “Then it was announced that the vaccination campaign will start from June 21. Every day, there are announcements of new campaigns and dates,” Patwari said. He said that contrary to the chief minister’s claims, there is crisis of vaccines in the state. “In my constituency, there are three vaccination centres and are closed because there is no vaccine,” Patwari claimed. “Actually, reports are that 25% people have got their first vaccination dose while only 3.5% got the second dose. The summary of all the speeches, events, photos and visuals are these numbers. The chief minister also made an announcement that 5.5 crore people in the state will get free ration through PDS. This means that out of 7.5 crore population, 5.5 crore are poor. This is this government’s real image,” the former minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cong-urges-govt-to-speed-up-vaccination/articleshow/83616341.cms||---

The survey, being conducted by Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH), started with the collection of blood samples of the residents of various clusters, including slums, tenements and housing societies in 32 wards. “We have formed around 200 clusters, of which 120 are in housing societies, 40 in tenements and 40 in the slum areas,” Atul Desale, the principal investigator and assistant professor, department of community medicine, YCMH, said, adding that on the first day of the survey, around 1,000 people’s blood samples were collected. Desale said the prevalence of seropositivity would help identify the current spread of the infection. The ongoing sero survey would be much more extensive in nature and include more research activities due to vaccination as an added factor, he added. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI, “We encountered opposition from slum residents about the survey, but after convincing by our teams, the residents cooperated. They were apprehensive about the medical teams entering their areas, but after proper consultation, the issue was resolved.” Sanjay Patil, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) hospital board of India, said, “Now that almost 40% of our target population has been vaccinated with the first jab, it could give us a better idea of how many people were affected by the infection.” The first survey by PCMC, carried out from October 7-17 last year, found 34% of the surveyed had antibodies, suggesting extensive spread in slums, tenements, and large societies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-largest-sero-survey-begins-in-pimpri-chinchwad/articleshow/83616328.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The RTDC employee association president Tej Singh Rathore said that they will protest and start a movement against any move to lease out the units of the corporation. The previous government had started an exercise to privatize the hotels. But after the Congress came to power, the privatization or leas out attempt was put into cold storage. In an attempt to revive, RTDC was allowed to open IMFL liquor shops. But now, Rathore said there is a fresh attempt again in the government to lease out the hotels. “If the department goes ahead with its plan to lease out the units, we will launch a state-wide agitation,” added Rathore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rtdc-employees-to-protest-against-hotels-leasing-out/articleshow/83618735.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: No headway in Gandhi Path firing, but cops suspect personal grudge||JAIPUR: A day after a 41-year-old man was shot at by masked men near Gandhi Path area on Wednesday; police teams following leads on suspects said the shooting may have been a result of some personal grudge. The officials of city police said none of the two gunmen could be identified even 24 hours after the accused shot at Aditya Jain. The sources, however, said that the prima facie probe indicates that some personal reasons may be in the backdrop to the Wednesday’s attack. Police had spoken to Jain after he sustained bullet injury on his hand, the clues shared by Jain. “He worked as a car washer in the city and his family runs a tiffin centre. There was no motive for gain involved in the attack; therefore, the other possibilities could include some personal or family reasons,” the official said, adding that Jain had come to Jaipur eight months ago from Mumbai. “We are also examined if he had any fall out with anyone while working in Mumbai,” an official said. The police, however, could not confirm whether the bike-borne gunmen were contract assassins. One of the teams that had visited the spot soon after the attack had hinted at the possibility of shooting as an exercise to warn or “scare off,” Jain. “About three rounds were fired, of which one bullet struck at Jain’s hand. It could mean that attempt was not organise a hit on Jain to bump him off but to scare or cajole him. But these all are presumptions at this juncture,” the official said, adding that the accused on the bike doesn’t appear to be a rookie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-headway-in-gandhi-path-firing-but-cops-suspect-personal-grudge/articleshow/83618732.cms||---

This in response to a PIL seeking cancellation of the mining contract because it would lead to cutting of more than 2 lakh trees in the forest, which would ruin the ecological balance in the Bundelkhand region. The PIL filed by an advocate, Sudeep Singh Sainy, read, “382 hectare land has been leased out to the company for 50 years. The diamond mining project would lead to complete destruction of Buxwah forests, which would affect not only the human lives in the Bundelkhand region but also the wildlife in the forests. Describing the project to be an environmental catastrophe, the petitioner said that forests take hundreds of years to develop, they provide shelter to the wild animals and oxygen to human beings. If the forests and wildlife is destroyed at Buxwaha, ecological balance in the region would also be destroyed.” After a preliminary hearing, the division bench of Justice Mohd Rafiq and Justice V K Shukla issued notices to the respondents while placing the case for further hearing on June 21.

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Evergreen ghazals of Fayyaz Hashmi, Bashir Badr at Gamak||BHOPAL: It was a heady mix of monsoon and music, which captivated the attention of music lovers as they enjoyed ‘Sham-e-ghazal’ on Thursday, streaming live on social media platforms. The virtual musical treat was organised by department of culture, MP, and presented by Urdu Academy of the state. Organised under the banner of Gamak, the event saw young ghazal singer Ahmed Raza and his group giving an evening to remember to music buffs. The bouquet of ghazals chosen by Raza was really wonderful; from Bashir Badr to Javed Akhtar and Fayyaz Hashmi, he sung some soulful ghazals of all these shayars with finesse. Old classical ghazals like ‘Ranjish hi sahi’, were treated with due respect; Raza deftly handled the finer nuances of this timeless piece with aplomb. Well-known shayara and director of Urdu Academy, Nusrat Mehdi, expressed happiness over the way young singers are experimenting with this genre. “Young singers today are hand-picking the best of traditional and contemporary to carve a unique path for themselves, instead of following the cliched and redundant norms. This is what indicates that ghazal is safe and will soon catapult to greater heights.” Nusrat revealed that among the virtual listeners, there are a lot of youngsters, who are opening new vistas for ghazals. When there are listeners for a particular variety of music, it not only survives but also thrives. It also motivates the singers to experiment more with their art,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/evergreen-ghazals-of-fayyaz-hashmi-bashir-badr-at-gamak/articleshow/83616385.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

According to minority affairs minister Nawab Malik, the hostel would help the girls from minority communities to pursue higher education from the university without worrying about accommodation. Students from Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain and other religious communities would get the benefit of the new facility. “A tender notice would be issued and after completion of administrative formalities, the actual work would start soon. We’ve approved a budget of Rs14.82 crore for the building,” the minister said. The decision to build hostels for students from the minority communities in all the districts of the state as well was taken by the minority development department headed by Malik, also the senior NCP spokesperson. “Nagpur is a major educational centre in Vidarbha. Students from rural as well as urban areas from all over the state arrive here to pursue education. But many from poor strata of the society are at a disadvantage due to lack of accommodation. Many times, it leads to girls dropping out of higher education. To prevent it, it has been decided to build special girls hostels in cities having good education facilities,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-grants-approval-for-minority-girls-hostel-in-nu/articleshow/83616382.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Day after ‘failed’ talks, government corporatizes Ordinance Factory||NAGPUR: Trade unions in ordnance factories were taken by surprise after the Union cabinet took a decision to corporatize the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). The OFB, which is a government department at present, will be now made a public corporation and split into seven entities. So far talks were under way between the government and unions through Central Labour Commissioner (CLC). On June 15, the CLC filed a failure report, which means the negotiaitons have failed. This happened abruptly without consulting us in final stages, said the union leaders and added that the very next day cabinet cleared corporatization of the OFB. The three unions, including Left-leaning All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF), Congress’ Indian National Defence Workers’ Federation, and RSS’ Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMPS), plan to hold a meeting on Sunday. Measures including launching an indefinite strike will be discussed during the meet. During an earlier strike in August 2019, the unions had declared another indefinite strike from October 12 last year. This was soon followed by negotiaitons. Both government and unions had decided not to take any step till conciliatory proceedings were under way before the CLC. The status quo was maintained under the section 33(1) of Industrial Disputes Act under which none of the parties take any step till the discussions are on. However, on June 11 a meeting was held between the representatives of the three unions. “The government side was represented by the joint secretary (land systems) Puneet Arora. The government now took a stance that corporatization was a policy decision and a non-negotiable issue with the unions,” said C Srikumar, general secretary of AIDEF. “On June 15, the CLC filed a failure report without consulting the unions,” he said and addded even requests to hold the final meeting after June 18 were ignored. R Srinivasan, general secretary of INDWF, said, “The hurry to close the case was evident. Minutes of the June 11 meeting were released late in the night, which had a mention of a meeting with CLD on June 15. No such discussions actually took place in the meet however.” Later, the unions wrote to the CLC asking that the meeting can be held after June 18, as the representatives needed time to respond. There was no response and CLC went ahead with the failure report on June 15. This was confirmed by Mukesh Singh, general secretary of BPMS. Unions cannot immediately go ahead with an indefinite strike because Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) has been evoked. The order will continue till June 24. “Till then the no strike can be held,” said Singh. “During the protests we will also highlight the case of Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited, the joint venture for setting up a plant to build AK-203 rifles at Amethi. It has been two years since the stone-laying ceremony but the production has not started. There are no unions here to delay the project,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/day-after-failed-talks-govt-corporatizes-of/articleshow/83618537.cms||Shishir Arya

Five fire tenders took over four hours to contain the blaze in Vishal Fireworks on the Vangaon-Dahanu Road. A group of workers were erecting sheds for monsoon and welding work was underway. The sparks from the welding machines are believed to have hit the raw materials used to make firecrackers. The sound of the explosions could be heard five to six kms away from the village. Fire personnel, police and district disaster management officials had to wait at a distance as the explosions continued for a while. The Dahanu police registered a case under section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of the IPC against the factory owner. — Sandhya Nair||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/explosion-at-firecracker-factory-in-dahanu-5-hurt-in-mumbai/articleshow/83618800.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Former junior played key role in Pradeep Sharma's arrest||MUMBAI: Encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma is close to several influential politicians in the state and Centre, but none could save him this time. It is believed that Sharma’s former junior officer-turned-rival played a crucial role in un-earthing his role in the explosives case which culminated in his arrest. When they had worked together in crime br-anch, differences started between them over informants, which turned into rivalry. The officer during his st-int with state ATS, which first probed Mansukh Hiran’s murder, helped the NIA in gathering some of the crucial evidence that resulted in the arrest of assistant police inspector Sachin Waze and Sharma. A senior officer said Sharma always believed that he was a ‘supercop’ because of the support extended by some officers. “Later some of them dumped him when they realised that it was not in their interest to be associated with him. He failed to learn from his mistakes and paid a heavy price,” the officer said. In the late 90s, Sharma was at his peak as he gunned down several gangsters in encounters. He first courted con-troversy for the custodial death of Ghatkopar blast accus-ed Khwaja Yunus. He escaped unscathed, but Waze was sus-pended for 17 years; he was reinstated last year. In 2011, Sh-arma was arrested for the 2006 fake encounter of Chhota Rajan gang member Ramnarayan Gupta alias Lakhan Bhaiya. He was acquitted, but in the intervening period, the st-ate dismissed him for his alleged underworld links. He was reinstated following a court order. Sharma’s name also cr-opped up in the murder of An-il Bheda, prime witness in the Gupta fake encounter case. After his return to the force in 2017, he was posted to Th-ane where Param Bir Singh was police chief. All this while, he nurtured his dream of joining politics. In 2014, Sharma’s NGO PS Foundation put up his posters after he decided to contest the assembly election from Andheri (E). He met then BJP president Amit Shah for a ticket. But BJP, Sena, and RPI (A) contested the election jointly and the seat went to the Sena. Sharma filed his nomination as an independent declaring Rs 39 crore assets, but withdrew it. In July 2019, Sharma resigned from the force, a year before his retirement, and contested on a Sena ticket from Nalasopara. He lost. Sources said Sharma helped Sena keep a watch on its MLAs during the uncertainty over the government formation after the 2019 poll results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-former-junior-played-key-role-in-arrest-of-supercop/articleshow/83618877.cms||Vijay V Singh

The assistant district governor of Rotary Club, Anugrah Narain Sharma, said, “We have already given a proposal to the commissioner of Palamu division (Jata Shanker Chowdhury) in this regard.” He added, “This offer is applicable to those who have lost either their father or mother or both and their kin will to take the final call on whether they should accept our offer.” Asked if the Rotary Club has any idea as to how many children have become Covid orphans in the entire commissionary, which comprises Palamu, Latehar and Garhwa districts, Sharma said, “The club is in touch with the respective deputy commissioners in this regard. We have asked for the number of Covid orphans and of those, we have asked to let us know how many of them are willing to study in one of the two schools here (one is at Station road and the other is in Daltonganj).” When asked, deputy commissioner Shashi Ranjan said their recent household survey found that the death toll was around 1,400 in the last two months. “We are now trying to find out the number of children orphaned in the second wave of coronavirus,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/daltonganj-rotary-club-offers-free-edu-to-covid-orphans/articleshow/83617261.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Provide Rupa’s kin with security: Jharkhand high court tells Ranchi SSP||RANCHI: The Jharkhand High Court on Thursday ordered the Ranchi senior superintendent of police to ensure adequate security for the family members of Rupa Tirkey, former Sahebgunj Mahila Thana officer in-charge who allegedly killed herself last month. Justice S K Diwedi gave the order while hearing a criminal writ petition filed by Rupa’s father Devanand Tirkey. Rupa was found hanging in her official quarters on May 3. While the police in its investigation have concluded that her death was case of suicide, her father and her relatives have said that she was murdered by some bigshots in the bureaucracy. Devanand, in his petition, has raised doubts on police’s “perfunctory” investigation into his daughter’s death. He has also accused chief minister Hemant Soren’s representative Pankaj Mishra of being involved in Rupa’s death. The petition also seeks a probe into the assets acquired by Mishra which allegedly are disproportionate to his income. Besides filing a criminal writ petition, Devanand has also met the CM to demand a CBI probe into his daughter’s death. Meanwhile, the government counsel informed the court that an inquiry committee has been constituted to look into the case. The committee is being headed by a former justice of the high court. The bench was, however, not satisfied and made an oral observation that there is no provision of a committee overseeing an investigation done by the police. The state government has been directed to file a counter affidavit on the matter which will be heard again on July 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/provide-rupas-kin-with-security-hc-tells-ranchi-ssp/articleshow/83617171.cms||---

Last week cops had arrested four persons for circulating fake currency notes in village markets located along the Gujarat and Maharashtra border. Four accused Haridas alias Haresh Chaudhary, Krutesh alias Ajay Bochal, Jai Singh Valvi and Bhagvanta alias Bhagwan Gumbade who were involved in printing of the fake currency notes of Rs 500 denomination were arrested on Wednesday. These accused use to and circulate the fake currency in the market through their four accomplices, who were nabbed last week. Police said that Chaudhary and Bochal scanned the original notes and after minor correction through software, used to print fake currency notes. The fake notes were then handed over to Valvi and Gumbade. “The accused had formed a chain of circulation wherein one would keep some notes with himself and pass on the remaining to the other,” said a police official. Four others who were arrested last week were also responsible for circulating the notes. Police said that they used to circulate the notes in the villages on Gujarat-Maharashtra border and local markets along with original notes to avoid any suspicion. So far, police have seized 300 fake currency notes from the accused. During investigation, it was found that Chaudhary and Bochal were the masterminds of the racket. In the past, Chaudhary was arrested under the Prohibition Act by Saputara and Waghai police. Bochal, a BSc graduate, joined hands with Chaudhary to make some quick money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/masterminds-of-fake-currency-racket-nabbed-from-nashik/articleshow/83613262.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Mass Covid testing in seven bordering districts of Jharkhand on June 22||RANCHI: Seven districts of Jharkhand that share their borders with neighbouring states will undertake mass Covid-19 testing drive on June 22, the state health department has said. The administrations of Bokaro, East Singhbhum, Hazaribag, Koderma, Ramgarh, Ranchi and Lohardaga districts have been directed to test at least 1.2 lakh people in the drive through rapid antigen testing (RAT) kits. “The administrations are required to test all people arriving from neighbouring states, senior citizens and people with co-morbidities on priority. All the symptomatic patients, who have tested negative through RAT, are to be put through RT-PCR tests,” the directive stated. Ranchi, Ramgarh, Bokaro and Dhanbad share their borders with West Bengal while Koderma and Hazaribag share their borders with Bihar. East Singhbhum shares its borders with West Bengal and Odisha. The districts have been identified on their high testing positivity rate (TPR) which is above 4%. Even though home isolation is mandatory for people arriving from outside the state, many passengers are giving the health and administrative officials a slip at the railway stations and at the inter-state check posts. The district administrations have also been directed to keep their medical facilities and Covid-19 care centres on standby for the hospitalizations of patients who test positive during the drive. Notably, the state government has scrapped the provision of home isolation for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients and mandated their stay at the CCCs till the time of recovery. “Although we have less than 3,000 active cases at the moment, there can be a surge any moment, especially with the gradual reopening of economic activities. So it is essential that there is no laxity on our part and such testing drives are conducted at frequent intervals,” a senior health official said. Of the total active cases, nearly 2,500 are asymptomatic. Siddarth Tripathy, the nodal officer of the IEC wing, on Thursday said the civil surgeons of all 24 districts have been formally instructed to conduct RT-PCR and TruNat tests of people who tested negative in RAT during the intensive public health survey (IPHS) conducted across 2.2 crore people living in rural areas between May 25 and June 5. Around 2.08 lakh people were put through RAT during the drive, of which less than 1,000 people tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mass-cov-testing-in-seven-bordering-dists-on-june-22/articleshow/83617356.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The PCV vaccination programme will be effective in preventing pneumonia-like complications among our children, should a third wave come." Health secretary Arun Kumar Singh said, "So far, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh have inducted PCV in their routine immunization programmes.” According to the programme, two doses of PCV will be administered to the infants through government-run medical colleges, hospitals, sub-divisional hospitals, community and primary health centres for free. The protocols mandate that infants will be given two doses on the sixth and ninth week after their birth and a booster dose when they are nine months old. Singh added, “PCV is an expensive vaccine and each dose costs around Rs 1,600 in open markets. Now, it will be a free vaccine in the state.” Gupta launched the programme from his official residence in Doranda and oversaw the inoculation of a two-month infant named Ananya Kumari, who was brought for the jab by her mother Neha Devi, a Ranchi resident, during the launch. The PCV prevents pneumococcus, a disease caused by a bacteria named Streptococcus pneumoniae. The disease kills over 1.2 lakh infants in the country every year, according to the Union health ministry. The bacteria spread through the air and causes breathing ailments, fever, and cough among infants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-inducts-pcv-in-routine-vax-prog/articleshow/83616258.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Talking to TOI, education secretary Rajesh Sharma said, “JAC has forwarded us the evaluation pattern which they worked out after consultation with different stakeholders but we are yet to go through it. In next two days, we are hoping to finalise the modalities of evaluating matric and intermediate students.” Sharma added that they had provided a broad guideline to JAC on devising the evaluation pattern. “As per the board guidelines, JAC will take into account the practical exams and 30% weightage will be given to that marks. About 91% of the students have already taken the practical exams, which were conducted before the curbs kicked in and so we will consider those marks. Apart from this, 20% marks will be based on internal evaluation which will be done by a three-member team of teachers. The remaining will probably be based on the past results of Classes 9 and 11.

The officials of the building construction department requested the company to provide the map but as it failed to comply, a new map had to be drawn up and sent for approval to the tourism department. Sources said that Rs 4.5 crore was sanctioned for the construction of a museum here as many archaeological findings dating back to the 9th century have been kept in a room at the temple premises. Itkhori is an ancient centre of confluence for three religions — Hinduism, Jainisim and Buddhism. The state government had plans to develop the place as a tourist hotspot and it decided to construct a museum, a giant prayer wheel, a mega gate, restaurants and parks, among others. A temple committee member said, “After the consultant company readied the map, the tourism department awarded the tender to a Ramgarh-based agency. The agency started the work seven months ago and finished construction till the plinth level. But now in the absence of the map, it has became tough to continue further construction. For the last two months, the agency has been forced to cease work.” The executive engineer of the building construction department, Amit Kumar, said they have map till the plinth level only. “The department has made a new map and sent it for approval to the tourism department.” Sources said that the deadline to complete the work was two years and if a new map was not provided soon, it will delay the entire project. However, officials said they were trying to get the approval at the earliest so as to finish the project on time. After completion, this will be the second biggest state-of-the-art museum in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lack-of-map-delays-construction-work-of-itkhori-temple-museum/articleshow/83617381.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Two girls from Jharkhand in Tokyo Olympics hockey team||GUMLA/RANCHI: Two women hockey players from Jharkhand — Nikki Pradhan from Khunti district and Salima Tete from Simdega — were named on Thursday as part of the Indian women hockey squad for the Tokyo Olympics which is scheduled for next month. The news brought cheers to the entire state, particularly among the sports fraternity, amid the sombre environment of the Covid-19 pandemic. This will be Nikki’s second stint in Olympics, the first feat by any female hockey player from Jharkhand. She was part of the Indian team in the 2016 Rio Olympics by becoming the first woman hockey player to represent this tribal heartland. Salima, on the other hand, is the first female player from Simdega to make the cut into the Olympic circuit after 40 years, Hockey Jharkhand officials said. In the past, only two male hockey players from Simdega — Michael Kindo and Sylvanus Dungdung -- took part in Olympics. “Salima is now the third hockey player from Simdega district to represent India in the Olympics. Michael Kindo was part of Munich Olympics in 1972 and Sylvanus Dungdung was a member of the gold-winning Indian team in the 1980 Moscow Olympics,” said a jubilant president of Hockey Simdega, Manoj Konbegi. Talking to TOI, Salima said that she never gives up hope. “I focused on my game and tried to do my best during practice matches with other players. I hail from a remote village in Simdega and am happy for making it to the squad. I would like to thank my family for believing in me.” Salima, along with Nikki and their teammates, is at the Centre of Excellence for Hockey in Bengaluru. Notably, Salima captained the national women's side which won silver at the 2018 Youth Olympics. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had congratulated her and the team for their performance. Nikki, on the other hand, said dealing with the pandemic has been tough but she is happy to have remained free of any infection since March last year. “I took both my vaccine doses,” she said over the phone, adding that throughout their stint at the Bengaluru centre since last year, they remained confined to their training centre. “None of us ever ventured out of the training centre for over a year now due to fear of infection. All team remained at the camp, maintaining proper protocols both on and off the field. It’s frustrating at times, but we couldn’t afford to lose focus. The real battle will begin now,” Nikki said, adding that she had come to her home (Ranchi) only a few times in the last month. “Luckily, my family members, too, remained free of Covid-19 so far,” she said. Asked about the team’s preparedness, Nikki said, “The team is in good shape but unlike the pre-Covid era, we couldn’t play exposure matches to improve our skills. But the support staff of the team is very good in keeping us with a good frame of mind. We are also practising hard.” Jharkhand Hockey president Bholanath Singh said, “We had faith in both the girls that they would be selected for the Olympics. They were doing well in the national team for the last two years.” (With inputs from ASRP Mukesh)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-girls-from-state-in-oly-hockey-team/articleshow/83616139.cms||K A Gupta

Finance minister Rameshwar Oraon in his letter to Union ministry of Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Piyush Goyal sought immediate release of Rs 180 crores pending with Food Corporation of India (FCI) in lieu of paddy procurement from farmers. Oraon, who also in-charge of the state food, public distribution and consumer affairs department, accused FCI of high-handedness and being apathetic towards the farmers at a time when many are battling financial crisis due to covid-19 pandemic. With onset of monsoon and commencement of kharif season, non-payment of money to farmers is further posing hardships to them, he noted. According to Oraon, state government procured 4.6 lakh metric tons of paddy in 2020-21 season on minimum support price (MSP) for there is a requirement of Rs 943.21 crores to make payments to farmers. “State has already paid Rs 568.50 crores so far of which FCI only gave Rs 162 in lieu of the stocks it received from the rice mills. Currently, Rs 374.1 crore is pending to farmers in the state of which Rs 180 is due with FCI. Despite numerous reminders and letters, officials here are non-responsive. We have also been receiving several complaints from the field against apathetic attitude of FCI officials towards farmers concerns. It is therefore, requested for your proactive steps to ensure FCI remits the amount soon in the interest of farmers of our state,” Oraon wrote. Talking to TOI on the other hand, agriculture minister and Jarmundi MLA Badal Patralekh following a review meeting today, said that out of 9,02,603 farmers identified for farm loan waivers, they have already disbursed funds in tune of Rs 980 crore to banks for 2,46,012 farmers. “The figures are as on date. Despite the covid-19 pandemic, state government is fulfilling its promise of loan waivers up to Rs 50,000. Of about total 9 lakh farmers, Aadhar seeding of 5,51,265 bank accounts are done by the banks. Of this, details of 2,73,265 are already uploaded by the banks and money for 2,46,012 which is in tune of Rs 980 crore is already disbursed,” said Badal, adding that e-KYC of remaining accounts are underway by banking correspondents to release further funds. “Not only this, of the total target of 44,000 quintals of distribution of kharif seeds to farmers this monsoon, we have already achieved over 68%. Considering the demand, we have placed further order for 6,000 quintals of seeds,” he added, criticizing BJP for doing politics over the farmers issue in the state. “BJP has 12 out of 14 MPs in Jharkhand but hardly anyone has raised voice against FCI, which is a central government agency, for its negligent attitude towards farmers of our state. Unlike BJP, our government speaks on the facts,” he said. BJP on the other hand has planned to hit farmlands across the state from 8am-11am against state government for pending payments to farmers in lieu of paddy procurement, farm loans among others. Party president Deepak Prakash said, “Maintaining social distancing, BJP workers will hit to farmlands across the state to fight for them against this anti-farmers, anti-poor government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-mins-step-up-heat-on-bjp-ahead-of-latters-farm-protest/articleshow/83616159.cms||ASRP Mukesh

About seven lakh students had enrolled for this year’s matric and intermediate exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/jac-marking-pattern-for-class-x-xii-pupils-submitted-to-edu-dept/articleshow/83625847.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The accused were nabbed from Padra with 994 gm of mephedrone (MD) worth nearly Rs 1 crore. According to the NCB, their team had received specific information on the basis of which they conducted the raid. “The drug commands a huge price in the international market and seizure in such quantity is not common,” NCB officials said. Of the seven accused, two are women. NCB sleuths said that the drugs were sourced from Maharashtra and the accused were planning to sell them in Gujarat for local consumption. Two cars and Rs 7.5 lakh cash was also seized during the raid. The investigators are trying to ascertain if any other person was involved in the racket. The focus is on busting the local network too. “With this seizure, we have busted a major MD selling racket in the state,” the officials added. Two months ago too, the NCB had seized MD worth about Rs 3 lakh from a car near Karjan toll plaza. One man was arrested from the car that was travelling from Mumbai to Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/seven-held-with-mephedrone-worth-rs-1-crore-in-padra/articleshow/83611994.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Minister Botcha Satyanarayana defends new property tax system||GUNTUR: Strongly defending the state government’s move to rationalise property taxes in urban areas, municipal administration and urban development minister Botcha Satyanarayana said it’s the most scientific system to determine property tax. Reacting to protests being held in various parts of the state against the new tax regime, he said the government is ready for a public debate on the issue. “The government took all issues into consideration before deciding to introduce the value-based property tax system, which was found to be most scientific way of levying taxes. All district collectors and municipal commissioners have been told to ensure that the rise in taxes should not be more than 15%,” the minister said. He added that the government stands to gain an additional revenue of Rs 186 crore from the new tax system. “The government studied the prevailing tax systems in other states before formulating the new tax structure. We have decided to levy 0.2 to 0.5% tax on the value of residential properties, and 0.2 to 2% on commercial structures. The new system will put a full stop on all kinds of irregularities and anomalies in levying of taxes at the field level,” Botcha said, while adding that all structures owned by the poor would be exempted from the tax revision. Later during the day, the minister inspected a waste-to-energy plant being constructed by Jindal Power on the outskirts of Guntur city. “The project will generate 15mw of power from garbage collected from nine municipal towns in the district. It will become a game-changer in the management of solid waste in the state. A similar project would be launched in Visakhapatnam soon. The civic bodies have been told to take measures to segregate wet and dry garbage at the collection points itself to scientifically manage the waste,” Botcha explained. Electric vehicles are being procured for collection of garbage through Swachh Andhra Corporation. “Handing of garbage has become crucial in balancing the ecological system. We are launching ‘Clean AP’ mission on July 8 across the state. Our target is to make all cities and towns in AP garbage and litter-free,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/botcha-defends-new-property-tax-system/articleshow/83614468.cms||Samdani MN

The foundation for the project was laid by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on July 8, 2020. The project comprises installation of a 125ft-tall statue of Dr BR Ambedkar, a park and a memorial library. The government has set a two-year deadline for the project and announced that the statue will be unveiled by April 2022. The PWD grounds are spread across 20 acres land of which five acres houses irrigation quarters, municipal offices, a polytechnic college and a rythu bazaar. The district administration has directed concerned departments to search for alternate sites for their offices. J Nivas, who took over as district collector recently, has set a one-week deadline for vacating the offices on PWD grounds. He has also directed officials to demolish the constructions. Agriculture marketing authorities have been directed to move the Swaraj Maidan rythu bazaar to a park site on the banks of Bandar canal adjacent to Krishna Lanka police station. Meanwhile, Dalit groups have welcomed the speeding up of the project works. “We are happy that the AP government decided to establish a memorial park for Dr BR Ambedkar in the centre of the city.

---||Visakhapatnam||With new technology, Andhra Pradesh to turn into mud crab cultivation hub||VISAKHAPATNAM: The state is all set to dominate mud crab cultivation. With steady rise in demand, Marine Products Exports Development (MPEDA) is focusing on better yield. According to MPEDA, East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishana and Guntur districts have a lot of brackish water ponds, suitable for mud crab culture. MPEDA has supplied over 60 per cent of the total 650 tonnes mud crab seeds to Andhra Pradesh. MPEDA has decided to promote mud crab farming which would not only contribute to a considerable component of coastal fisheries but also provide a source of income for fishermen. Mud crabs are known for their high flesh content and rapid growth rate in captivity. A fully-grown mud crab weighs over 1,200 gms. Live mud crabs are in demand in global market. Depending on the size (500 gms, 1,000 gms, above 1,000 gms), prices vary from Rs 600 to Rs 1,200 per kg. Mud crabs are much in demand in South East Asian countries where live crabs are highly preferred as delectable seafood. “At present, the area under the mud crab cultivation in Andhra Pradesh is over 5,000 hectares. We are expecting that Andhra Pradesh will dominate mud crab production and export in the coming days,” said Dr N Babu Rao, assistant project manager at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Aquaculture (RGCA), a research and development wing of MPEDA. MPEDA has identified several areas in four to five districts in the state that have huge potential to cultivate mud crabs scientifically known as scylla serrata. MPEDA also supplies feed. Andhra Pradesh is estimated to produce over 2,000 tonne mud crabs in 2021. MPEDA-RGCA’s mud crab hatchery technology, the only one-of-its kind in the country, has been granted patent by the Controller General of Patent, Design and Trade Marks, Government of India, for 20 years from 2011 to 2030, said MPEDA chairman K S Srinivas. The hatchery technology for mud crab has been developed by RGCA. Srinivas said it was a remarkable achievement in the history of Indian aquaculture as for the first time the central government has granted patent for this technology. It will go a long way in meeting seed requirements of farmers who intend to undertake diversified species for aquaculture instead of concentrating on shrimp farming alone, he said. MPEDA is dedicating this achievement to aquaculture farmers for their support and to young scientists at RGCA, said Srinivas, who is also president of RGCA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/with-new-tech-andhra-to-turn-into-mud-crab-cultivation-hub/articleshow/83614734.cms||Nalla.Babu

The single judge bench of Justice M Ranga Rao directed the state to call for fresh tenders and cancel the power purchase agreements. Tata Power Renewable Energy had moved the high court challenging the tenders called for setting up the solar power plants to meet the agriculture needs of the state. Tata Power submitted that the state government didn’t follow the provisions in the Electricity Act 2003 in preparing the request for selection (RFS) and draft of power purchase agreement (PPA). Advocates D Prakash Reddy and Kilaru Nitin Krishna, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the state government removed the enquiry rights of Electricity Regulatory Commission to verify the RFS and PPA. This will make the state government resolve the disputes that arose with the power generation companies, they submitted, adding that this was against section 63 of Electricity Act 2003. They also submitted to the court that the power purchase agreement was made violating the guidelines issued by the Union energy ministry in bidding of PPAs and sought directions from the court to cancel the tenders and call for fresh tenders and PPA. Advocate general S Sriram, appearing for the government, argued that the guidelines were framed considering the benefits of farmers. He submitted that it is not correct to challenge the tender process once it is completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-cancels-apgecls-solar-power-plant-tenders/articleshow/83614807.cms||Venu Lanka

Aiming to achieve the target set by Union minister Nitin Gadkari, MahaMetro wants to finish the concrete road, viewing gallery project and musical fountain light and sound show by August 15. In a press release issued on Wednesday, MahaMetro said work on viewing gallery and cement road project is progressing fast. “By August 15, the viewer’s gallery and multimedia show will most likely be ready. The multimedia show will be of 30 minutes duration. The first ten minutes will be focusing on the history of Nagpur city and another 20 minutes will be musical and light show. While the commentary has been penned by eminent lyricist Gulzar, music has been composed by AR Rehman and Resul Pookutty,” said officials. Costing around Rs113 crore, the entire project is funded from Central Road Fund (CRF) and includes three components — viewing gallery with projector room, multi-level parking plaza and cement concrete road. “After completing gallery and fountain, we will focus on finishing multi-level parking plaza,” said officials. As per the release, the length of the gallery is 350 m and the seating capacity is 4,000. Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) is developing a multimedia laser show at Futala lake which people can watch from the gallery. “A projector room is being built besides the gallery for the show. There will be parking space near the gallery. It will have parking slots for 13 cars, 24 two-wheelers and 24 bicycles. Also, a multi-level parking will be built near the gallery so that people coming to watch the show can park their vehicles. It will be a mechanized puzzle parking. There will be 1,000 parking slots for cars and 305 slots for two-wheelers,” the release said. Earlier, Maha Metro, as per directions of Public Works Department (PWD), had planned to construct a road tunnel below the gallery. However, this tunnel was dropped in January 2019 and the final drawing approved by PWD in October 2019 did not include it. NIT’s consultant for the multimedia laser show had told Maha Metro that the tunnel wall below the gallery will have acoustics problems and other technical issues, following which MahaMetro prepared a new design. As per the new design a cement concrete road is being built behind the gallery instead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahametro-rushing-to-meet-aug-15-target-for-futala-viewing-gallery-musical-fountain/articleshow/83617423.cms||Manka Behl

Meena, a German Shepherd dog, who was a part of the city police’s dog squad for the last seven years, died on Wednesday after she developed an infection in her leg and was ill for the past few days. ‘Alert, smart and sensitive’ Meena was recently posted to guard one of the most popular tourist sites – Statue of Unity – that witnesses huge footfall with heavy VVIP movement including that of PM Narendra Modi. “After developing an infection, her condition worsened and we lost her on Wednesday. It’s a very sad moment for us as Meena was just eight-years-old,” said a police official, adding that the canine was brought in the police department in 2014 as a sniffer dog. Meena was also a part of the regular mock drills and demonstrations. “Her job was to secure all important event venues. She was an expert in explosive substances and could easily sniff them out. In every big ticket event with VVIP movements in and around the city, Meena would first secure the arena,” cops handling her said. Meena was cremated with full honours at the city police headquarters on Thursday. Her colleagues Samrat, a Doberman and Danny, a Labrador gave her a final salute in presence of policemen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/8-yr-old-police-dog-guarding-sou-dies-fighting-illness/articleshow/83612083.cms||---

The weekly daily average of vaccinations has increased to around 33 lakh doses in the current week from 30 lakh doses during June 7-13 and 26.86 in the first week of June (May 31-June 6). An average of 12.83 lakh doses were administered daily during May 18-23.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); However, the daily vaccinations are still below the level achieved in April when 30-45 lakh doses were being administered every day till about middle of the month before it dropped to 4-15 lakh in May. Overall, 26.86 crore doses of Covid vaccines have been administered in the country with around 23.43% of the adult population receiving at least one dose, whereas the coverage of first dose is above 40% among 45 plus.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); However, Co-Win data show more number of people in the 18-44 years age group are coming forward for vaccination. The rise in vaccination has also been accompanied with more number of sessions being organised, though majority of them are still in public health facilities with a wide disparity in private sector. The number of sessions too has been steadily increasing since beginning of June, after it dropped to below 20,000 in May. On June 15, more than 48,000 sessions were organised across the country. On Thursday, 42,749 sessions were completed till 9:30 pm. The Centre has asked states to mobilise private health facilities to participate in the vaccination drive and organise multiple sessions every day to ensure more access to people, particularly in Tier 2-3 cities and remote areas. Officials are hopeful that vaccination will pick up more pace later this month as supplies are likely to be more equitable and smooth once the programme is again centralised from June 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-vaccination-picks-up-after-a-drop-in-may/articleshow/83622976.cms||Sushmi Dey

The city also tops in complete vaccination with 17.6% or 41,452 getting both the shots. Babus’ city Gandhinagar was second with 77.3% of 2.19 lakh eligible population (17 lakh) getting first dose and 14.1% getting both the shots. On Thursday, Gujarat recorded a vaccination of 2.17 lakh for the first and 35,000 for the second shot, taking the cumulative numbers to 1.65 crore and 46.98 lakh respectively. Among Indian states, Gujarat ranks fourth in administering the first dose, second in fully vaccinated population, and third in overall (first and second doses) vaccination. The data however indicates an urban-rural divide – the eight municipal corporations in all recorded coverage of 45% population for at least first dose. For the rest of the districts, the figure was just 24.8% or 45% less. In all, one-third or 33.3% of Gujarat population is vaccinated for at least the first dose of vaccination. “The higher percentage of vaccination in urban areas is due to two factors – the initial phase of 18-44 years was just extended to seven municipal corporations and three districts. Moreover, the number of centres and level of awareness were found to be slightly higher among the cities,” said a senior health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jamnagar-gandhinagar-top-in-per-capita-vaccination-in-gujarat/articleshow/83622982.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Bengaluru||Unlock: Karnataka government to balance livelihoods and safety||BENGALURU: The state government is drawing up a comprehensive plan which will balance lifting of current lockdown restrictions with preparedness for a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections, health minister K Sudhakar claimed on Thursday. The state had imposed a total lockdown from the last week of April to flatten infections from a deadly second wave. The government had partially lifted curbs in some districts from the beginning of this week (June 14) and intends to relax more restrictions in a second instalment from Monday (June 21). However, Sudhakar insisted abundant caution is needed. “The process of a graded unlock and preparations for future Covid requirements should go together,” the minister said. “While considering partial relaxation for trade and service sectors, we are also focusing on preventive measures and preparations to combat an anticipated surge in cases.” Sudhakar is scheduled to hold a meeting with the Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC) on Friday, where recommendations to ease curbs as well as medical preparedness to tackle any fresh surge of infections will be discussed. The minister said the government is considering allowing hotels, restaurants, malls and non-essential shops to open with riders such as time restrictions and limited occupancy. “Even public transport could operate in a limited manner. A detailed notification regarding the next phase of unlock will be released in a day or two,” he said. The TAC has reportedly told the government to observe the impact of Unlock 1.0, in effect since June 14, for two weeks. The panel wants the government to study the level of infection and behaviour of the virus in the wake of the return of migrant workers before deciding on unlocking other sectors, especially ones where crowds could gather. While a third wave is anticipated in October-November, some experts have warned that it could hit as early as August. Sudhakar said the government is awaiting a report from the Dr Devi Shetty-headed panel on preparedness for the third wave. He said work on augmenting medical infrastructure is already on with the focus on paediatric care. CN Ashwath Narayan, deputy chief minister and chairman, Covid-19 task force, had held a meeting with BBMP officials on Wednesday to take stock of preparations in Bengaluru — a hotspot for infections. “We plan to set up 100-bed secondary hospitals in each assembly constituency and a tertiary hospital in every four constituencies, besides upgrading infrastructure in all primary health centres. Considering the urgency, we have fixed a tough self-imposed deadline of 15 days,” Narayan said. The plan entails retention of existing Covid hospitals, notwithstanding low occupancy at present, and roping in corporate entities to set up new hospitals. For instance, the Haj Bhavan Covid Care Centre, which has 100 HDU beds and 30 ICU beds, has only 10 patients, but the government wants to retain the facility. A 100-bed state-of-art hospital, sponsored by Boeing India and Selco Foundation, in Yelahanka is set to be inaugurated on Saturday. “Extensive vaccination coverage is another aspect of preparedness. Our aim is to ensure 50% of adults get at least one dose by next month,” said Gaurav Gupta, BBMP chief commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/unlock-karnataka-government-to-balance-livelihoods-and-safety/articleshow/83622993.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Mobile phone number is used to validate the registration process. Satheesh Amin had received his first shot on May 24 at a camp organised by the private company he works for in Bengaluru. No one else from his family had registered with his phone number. “On Wednesday, I received a feedback call asking me to rate the vaccination experience. I was too shocked and surprised and immediately disconnected the call,” Amin said. “I quickly logged into the Arogya Setu app to find out what happened and learnt that a person from Tumakuru had taken the vaccine on June 14 using my mobile number. The vaccination certificate of this person was uploaded on the dashboard of my page.” Amin said an SMS was also sent but he didn’t notice it. He said one Dileep TR, 45, took a dose of Covishield at the Bhramasandra primary health centre in Tumakuru. “I’m surprised because the mobile number is used to validate registrations for the vaccine on the website or app,” Amin said. “I have been trying to reach out to the helpline to rectify this mistake and have even sent a mail for which a response is awaited.” Dr Mohammed Tufail, medical officer and CoWin app supervisor in Dakshina Kannada admitted there have been several similar incidents in the district. “The vaccine beneficiary in Tumakuru may have registered on-site, which demands visual verification,” Dr Tufail said. “This is done by taking a picture of the beneficiary and his/her Aadhaar card. The man may have deliberately given the wrong mobile number or staff may have made a mistake and entered the wrong number. The problem is for the Tumakuru person because he does not have his vaccine certificate and a new profile will have to be created when he goes for the second dose.” Currently, the app allows the beneficiary to rectify name, age, date of birth, gender and error in the number mentioned on the ID card submitted. “We expect an update soon that will allow the district administration to make corrections based on a complaint from a user,” Dr Tufail said. “We have seen cases where incorrect details were filed when taking the first dose and we were forced to create a new profile when the person returned for the second dose. So, it is important for people to check their vaccine certificate the day they are vaccinated.” A similar incident was reported in Ernakulam recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tumakuru-resident-uses-udupi-mans-number-for-shot/articleshow/83623029.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||World||Putin praises summit result, calls Biden a tough negotiator||MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday praised the outcome of his summit with US President Biden and called him an astute and shrewd negotiator. The two leaders concluded three hours of talks on Wednesday at an opulent villa facing Lake Geneva by exchanging expressions of mutual respect but firmly restating their starkly different views on cyberattacks, the conflict in Ukraine, political dissent and other issues. At the same time, they announced an agreement to return each other’s ambassadors and mapped more talks on arms control and cybersecurity. Putin offered more praise of the US leader on Thursday in a video call with graduates of a government management school. Biden kept him on his guard with his savvy negotiating skills, Putin said. “He perfectly knows the matter,” Putin said. “He is fully concentrated and knows what he wants to achieve. And he does it very shrewdly.” He dismissed what he described as media attempts to cast Biden as physically frail, noting that the 78-year-old US president was in great shape. “The atmosphere was quite friendly,” he added. “I think we managed to understand each other, we managed to understand each other’s positions on key issues, they differ on many things and we noted the differences. We established areas and points where we can possibly bring our positions closer...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/putin-praises-summit-result-calls-biden-a-tough-negotiator/articleshow/83623010.cms||---
---||Chennai||In first meet, CM M K Stalin asks PM Narendra Modi to scrap NEET, drop oil exploration in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin, in his maiden meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after assuming charge, requested him to scrap NEET and drop plans to extend such entrance exams for admission to other courses. He also asked the PM to drop hydrocarbon and neutrino projects planned for the state. In a 25-minute meeting with the PM in New Delhi on Thursday, Stalin sought adequate allotment of vaccines and drugs for Tamil Nadu to fight Covid. The CM also demanded early commencement of vaccine production at HLL Biotech in Chengalpet and Pasteur Institute in Coonoor to overcome vaccine shortage. The PM assured his full support for development projects in the state and said he could be reached anytime, the CM said. Accompanied by water resources minister S Duraimurugan, chief secretary V Irai Anbu and DMK Parliamentary party leader T R Baalu, Stalin reached the PM's residence at Lok Kalyan Marg at 5pm. It was "happy and satisfactory," Stalin told reporters about the meeting later in the day at Tamil Nadu House in New Delhi. ‘Will stay friendly but firm on state’s rights’The state government chose not to release the full text of the 117-page memorandum submitted by Stalin to Modi. The DMK government’s demands included revival of Sethusamudram shipping canal project and Maduravoyal-Chennai Port elevated road project. While the first was dropped by the BJP government at the Centre, the latter was spiked by the AIADMK government. It has also sought setting up of the apex court bench in Chennai. Reacting to social media reports that the DMK government had agreed to implement the Chennai-Salem greenfield expressway project, the state government clarified that it had urged the Centre to drop the project. Stalin sought to point out to Modi that the Centre was not supplying adequate quantity of Covid vaccines to Tamil Nadu. “The PM assured us of supply. We have been speaking to the PM and ministers over phone. They tell their difficulties,” Stalin said, seeking to recall the Centre’s direction to not reveal details of vaccine shortage. Urging speedy construction of AIIMS in Madurai, the state government has also demanded that an AIIMS-like institution be set up in Coimbatore. On the farm front, the DMK government urged the Centre to repeal the three farm laws. It also demanded that the Citizenship Amendment Act, electricity amendment bill 2020, national education policy and the draft EIA notification 2020 be withdrawn. “He (the PM) assured us that he would consult the ministers and officials concerned and take a good decision,” the chief minister said, adding that his government would follow the principles of former chief minister M Karunanidhi when it comes to maintaining Centre-state relations. “We will extend a friendly hand for relationship and raise our voice for the rights.” Stalin said he had requested Modi to declare Tamil as official language of India, that the proceedings in the Madras high court be carried out in Tamil and also demanded that Thirukkural be named the national literature. On the release of seven Rajiv assassins, the chief minister said the state government had sent a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind after governor Banwarilal Purohit decided that the President was the competent authority to decide on remission of sentences. Stalin said the government would shut down Tasmac outlets in a phased manner akin to the previous AIADMK government’s policy. “Those who cast votes for us should remain happy and those who did not cast votes should feel sorry,” Stalin said, responding to queries about the 42 days of his governance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/in-first-meet-cm-m-k-stalin-asks-pm-narendra-modi-to-scrap-neet-drop-oil-exploration-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/83623088.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Two kids from Hyderabad, one from Bengaluru get world’s costliest drug: Rs 16 crore per dose||BENGALURU: Three girls aged below two who are suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disease caused by the loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord, have got a new lease of life with the world’s costliest medicine. The kids — one from Bengaluru and two from Hyderabad — were chosen through a lottery system by pharma major Novartis to get Zolgensma, a drug costing Rs 16 crore per dose. The single-dose injection given for gene therapy is said to be most effective in treating the condition. The three girls were administered the dose on Thursday evening at Bangalore Baptist Hospital. The kids were the lucky winners of the lottery done through a compassionate access programme by Novartis, the drug manufacturer. The hospital received the consignment on June 16 from the US. “This drug needs to be maintained at freezing temperatures and hence, it was sent on dry ice,” said Dr Madhuri Maganthi, head of department and paediatric geneticist, Bangalore Baptist Hospital. SMA is caused by the loss of nerve cells, which carry electrical signals from the brain to muscles. “The protein needed for this signalling is coded by a gene for which everyone has two copies — one from the mother and the other from the father. A child develops SMA only if both the copies are faulty. Without the treatment, this disease is ultimately fatal,” explained Dr Maganthi. At the Centre for Neuromuscular Excellence in Baptist, five have got the drug so far and two more from Bengaluru will be receiving it shortly. The team spearheaded by neuromuscular specialist Dr Ann Agnes Mathew and Dr Maganthi managed to apply for the drug with the manufacturer even during the pandemic. Earlier, a three-year-old Hyderabad boy Ayaansh Gupta, suffering from SMA was administered the Rs 16-crore injection, thanks to over 62,400 people contributing Rs 14.84 crore towards his treatment through a crowdfunding site. The remaining Rs 1.2 crore came from an international crowdfunding initiative and the boy's family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/at-rs-16-crore-per-dose-three-children-get-worlds-costliest-drug/articleshow/83623050.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||World||British charity flags Rudyard Kipling’s and Enid Blyton’s ‘racism’||LONDON: English author Enid Blyton — famed for children’s book series such as “Noddy” and “The Famous” Five” — and Rudyard Kipling — the “poet-champion of the British Empire” and the first English-language writer to get the Nobel Prize in Literature — are the latest authors to be censured by English Heritage, a charity that manages historical places. The charity has updated its blue plaque website entry about Blyton to say her work “has been criticised for its racism, xenophobia and lack of literary merit”. It cited her story “The Little Black Doll” from 1966 where the doll’s face is washed “clean” by rain. It also wrote that publishers Macmillan in 1960 refused to publish her story “The Mystery That Never Was”, citing a “faint but unattractive touch of oldfashioned xenophobia”. On Kipling, English Heritage acknowledged the writer’s “racist and imperialist sentiments” and referred to works like “The White Man’s Burden” and its message of the British Empire as a “civilising force”. The blue plaque on Blyton’s and Kipling’s homes, however, will stay. A spokesperson for English Heritage told TOI that the changes had been done in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. “Our website entries aim to provide a fuller picture of each person’s life.” The move drew criticism from some on social media. “I refuse to accept any criticism of Enid Blyton,” tweeted writer Aseem Chhabra. “I refuse to cancel how my childhood was shaped, with thrilling adventures, mysteries.” Filmmaker Pooja Bhatt tweeted: “Like millions of readers whose imagination was fuelled by her books, there goes my childhood I guess.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/british-charity-flags-rudyard-kiplings-and-enid-blytons-racism/articleshow/83623082.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Bengaluru||Rowdy on the run tried to blackmail Bengaluru cops||BENGALURU: Rowdy Rajesh alias Kariya, 37, who was arrested in Nepal by Bengaluru police on Monday, had called a few police inspectors and sub-inspectors and pressured them to drop his name from the FIR against him, investigation has revealed. A special team of south division police had traced Rajesh to a hotel in Pokahara, Nepal. Rajesh, who is facing seven criminal cases, had fled the city in December 2020 after police booked him in a case of conspiracy to murder. “I shall reveal your connections with rowdies and other anti-social elements, with land mafia in particular,” he was quoted as telling the officers. “Rajesh wanted to scare some cops and get cases, including the murder-conspiracy case, withdrawn. We’ll ask him to explain what all he knows about the nexus. If true, such personnel too will face the music,” an IPS officer said. Rajesh had spent more than Rs 1 lakh per month during the last six months when he was on the run. “After leaving Bengaluru in December, Rajesh visited Mumbai. There, associates of Rashid Malbari hosted him till mid-January. From Mumbai, Rajesh with a few others travelled to Delhi and stayed there for a couple of weeks. We suspect that Rajesh travelled to Nepal mostly in the first week of March,” an officer said. According to officials, compared to the first three months of his fugitive life, his stay in Nepal was more expensive. Between March and June first week, he spent Rs 4 lakh,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-rowdy-on-the-run-tried-to-blackmail-cops/articleshow/83623085.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Chennai||Fewer Covid-19 cases, but fatality rate up in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: The Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) in Chennai and Tamil Nadu has been steadily increasing since May 16, though fresh and active cases have been falling sharply during the period, official data show. When Chennai's daily fresh cases fell from 6,247 to 689 and active cases from around 48,000 to 6,500, its CFR rose from 1.31% on May 16 to 1.5% on June 16. And Tamil Nadu's CFR touched 1.27% on June 16, up from 1.1% on May 16. So why is CFR rising? Senior virologist Dr T Jacob John says, "Deaths are the last to fall because most deaths are a reflection of cases that tested positive at least a week or a fortnight ago." NIE deputy director Prabhdeep Kaur says the sudden rise of CFR is probably due to discrepancies in reporting. When the epidemic curve was peaking, the system may have missed many deaths as access to care was limited. "Many people may not have tested or visited hospitals for care. These deaths are not reported as Covid deaths," she said. "With decline in cases, more deaths may now be counted by healthcare workers," she said. Also deaths follow an average of two week after cases are detected, she said. For instance, the highest number of fresh cases in Chennai was recorded on May 12 (7,564). However, the highest number of Covid deaths (109) in the city was on May 21. The second peak of deaths (107) was on May 28. Dr Jacob John said the CFR would dip in a week or two as the number of cases had steadily decreased for the past three-four weeks. Among the zones in Chennai, Thiru-vi-ka Nagar has the highest CFR at 1.98%, followed by Teynampet at 1.83%. The lowest CFR in the city is in Shollinganallur zone (0.77%), followed by Manali at 0.96%. When the infection was at its peak in the state between May 6 and May 12, the average CFR in that week was 0.86%. When cases started to drop in the week between May 20 and May 26, it was 1.25%. The weekly average CFR is now 2.2%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fewer-covid-19-cases-but-fatality-rate-up-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/83623127.cms||---
